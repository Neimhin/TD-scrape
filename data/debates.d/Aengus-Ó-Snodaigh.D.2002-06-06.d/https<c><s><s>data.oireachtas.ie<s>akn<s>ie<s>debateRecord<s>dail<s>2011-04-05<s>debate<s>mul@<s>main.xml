            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_11">I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive, together .</p>
            <p eId="para_12">At the outset I wish to say my deepest sympathies, and I am sure the sympathies of the entire House, go to the mother and family of PSNI Constable Ronan Kerr who was callously murdered last Saturday.  I, along with all the political leaders on these islands, totally condemn this act which runs completely contrary to the expressed will of the people.  We will do our utmost to ensure the continuing success of the peace process and will give every support to the Garda Síochána to continue to work closely with the PSNI to tackle this threat.  I will make a statement to the House on the matter later today.</p>
            <p eId="para_13">With regard to the questions posed, the Government is firmly committed to infrastructure projects which will be of benefit to the island of Ireland.  Infrastructure projects which have been particularly successful include Project Kelvin, the Dublin-Belfast Road and the significant level of co-operation under way to promote innovation to underpin economic growth and create employment, including increased co-operation in securing research funding under the EU Seventh Framework Programme, FP7.</p>
            <p eId="para_14">We are also very supportive of all-island co-operation in the energy area.  The single electricity market has been operating effectively for over three years and work is under way on a second North-South electricity interconnector.  Following the acquisition of Northern Ireland Electricity by the ESB, the energy markets in both jurisdictions are more closely linked than ever.  Work on the common arrangements for gas is progressing as are joint actions in the area of renewable energy.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">The Government is also supportive of the A5, North West Gateway to Aughnacloy, and A8, Belfast to Larne, road projects.  The completion of these roads will make a major contribution to the economy of the North and the north west and will have benefits for the whole of the island.  As I said to the Northern First and Deputy First Ministers when I last met them during my recent visit to Washington, I am open to looking at more cost effective ways of delivering this project to a high quality.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">There were suggestions recently that this Government lacked commitment to the development of a radiotherapy unit at Altnagelvin Hospital.  The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, wrote immediately in response to Michael McGimpsey confirming our commitment to the development of a satellite radiotherapy unit at Altnagelvin Hospital.  It is the strong view of the Government that this provides the optimum solution to the provision of patient centred services in the Donegal area.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">Let me assure the House that the Government and its Ministers with direct responsibility for the North-South bodies will continue to support fully the agencies involved and will engage constructively with their Northern ministerial counterparts to enhance and develop North-South co-operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_18">The Government is fully committed to the implementation of the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements.  As the House is aware, under the St. Andrews Agreement, it was agreed that the Northern Ireland Executive and Irish Government, under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, would appoint a review group to examine objectively, first, the efficiency and value for money of existing implementation bodies and, second, the case for additional bodies and areas of co-operation within the NSMC where mutual benefit would be derived.</p>
            <p eId="para_19">I understand the consultation with relevant Ministers in both jurisdictions on all aspects of the St. Andrews Agreement review is now nearing completion and that the St. Andrews review group will prepare a report for consideration by the North-South Ministerial Council at its next plenary session which will take place in June.  It is hoped the process will be brought to a conclusion at that stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_20">I also hope to see progress on the establishment of the North-South Consultative Forum.  Proposals have been made to the Northern Ireland Executive on the role, format, membership and operation of the forum but no response to these has yet been received.</p>
            <p eId="para_21">In the meantime, three consultative conferences were facilitated in Farmleigh by the previous Government involving social partners and other groups from civil society from across the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_22">The establishment of the North-South parliamentary forum is another outstanding commitment under the St. Andrews Agreement that I would like to see progressed.  Having attended the North-South parliamentary forum in Newcastle last October, I can see there is great potential for parliamentarians North and South to work together on issues of mutual interest.  While the establishment of the North-South parliamentary forum is a matter for agreement between the Oireachtas and the Assembly, I hope we will see progress on this after the Assembly elections in May and I have written to the Ceann Comhairle to this effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_23">Ministers with line responsibility for all of these issues will continue to work on these matters and officials have been asked to progress them in advance of the plenary session in June.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">I also look forward to making progress on all of these issues in conjunction with a newly elected Northern Ireland Executive which will take office after the Assembly elections in May.</p>
            <p eId="para_25">On the issue of 50-50 recruitment to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has written to the Northern Ireland Secretary of State underlining the view of the Government that the transformation of policing is a central pillar of all that has to be achieved in the peace process.  It has also been indicated to the Secretary of State that if for any reason there is any slippage or failure to make steady progress towards a fully representative force, corrective measures would have to be taken, including consideration of the re-introduction of 50-50 type provisions.  We will continue to raise this with the British Government as opportunities arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_26">I spoke to Prime Minister Cameron yesterday following the killing of PSNI Constable Ronan Kerr.  I expect to travel to London in the relatively near future to meet with him following his invitation when I expect that, among other matters, we will discuss the general situation in Northern Ireland, including the economic challenges faced on all parts of this island.</p>
            <p eId="para_27">Both Governments are aware of the need for economic growth as a stabilising factor in the peace process.  I know the Secretary of State has recently launched a consultation paper on the Northern economy entitled "Rebalancing the Northern Ireland Economy" which sets out the major challenges facing the Northern economy.  It is in all our interests to have a peaceful and prosperous Northern Ireland with benefits for the whole island as a consequence.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_28">I join the Taoiseach in condemning the evil and cowardly murder of PSNI constable Ronan Kerr at the weekend.  This was a shocking attack on the peace process and it is a human tragedy of immense proportions for the Kerr family.  Our sympathies go out to the family, friends and neighbours of Ronan Kerr.  Later today we will have an opportunity to articulate more fully our abhorrence at this horrific attack by a cowardly gang of terrorists whose sole objective is not just to visit terror upon the population of Northern Ireland but to undermine the transformation that has occurred as a result of the peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_29">Nowhere have the changes that have occurred in Northern Ireland been more evident than in the transformation of policing in that jurisdiction.  All parties to the British-Irish Agreement deserve credit for that transformation, which is seen as being the way to proceed in resolving other conflicts across the globe.  It is the foremost example one can suggest to people as a model to be followed in the context of conflict resolution.  What occurred at the weekend was an extremely ruthless, strategic attack on the transformation to which I refer.  We did not realise when we tabled these questions to the Taoiseach that such a murderous attack would take place in the interim.  This attack underlines the need for vigilance in respect of the peace process.  There is a need to pay constant attention to the detail of the Agreement and to moving it forward, particularly in the context of its economic and social aspects.</p>
            <p eId="para_30">I tabled two of the questions in this group, the first of which relates to cross-Border infrastructure and the second to the North-South bodies.  I have no difficulty with the two being taken together.  I welcome the assurances provided by the Taoiseach in respect of the ongoing investment in infrastructure in Border areas.  The programme for Government was somewhat light in the context of commitment in this regard.  However, the Taoiseach has articulated that he is committed to the development projects relating to the A5 and A8 roads.  The previous Government agreed to the allocation of between €400 million and €500 million to fund critical infrastructure for the economic and social development of the island, particularly its northern part.  In the context of bringing significant inward investment to the Border area and the North in general, there is need for significant investment in the areas of utilities and infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_31">I ask the Taoiseach to pay particular heed to the north-west spatial study, which has been in existence for some time and in respect of which some political issues have arisen.  This study is critical to unleashing the potential of the north-west corner of this island — including areas such as Donegal, Derry and elsewhere — in the context of attracting inward investment.  In that regard, the relevant utilities must be upgraded.  There is a good corporate tax policy in place on this side of the Border and there is a good pool of labour available on the other.  If both Governments and the Executive got their act together and dealt with some of the issues that are delaying the study considerable potential could be unleashed.  I ask the Government to pursue that.  I also welcome the Taoiseach's confirmation of continued funding for all the areas of cross-Border infrastructure agreed by the outgoing Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_32">With regard to North-South bodies, there will, shortly, be key visits by Queen Elizabeth and President Obama.  Has the Taoiseach considered approaching bodies such as Tourism Ireland and InterTradeIreland to see if there are ways to highlight and use the potential of those visits to promote Ireland as a tourism and inward investment destination, particularly in Border areas and Northern Ireland itself?  This is a welcome opportunity to promote Ireland through the North-South bodies.  Now that the review is nearing completion, in the aftermath of the Assembly elections we should move on and be bolder by adding to the existing number of North-South bodies.  There have been political issues regarding them for some time.  People are becoming more comfortable with them as time passes.  It is important to urge others to take a more pragmatic approach to the operation of the North-South bodies and to the creation of new bodies that could add real value to the island of Ireland in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">I assume there is no disagreement in the House regarding the murder of Constable Ronan Kerr.  I regard this as an act of cowardice that does nothing for anybody on this island.  Yesterday, I spoke to Constable Kerr's mother, Nuala.  I admire her quiet courage and forthrightness in speaking out.  I admire those, from all sides of the political divide in Northern Ireland, who have spoken out and acted in the interest of peace and harmony between all communities on this island.  I intend to travel to the funeral of Constable Kerr tomorrow, with a number of other Members of the House, as a statement of solidarity with the Kerr family and that the Oireachtas and the vast majority of people on this island abhor what happened.  The person who placed the bomb in the footwell of Constable Kerr's vehicle may, in their own warped version, be someone of stature.  That version is false, wrong and utterly removed from the future of the peoples of this island.  Our attendance will condemn their action without question or hesitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_34">I also admire the fortitude of the Gaelic Athletic Association.  The chairman of the Ulster Council of the GAA issued a statement of direct and forthright condemnation.  His statement was a lesson that an attack on a member of the association is an attack on the entire membership, which reaches into every town, city and parish in the country.  Contact has been made with many GAA clubs in Northern Ireland in this regard.  The House will have an opportunity to make statements on the murder of Constable Kerr when the Order of Business concludes.</p>
            <p eId="para_35">The other matter raised by Deputy Martin is important in the context of the economy of the island of Ireland.  I know from my experience as Minister for Tourism and Trade that the opportunities presented by the forthcoming visits of Queen Elizabeth and President Obama are immense.  There are issues that have yet to be decided in the context of the visits.  However, they should be seen as an investment for the future from a tourism and business perspective.  I expect that the welcome accorded to both international visitors by the people of Ireland will be historic in significance and that they will be made feel welcome when they come to our shores.</p>
            <p eId="para_36">The Deputy referred, not today but last week, to the International Fund for Ireland, which is an important consideration in respect of vulnerable communities on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland.  It is hoped this matter will be addressed by the US through its appropriations committee.  It is an important element of leverage for further funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_37">I look forward to working with the newly elected Members of the Assembly, following the casting of votes by the people of Northern Ireland in early May.  We also look forward to following through on our work, through the Ceann Comhairle and new Speaker of the Assembly, in respect of the North-South parliamentary forum.  It is hoped that the meeting of the North-South Ministers, which will take place early in the summer, will conclude the process outlined here.  I agree that the Government and Assembly should work together on addressing issues relating to the island of Ireland and its economy.  I am committed to working in harmony and co-operation with our colleagues in Northern Ireland in respect of all of these matters.</p>

            <from>Deputy Gerry Adams</from>
            <p eId="para_38">Aontaíonn Sinn Féin le achan focal a dúirt an Taoiseach faoi dhúnmharú Ronan Kerr.  Bhíomar leis an teaghlach ag an áit deacair agus brónach ina saol.  Bhí mé sa Tuaisceart Dé Domhnaigh agus inné ag obair le Martin McGuinness agus daoine eile sa Tionól.  Táimid ag déanamh ár ndícheall chun a rá go soiléir nach nglacann pobal nó muintir na hÉireann leis an dúnmharú seo.</p>
            <p eId="para_39">I agree with every word the Taoiseach said in regard to the murder of Constable Ronan Kerr.  I was in the North on Sunday and Monday and, in concert with the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness and others in the Executive, spelled out clearly our views in regard to that dreadful action.</p>
            <p eId="para_40">When I asked the Taoiseach two weeks ago to urgently raise with the British Government its unilateral decision to do away with the 50:50 — 50% Catholic and 50% Protestant — recruitment policy in respect of the PSNI, I did not contemplate the murder of this young man, whom I did not know but whose father and grandfather come from Andersonstown in West Belfast.  His grandfather still lives there.  Although I did not know Constable Kerr, I presume he joined the PSNI because of the changes, brought about collectively by us, in that service.  A 50:50 recruitment policy is crucial.  The British Government took a decision and did away with that policy although it had no right to do so.  The Irish Government is an equal partner to the Good Friday Agreement.  The Patten report is an essential part of that agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">It is not clear from the Taoiseach's reply whether he made representations in this regard immediately after my having raised the matter with him in the House.  If he did, the British Government ignored him.  I do not say that to make any point other than that the current British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has taken a number of solo runs with this international agreement and other agreements.  It is difficult for any Irish republican to have confidence in a British Secretary of State.  I acknowledge that we, like the Irish Government, have developed working relationships with a series of Secretaries of State.  However, I have no confidence whatsoever in the current British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Owen Paterson.</p>
            <p eId="para_42">The young man concerned joined the police service to, according to his mother, be part of the quest for equality for all.  Mrs. Kerr also spoke of a neutral police service being necessary for our country.  I beseech the Taoiseach — it is as important as that — to take up all of these matters with the British on an ongoing basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_43">I ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to indulge me for a moment.  I know Deputies will have an opportunity to discuss the murder of Ronan Kerr later.  In dealing with those outworkings of the St. Andrews Agreement which have not been implemented and other issues — in this respect I welcome the commitment from the Government on cross-Border infrastructural and regeneration projects and, like the Taoiseach, I am lobbying on the International Fund for Ireland — it is inappropriate to lump together the three or four serious issues involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_44">We will go toe to toe with the so-called dissidents.  However, it does not help the case we are trying to make if the British Government is reneging on outstanding parts of the Agreement or breaking essential parts of it.  I ask the Taoiseach, as a matter of grave urgency, to place this issue on the British Prime Minister's agenda and, with our friends in the USA and elsewhere, ensure that the peace process, the Good Friday Agreement and other agreements are implemented as they should be implemented.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_9">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_45">Níl aon easaontas eadrainn faoi seo.  Mar adúirt mé, aontaím go mór leis na Teachtaí a cháin dúnmharú Ronan Kerr.  Bhí mé ag caint le Máirtín McGuinness agus leis an gCéad Aire, Peter Robinson, inné agus labhair mé le Príomh Aire Cameron freisin.  Phléamar an cheist faoi ionadaíocht 50-50 an tseachtain seo caite.  In parallel with that, the Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote to the Secretary of State indicating the Government's concern about this matter.  The Secretary of State has, therefore, been made aware of the issue.  I will also raise it with the British Prime Minister when we make arrangements for our meeting which I assume will take place at a reasonably early date.  It is a matter of considerable importance.</p>
            <p eId="para_46">While I do not know the answer to the question, it may well be that the person or persons who crept up on Mr. Kerr's car and placed a bomb under its foot well are Catholics.  If the attack was in the realm of dissident republicanism, it is not to anyone's benefit to take away the life of an innocent young man who is merely doing his job and duty as part of a process that the vast majority of people on this island voted for and want to see implemented in order that they can live their lives in peace and harmony and get on with raising their families.  While I cannot speak with the strength and power of Mrs. Kerr when she stated that her son's murder should not deter young Catholics from wanting to join the PSNI and participate in and contribute to the well-being and livelihood of the people of Northern Ireland, I support her 100%.</p>
            <p eId="para_47">I give a commitment to follow through on the letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Secretary of State and I will raise the matter with Prime Minister Cameron when I see him.  We will also apprise interested colleagues in the United States of all these matters.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_10">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_48">The previous Government will have communicated to the British Government at the relevant time its opposition to the ending of the 50-50 recruitment rule.  Irrespective of whether it is within the parameters laid down, the decision to end the 50-50 policy is premature.  The success of the Patten commission has been well documented in terms of the transformation of the police force.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">Perhaps we should remove from our vocabulary, as I have already done, all references to "dissident republicans".  Dissident is an honourable word that was used during the Cold War to describe people who, in conscience, went against autocracy and dictatorships.</p>
            <p eId="para_50">The term "dissident" has no place in the context of describing the people who committed that evil act this week and, indeed, other evil acts in the past two or three years.  That part of our vocabulary should simply disappear because it seeks to give some degree of legitimacy to what these people are doing.  I know that no Member of this House would attempt to do so in any shape or form.  In my view it is a cowardly, criminal gang who did this.  I am fully conscious of the use of language in the context of the island and the past conflict in the North, but it is time to move on now as regards how we describe these acts of terror.  The latest such act has had an appalling impact on a young life and the lives of his family members.  There is no room left for using language that is in any way equivocal.</p>
            <p eId="para_51">The Taoiseach correctly raised the matter of the International Fund for Ireland.  It is interesting that the initiative to keep that fund going came from the Irish Government, and myself as Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time.  There needs to be a genuine and substantive cross-party approach by parties in the North with the British and Irish Governments in dealing with communities that are hard to reach on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland.  Insufficient attention has been paid to investment or economic and social development in those communities.  The matter is nonetheless urgent because it is a fundamental potential threat to the long-term success of the peace process.  There have been plenty of political dividends from that process, including a radical change in politics.  However, for many people in working class communities there remain frightening issues such as unemployment, a high school drop-out rate and poor health indices.  The scale of statistics reflect such problems in those communities.  I would fault the lack of a comprehensive approach from the Northern Ireland Executive and others concerned.  That is why the retention of IFI funding is so important.</p>
            <p eId="para_52">We also need to work with the European Union which has provided such funding in the past.  The Taoiseach should see that his officials and those of the Department of Foreign Affairs are in discussion with the European Commission to ensure that EU funding is retained, as well as the American funding.  Whatever other additional supports the Irish and British Governments can give are also needed to ensure that meaningful progress is made in dealing with young people in hard to reach communities.  We all remember some of the commentary from some young people following the atrocities at Massereene Barracks in 2009.  They were hardly four or five years old at the time of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.  It was difficult to comprehend some of the opinions that were articulated at that time, which were a cause of concern for many of us who witnessed those attacks.  That centrally important issue therefore deserves to be brought to the top of the political agenda on this island, otherwise the sustainability of the peace process will be in difficulty in the medium term.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_11">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_53">There can be no doubt but that, after many years of difficulty, trial, tribulation and hardship, having arrived at a position where a peace process is <i>in situ</i> and being implemented, there is always the danger that vulnerable communities will regress.  Young people can tend to drift backwards because of unemployment, depression, alcoholism or suicide.  That is why the IFI and EU funding, as well as funding from both Governments is absolutely critical for the development of such communities, as well as demonstrating to young people that there is a better way.  The cause of peace can lead on to a better life for everyone concerned.  That is why it is so important that those who work in such communities, on both sides, can demonstrate the effective value of that kind of expenditure in the interests of young people’s livelihoods.  I have met quite a number of them and I have been impressed by the range and scale of work in which they are involved.  I also appreciate the difficulty they have in constantly reaching out for new ways to attract young people to honour the peace code.  That is why there is no disagreement that the IFI fund is critical, as is the funding from Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_54">I am sure everyone here hopes, as I do, that what happened to Ronan Kerr can be viewed not as the beginning of something but as the end of it.  We would all like to think this can never happen again.  For what it is worth, it is important that this House expresses its utter condemnation of what happened, as it is also important for people to be able to express that condemnation by attendance at the funeral of young Ronan Kerr.  As I said, I admire the courage and quiet strength of his mother, having lost her son yet speaking out for so many others of a young generation, and a generation to come, of the kind of Northern Ireland she would like to see.</p>

            <from>Deputy Gerry Adams</from>
            <p eId="para_55">Tá a fhios agam go mbeidh seans againn an dúnmharú seo a phlé agus díospóireacht a bheith againn níos moille.  Tá a lán oibre le déanamh againn anois.  One of the things we have to make very clear is that the Irish Government is in the driving seat of the peace process.  It is the Government's project because it is the popular project, the citizen's project, and the Government must take the leadership role.  So many little things can be done which would also help the people in this part of the island, even in terms of economic deprivation.  It does not make sense that in a small island, with a small land mass and a small population, we should have two competing economies.</p>
            <p eId="para_56">I commend, for example, the projects to which the Government has committed, such as the N2-A5 and the A8 infrastructural projects.  This will help to generate employment and, as is possible under the Good Friday Agreement, to ensure local labour clauses and apprenticeships to help people in the communities through which, North and South, those big projects are being developed.  The Taoiseach might update us on other flagship projects such as the Ulster Canal — at least, it was described as a flagship project at the time it was launched.  The Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety in the North recently pulled out of the Altnagelvin radiological unit for the north west.  I welcome the commitment of the Minister for Health and Children, who, in an answer to Deputy Ó Caoláin, stated the Government remained committed to that project, which is another that helps everybody in the north west.</p>
            <p eId="para_57">I understand many issues are pressing down on us all at present.  However, given these outstanding elements of the St. Andrew's Agreement and the fact that the mechanisms are not in place, the Government should indicate, and be pleased to do so, the areas of co-operation and harmonisation it wants to see developed.  On all of these cross-Border economic, social, health, environmental, energy and agricultural issues, there is no resistance from Unionism.  I travelled to Belfast from this Chamber last week and met working class loyalists in the middle of a working class loyalist neighbourhood to talk about social and economic issues.  They understand this Government and this island with regard to those issues.  While they may not have moved away from their commitment to the Union, they have moved on these issues.  This is why we need to move beyond condemnation to the real politics of peace making.</p>
            <p eId="para_58">To conclude, there is a democratic and peaceful way to bring about Irish unity.  It is there as part of an international agreement, the British Government has signed up to it, all of the parties in the Assembly in the North have signed up to it, and we need to make it a reality.  In a very clear way, with the Government in the driving seat, we need to spell out all of that.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_13">
            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_59">I add my voice and that of People Before Profit and the United Left Alliance in offering our condolences to the family of Ronan Kerr following this terrible tragedy.  We join other speakers and parties in condemning absolutely this despicable act.  There is simply no justification whatsoever for this kind of atrocity.  As Deputy Martin said, these are not dissidents fulfilling some sort of authentic republican strategy.  It is an utterly brutal, barbaric action that leads nowhere except back down a road which has failed in the past and which we do not want to go down again.</p>
            <p eId="para_60">However, it is important to look at the deeper politics, as Deputy Adams said, to allow us to address this problem and the danger of things moving back in that direction. We all must acknowledge that there has been a worrying growth, albeit among a minority in the North, in the organisations associated with this kind of activity.  We have to ask ourselves why that is happening and what we can do about it.  The peace dividend was much talked about at the time of the Good Friday Agreement.  Many people placed their hopes in the Agreement that there would be a dividend in terms of prosperity, improved quality of life, better living conditions — all that people hoped would come with it, not just peace but a social and economic dividend.  Does the Taoiseach agree this has not been delivered and that, in such a situation, there is always a danger of alienated young people moving towards twisted, warped or misguided ideas which they think can somehow address it?  We must look seriously at that.  In that context, the economic austerity being imposed in the North as well as here and across the world, in the interests of protecting bankers and bondholders across Europe, is part of the problem and will fuel it.  We have to resist an austerity which leads to that sort of alienation and which fails to deliver on the social and economic aspirations of ordinary people.  We must also ask whether, despite best intentions, the political structures that were set up as a result of the Good Friday Agreement, which sought to bring about a political dispensation that could end conflict, may perhaps at some level have institutionalised communal identity in the political structure of Northern Ireland.  The Agreement has corralled people into community identities instead of developing a politics that breaks us out of communal identity and where we begin to talk about the social and economic issues that unite people rather than the communal identities which divide them.  That is something we must address in a serious way.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_61">Deputy Adams raised several issues.  In respect of the economy of Northern Ireland and of the island as a whole, when I was on that side of the House my party set up a cross-Border forum dealing with issues that impact on people North and South.  Deputy McHugh, who is from Donegal, chaired a number of useful sessions concerned with identifying issues in the agri-economy, tourism economy, business sector, health sector, education sector and so on.  At one of those sessions we had speakers from the UUP and the SDLP.  With Sinn Féin and the DUP in government together in the Assembly, we did not want to tread on people's protocols in so far as that is concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_62">A number of issues were identified which clearly, from any political point of view, would be of interest and benefit to the infrastructure and the economies North and South.  The Deputy mentioned some which have been under discussion for a long time.  Were we not obliged to pay €3 billion to Anglo Irish Bank for the next ten years, it would be great to be able to tell the Deputy that the Government could now deal with the Ulster Canal or a number of other issues.  Unfortunately, that is not the way it is at present.  Consequently, from that perspective the Government will continue to commit itself to working diligently in the interests of the development of the economies North and South and, in consequence, of the entire island.</p>
            <p eId="para_63">As for what Deputy Boyd Barrett can do, the United Left Alliance can vociferously and strongly voice its opinions that when they take away life like this, those who perpetrated this cowardly act have no place in a democratic island.  While we all can have political differences and can argue on the politics of one's beliefs, to deliberately attempt to take away innocent lives is not part of the Irishness espoused by the Deputy or by me and I condemn it out of hand from that point of view.  I agree with the Deputy on the twisted mentality of people who may think they are doing something for some warped belief that has been and will be rejected by every right-thinking person in this country.  All Members should stand 100% behind Mrs. Kerr as the mother of a young man who chose his career to play his part in the development of his community and country.  His life should not have been ended by someone who crept up in the dark to deliberately plant an explosive device under his car, thereby ending his career of contributing to his community.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Fergus O’Dowd)</from>
            <p eId="para_65">The Government has set out clearly its intention to ensure that public enterprise plays a full role in Ireland's economic recovery.  The new economic and recovery authority is the vehicle whereby it will manage the State's holdings of the key State companies undertaking investment in key priority areas.  These include the energy networks, broadband, water and bioenergy.  Under the NewERA plan, streamlined and restructured State companies will make significant strategic investments over the coming years in these key sectors of the economy.  These commercially financed investment programmes, in the context of the new national development plan, will support economic activity and employment in the short term.  They also will critically underpin investment in sustainable export-led jobs and growth by foreign direct investment companies and indigenous Irish enterprise.</p>
            <p eId="para_66">I have been charged by the Taoiseach with responsibility for implementing the NewERA programme in consultation with all stakeholders.  This includes bringing forward the necessary legislation to underpin the planned structured changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_67">Additional information not given on floor of the House</p>
            <p eId="para_68">I am working with the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and all relevant ministerial colleagues to deliver effectively and speedily on our ambition.</p>
            <p eId="para_69">The NewERA plan includes the commitment to establish a new Irish water State company to lead much-needed investment in the water network.  The Government also is committed to the creation of a smart grid company, which ultimately will have ownership and responsibility for the national energy networks.  The programme for Government also envisages the merger of Bord na Móna and Coillte to create bioenergy Ireland with the aim of realising the full potential of Ireland's bioenergy resources.  The NewERA plan also will oversee the delivery of next generation broadband in conjunction with the private sector and relevant Statecompanies.</p>
            <p eId="para_70">The timeframe for establishing and restructuring the entities will be ambitious, while recognising that there are complex financial, legal and other considerations to be addressed as part of the process.</p>

            <p eId="para_71">I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, on his appointment and to thank him for his reply.  What level of funding does the Minister of State anticipate will be required to fund the NewERA project?  Different figures were articulated prior to and during the election campaign, ranging from €7 billion to €18 billion, but the only reference in the programme for Government is to the expectation of raising approximately €2 billion from the sale of non-strategic State assets.  How many jobs does the Minister of State expect will be created, as figures of more than 100,000 jobs were being earmarked for the NewERA project?  When does he expect Members to have sight of the nuts and bolts or the establishment of the NewERA authority?</p>

            <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_72">When we entered into government, the cupboard was almost bare thanks to the financial mismanagement of Fianna Fáil and previous Governments.  There is less money than we expected, but the country must effect changes in its policies, particularly its investment policy.  If the Government cannot borrow, State companies can use their initiative to create jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_73">NewERA contains a commitment to establish a new State water company to lend much needed investment to our water networks.  We are also committed to the creation of a smart grid company that will have ownership and responsibility for natural energy networks.  The programme for Government envisages the merger of Bord na Móna and Coillte to create BioEnergy Ireland with the aim of realising the full potential of Ireland's bioenergy resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_74">The NewERA plan is to create new jobs by lending off the Government balance sheet.  We will not have 1,000 young people emigrating every week as was the case under the Deputy's Government.  The disgraceful way in which the economy was run down by his party in government is clear to us now and we are committed to creating as many jobs as possible under the NewERA programme, which we will implement as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_75">The questions were simple.  In fairness to Fine Gael, it had no problem with going into specifics during the election.  It quoted a particular figure for the number of jobs that would be created and the amount of money that would be invested.  How much will NewERA cost, how much does the Government expect to invest and how many jobs will be created?</p>

            <p eId="para_76">The answer to the last question is clear — as many and as quickly as we possibly can.  I am charged with dealing with the Ministries involved — the Departments of Finance and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government — and the Office of the Attorney General.  Under a different heading in the NewERA policy, we will address the issue of a national water authority tomorrow.

          his plans to review the system of licensing for oil and gas exploration, development and production on Irish territory and waters, with a view to ensuring greater benefits for the Irish State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_25">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_84">I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_85">While Ireland has recognised potential as a petroleum producing area, the Irish offshore is relatively underexplored.  As a result, Ireland's petroleum potential is largely unproven.  This is likely to continue to be the case until there is an increase in the level of Irish offshore exploration, exploration drilling in particular.  Ireland competes with other countries in Europe and much farther afield to attract mobile international exploration investment.  To this end, it is important that Ireland maintains a licensing regime that appropriately reflects the risks and rewards of investing in petroleum exploration in the Irish offshore relative to investing in exploration in other jurisdictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">Regarding periodic publicity about Ireland's oil and gas resources, recent assessments of yet-to-find potential based on petroleum systems studies indicate a total reserve potential in the order of 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent for the offshore frontier basins west of Ireland.  This divides approximately into 6.5 billion barrels of oil and 20 trillion cubic feet of gas.  It should be understood that these figures only represent potential reserves, namely, the reserves that might be present based on geological criteria and regional comparisons, and that they have not been discovered.  Actual reserve figures are likely to vary widely from these estimates and will not be known without a dramatic increase in the level of exploration activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_87">A comprehensive review of Ireland's fiscal terms was carried out in 2007.  This review, which was underpinned by independent economic analysis, considered the appropriateness of Ireland's licensing terms in comparison with other European countries with which Ireland competes for exploration investment.  The review concluded that there might be potential to capture a higher share for the State on more profitable finds, but that the potential for this should not be overestimated.  The outcome of the review was the introduction of a supplementary tax, known as a profit resource rent tax, of between 5% and 15% that will apply in the case of more profitable fields.  The supplementary tax would be payable in addition to the standard petroleum corporate tax of 25%, which is double the standard corporation tax rate of 12.5%.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">Since the review concluded in 2007, there has been no significant change in terms of the level of exploration activity and no new commercial discoveries have been made.  The level of exploration activity will continue to be the critical factor in Ireland obtaining a benefit from our indigenous oil and gas resources.  We need to get drilling levels above the recent levels of one or two wells per year if more commercial discoveries are to be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">As part of an ongoing strategy to attract new companies and new investment, my Department is running a licensing round that is deliberately structured to attract new exploration companies.  This licensing round, which closes at the end of May, also aims to encourage companies to look at areas of the Irish offshore where few data currently exist and, as a consequence, little is known of their potential prospectivity.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">While I will keep the licensing terms, both fiscal and non-fiscal, under review in light of relevant future developments, at this juncture the focus should be on attracting a larger share of mobile international exploration investment to Ireland to increase the chances of new commercial discoveries being made.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_26">
            <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
            <p eId="para_91">It is ironic that we are discussing Corrib at a time when it is in the news again for the wrong reason, namely, allegations about an audiotape of gardaí in the back of a car talking about the use of rape against two protestors.  Equally disturbing if the contents of the audiotape are true, some of the commentary was derogatory towards protestors but favourable towards oil companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_92">In the context of a review, will the Minister argue that the State should reinstate the type of fiscal regime put in place by the late Labour Party energy Minister, Justin Keating, in the 1970s?  Under it, the State had holdings of 50% and between 6% and 7% in royalties.  The Minister will probably remember how the stake was lowered by Dick Spring, but it was subsequently devastated by Ray Burke, who abandoned the State's share altogether.  Does the Minister agree that, at a time when we are loaded down with an unpayable bank debt, the State should reinstate the sort of regime that Justin Keating put in place to ensure our people benefit from Corrib and other reserves when they come on stream?  What is required is something that was advocated in the mid-1970s by one of the Minister's former parties, namely, Sinn Féin The Workers' Party.  He might be able to correct me on the date.  That party supported the objective of a resources protection campaign, something that was supported by members of the Labour Party.</p>
            <p eId="para_93">In 1995, a group stated that a large area of the nation's offshore rights had been conceded for a pittance.  Does the Minister agree that what was done at that point and in subsequent negotiations with oil companies has done significant damage to the potential resources off our north-west and west coast?</p>
            <p eId="para_94">I have personal experience of working on the rigs on the Porcupine Bank.  In 1978 and 1981 there were finds and the depth was approximately 1,600 ft., so they were not seen as commercially viable.  The geology reports from the time indicated the finds could be substantial but because of the depth of water, the technology was not available at the time to access the resources and bring them ashore.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_27" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_95">I do not have any knowledge of reported stories concerning the protests at the Corrib field but I agree with the Deputy that the allegations are unedifying.  With regard to the tax regime as applying to offshore prospecting, it is true that a different regime existed up to 1987, when it was changed.  The change occurred because the expectations from the early 1970s were, unfortunately, not borne out then or since.  Our strike rate is especially disappointing.  Therefore, I fully endorse the current policy of trying to generate more activity in exploration.</p>
            <p eId="para_96">Deputy Ferris would acknowledge that 25% or 55% of nothing is still nothing.  If we do not bring about finds, the issue is entirely theoretical.  Deputy Ferris advances the information that when he worked on the rigs, there were potential finds but the water was too deep for technology to exploit the resources at the time.  Over the years the strike rate has been poor, although few holes have been drilled.  We are trying to increase the rate of exploration activity.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_98">The petroleum affairs division, as mentioned by the Minister, estimates that 10 billion barrels of gas or oil equivalent are out there.  We should be clear what is at stake.  If that is anywhere even close to the mark, at current oil prices that would amount to €900 billion of gas and oil just off the west coast.  One can consider that we have just borrowed €100 billion to bail out toxic banks and NAMA in a deal that will enslave this country to austerity, cutbacks and an unsustainable debt burden.  Would it not be better to instead invest in developing resources and establishing a regime where we can get a reasonable benefit from the development and exploitation of those resources?</p>
            <p eId="para_99">Is it a fact that we have one of the most pathetic arrangements for licensing, as we will get next to nothing?  We have an arrangement where no royalties will accrue to this State from the development by multinational companies of our gas and oil resources.  For all the bending over backwards we have done to facilitate Shell in its activities in Mayo etc., there is no security of supply.  It does not have to supply to us if it does not want to.</p>
            <p eId="para_100">Why do we not act like the Norwegians?  That country has a 78% tax on profits made on oil resources in its territory and it owns 67% of Statoil, the national oil and petroleum company.  The state jointly participates with multinational oil companies in the development and exploitation of those resources.  It is shocking that the people of Norway will benefit more from the development of our gas and oil resources off the west coast of Ireland than we will.  Should we not do something about it urgently?  There are now reports of significant finds in Dublin Bay in the hands of more private companies but why are we giving away gas and oil resources rather than developing and exploiting them ourselves?</p>

            <p eId="para_103">——I will join with him in reviewing the terms.  We have not made the finds and in comparison to Norway, the strike rate in that country is beyond our wildest dreams.  If a hole is drilled unsuccessfully in Norway, the state pays 70% of the cost, and if we were to do so here our financial position would be worse.  What Deputy Boyd Barrett is not minded to accept is that what we are talking about is a potential reserve but we have not yet been able to find it.  We are now engaged in a new licensing round calculated to bring in more companies with an exploration interest into this area of our offshore.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</b>
          if he will provide further details on the commitment in the programme for Government to review the funding of public and independent broadcasters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_33" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_105">The commitment in the programme for Government referred to in the question is in recognition of the pressures that the funding of both public service and commercial broadcasters has faced in recent years as a result of the serious decline in commercial revenues.  Whereas this decline is primarily as a result of the impact of the recession over the past three years, revenues have also been impacted through the increasing fragmentation of the broadcast market as a result of the increasing number of channels available on satellite and cable, and through on-line and other developing platforms.</p>
            <p eId="para_106">Funding of the public service broadcasters RTE and TG4 is met through a mix of licence fee revenues, Exchequer grant-in-aid and commercial revenues obtained largely from advertising.  The public funding element is provided for the purpose of allowing these bodies to meet their respective public service broadcasting objects.  These objects are set out in part 7 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, and they impose a wide range of public service obligations on each of these broadcasters.  I am aware that the funding of the public service broadcasters has been subject to criticism by private sector broadcasters and, in particular, that there has been criticism of the dual public and commercial funding model as applied to RTE.  The funding of privately owned independent broadcasters is, of course, derived from their own commercial activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_107">Both public and independent broadcasters can also access funding from the broadcasting funding scheme, the purpose of which is to encourage the inclusion of additional programming of a particular character in broadcasters' programme schedules.  The fund is open to independent producers and all free-to-air broadcasters.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">The broadcasting funding scheme is funded by way of a payment of 7% of net licence fee receipts.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_110">This is paid to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) in respect of this scheme.  This amount was increased from 5% to 7% under the Broadcasting Act 2009.  On the proposed review of funding, the Broadcasting Act 2009, which was enacted on 12 July 2009, provides mechanisms that may be used to facilitate this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_111">Section 124(8) of the Act requires the BAI, within three years of enactment of the Act, to review the adequacy or otherwise of public funding to enable public service broadcasters to meet their public service objectives.  In addition, section 158(1) requires the BAI to review the operation, effectiveness and impact of the broadcasting funding scheme not later than three years after enactment.  I understand that the BAI expects to complete both of these reviews before the end of 2011 and I look forward to receiving both reports from the BAI in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">It is my intention that the findings of these two reports from the BAI will be used to inform the review referred to in the programme for Government, which I can confirm will be carried out by my Department.  This review, which will focus on the scope of funding of public service content provided by all broadcasters, public and private, will be undertaken in tandem with the review of the licence fee funding mechanism, which is also committed to in the programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">In conclusion, I accept that the broadcasting sector, in common with other sectors, is facing very challenging economic circumstances.  In addition, change in the way content can be transmitted is adding to the challenging environment.  Apart from the reviews referred to, I look forward to working with all of the sector to ensure that broadcasting can continue to play its important and distinctive role in Irish society and maintain quality standards in the process.</p>

            <p eId="para_114">I thank the Minister for his response concerning what we all agree is an important area.  I welcome the review to be initiated.  Will the Minister elaborate on when he hopes to undertake the review, who will undertake it and its anticipated terms of reference?  I am sure he is aware of reports today that the independent broadcasters of Ireland are asking the Government that the planned new broadcasting charge which is expected to replace the licence fee should also fund independent radio stations.  Will that issue fall within the remit of the review?  The replacement of the television licence fee by a public broadcasting charge is a separate matter within the programme for Government.  If the charge is to be used to extend funding to independent broadcasting entities will the Minister also consider extending public service obligations to such commercial broadcasters?</p>

            <p eId="para_115">The rest of my prepared answer sought to deal with the Deputy's question.  Section 124 of the Broadcasting Act requires the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, within three years of its enactment, namely, by the end of this year, to review the adequacy or otherwise of public funding to enable public service broadcasters to meet their public service objectives.  In addition, section 158 requires the BAI to review the operation's effectiveness and the impact of the broadcasting funding scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_116">I understand the BAI intends to have those reports with me by the end of this year and it is my intention that the findings will be used to inform the review referred to in the programme for Government, which I confirm will be carried out by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">I welcome contributions such as the Deputy made to the debate from wheresoever they may come.  We live in changing times.  A review is taking place separately within the Department of the efficacy of the licence collection system, with an attempt to measure the extent of evasion and gather understanding of the new platforms used in particular by young people who do not necessarily access television by means of a television screen.  In that sense, one can see the notion of a universal household charge might be worth considering in the not so distant future.  I have an open mind on this and the issue will be included in the review.</p>

            <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_121">In the context of the NewERA plan the Government commits to an ambitious strategy of accelerating the development of Ireland's forestry and bioenergy resources.  Key to the realisation of this strategy is the plan to create a new State company, to be called BioEnergy Ireland, which will entail the merger of Bord na Móna and Coillte.</p>
            <p eId="para_122">The Government envisages that the new company will become a global leader in the commercialisation of next-generation bioenergy technologies.  In addition, it will oversee delivery of an annual 14,700 hectare afforestation programme.  I will work with the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, with the Minister for Agriculture, Marine and Food, and all relevant Ministers to develop a national bioenergy strategy as well as a comprehensive business case to underpin the merger of Bord na Móna and Coillte.</p>
            <p eId="para_123">The systematic development of Ireland's abundant bioenergy resources will contribute to national security of energy supply and our renewable energy targets.  Critically, it will support rural development by providing new markets and employment development opportunities for the agriculture, farming and forestry sectors.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">The McCarthy report was released — or leaked — in part at Christmas and given to the previous Government.  Concerning some of the proposals relating to Coillte and Bord na Móna there was a report in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> of 12 December that one option in respect of State assets and liabilities considered at the time was a merger of Coillte and Bord na Móna.  Does this Government’s policy proceed from the McCarthy report?</p>
            <p eId="para_125">My understanding is that at that time some of the labour negotiators met Professor McCarthy in regard to the sale of €2 billion of State assets.  What will happen the land currently owned by Coillte?  Many people were very concerned some months ago when it appeared that an international forestry group was interested in purchasing it — a group, incidentally, chaired by a previous Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern.  People were concerned regarding the actual land under forest.  What is to happen Coillte lands with regard to the merger?</p>

            <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_126">The key point is that what is being discussed is the setting up of a State company, not a private company, and one which will remain in State ownership.  To put it a different way, in medieval times if one were going through the forests of Nottingham, the Sheriff of Nottingham's writ would have run there and the Robin Hoods of the day would have prevented him doing whatever he wanted to do.  In this modern State these are the people's forests and will so remain.</p>
            <p eId="para_127">I acknowledge the 150 different recreational and special amenity areas that Coillte hold and maintain throughout the country which provide fantastic public amenities for anybody and everybody.  These will continue, absolutely.  However, we need new synergies between the two State companies and our plan will bring this about.</p>
            <p eId="para_128">The key point  is that this will create new jobs, particularly in rural areas where at present there is no opportunity for employment, as all of us know.</p>

            <p eId="para_132">The problem at present is that by virtue of a European directive Coillte is prevented from benefiting from grants such as those farmers receive for reforestation and, therefore, there is an issue which must be tackled.  I believe Coillte has not planted a tree since 1995 for that reason — perhaps I may be corrected by a Member with greater knowledge.  We need new synergies to plant more trees.  We need more jobs and we need to reduce our carbon footprint.  One of the key points about forestry is that it is a carbon sink and will help us reduce our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, strengthen our competitiveness and will create more jobs locally.  That is our plan.</p>

The Minister of State outlined the investment programme being funded under NewERA, which will absorb money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and, according to the programme for Government, it is also proposed to finance the investment programme from the sale of certain State assets.  Up to €2 billion is targeted through such sales.  The programme also states, however, that assets will only be sold when market conditions are right and when adequate regulatory structures have been established to protect consumer interests.  We do not know when those conditions will be right for any such sales.  In the short term, will the initial investments be funded through the National Pensions Reserve Fund and has the Minister identified how much money will be available after the bank recapitalisation for investment through that channel?</p>

While everything must be done it must be done at the right time.  The Deputy is right; there can be no fire-sale of assets and that is made clear in the programme for Government.  Another report by Mr. Colm McCarthy is yet to be published and there are issues in that surrounding the sale of some assets that I hope will bring in €2 billion.

It is important that we get this right and consult our colleagues in Government, the Civil Service and the State and semi-State bodies.  It is vital to our national recovery that we take the time to get this right and put the investments in place, taking time to sell those non-essential State assets at a time when we will get the greatest benefit from them.  The drive and energy will initially be directed towards water infrastructure and broadband.  As we move through the programme, it is hoped we will create the thousands of jobs needed.

            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_166">I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 34 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_167">I am informed there are 364 customers on the ESB microgeneration tariff to date, representing a total connected generation capacity of just in excess of 2 MW.  The technologies being deployed are wind turbines, solar installations and small-scale hydro turbines.  ESB Networks is currently processing 18 customer applications and these are at different stages of completion.  ESB Networks agreed in 2009 to provide the necessary import and export metering free of charge to the first 4,000 domestic microgeneration customers.  ESB Networks also provides a support payment of ten cent per kilowatt hour for those eligible customers for the first 3,000 kW hours exported back to the grid annually for a period of five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_168">The take-up has been disappointingly low despite an overall tariff rate of 19 cent per kilowatt hour being available.  This compares to the wholesale electricity price, which is currently averaging approximately seven cent per kilowatt hour.  Currently, ESB Customer Supply, now rebranded ESB Electric Ireland, is the only electricity supplier in the market offering microgeneration tariffs to domestic customers who generate up to 11 kW.</p>
            <p eId="para_169">The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, is currently completing an 18 month microgeneration pilot scheme and is monitoring the performance of the 42 installations involved.  Those participating in the pilot have been able to avail of the tariffs offered.  The findings from the pilot will provide valuable data with regard to microgeneration and which will inform policy decisions on how best to stimulate the sector.  In line with the programme for Government commitment, I have asked my Department and the SEAI to finalise their cost-benefit analysis work on a feed in tariff programme for microgeneration.  Any such programme must be fully cost effective and take into consideration the overall cost implications for all electricity consumers.</p>

            <from>Deputy David Stanton</from>
            <p eId="para_170">I thank the Minister for his response.  When does the Minister expect the SEAI study to be completed?  Is the ESB carrying out a review of this as well?  Has the Department identified any barriers or why, as the Minister stated, there is such a low uptake in a scheme which could have great potential?  For example, has anyone considered the fact that VAT can be reclaimed on diesel generators but not on wind generators?  Would this assist if it were put into practice?  Is there any reason it should not be allowed?  Is it not an anomaly that someone can reclaim VAT if he or she generates electricity on a farm using a diesel generator but not if he or she uses a wind generator?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_69" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_171">I suspect Deputy Stanton knows more about the detail of this than I do and I am struggling to understand the barriers and obstacles to which he refers.  For example, I am aware that the single electricity market price paid for electricity is approximately €60 per megawatt hour.  The ESB pays microgenerators approximately three times this amount, that is, €190.  Obviously, this is a barrier from the point of view of the State in the sense that if a subsidy is required — this signals that it is required — it is a significant matter.  I hope that I will have the conclusions of the SEAI report before the autumn.  It is analysing various scenarios related to levels of feed in tariffs which would be required.</p>
            <p eId="para_172">As the Deputy is aware, the REFIT, renewable energy feed in tariff, system operates for large-scale projects.  It is funded by public service obligation on all consumers.  We have made a commitment in the programme for Government to provide a REFIT system for microgenerators for the reasons Deputy Stanton has hinted.  However, as the programme for Government states, "The tariff will not be significantly above single energy market price for electricity".  We must wait and see what the conclusions will be.  Since the scheme announced has the capacity to accommodate 4,000 participants, the level of uptake is disappointing.  Is it the case that the level of subsidy is inadequate?  How much further can one go?  The contribution of renewables is critical.  If one were obliged to increase the subsidy, would it be the most economic way of feeding back into the grid?  We must wait and see.  I was surprised to learn that there have been only 364 applicants of the scheme as it stands.</p>

            <from>Deputy David Stanton</from>
            <p eId="para_173">What way is the scheme being marketed, sold or put out to people who might be customers?  I have seen no marketing for it anywhere.  Would the Minister examine this and consider a public awareness campaign such that people could know a little more about the scheme?</p>
            <p eId="para_174">The Minister may not have this information but he might get it to me.  Is it true there was a problem with generating at the 11kW level?  I understand the SEAI was examining this earlier in the year.  Perhaps the Minister will come back to me and inform me whether this issue has been resolved or whether there has been any further information issued from the SEAI.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_175">The Deputy may well have a point about the effectiveness of the marketing of the initiative but one should be struck by the number of correspondents who communicate with the Department about it.  It would appear that there is a wider level of interest than there is of uptake and I am unsure why this is the case.  There is regular e-mail traffic to the Department from individuals seeking information on it.  The ESB is the only supplier and no other supplier has chosen to enter the market.  I suppose this is because of the cost of the supports involved.  Nevertheless, only the ESB is in place and I suppose to some degree this constrains it.  I will certainly examine the point raised by the Deputy and come back to him on it.</p>

        <b> Deputy Michael P. Kitt</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</b>
          his budget and his priorities for 2011. 
        [6650/11]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_72" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_177">The budget in my Department is set out in the Revised Estimates for public services 2011.  The total gross Vote provision is €475 million, comprising €336 million for current expenditure and €139 million for capital expenditure.  Of the gross current provision, a sum of €222 million relates to the Vote neutral broadcasting licence fee receipts.  This is money which passes through the Vote as a receipt with corresponding expenditure.  When this is netted off the gross provision, the Department's 2011 budget is €253 million, made up of a €114 million current allocation and a €139 million capital allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_178">My Department's expenditure priorities in 2011 include the energy efficiency programmes amounting to €69.4 million — the bulk of expenditure in this area will be on the national energy efficiency retrofit programme; energy research programmes totalling €20.4 million, including progressing the ocean energy programme; and information and communications technology programmes totalling €43.8 million — most of this allocation is to fund broadband investment in cases of market failure.</p>
            <p eId="para_179">As reflected in the allocations, the priorities in 2011 are the funding of public sector broadcasting, funding of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies and investment in broadband in cases of market failure.  The investment in energy efficiency will play an important role in promoting employment in the construction sector.  Broadband intervention, especially through the national broadband scheme, is furthering the roll-out of broadband infrastructure, which plays a key role in underpinning economic and social development.  In addition, my Department will provide some €34 million to fund TG4 and almost €29 million to fund inland fisheries in the current year.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_180">I thank the Minister for his reply.  He referred to expenditure of €69 million for the energy efficiency area.  The home energy savings scheme has been one of the most successful grant schemes administered by the SEAI.  Is it the Minister's intention to continue to fund that scheme?  As he will be aware, there is provision in the Finance Act 2011 for some tax relief for persons who invest in energy efficiency measures in their homes but it is subject to a commencement order.  Would he like to comment on that?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_74" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_181">I agree with the Deputy.  It is beyond dispute that the home efficiency home heating scheme has great merit.  It ticks all the boxes in terms of energy efficiency and energy saving, making a contribution to meeting our carbon targets and, third but by no means least, job creation.  Job application in that area is very significant at a time when there are so many unemployed workers in the construction sector.  It is my intention to continue the scheme although I am in the process of examining the development of perhaps a wider scheme, which would encompass some of the existing schemes like the warmer homes scheme and so on, and rebranding it.  All that is left for me to do now is to find the money.  That is the hard bit.  In terms of not only domestic dwellings but public buildings, there is a huge saving in the medium term for the State and considerable potential for job creation in this area.  I hope when the Minister for Finance brings in his jobs budget that this area will be well represented in it.</p>
            <p eId="para_182">I have not yet made up my mind or examined the issue raised by Deputy McGrath in terms of the tax relief provided in the last Finance Act in this area.  My understanding is that it is a relief at the standard rate.  This issue is similar to the debate with Deputy Stanton on microgeneration or, perhaps more pertinently, the argument in the pensions industry that if people were given a tax break at the marginal rate, there would be a very significant uptake.  However, if the rate was changed to the standard rate, what would be the uptake and what would be the effect on the pensions industry and the people employed there?</p>
            <p eId="para_183">Similarly in this respect, would domestic dwellers, for example, incur at this time the necessary spend for a 20% tax break or could that money be used more  productively?  That is the issue I have to examine.  There is no doubt but that in terms of energy saving, import substitution, the jobs dimension of the scheme, and our 2020 targets and thereafter, this would make a significant contribution and there is a jobs dimension to it.  Whether an estimate of the tax foregone might be better used elsewhere is something that I have not yet made up my mind about but the short answer to Deputy McGrath's question is that I agree it is a worthwhile scheme as it is operating and it is my definite intention to continue it.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_75">
            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_184">I acknowledge the Minister's comments as to whether any tax relief in this area, as set out in the Finance Act, would provide a tangible incentive.  The administration of the scheme has been quite efficient.  As the Minister will be aware, people who apply online have an answer in a short number of days.  It is easy to administer and it is easy for the home owner to avail of it.  Whether the Minister would be better off configuring additional support into the direct grant scheme rather than in terms of tax relief is a matter which I agree could be reconsidered.</p>

            <p eId="para_185">I agree with the Deputy that they are the issues that require to be crystallised because the scheme is a good one.  We have not touched on the issue of fuel poverty, which, unfortunately, is a growing difficulty in that area.  This scheme, which is separate from the scheme administered by the local authorities, makes a significant contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_186">In that regard, having welcomed the ESB's announcement yesterday, I was disappointed about an aspect of it.  Deregulation in the marketplace finished yesterday and was accompanied by a statement from the ESB to make a not insignificant reduction in energy prices graded according to different categories but, unfortunately, people already in trouble were excluded from that.  I am sure an element of that comprises customers who are recalcitrant in the sense of flitting from one company to another to evade their ESB or gas bills and I understand the ESB's response in respect of that small category.  However, there are genuine people in difficulty as a result of fuel poverty, of having been disconnected and of their inability to pay their bills.  I ask the ESB to re-examine whether it is not feasible to distinguish between those genuinely in need and those who simply are seeking to evade paying their normal tariff.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Michael Healy-Rae — the need to reconsider proposals regarding the school transport scheme; (2) Deputy Seán Kyne — the need to clear weeds from Lough Corrib; (3) Deputy Mattie McGrath — the need for the immediate procurement of a site to facilitate the proposed amalgamation of Cahir boys national school and Cahir girls national school; (4) Deputy Michael McCarthy — the issue of Kinsale College of Further Education — the college has an ongoing issue in securing autonomy as a stand-alone PLC centre and there had been a realistic expectation that the previous Minister for Education and Skills would be able to grant this on the basis that the school would obtain a roll number, but this seems to no longer to be the case, and the need for the Minister to clarify the position; (5) Deputy Tom Fleming — when will the Minister open Castlemaine harbour salmon fishery which was reopened last year on a pilot basis and that the inland fishery furnish the scientific evidence results as soon as possible; (6) Deputy James Bannon — the need to provide funding in respect of a new school building for Curraghmore national school, County Westmeath; (7) Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív — an tábhacht a bhaineann le cead a thabhairt láithreach do Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe dul ar aghaidh le scéim uisce réigiúnach Chasla go mór mhór i bhfianaise na faidhbe a d'éirigh le gairid le scéim uisce na Ceathrún Rua nuair a chuaigh ola isteach san uisce; (8) Deputy Martin Ferris — the failure of the ESB to pass on its decrease in prices to customers who are currently in arrears; (9) Deputy Joe Costello — the need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to introduce legislation to abolish the Smithfield horse fair; and (10) Deputy Nicky McFadden — to raise the matter of the revision of VEC areas in the country with the Minister for Education and Skills and to highlight the need to ensure that the configuration of the Midland VEC will be Longford-Westmeath with the headquarters based in Mullingar, County Westmeath.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_190">I take the opportunity of Leaders' Questions to the Taoiseach today to raise the horrific murder of PSNI officer Ronan Kerr in Omagh at the weekend.  We have our political differences but in terms of the rule of law and democracy I believe the Taoiseach and I are on the same side.  I know that the Taoiseach and the Government share our and our party's abhorrence at the callous and shocking murder of police constable Ronan Kerr.  In that context, will the Taoiseach agree that the perpetrators of such evil actions have no place in a civilised society and must be challenged and confronted at every opportunity?</p>
          <p eId="para_191">In the aftermath of such an horrific murder it is important that a clear, united and unequivocal message be sent from this democratic Chamber that those responsible for this cowardly atrocity have no mandate and do not act in the name of the Irish people.  The murder of Ronan Kerr is a direct assault on the peace process itself.  No terrorist gang can be allowed to dictate to the Irish people or undermine our desire to live and share this island in harmony and friendship.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">It is important that our national Parliament is seen to stand firmly and absolutely behind the peace process.  It is for this reason that I ask if the Taoiseach would agree that it would be an apt response from this House that we pass an all-party agreed motion to make clear our abhorrence of this murder in Omagh.  There is a precedent in this regard because in March 2009, following the murder of PSNI constable Stephen Carroll and two British soldiers, the Dáil passed such a motion.  The murder of PSNI constable Ronan Kerr is no different to, and is equally repulsive as those which took place in 2009.  I request that the motion to which I refer be taken following statements.  Fianna Fáil has tabled a motion but would withdraw it in favour of a joint motion agreed by the Whips.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_79">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_193">I agree that a motion in respect of which there would be unanimous agreement should be taken following statements.  This matter was already discussed in the context of the parliamentary questions I answered earlier.  There will be an opportunity for Members to make their views known during the statements that will be taken following the Order of Business.  There is no reason we should not send out a strong, clear and unequivocal condemnation by way of a motion unanimously agreed by the House.  As the Deputy indicated, this is not the first occasion on which we have been obliged to resort to taking such action.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">I regret that Members are being asked to speak in a debate to which they would never have believed they would be obliged to contribute.  It is important to bear in mind the psychology behind what happened.  A meeting was held, a decision was made and an instruction was given to someone who took an oath to be a member of the cell, society or group responsible for what occurred at the weekend.  That individual, perhaps in conjunction with others, was then sent to perpetrate this cowardly act and a young man's life ended as a result.  It is a slur on the humanity of every person in this country that this should have happened.  We condemn this act unreservedly.  There is no one in the House who will not share that sentiment.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">I agree with Deputy Martin that we should send out, by way of statement and agreed motion, a unanimous, unequivocal, strong and clear message that this kind of cowardice will not be tolerated and is condemned unreservedly by Dáil Éireann and by every Member elected thereto by the people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_196">I thank the Taoiseach and agree wholeheartedly with him.  As stated during Question Time, the transformation of the police service in Northern Ireland is one of the outstanding legacies of the peace process.  The changed relationship between the Garda Síochána and the PSNI has played a strong and central role in that transformation.  Many gardaí who engage on a daily and weekly basis with their counterparts in the PSNI share people's horror and sadness with regard to what has occurred.  The Minister for Justice and Equality articulated the position very well in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">When one listens to certain commentators, it occasionally appears that there is some doubt with regard to the absolute and strong co-operation between — and the agenda shared by — the Garda Síochána and the PSNI in the context of tracking and apprehending the evil individuals who perpetrate crimes of this nature.  Is the Taoiseach in a position to assure the House that the two forces will continue to work in a synergistic fashion to ensure that the peace and quality of life enjoyed by all citizens on this island will be protected?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_81">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_198">I am in a position to provide such an assurance.  As indicated on Question Time, I spoke to the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson MLA, and to the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, MLA.  In addition, the Minister for Justice and Equality spoke to his counterpart in Northern Ireland, Mr. David Ford, MLA.  I have also spoken to the British Prime Minister and pledged the Government's support for both the Northern Ireland Assembly and the British Government in the wake of this act of cowardice.  I assure Deputy Martin that the level of co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI — both of which the Deputy and I support — is at an all-time high.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">I received a security briefing yesterday from the Garda Commissioner.  From his time in Government, the Deputy would have experience of such briefings.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Justice and Equality also attended the briefing to which I refer.  We were provided with an assurance that there is active and intense co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI and that this will continue.  The resources necessary to underpin this high level of co-operation will be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">It is clear from what we heard at the briefing that in the past, lives have been saved and dastardly acts have been prevented.  It is most tragic that in this instance a young man lost his life.  The Garda Commissioner has confirmed that the co-operation and involvement between Garda Síochána and the PSNI is what the Deputy, I and everyone else would expect it to be, namely, of the highest calibre possible.  There is no difficulty with regard to the transmission of information, where relevant, between the Garda and the PSNI.  I hope that the intensity of the relationship between the two forces will ensure that the perpetrators of this murder, whomever they may be, will be brought to justice and punished accordingly.</p>

Bhí mé sa Tuaisceart Dé Domhnaigh agus inné ag obair le Máirtín Mac Aonghusa agus daoine eile agus táimid go han-soiléir go bhfuil pobal na tíre in éadan an dhúnmharaithe sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">It is appropriate that the Government has allocated time for a debate on the murder of Ronan Kerr.  We discussed this matter earlier on Question Time.  It is of the utmost importance that we should continue to make it clear that we stand in opposition to this murder and that we stand with the Kerr family.  During the statements that will follow the Order of Business, we will have the opportunity to spell out our views in detail and to chart a way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the ongoing economic situation.  In the recent general election campaign, he clearly stated that the current EU-IMF bailout deal is bad for Ireland and bad for Europe, that the financial markets are closed to Ireland principally because investors are concerned that any further capital injections into the banks will sink the economy and that the bailout plan would not restore confidence in Ireland because at its heart is a commitment to continue the failed banking policies of the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government.  The Taoiseach made these comments only a few short weeks ago.  However, he has taken every opportunity — in this Chamber, at meetings at European level and at various summits — to state that he is committed to the EU-IMF deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">I do not understand what kind of negotiating position this represents.  It strikes me as ridiculous for the Taoiseach to continually give away his negotiating position.  Many individuals have informed me that it is totally unacceptable that he is doing the exact opposite to that to which he committed only a few short weeks ago.  The Irish people are being obliged to pay for that.  Will the Taoiseach explain this departure and will he throw some light on the Government's negotiating stance, le do thoil?</p>

Mar a dúirt mé, bhí mé ag caint lena mháthair, Nuala, inné agus táim fíor-bhuíoch di as ucht na crógachta agus as ucht an mhisnigh a léirigh sí sa chaoi a labhair sí amach faoi dhúnmharú a mic.  Tá súil agam nuair a bheidh mé thuas amárach, in éineacht leis an Chéad-Aire agus an Leas-Chéad Aire agus Teachtaí eile ón Teach seo, gur comhartha láidir a bheidh ann ag éirí as an díospóireacht a bheidh againn inniu agus an rún a rithfear go hiomlán ar son gach Teachta sa Dáil seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">It is not a case of changing our position.  The actual position is that we have been dealing with six dysfunctional banks.  We proceeded down a path of confusion and uncertainty for a long period and people became completely frustrated by the fact that the previous Government would not provide leadership or point the way towards a point where the country would be in charge of its economic destiny once again.  That is why the Government last week made its decisions in respect of the banking sector.  This brings clarity and certainty.  We will now have two pillar banks which will be the bulwark of the future banking sector in Ireland.  That is very clear and gives certainty.  This is now recognised internationally and by independent commentators.  The ECB, in its statement following the Government's decision about the banking sector, confirmed it will provide ongoing liquidity to the Irish banks, which is of extreme and fundamental importance for business and for confidence in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">We must rebuild our connections and contacts with our counterparts in Europe.  The Tánaiste and all members of the Government will involve themselves in this important work.  Our European colleagues understand how important it is, in a European sense, to show flexibility in the path Ireland must follow and will follow.  The Deputy is aware that the EU-IMF mission starts today and will last until 15 April.  Much of this will consist of technical discussion of the intricacies of the instruments.  The Government will discuss elements of the programme for Government, such as the upcoming jobs initiative programme which will have an impact on the indigenous economy.  It will stimulate investment and provide confidence so people who have been saving, because of their fear of future uncertainty, will have an opportunity to spend in the Irish economy to grow confidence and hope and provide jobs.</p>

          <p eId="para_208">Níor thug an Taoiseach freagra ar na ceisteanna a chuir mé air.  Seo na focail a dúirt sé.  These are his words.  I did not make them up.  These are what people voted for.  The Taoiseach talked about the five point plan.  It strikes me that we are engaged in a five point U-turn.  Here are other words people voted for:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_209">Fine Gael in Government will force certain bondholders to share in the cost of recapitalising troubled financial institutions.  This will be done unilaterally for most junior bondholders.  It could be extended as part of a Euope-wide framework for senior debt, focusing on insolvent institutions like Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide that have no importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The Government gave €3 billion of the people's money to those two institutions.  There needs to be some clarity so people can understand what the Government is doing and have confidence in it.  The Taoiseach's party said not a red cent would be committed to the banks unless they imposed losses on their bondholders, yet last week the Government poured another €24 billion of the people's money into those banks.  What price manifestos, election promises or election commitments?  A very high price indeed, especially for people who are in economic distress at this time.  The manifesto of the Labour Party, the other party in government, has been shredded.  The Irish taxpayers are paying, not just for the Government's U-turns, but also for the private greed of bankers.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">There is no sense of our coming out of this.  I am, by nature, an optimist and I believe we can find a way out of our difficulty.  This party has put forward suggestions for how to do that, but not by throwing good money after bad.</p>

          <p eId="para_212">The Government's decision of last week brought about certainty and clarity regarding the Irish banking sector.  This is very important for business.  It has been received in that light by international commentators, the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund.  It was about time someone made a decision in respect of the Irish banking sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">The Government looked at the positions of six dysfunctional banks and a country that could not borrow money on the international markets, whose banks could not borrow money and where every cent coming in was being provided from abroad.  The Government's decisions give clarity and certainty to that.  This has been followed by clarity from the ECB in respect of its ongoing commitment to liquidity in the Irish banking system, which is important in getting confidence back into our economy.  Thursday's payments of €2.5 billion and €530 million from the Exchequer to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide arise from the promissory note made by the previous Government.  I have said on many occasions that there is no point in not telling the people what the facts of life are.</p>

          <from>Deputy Shane Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_225">I agree with the Taoiseach on one point.  Plenty of clarity and certainty has been introduced.  The clarity and certainty is that the Government has utterly surrendered to the IMF and EU.  They know that, we know that and everybody knows that.  "Default" is, apparently, the word that cannot be mentioned in this Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">Is the Taoiseach happy that the greatest cheerleaders for his policy and for the statements coming from his side of the House are Fianna Fáil?  His support is coming from the previous Government.  Very few people can see the difference, if there is any, between this Government and the previous one in their attitudes to the banks, despite all the those promises.  That is the great disappointment for those of us who have been observing this for a long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">The Taoiseach cannot paint the opposition to Government policies as something coming from the technical group and Sinn Féin.  Does the Taoiseach read the Lex column in the <i>Financial Times</i>?  It will tell him that people out in the market think Ireland is being governed by people who do not understand markets.  Let me read four lines from the Lex column of last Saturday:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_228">In the Irish case senior bondholders have been given a blank cheque by Irish taxpayers, the result of an Irish Government decision in late 2008.  No other Government is likely to make that mistake.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">Another Government has made that mistake.  The Taoiseach's Government has done so, by wearing the clothes of the Government of Brian Cowen.  Why do senior bondholders have to be treated in the same way as deposit holders?  They are a completely different creature.  Senior bondholders make a decision, take a risk and make an investment.  Depositors take their money to a bank with no sophisticated investment techniques or knowledge and put their money in the bank to be safeguarded.  There is an issue of trust against an issue of investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">Yet we are saying we rank them <i>pari passu </i>and they should never be stung.  The logic of this is that the Irish taxpayer must pay for the senior bondholders.  The article in Lex column, which is a market-led column, states that senior bondholders are the luckiest people in Europe and that they cannot believe their luck at the current Irish Government pursuing identical policies to those of the last Government in terms of insisting on paying them when no other Government in the world would do so.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_97">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_231">A man of Deputy Ross's capabilities and intelligence will understand that the policies are not the same.  The Government has not made a mistake; it has made a decision, namely, to reduce the number of dysfunctional banks and to create two pillar banks which will be the bulwark in terms of where we go from here.  This differs from the position taken by the last Government.  It is a decision which brings clarity and certainty to the Irish banking sector.  It is a matter of fact that commentators must comment.  The Lex column is not the sovereign Government of this country.  Unfortunately, because of the constraints placed on the people of this country as a result of the IMF-EU deal, the options available to the new Government were limited.  However, one must make decisions.  The Government made a decision which will ensure clarity and certainty in the banking sector.  In discussions with the European Central Bank, it provided certainty in respect of ongoing liquidity into the Irish banks.  That is important.  I accept it is not the end result in terms of where we want to be, which is, in a position to say goodbye to the IMF in terms of the deal and to return to the bond markets, thus regaining control of our economic destiny.  Given the obstacles in our way, difficult decisions will have to be taken into the future.  We must rebuild the nature of our relationship with many of our European counterparts and we are working to do so.  The space now provided allows for this to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">Deputy Ross will be aware that there have been significant contributions from subordinated bondholders.  The point was made at least week's press conference that there is a clear difference between senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society and those in the pillar banks, namely, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.  The Government was clear in terms of its pronouncement in this regard.</p>

I would have thought a man of the Taoiseach's intelligence and knowledge would be aware of the serious dangers of setting up two major banks of that sort.  The Taoiseach and I am sure everyone else in the House will remember what happened when Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland dominated the market in the past, namely, they ran a cartel or, at least, a duopoly which is the reason they have become the tyrants of the financial system here.  By retreating into that position the Taoiseach is inviting them to regain the type of territorial strength they had in the past, thus being in a position once again to crucify the consumer in order to gain increased bank profits.

          <p eId="para_236">The Government, as part of its programme for Government, will move on to the issues that need to be addressed in respect of governance of the Irish banking sector.  Clearly, changes are needed.  I am sure Deputy Ross is aware that foreign-owned banks located here will provide competition and certainty within the sector.  Deputy Ross may also be aware that many international commentators are now looking with some degree of confidence at the decisions made by the Government in terms of bringing clarity and certainty to the banking sector.  That is important.  We are no longer proceeding on a path of confusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">Deputy Ross will be aware that people in this country like to be told the scale of the problem.  From this point of view, the people understand the constraints and difficulties of government.  Governments must make decisions on how to proceed rather than just comment.  In this regard, the Government has brought clarity and certainty to the banking sector.  We must now move on to discussions in regard to the interest rate on the IMF-EU deal and other costs associated with that structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">It is important to understand that what we are seeking from Europe is not more but less money with greater flexibility to achieve the same target.  The Government is concentrating on providing a jobs initiative programme which it will publish in due course.  This initiative will provide opportunities and incentives to stimulate our indigenous economy, thus providing that much needed sense of confidence and hope for job creation and allowing employers to recruit labour and getting our country moving.  Other countries have moved on; their recession is over.  We face an enormous range of difficulties.  Courage is needed if we are to move forward in accordance with the programme for Government.</p>

If what we seek is a consensual approach in this regard, we should then create a process for so doing.  I ask, in the spirit of co-operation, that the Government withdraw this motion.  Let us approach this in a consensual manner with all Whips meeting to earnestly discuss reform of how we do our business.  The Taoiseach will find us forthcoming in that regard.  We have no wish for disruption of the Order of Business.

I was a member of the sub-committee on Dáil reform for many years, the work of which was obstructed not by me or the smaller parties but by others.  I believe any changes made should not be to Standing Orders alone but in the context of overall change.  Many parties have proposed reasonable changes which would facilitate reform of the Dáil.  I do not have a problem with facilitating a once-off change, for instance, to accommodate someone who cannot or does not wish to be present for Taoiseach's questions tomorrow.  However, there are more effective and efficient means of giving effect to such a change.  One option would be to have an earlier sitting.  Another proposal has been made to have topical questions.  Rather than forcing the issue, I concur with Deputy Martin's suggestion that the motion be withdrawn until such time as a full plan for Dáil reform has been brought forward.  Last Thursday's discussion on committees marked a start with regard to the agenda the Government has stated it will pursue.  As we have not yet received its proposals in totality, it would not be appropriate to adopt this proposed change on its own.</p>

          <p eId="para_261">The issue before us was raised at last week's meeting of the Whips and has been placed on the Order Paper because the flow of business in the House has not been right for some time.  It is proposed that, following Leaders' Questions, we will have the Order of Business for 30 minutes and that this will be followed by Taoiseach's questions.  The change would only apply on Wednesdays.  It is not my intention to have this individual measure continue in perpetuity as I have a range of ideas which I have put to my party Whip.  The Whips will discuss a series of radical changes to the way in which we do business at their meeting next week and this proposal can be thrown into the melting pot.</p>

The change which was also discussed at last week's meeting of the Whips would only apply on Wednesdays.  In the context of discussions at next week's meeting of the Whips on a whole series of changes to make the Dáil more relevant, effective and responsive, I ask the parties opposite to leave the proposal in place.  I do not want to withdraw it because it would provide for a better flow of business.  I hope we will agree on it because, as Deputy Martin will know from his years on this side of the House, the committee dealing with Dáil reform met until its members were blue in the face but nothing happened.  We will see to it that something happens now.</p>

While we welcome the Fianna Fáil Party's new wish for consensus, having been in opposition for the past 15 years, I recall being told at Whips' meetings to take it or leave it.  Fianna Fáil will get reform, regardless of whether it likes it.</p>

          <p eId="para_280">While it is all very well for Deputy Stagg to endeavour to impose himself again and be whatever he wants to be, there is an important point of principle at stake.  The Taoiseach may ignore it or put the matter to a vote if he wishes, but I respectfully ask him, in the spirit of our agreed co-operation, to withdraw the motion and approach this issue correctly.  Although the matter was raised at the Whips' meeting, the Government Whip stated he would revert to the matter at the subsequent meeting of the Whips.  It was not agreed by the Whips by any means.  It was raised at the end of the meeting in a sort of a sleeveen way rather than in an up-front manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_281">The Fianna Fáil Party will not be denied any rights.  At present, we have Leaders' Questions followed by Taoiseach's questions followed by the Order of Business.  A number of people have suggested business would flow better if Leaders' Questions were followed by the Order of Business to allow matters of national interest to be raised.  This would then be followed by Taoiseach's questions.  As Deputy Martin will recall, on the first day I answered questions I indicated that we would perhaps change questions to the Taoiseach on one day to allow Deputies to raise topical issues and receive replies from Ministers.  The proposal relates to Wednesdays only and Deputies would not be denied an opportunity to raise matters on the Order of Business.  Although the time allocated to the Order of Business under the proposal is 30 minutes, this period would be extended if a vote or votes were called and Taoiseach's questions would be pushed out further.  No one would be denied the right to raise an issue on the Order of Business.  The proposal would provide for a better flow of political business in the Chamber and refers only to Wednesdays.</p>

The Labour Party and Fine Gael made commitments before the election to reverse the cut and restore the minimum wage.  Does the Government remain committed to this and when will it be done?  I was very perturbed that the Taoiseach said in response to me that he would need the approval of the EU and the IMF to reverse the decision by the last Government to reduce the minimum wage.  At some point, the Taoiseach has to stop blaming the last Government for the actions of this Government.  I am caught on what authority the Government has if it must get the permission of the EU and the IMF to rectify the reduction of the minimum wage.  Does it remain a Government commitment and when will it be brought forward?</p>

One of the commitments we gave as an incoming Government was to reverse the decision in respect of the minimum wage.  It is not a budgetary matter, so it is not just a matter for the Minister for Finance, and it requires the approval of the IMF-EU.  In fact, it was mentioned this morning and we have asked the Attorney General for her advice as to whether it will require legislation to do this.  We will report to the Members of the House when that advice is available.</p>

This would allow for a proper debate on whether this country should be allowed to decide whether it wants to proceed with the bank bailout and the IMF deal.

First, I see in the pink pages that we will deal with the finance (No. 2) Bill, which will give effect to the issues in regard to civil partnership but also in regard to the mini-budget that is to be introduced.  What is the date of that mini-budget?

          <p eId="para_451">Second, nowhere in the legislative programme is there reference to the strategic investment bank, which is a promise made in the programme for Government.  Is that binned or is it still on the agenda?  When are we likely to see any relevant legislation?</p>
          <p eId="para_452">Another omission in the legislative programme is a measure relating to mortgages, specifically, the difficulties being experienced by the many who are already struggling to pay their mortgages.  In light of the interest rate hike by the ECB that is expected shortly, are there any proposals by the Government, as promised, to bring forward measures that will reduce the severity of such hikes, as well as in regard to restructuring mortgage debts of customers?  We have dealt with the banks in terms of the stress tests.  Is there legislation pending in regard to ordinary customers?  Will the Taoiseach indicate when there will be a mini-budget, whether the investment bank is binned and whether the Government intends to bring forward proposals in terms of mortgages?</p>

          <p eId="para_458">A great deal of good work was done by an all-party Oireachtas committee on a proposed wording for a children's right referendum.  The previous Attorney General gave a view on that and a different form of wording was produced.  The children's rights advocacy groups were somewhat upset about this when I met with them before the election.  They were of the opinion — without being definite about a referendum — that it might be possible to arrive at an agreed position whereby a referendum on children's rights could be held, presumably on the same day as a presidential election which will happen some time in November.  That is not definite and the Minister for Children is looking at the advice given by the previous Attorney General in respect of the wording for what is a sensitive and serious issue.  There was no commitment to hold a specific referendum on the date of a presidential election, but it is a matter that can be considered.  If there is a referendum there will also have to be a Bill giving effect to it, which would impact on the legislative programme as published at 4 p.m.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_175">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_474">Last Saturday in Omagh a despicable act was carried out which has been universally condemned in both parts of this island.  It will be counter-productive to the perpetrators.  I convey my utter abhorrence of the brutal and senseless killing of Constable Ronan Kerr.  I speak for everyone in this House in expressing deepest condolences to his family.  We must remember that, in the first instance, the callous murder of Constable Kerr has left his mother, Nuala, grieving for a lost son and Cathair, Aaron and Deirine without a much loved brother.  Their loss is a terrible one and I send them my deepest sympathy at this very sad and dark time.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">Ronan Kerr's death is a severe loss to his family.  He is also a great loss to his friends and community, to his fellow GAA players, to his colleagues in the Police Service of Northern Ireland and to all peace-loving people on this island.  I was particularly moved by the words of Nuala Kerr who, in the midst of her shock and grief, was brave enough to speak out against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act and to urge Catholics not to be deterred from joining the PSNI, a sincere sentiment later reinforced in the statements from the First and Deputy First Ministers.  I spoke to Nuala yesterday.  Despite her loss she welcomed my call and spoke warmly and with immense pride about her son, Ronan.  Her dignity at what is a deeply sad time for the Kerr family impressed me greatly.  I intend to offer my sympathy to her and her family in person tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">In totally condemning the callous killing of a young man who had decided to dedicate his life to protecting the people of Northern Ireland, I am joined by all the political voices on these islands.  What is especially striking is the speed with which all sections of the community have moved to express their utter outrage at this unlawful, merciless murder.  The condemnation has been broad-based and swift.  The Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh, the Most Rev. Alan Harper, and the Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, the Right Rev. Ken Good, were correct when they said that the "cruelty and shame of those who committed this act, either in planting the device or in supplying of information, is displayed for all the world to see."  In his statement the president of Ulster GAA summed up what many feel when he said that "his [Constable Kerr's] death demeans humanity and is detrimental to the development of a shared future based on mutual respect."  Later he described the attack on one of its members as an "attack on us all".  I join the British Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, when he said that "those who carried out this wicked and cowardly crime will never succeed in dragging Northern Ireland back to a dark and bloody past."</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Since the terrible incident on Saturday I have spoken to the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, and to the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness.  Many ministerial colleagues have been in touch with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  We are all equally determined, in a combined effort, to maintain peace, stability and security in Northern Ireland.  We will not waver from that task.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">Saturday's attack was an attack on community policing, and its impact has been felt by both police forces on this island.  The Garda Commissioner put it well when he said that while the Garda and PSNI wear different uniforms, they are woven together by what they do.  The extent and quality of co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI is of the highest level and is proving to be a successful collaboration.  The increased level in dissident activities in the past two years has been met by even greater levels of co-operation between both forces.  Saturday's events will only strengthen that co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The Government will provide every support to the investigation into this crime.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has been in touch with his opposite number, the Northern Ireland Justice Minister, Mr. David Ford, to assure him that every support will be given to the PSNI in this case.  This shocking event brings to mind the violence and destruction that unfortunately was so much a part of the past in Northern Ireland and which brought previous tragedy to the good people of Omagh.  One must also remind oneself that in recent years, as a result of the peace process, a new era has developed that has totally transformed Northern Ireland, the relationships between both its traditions and the relationships between North and South.  Saturday's terrible event will not deflect us from this path of peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">I join with the PSNI Chief Constable and the Garda Síochána in appealing to members of the public who have any information relating to the criminals responsible to come forward.  No effort must be spared in bringing them to justice.  This was a heinous and pointless act of terror by a small segment of the population whose motivation lies in the dark past.  The rejection of this awful crime and the united response of the political parties and civic society sends out a very clear message.  Quite simply, we will not allow a return to instability and violence.  The democratic will of the people will never be defeated.  The democratic institutions and the peace that has been so hard-won are being challenged by a tiny and unrepresentative group of people with no mandate and no support for their actions.  They are acting in defiance of the peace process so wholeheartedly supported by the people on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The Good Friday Agreement made clear the people's commitment to peace and the creation of a stable society founded on mutual respect, equal rights and opportunities for all its citizens.  The Agreement provided the basis on which Northern Ireland has reached a new era of peace, mutual respect and co-operation.  It provided a firm basis for reconciliation and renewal and helped to bring to an end the historical legacy of mistrust and bitter conflict.  The Good Friday Agreement provided a framework for a new beginning and a new era marked by tolerance and mutual respect for all people and all points of view on this island.  The constitutional amendment so emphatically endorsed by the people in 1998 sets out clearly our commitment to working in partnership and friendship to unite all the people who share the territory of the island of Ireland, with equal regard to the diversity of their identities and traditions, recognising that a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of the majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">These principles are strongly adhered to today and continue to guide Government policy.  Through all the twists and turns over the last number of years, the Agreement has endured, both in respect of its institutions, which are central, and of the very principles and aspirations it embodies.  These principles and aspirations continue to guide us as we continue to work together to make a better future and resolve never to return to the pain, suffering and darkness of the past.  The Good Friday Agreement represents the absolute democratic will of the people of this island, North and South.  Its implementation is an imperative to a peaceful and prosperous future on this island.  Last Saturday's tragedy is completely contrary to the letter and the spirit of the Agreement.  It was an action of a past from which we all have moved on and was a brutal action that offers nothing to either the present or the future.  It was a cold, calculated and cowardly act carried out by what the Deputy First Minister described as the "enemies of ... peace" and "enemies of the people of Ireland".</p>
          <p eId="para_483">When the Northern Assembly rose at the end of March in advance of the Assembly elections, it marked the longest continual period of operation of the institutions in the North since the Agreement.  This is a significant achievement and is an historical milestone.  I wish to acknowledge the commitment and determination of the political leaders in Northern Ireland to work together to create a new future.  They demonstrate the primacy of democracy and hope over violence and despair.  They have shown that the institutions work.  They have displayed a firm commitment to tackling issues that concern everyone, including the economy, jobs, health, education, infrastructure and the quality of life in general.  Above all, the political institutions offer real hope for the future.  In referring to those who perpetrated this act, the First and Deputy First Minister gave a clear message that the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland are stronger today than ever before.  In this context, the forthcoming elections represent the normalisation of politics in the North, which was brought about by democratic politics, democratic votes and adherence to the rule of law by a forward-looking society.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">In its programme for Government, the Government has set out its full support for the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement.  It is committed to publishing and acting on the recommendations of the first review of the North-South implementation bodies and areas for co-operation and will progress the second part of the review to identify new areas for North-South co-operation.  The promotion of greater economic co-operation on this island to accelerate the process of recovery and the creation of jobs also is a clear part of that agenda.  The Government is committed to furthering these issues through the work of the North-South Ministerial Council.  The degree of co-operation at all levels between North and South and across a wide range of key sectors continues to develop.  There has been a transformation of relationships on this island.  Relations between nationalism and unionism have been transformed, as have relations between North and South and between Ireland and Britain.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The Government remains firmly committed to working with the Northern Ireland Executive and the British Government to maintain peace in Northern Ireland, to build on the historic achievements that have been made after so much hard work by so many and which have helped to create a better future for everyone on this island.  I hope and pray that the tragic and unfortunate death of Ronan Kerr will mark a turning point for those who might lean towards supporting violence as a way forward.  Violence clearly is not a way forward for anyone.  It can not and will not succeed in dividing us.  This House is united today, as is our country, in remembering the life of a young and proud Irishman, Constable Ronan Kerr.  He was a proud Irishman who loved his country and who lost his life in the service of Ireland and the cause of peace.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_176">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_486">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the callous and shocking murder of Police Constable Ronan Kerr.  I will of course also attend his funeral mass tomorrow.  I referred earlier to the importance of an agreed motion to give a clear message from this democratic Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">At the outset, I wish to extend my deepest sympathies and those of my party to the family, friends and neighbours of Ronan Kerr.  His murder is a heinous crime and those responsible for it are beneath contempt.  They are psychopaths not patriots and I hope they soon will face the full rigors of the law.  Ronan Kerr was a brave and civic-minded Irishman.  He was shamefully murdered by faceless and twisted assassins who are intent on defying the will of the Irish people.  Ronan died in the service of his community as he left his home to go to work in Enniskillen on Saturday evening in order that others could live in peace and security.  His death is a human tragedy for his family and for the people of Omagh.  His murder has achieved nothing but suffering, pain and terrible grief among an ordinary hard-working family.  Moreover, there is no escaping the sadness, sense of waste and lost potential of a young man in his prime, only 25 years of age, being senselessly and brutally assassinated by people who have no respect for human life and no respect for democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">The perpetrators of such evil actions have no place in civilised society and must be challenged and confronted at every opportunity.  In the aftermath of an horrific murder such as this, it is important that a clear, united and unequivocal message be sent from the democratic Parliament of the Irish Republic that those responsible for this cowardly atrocity have no mandate and do not act in the name of the Irish people.  The terrorists who carried out this brutal killing have no democratic legitimacy.  They went about their vile business because they have no respect for the sovereign wishes of the Irish people.  They may claim to be a republican organisation but most definitely are not.  Their actions and contempt for the will of the Irish people, North and South, to live together in peace and harmony, defiles that honourable tradition.  Real republicans understand and respect the fact that the Irish people are sovereign.  Real republicans recognise and accept that the Irish people have democratically expressed their support for peace on this island and stand firmly behind that inspired decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">The murder of Ronan Kerr is a direct assault on and a violent attempt to undermine the peace process.  It is a brutal effort to subvert the collective will of the people as expressed in the Good Friday Agreement.  It is part of a sinister plot to destabilise the legitimately established institutions in Northern Ireland.  As democratically elected representatives, it is important that Deputies express with one voice our clear revulsion for and steadfast opposition to those who want to return this island to the bad days of murder and mayhem.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">A lunatic minority who glory in a return to so-called armed struggle wish to undo all the progress of a generation in building peace and trust, but they will not succeed.  The peace process belongs to all the people of this island and no terrorist gang will deflect us from it.  No terrorist gang can be allowed to dictate to the Irish people or undermine our desire to live and share this island in harmony and friendship.  The will of the people is stronger than those who threaten or use violence while claiming a political agenda.  Let us be clear — there is no politics in the murder of Ronan Kerr.  It is murder, plain and simple.  It was carried out by people with no agenda other than to inflict pain and cause sorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">I want to make clear to the Taoiseach and the Government that they have this party's full support and enduring co-operation in ensuring that these terrorist gangs are not allowed to jeopardise the peace process.  A convention has developed whereby they are referred to as "dissidents".  I have always rejected this label.  "Dissident" suggests a coherent opinion and a principled stand against another's position.  It probably developed during the Cold War.  It has no place in the description of the bloodthirsty nihilists who took the life of this fine young Irishman.  They are straightforward gangs, but we are acutely conscious of the threat they pose.  Unfortunately, this week has shown us once again their aptitude and capacity for evil.  Irish and British security and intelligence sources believe they are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their bomb-making capability.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Fianna Fáil will support the Government in any effort it takes to place further extensive resources at the disposal of the Garda to target the activities of these gangs.  We will also support the Government in any practical legislative measure it may introduce to crush those who engage in or give succour to terrorist gangs.  The Garda Síochána will be giving every assistance to the PSNI to counter the subversive threat to democracy on this island.  I am heartened by the excellent co-operation between the police services.  That is the way it should be and it is a reality which many of us in this House have worked hard to help achieve.  Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan and PSNI Chief Constable Matt Baggott are liaising closely.  Anti-terrorist officers from both police services are also working together in an effort to identify the murderers.  It is the patriotic duty of everyone on this island to give full support to police investigations so the evil people responsible for this crime can be brought to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">This weekend, the name of Ireland was sullied again by those who trade in old hatreds and glory in weapons of terror.  At a time when we crucially need to bring jobs and investment to our country, the international reputation of Ireland has taken another blow from murderers who care more about sowing the seeds of conflict than the need to restore prosperity to the people of Ireland.  It is important that our national Parliament be seen to stand firmly and absolutely behind the peace process.  For this reason, I suggested it would be an apt response from the House to pass an all-party agreed motion making clear our abhorrence of the murder in Omagh.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">I also want to commend the response of First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness who joined Chief Constable Baggott at Stormont Castle yesterday to condemn the attack on Constable Kerr.  Indeed, the shared revulsion and outrage right across the political spectrum caused by the murder of the young police officer shows clearly how isolated and out of touch the murderers are with mainstream opinion.  In every community across the island, the strong sense of solidarity with the Kerr family and the public anger at the wrong that has been done to its members show how far we have travelled and how deep the roots of reconciliation have stretched.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">In many ways, this united approach and clear sense that the overwhelming majority of people want to leave violence behind offer us hope for the future.  Trust and better relations take time to grow and develop, but they have begun to blossom in the past decade.  There are still those who want to cling to ancient hatreds and to engage in violence, but they are few and isolated, their support is negligible and they will be defeated.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">The fact that violence has reared its ugly head once again in Northern Ireland should make us all the more resolved to stick with our framework for peace, which is centred on key democratic values such as respect for human rights, equality, tolerance and the principle of consent.  As a democrat who accepts the principle of consent, I endorse the right of a majority of the population of Northern Ireland to maintain the Union with Britain if that is the people's democratic wish.  As a proud Irish republican, however, I equally aspire to seeing and will continue to work towards the day when a majority of the people of Northern Ireland freely choose the option of an Ireland united in peace.  The great genius of the Good Friday Agreement is that it validates both of these options.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">One matter is clear and beyond doubt — violence or the threat of violence can never be used to change the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.  I completely fail to understand how any sane individual could ever believe, even for a moment, that murdering a community policeman advances the cause of a united Ireland one iota.  It undermines that goal and demeans the shared humanity of everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">The murder of Ronan Kerr on Saturday and other more recent attacks against PSNI officers and their families have shown a small criminal minority of people continue to dispute this view.  They do not enjoy any significant level of support in the community and are without any political agenda or mandate, but we must remain vigilant.  As a constitutional republican, I was privileged to play a part in the negotiation of the Hillsborough Agreement, which saw the transfer of justice and policing powers from London to Belfast.  This helped further consolidate the devolved institutions in Stormont and completed the transformation of policing in Northern Ireland.  This also secured further cross-community support for Northern Ireland's new policing arrangements and removed any last vestige of legitimacy from those who sought to undermine the peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">Like the Garda, the PSNI is essentially a force for good on this island.  The targeting of Catholic members of the PSNI by dissident groups is not only misguided, but disgusting and morally wrong.  On behalf of Fianna Fáil, I want to be crystal clear, in that there be can no justification whatsoever for threats of any description against any PSNI officer.  The targeting of any officer on grounds of his or her religion is an evil and sectarian attack against the officer and genuine republican values.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">We have persevered long, hard and successfully to transform policing through the implementation of the Patten report.  The large increase in the number of Catholic police officers has been one of the key achievements of this transformation, helping to build mutual respect across Northern Ireland.  In this regard, I will quote the wise words of a courageous woman, Mrs. Nuala Kerr, the mother of police officer Ronan Kerr, who has urged others from her community not to be deterred from joining the PSNI because of his murder.  She stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_501">This is at a time when we are striving for a neutral police force for the good of our country, and I urge all Catholic members not to be deterred by this.  We all need to stand up and be counted and to strive for equality.  We do not want to go back into the dark days again of fear and terror.  We were so proud of Ronan and all that he stood for.  Do not let his death be in vain.</p>

Ba mhaith liom mo chomhbhrón féin, agus comhbhrón poblachtánaigh in achan áit, a ghabháil le Nuala Kerr agus a chlann ar fad.  I want to extend on my own behalf and that of republicans everywhere our solidarity and sincerest condolences to Nuala Kerr and her children, Cathair, Dairine and Aaron.  Like many others I watched Nuala on television on Sunday, standing with her children beside her, speaking with love, pride and affection about Ronan.  It was a desperately sad moment, made all the more poignant because it was mothers' day.  Is am iontach brónach atá ann do Nuala Kerr agus dá clann.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">Ronan's late father Brian came from Andersonstown in west Belfast.  Tá a lán meas ag daoine ar chlann Kerr.  The Kerrs are a well known and respected family.  Ronan's grandparents and other family members live there and Ronan was a regular visitor.  This week's <i>Andersonstown News</i> — the local newspaper — has photographs on its front page of Ronan’s late father and his mother, Nuala, at a family reunion in the Andersonstown social club.  This was formerly known as the PDF club, which used to support republican prisoners and their families and organised transport for families to visit people in Long Kesh, Armagh and Portlaoise.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">Ronan was a keen GAA member.  He played for Beragh Red Knights at under 12, under 14, under 16 and at minor level.  He was also an enthusiastic Tyrone supporter.  He was one of many young Nationalists and republicans who, following fundamental changes to policing, decided to join the PSNI.  He wanted to serve his community and had just completed his training.  He was 25.  That means he was eight years old when the first IRA cessation was called.  For most of his life and all of his short adult life, he had, like all of his generation, no experience of conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Speaking on Sunday Nuala Kerr spoke for all of us when she said, as others have quoted:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_508">It is a sad day for our community.  Ronan was a valued member and he had much to offer.  This is at a time when we are striving for a neutral police force for the good of our country and I urge all Catholic members not to be deterred.  We all need to stand up and be counted and to strive for equality.  We do not want to go back to the dark days again of fear and terror.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">She is right.  We all must stand up for our community every day and everywhere on this island.  We must stand up for equality and a non-partisan, civic policing service in the North.  We must encourage young Nationalists and republicans to join the PSNI, and I do so again today.  We must confront and challenge those responsible for Ronan Kerr's murder.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">The shock, outrage and anger surrounding the murder of Ronan Kerr will unite and bind together more strongly than ever before all of those who want the peace process to succeed.  I was in the North yesterday and the day before and met many republicans who have suffered grievously in the conflict.  These people have spent a long time in prison without trial and have had their homes raided or family members assaulted, injured or, in some cases, killed.  These people are seething with anger about this.  There is such evidence in communities, from the GAA and among political representatives in civic society.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">We must go beyond condemnation; that is key.  It is important that we spell out our feelings on what occurred but there is an imperative on every citizen to defend the peace process.  That especially includes those of us honoured to be elected as political representatives, such as those of us in the Chamber and the Government as a whole.  We must demonstrate to those who want to tear down the Good Friday Agreement that we are resolute and determined to defend and build on the institutions.  There is an onus on all of us, especially the Government, to implement all outstanding aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and to strengthen the all-Ireland institutional structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">I want to take this opportunity to speak directly to those responsible for violent actions and others who might tolerate them.  Sinn Féin offered — through people like me and Martin McGuinness — to meet  you and to outline our strategy for advancing republican and democratic objectives and our belief in the futility of armed actions.  So far you have refused to speak to us, dismissed us and placed a death threat on some of us.  I make the same offer again.  I have no problem with anyone disagreeing with Sinn Féin and that is your right, but you have no right to attack anyone and there is no support for this.  That is clear from the overwhelming public rejection of the attack which killed Ronan Kerr.  The people of this island demand that you stop.  I will meet you anywhere at any time to listen to what you have to say and to tell you that there is now a democratic peaceful way to unite our people and our country on the basis of equality.  Your achievement has been to unite us all in opposition to your actions.  It is time to end these futile attacks on the peace process; they will not succeed.  Tá an cogadh thart.  The war is over.  The IRA is gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">I appeal to anyone who helped in any way to assist or shelter the perpetrators of this action, or those who may in some way — in their head or from a bar stool while chatting — try to justify this action.  Those who murdered Ronan Kerr are not the IRA; it has embraced, facilitated and supported the peace process.  The IRA has left the stage and those who murdered Ronan Kerr have no coherent strategy and their actions do not advance any political agenda whatever.  They are unrepresentative of the community and do not define republicanism.  They claim to be republican but their actions are anti-republican and against peace.  They are not dissidents; dissent is a good and necessary part of any democratic or social movement.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">Almost 20 years ago, through a long and hard process of negotiation, effort and hard work, Sinn Féin developed a peace strategy and with others created a peace process that has brought about fundamental and positive change.  Tá athruithe cuimsitheacha tar éis tarlú.  Significant progress has been made, although this is a continuing struggle.  One example of this is the fact that in four weeks there will be an election to the power sharing Northern Ireland Assembly and executive at the end of a successful four year term.  Who could have imagined 20 years ago that Martin McGuinness could be in government with Ian Paisley or Peter Robinson, with Sinn Féin, the DUP and other parties in government?  Who could have imagined the all-Ireland institutions or that the Taoiseach could be welcomed, even on a sad occasion, by every person he could meet at this sad time?  That is progress and it should be developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">The Good Friday Agreement provides a peaceful and democratic means to achieve republican objectives for those who have such goals.  In referenda and in every subsequent election the people of this island have voted for this and subsequent agreements.  There is no excuse, justification or explanation that can validate the murder of Ronan Kerr or any of the other actions of those involved in his killing.  Our goal in the time ahead must be to defend the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">Nuala Kerr is right.  This is a time to stand up and be counted against those who would seek to drag us back to the dark days and against those who are wedded to senseless and futile militarism.  It is time to continue, as she put it, the quest for equality for all.  That is the responsibility of every one of us.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_178">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_517">I wish to share time with Deputies Joan Collins, Luke Flanagan and Catherine Murphy.  I am thankful for the opportunity to speak to this urgent and sad debate, which concerns the horrific murder of Ronan Kerr, a young PSNI officer.  I offer my deepest and most sincere sympathy to his mother, brothers and sister, as well as his family and close friends.  It was a nightmare for young Ronan's family that he should die in such a way.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Before I discuss the political and policing aspects of his death it is essential to state we should never forget the human aspects of the tragedy and the hurt for his family.  They will never get over it and, like many victims of the Troubles and of violence, their pain and hurt will continue for a long time.  It is a sad day for the whole country to see such a young man's life wasted.  Those of us who strongly support Irish unity and independence totally reject such attacks.  They are wrong and have no support from the vast majority of the people.  It is important that the Kerr family know that in their hour of need and deep sadness.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">I commend the GAA on its brave stand yesterday in speaking out on this horrific murder.  It was fair, decent and right, and showed leadership when it was needed.  I also commend the leadership of Sinn Féin, particularly that of Deputy Gerry Adams today in his decisive and strong statement on Ronan Kerr's murder.  We need that kind of leadership in this country concerning opposition to violence when there is a political path wide open to all people on the island.  The people of this country want to solve our political problems by peaceful and democratic means.  If one is not happy with the lot of the political scene — I am such a person  — one can join a political party or become an Independent Deputy or councillor, put one's name forward, fight for one's political corner and bring change to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">There are indeed choices and options.  However, the blowing up of young Ronan Kerr was no such option and must be challenged in today's debate.  The Good Friday Agreement is about accommodating difference and diversity, about bringing forward republican principles that are in line with the teachings of Tone and Connolly.  It is about equality and respect.  Saturday's killing was not about equality and respect.  I belong to the Technical Group, a group of 16 Deputies who have strong differences on policy and political matters but are all united Irish men and women in the tradition of Tone and Connolly, uniting Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter.  That is the way forward for Irish politics and for the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">On the issue of policing I accept there must be major changes.  The police force in the North must prove itself to be neutral and independent of politics.  There has been a very sad history in that respect.  Men and women in the police force must earn the respect of the community.  Ronan was one of the 30% of Catholics who now make up the force.  I strongly support all the parties which want to push up that figure.  However, the Southern parties must change too and must actively support the peace process.  All Members of this House and of the Northern Assembly must be guardians of the peace process.  Otherwise there will be more Ronan Kerrs — that is the sad reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">Again, I commend Deputy Gerry Adams.  He was right to say all of us must make politics work and prove these people wrong.  That is the essential point.  It is not a time for sitting on the fence.  We owe it to victims like Ronan Kerr.  I reiterate my sincere sympathy to Nuala Kerr and all her family.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_179">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_523">On behalf of the People Before Profit Alliance, I condemn outright the pointless, cowardly murder of Ronan Kerr.  We wish to send our deepest condolences to Ronan's mother and family who have shown great courage in what must be one of the most difficult times of their lives and one of their darkest hours of grief.  This was a horrendous act and has really shocked the nation.  Over the past few days many people have said to me, "What are we going back to?  What are we facing into? We don't want this".</p>
          <p eId="para_524">What has been termed a military campaign to drive the British out is doomed to failure.  Thirty years of the Troubles demonstrated that such a campaign, based on the support of a section of the community and implacably opposed by the rest of it, could not succeed and was a failure.  A so-called campaign with no support is pointless and any murder connected with it is despicable.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">I note the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has called a solidarity rally in Belfast tomorrow and has asked for widespread support from trade unionists, working and unemployed people for this initiative.  Such actions by trade unions have been decisive in the past in pulling Northern Ireland back from the brink and expressing solidarity towards families and communities as well as expressing opposition to murder.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">We believe sincerely that unity of working people is the only way forward to achieve a lasting solution to the national question on this island.  Peace must be linked to social and economic equality in the lives of the majority of people both North and South.  Actions which divide working people and raise sectarian tensions are an obstacle to achieving that solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">To Ronan's family and friends and the wider community I reiterate our sincere sympathy and our absolute condemnation of his murder.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LukeMingFlanagan" eId="spk_180">
          <from>Deputy Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_528">It is very sad to have to stand and talk about this matter.  We had all hoped it was a thing of the past but obviously there are people who are determined it should not be.  I am a parent as are many of those present.  The fear of every parent is of getting a telephone call some day with bad news.  That is what Nuala Kerr had to face last Saturday.  It is hard enough to lose somebody connected to oneself through disease or a car crash but one must try to deal with that situation.  However, the thought of having to deal with a telephone call telling one one's son has been blown up must be phenomenally difficult to handle.  On behalf of the people of south Leitrim and Roscommon, on my behalf and that of my family, I wish to offer condolences to the family of Constable Kerr.  He chose a path in life which was the right one and he was doing the right thing but unfortunately there were people who had a problem with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">I condemn those whom I had intended to call animals.  However, I have a dog at home and he never behaved like that.  Trying to pick an adjective or superlative to describe the people who carried out this act is impossible.  It is just horrible.  Out of everything, however, one must try to take some hope and see some light.  Some has emerged and to me the most striking was the minute's silence held at the Tyrone-Kildare game.  It is not easy to keep a crowd of that size quiet, no matter what the occasion may be, but according to <i>The Irish Times</i> the people at the game observed the silence impeccably which shows there is some hope.  There is massive hope in the condemnation of this act from all sides of the political divide in Northern Ireland.  It was absolutely brilliant to hear the condemnation from Sinn Féin and from all political parties.  We must take a little bit of hope from that.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">Over the coming days my thoughts and those of people I know will be with Mrs. Kerr and her family.  They will never get over this but I hope they know the people of the Republic of Ireland are on their side and that we do not agree with what happened.  I do not believe there is anybody left in the Twenty-six Counties who does agree with it.  My thoughts are with the family.  I hope I will not have to stand up in this Chamber to talk about anything of this kind in the future.  That would be good.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_181">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_531">The death of Constable Ronan Kerr in Omagh last week came as a shock, not only to his family and friends and his workmates, but to all right-thinking people who were shocked because of the motivation of those who carried out this evil deed.  I cannot help but notice there is a much more sombre mood in the House today which I believe has a direct relationship to the terrible atrocity that happened on Saturday.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">There is an acceptance that we simply cannot go back to the past.  This was an act that would have us do just that.  We cannot see another generation scarred in the same way we saw generations scarred during the years of the Troubles.  We know this is what will occur unless it stops right here and now.  Nuala Kerr, Ronan's mother, has asked that her son's death not be in vain.  That request must be respected and supported in any way possible by the State.  Her appeal was made on mothers' day, which should have been a day to celebrate with her son and the rest of her family but his life was cruelly and painfully cut short.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">As news filtered out, and it was a few hours before it was clear what had happened, it did not occur to me to wonder about the religious faith of this young man.  From a practical point of view, however, that mattered to those who carried out the atrocity because they do not want a shared peace.  They are a tiny minority who must be completely isolated.  People must come forward with any information they might have.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">If evidence is needed of the progress that has been made over the years in the peace process, the statement by the Ulster Council of the GAA was it.  The GAA was set up as part of the Gaelic revival of the 19th century and the GAA statement would not have been considered possible just a few short years ago when police officers were banned from playing Gaelic games, Catholics did not join the police and religion and policing were intertwined.  Those have all changed, and we should celebrate that.  We must not and cannot return to those days.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">I express my sympathies to the Kerr family on the loss of a son and a brother, to his friends and to the PSNI on the loss of a colleague.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_182">
          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
          <p eId="para_536">I want to begin my remarks by echoing the words of sympathy of the Taoiseach and others to the family of Constable Ronan Kerr.  This is a terrible tragedy; terrible for his mother Nuala, terrible for Cathair, Dairine and Aaron, terrible for his community, for his colleagues North and South, and terrible for all of us on this island.  We have been here before in this House, many times, but the contemplation of criminal terrorism never gets any easier.  Two years ago we mourned the deaths of Constable Stephen Carroll and of the two young soldiers, Mark Quinsey and Patrick Azimkar.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Ronan Kerr was a young Catholic man whose only wish was to serve his community.  That he chose to do so by joining the Police Service of Northern Ireland is a sign of how far the people of Northern Ireland have embraced hope.  That he now lies dead is a sign of the despair into which these criminal terrorists wish to drag us.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">As of yet there has been no claim of responsibility for this attack.  So-called "dissident republicans" have been blamed.  I say "so-called" because these groups debase both words.  Historically, the term "dissident" was a badge of honour for those who opposed tyranny.  These people, however, are dissenting from democracy itself.  Their campaign of violence is designed to set at nothing the will of the Irish people.  Other Members have today made similar comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">Respect for democracy is fundamental to true republicanism.  The perpetrators of this attack need to ask themselves who exactly they represent.  At what point did their confused, totalitarian form of supposed republicanism become so perverted, so dogmatic, that its total rejection by their fellow countrymen and women became irrelevant?</p>
          <p eId="para_540">In reality, the people who make up these groups are no more than criminal terrorists, whose activities are often inextricably linked with organised crime.  While it is right that we in this House, on behalf of the people we represent, express our condemnation as strongly as we can, the unpalatable fact is that the people involved in these acts have so far proved impervious to the appeals of people from all backgrounds to stop the violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">It is important, therefore, that we offer reassurance that the forces of law and order are doing everything possible, within the rule of law, to take on this threat.  The Garda Commissioner yesterday briefed us fully on the security situation and on the steps being taken, in concert with the PSNI, to counteract terrorist activities and to assist in the investigation of this crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">The Garda Síochána is constantly engaged in an intensive anti- and counter-terrorist effort against these organisations.  It is of course the case that the range of measures made available to the gardaí to counter terrorist activity, including for example the powers available under the original Offences Against the State Acts, including the use of the Special Criminal Court, have been retained.  I will be asking the House soon to renew the provisions of the legislation enacted after the earlier atrocity in Omagh in 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">The gardaí are using these measures wherever appropriate to do so.  Over the last 18 months, around 100 people have been arrested in connection with such activities.  Currently, 43 people are charged before the Special Criminal Court and 54 people are imprisoned having been convicted of offences relating to terrorist activity.  Let me put it as plainly as I can: we will stop at nothing, within the rule of law, to defeat these groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">I can also tell the House that I spoke with Northern Ireland Minister of Justice David Ford last Saturday, very shortly after the dreadful atrocity took place, and later that night with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  I expressed my sympathy to them for the loss of this young officer.  I also reiterated the Government's commitment to supporting the Chief Constable and his officers, not just in the investigation into this tragedy, but in general.  I know that I speak for the Garda Commissioner in saying that we stand foursquare behind the PSNI.  In this regard I can do no better than to quote the Commissioner himself, who, after speaking to Chief Constable Baggott on Saturday, stated that the two police forces on this island are bound together by a shared resolve and determination to bring those responsible for this crime to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">As the House knows, the honour of being Minister with responsibility for the Garda Síochána, and for the security of the State, has been mine for only a short time.  One of my first actions was to travel to Belfast to meet with the northern Minister of Justice, David Ford.  The Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI accompanied us to that meeting and shared a frank assessment of the threat posed by the small number of criminal terrorists who continue to operate in both jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">I was struck at that meeting by the obvious closeness of the relationship between the two police forces on this island, and the obvious commitment of the Commissioner and Chief Constable to working together.  While security cooperation remains and must remain a particular priority — a fact brought into stark focus by the tragic death of Constable Kerr — it is clear to me that this commitment to work together extends to cover the full range of police work.  The excellent relationship which exists between the two police forces has not arisen by accident and no-one should underestimate the efforts that have gone into getting us to where we are. As Minister I am now in a position to see at close quarters, and to support, the hard work and dedication that is necessary to make such a relationship work, and the abundance of goodwill between the two police forces which provides the base upon which good cooperation can be built and maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">One embodiment of this is the recent publication of the first formal cross-Border policing strategy.  This new strategy shows the breadth of cooperation that exists and the determination of both police forces to use all the tools available to them to ensure that those who would seek to exploit the Border for criminal and terrorist purposes will not succeed.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">The House should be in no doubt about the extent of the involvement of these groups in a range of criminal activities, including robbery, extortion, smuggling and kidnapping.  To put it simply, on one side of the equation lies democracy, the Good Friday Agreement and the clearly-expressed desire for peace of the majority of the people of Ireland, and of every political party represented in the Oireachtas and at Stormont; on the other side lies a small number of unreconstructed criminal terrorists who appear to believe that robbery and kidnapping are legitimate steps on the road to Irish unity.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The people who carried out this barbaric attack have no coherent political position, no points of principle that any decent person could recognise.  All they seem to believe in is the death of fellow Irishmen and women.  Let us be clear about it in the context of what occurred at the weekend; this was killing for killing's sake.  That they claim to carry out these attacks in the name of the Irish people, the same people who have roundly and categorically rejected them, is quite frankly sickening.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">I say it again, the idea that the so-called dissidents are dissenting from is called democracy.  There could be no greater contrast between the cowardly futility which these groups display and the brave words of Ronan Kerr's mother, Nuala, when, at a time of unbearable grief, she concentrated on doing good for the community, just as her son tried to do.  If anyone who was involved in this killing had any remaining ounce of humanity they would have hung their heads in shame when they heard Nuala Kerr's words.  She said, "We were so proud of Ronan and all that he stood for."  So are we in this House.  She said, "Do not let his death be in vain."  It will not be.  It has made us all the stronger in our determination that the evil behind it will not prevail.  It has made us stronger in our determination that democracy will prevail and that peace on this island will be maintained.</p>

          <from>Deputy Niall Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_551">I dtús báire, ba mhaith liom dúnmharú Rónán Kerr a cháineadh.  Ní éireoidh leis mar tá dúil ag muintir na hÉireann síochán sa tír seo a neartú.  I offer my condolences to the family of constable Ronan Kerr, to his mother, Nuala, his sister, Dairine, and his brothers, Cathair and Aaron.  This is a horrible nightmare for any family to go through, especially a family which only recently suffered the heartbreak of losing a loved one; Ronan's father, Brian who passed way away two years ago.  In particular, I pay tribute to Nuala Kerr for the manner in which she has spoken about her son's death.  Urging other young Catholics not to be deterred from joining the Police Service of Northern Ireland she stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_552">we are striving for a neutral police force for the good of our country, and I urge all Catholic members not to be deterred by this.  We all need to stand up and be counted and to strive for equality.  We don't want to go back into the dark days again of fear and terror.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">It never ceases to amaze me how some people manage to provide inspiration at a time when they have been rocked by grief and tragedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">Constable Kerr had been in the force only for a few weeks when he was killed but it was clear that he had already left an indelible impression on his colleagues.  The PSNI Chief Constable, Matt Baggott, described him as a modern-day hero.  His decision to join the PSNI was a testament to his courage and to the strength of the peace process.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">It is difficult to find words to express the horror and revulsion caused by the murder of this brave young man, committed to protecting his community.  Civic, religious and political leaders have all come together to condemn this atrocity.  However, a picture is worth 1,000 words.  The sight of senior and local members of the GAA gathered together at constable Kerr's Beragh Red Knights club yesterday sent a powerful message to those responsible for Ronan Kerr's murder to the effect that their acts would not be tolerated.  The chairman of the Beragh club, Gearóid Ó Treasaigh, described Ronan Kerr as "a Catholic, an Irishman and a Gael, who joined the PSNI because he wanted to play his part in making our society a better place".  Perhaps the Ulster GAA president, Aogán Ó Fearghaíl put it best when he stated: "when one of our members is attacked, and when our communities are attacked, we are all attacked".</p>
          <p eId="para_556">As well as the Kerr family, my thoughts are with the people of Omagh at this difficult time.  In the words of Michael Gallagher, who lost his 21 year old son in the Real IRA blast which killed 29 people and unborn twins in 1998, Ronan Kerr's murder is a "double insult" to the town of Omagh.  That Omagh should once again become the backdrop to another atrocity is unspeakable.  Just as the community thought they had put their worst days behind them, they find themselves confronted by more horror.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">Apart from its cruelty, one of the most striking things about the murder of Ronan Kerr is its absolute futility.  It appears these dissidents believe that by targeting Catholic members of the PSNI young men will seek to leave the service while other young Catholics will be deterred from joining the force in the first place.  Ronan Kerr was proof that this strategy will not work.  The murder of police constable Stephen Carroll two years ago and the maiming of Peadar Heffron, not to mention the other attempted attacks such as the attack on a woman officer in Kilkeel, County Down, last August, did not deter Ronan from joining.  These atrocities did not weaken the resolve of the community and the police force then and they will not do so now.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Figures show that Catholic participation has been increasing at a steady pace since the PSNI was formed in 2001.  As the First Minister, Peter Robinson, stated at the press conference at Stormont yesterday, "all they have done is strengthen the institutions that we have, unite our community, bring politicians closer together, and make sure there is a united response in support of the PSNI".  The press conference yesterday at which the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, First Minister, Peter Robinson, the Minister for Justice, David Ford and the PSNI Chief Constable, Matt Baggott, all stood shoulder to shoulder further underlines the futility of the dissidents' strategy.  The murder of Stephen Carroll prompted a similar press conference as well as widespread condemnation.  Why do these dissidents believe it will be any different this time?  How can these people believe they have any real support among the community?  Do they really believe their strategy will work?  The murder of constable Kerr should not be interpreted as a sign that the peace process is faltering but that it is working well, too well for those who oppose it.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">While we express our sympathy to the family of Ronan Kerr and our condemnation of his murder, the best way to stand up to those responsible is to ensure they are brought before the courts of justice.  The only way to achieve this is through the provision of information to the police authorities.  I echo the calls of the PSNI and the Garda Síochána for anyone with information to come forward.  This is an opportunity for people to stand up to the dissidents.  I understand that people are scared to come forward.  In my constituency in Limerick I have seen how fear can be instilled in a community by those who believe they are above the law.  However, those who are afraid should be reminded that they can provide information anonymously.  I welcome the fact that Crimestoppers announced today that it is offering a £50,000 reward for information that will help detectives catch Ronan Kerr's killers.  It is heartening that following the murder of Stephen Carroll in March 2009, the community came forward with information and it seems a court case may be underway in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">A further concerning aspect is the increased sophistication of the dissidents.  It appears their bomb making and engineering capabilities have improved significantly.  The PSNI has described as substantial the device that killed Constable Kerr.  There is a concern that dissidents are using under-car bombs which are miniature in nature and more difficult to detect.  The PSNI is currently examining evidence from the bombing at the weekend and more information will be available in time.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Faced with the growing capabilities of the dissidents, it is important that co-operation between the police forces and justice Departments North and South is maintained at the unprecedented level set by the previous Government.  According to media reports, Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, and PSNI Chief Constable, Matt Baggott, are liaising closely, while anti-terrorist officers from both police forces are working together in an effort to identify the bombers as well.  The words of the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, during the weekend should leave people in no doubt as to the level of co-operation between the two forces.  He stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_562">we in An Garda Síochána stand together with our colleagues in the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  Our uniforms may be woven from different cloth, but the police on this island are bound together by a shared resolve and determination to bring those responsible for this senseless crime to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">As recently as last November, the second formal meeting of the cross-Border criminal justice ministerial group, under the auspices of the intergovernmental agreement on co-operation on criminal justice matters, was held in Dublin.  The intergovernmental agreement provides a framework for co-operation on criminal justice matters and provides for at least one ministerial meeting per year between the Ministers North and South who receive reports from a working group made up of senior officials from both jurisdictions.  At this meeting the Northern Ireland Justice Minister David Ford stated: "Co-operation between criminal justice organisations on both sides of the Border has never been better."  He also pointed out that there is "good day-to-day co-operation across the criminal justice system".  Following his first official meeting with his Northern counterpart last month, the new Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, paid tribute to the excellent relations between the two police forces, stating that he was "struck by the high level of cooperation taking place".  I urge the new Government to continue to support the ever improving relationship between the two forces and I trust this will be matched by a determination at political level to facilitate co-operation in every way possible.  I conclude by expressing once again my absolute revulsion at the futile and cold blooded murder of Constable Ronan Kerr.  My thoughts and prayers are with the Kerr family at this very difficult time.</p>

          <p eId="para_564">I wish to share time with four minutes each for Deputy Griffin and I and two minutes for my constituency colleague, Deputy Seán Conlan.  I take this opportunity to offer my sincere condolences to Nuala, Ronan's mother, to Cathair, Aaron and Dairine.  They lost a son, a brother and a friend and the PSNI has lost an excellent officer.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.  At 4 p.m. last Saturday, the PSNI lost one of its newest members, 25 year old constable Ronan Kerr.  Ronan was in the service only for a few months when his life was cruelly taken from him in a barbaric act by individuals who can only be described as enemies of peace.  The bomb was the size of a lunch box and weighed 500g but it was enough to fatally injure the young constable.  As a representative of a Border county, I can say without hesitation that this heinous act has been met with abhorrence across the Border, North and South.  The actions and views of the individuals who carried out this attack do not represent the feelings of the majority of people in the North or in the South.  A Facebook page dedicated to the memory of Ronan has already attracted more than 24,000 people.  That is an indication of the level of condemnation of the atrocity by members of the wider public.  Young Unionists and republicans in Northern Ireland wear their PSNI uniforms with pride, and rightly so, as they represent all that is positive about the ethos of the Good Friday Agreement and the continual striving for peace in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">The Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_566">Those who carried it out want to drag us back to the misery and pain of the past.  They are acting in defiance of the Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">I fully endorse that statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Those who carried out this crime have no place in the future of either Northern Ireland or the continuing work that is being done by the peace process.  They betrayed their community and those who have strived for peace in the North for decades and in recent years.  They will not and must not succeed in quenching the democratic will of the people of the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">Dr. Séamus Hegarty, Bishop of Derry, has pleaded with any young Catholic person considering joining the PSNI not to be deterred from serving the public and his or her community.  We must do everything in our power to prevent us going backwards.  The radical ideas of the past do not reflect a united vision for the future, which is what we need.  The peace process got its ultimate endorsement in the massive endorsement, North and South, of the Good Friday Agreement.  This Agreement needs to be constantly worked on at community level.   It needs an exchange of visits between people North and South, an interaction by communities and schools, further injecting of moneys and the building of communities North and South.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">The best and ultimate tribute we can pay to Constable Kerr is that we will work for peace, build peace in our own communities and build links between the North and the South.  A start has been made this evening and working to build peace is the ultimate tribute in how we can best respect the memory of Constable Kerr.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Griffin</from>
          <p eId="para_571">The cruel murder of Constable Ronan Kerr in Omagh on Saturday has once again reminded us of the need to convey the pointlessness of violence as a means of political change on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">Ronan Kerr, like myself, was a child of the 1980s, a decade that saw some horrendous atrocities carried out on this island in the name of one cause or another.  We children born in the 1980s are the youngest who can still recall the darkness and despair of the Troubles.  Ronan Kerr would have been eight years old when the first IRA ceasefire was announced in August 1994 and was 12 when the real IRA bombed his hometown of Omagh killing 29 innocent people and unborn twins in 1998.  The children of the 1980s hope that we are the last to witness the depravity that has plagued this island for decades.  It is our hope that those born after the 1980s will never see what we can still recall from our childhood.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">Ronan Kerr was one of us and from what I have learned in the past three days he was a patriot and a man who believed in the rule of law, fairness and equality.  It is galling that we are once again visited with the shock, sadness and outrage of an honourable man slain in the course of his duty to his community.  Will those who were responsible for this despicable act of cowardice ever learn that such actions achieve no good for anyone of any ideology, religious persuasion or background?</p>
          <p eId="para_574">On my way from Kerry to Dublin this morning I paused briefly at the memorial plaque in honour of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe in Adare.  As I read the plaque I thought how pointless was his murder and how sad it is that such pointless acts are still occurring on this island at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">There is no popular desire on this island to return to the horror and sadness of the past.  The youngest generation on this island wish to live their lives free of the savagery of the past.  Those who cannot recall are well aware of the hurt, agony and pain of the Troubles.  However, those who are not aware must be reminded.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">It is with huge regret that in my maiden speech in Dáil Éireann I offer my condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of Constable Ronan Kerr.  Let his death be the last such death on this island.</p>

          <p eId="para_577">I wish to express my sincere condolences to the family of Ronan Kerr.  This is a great tragedy for the Kerr family and for the people of Northern Ireland.  I want to state clearly that the majority of the people along the Border do not share the views of the people who carried out this act.  It achieves nothing.  It does not bring a united Ireland one day closer.  It was a futile act.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">I know that Ronan spent some of his childhood visiting his relatives in County Monaghan.  Along with Border people I was in Beragh yesterday evening.  What has happened is a disgrace.  I hope if one thing is learned from this it is the futility of what has happened.  We can never go back to the days of the past when these events happened on a regular basis.  It serves no purpose.  Nobody wants it.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">I express my sympathy on behalf of my constituents and the people of County Monaghan on the death of Ronan.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</from>
          <p eId="para_581">I will be mindful of the clock.  I join in the expressions of sympathy to the Kerr family at this dark and traumatic time for them.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends and colleagues of this young police officer.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">Ronan was just 25 when he joined the new policing service in the North of Ireland last May.  In a spirit of public service he joined the PSNI to both protect and serve the community and to define and create a better future in a peaceful and equal society.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">Ronan represented a new generation of Irish youth.  I call them the peace process generation, a generation eager for change, filled with belief and confidence and ready to take on the challenge, however great, to achieve that change, a generation determined to draw a line under the past with its conflict and injustices and to create a new Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">The many public tributes to Ronan give us the measure of the man.  A beloved son and brother, a respected member of his local  community and a member of the GAA from the age of five and through his club, Beragh Red Knights, he made a significant contribution to Gaelic sports and culture.  His death is a huge loss to his club, community and county of Tyrone.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">Those individuals who orchestrated and carried out this act offer nothing — no direction, no hope and no regard for republican values, which they have  sought to debase through Ronan's murder.  They have betrayed the community.  They set themselves above and against the will of the people of Ireland.  No cause is served by their actions.  There can be no shelter or succour given to the perpetrators of this act.  There is no rationale or excuse — such as that of misguided loyalties — to prevent anything other than full co-operation with the PSNI and the Garda Síochána in their pursuit of those individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">The efforts of a small group of people to promote division and conflict will fail.  They will not thwart our determination to bring about political change, they will not blunt the people's demand for a new Ireland and they will not subvert republicanism for their own narrow selfish ends because we will not allow them to do so.  The process of peace-building will continue.  The Sinn Féin position in respect of this killing and all other such actions is unequivocal: our condemnation is absolute.  All attacks of this nature are wrong and cannot be justified.  Sinn Féin supports the efforts of the police service in bringing those responsible before the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">The North has changed and continues to change.  The new political dispensation, so painstakingly and courageously built over a long period, is supported by the majority of citizens across Ireland.  A new era, with a new civic and accountable policing service, is a key component of this.  Young Nationalists and republicans must continue to take their place in the PSNI.  We, as politicians, have an obligation to ensure this remains possible.  That makes it all the more urgent that the Government should address with the British authorities their unilateral decision to remove the 50-50 recruitment relating to the PSNI.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">Our political direction can be only forward.  There will be no return to the past.  The war is over.  People across Ireland, particularly those in County Tyrone, are very angry.  Today, we condemn the murder of Constable Ronan Kerr and we unite in solidarity with his heartbroken family.  However, we must do more than that.  Rhetoric is not enough.  Horror and revulsion, though understandable, are also not sufficient.  The peace process, the process of power-sharing and the all-Ireland political institutions must be defended.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">I am heartened by the Taoiseach's commitment to defend the peace process and to ensure the full implementation of the British-Irish Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement.  He must live up to that commitment.  The Minister for Justice and Equality and everyone else must understand that it is the political process and the triumph of democracy which will see off these fringe and minority elements who have turned their face against the peace process.  Irish republicans have charted a peaceful and a democratic path to Irish unity.  They have been architects of the peace process and they will defend it against all comers.</p>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
          <p eId="para_591">As a previous speaker stated, this is the type of discussion in which we had hoped we would never be obliged to engage again in the House.  I join Members from all parties in turning my thoughts to Ronan Kerr and his grieving family.  We offer our profound sympathy to Ronan's family, his friends and the PSNI on the loss of a beloved son, brother, friend and colleague.  Members all share the sense of loss.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Ronan Kerr was a young and public-spirited man.  On Saturday last, the evil actions of a few deprived the people of this island of a fine Irishman and a committed public servant, a policeman who sought to devote himself to the protection and well-being of his community.  His murderers robbed Ronan of his life.  They robbed Ronan's mother of her son and the happiness that had come with seeing her child grow to maturity and fulfilment.  The individuals to whom I refer robbed Ronan's brothers and sister of the love and companionship of their big brother.  However, they also robbed every one of us on this island of the potential which Ronan's life held and all that his life might have been.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">We in this House stand together to make clear our absolute condemnation of this crime and of those who committed it.  The unity of the message which has come from those on all sides of the Chamber is unsurprising and reflects the genuine shock, sorrow and disbelief of those we represent that such an atrocity should occur.  We stand together with people from all sides of the community in Northern Ireland and with their elected representatives.  Once again they have shown their strength of purpose and their determination to preserve and protect the peace which has been achieved on our island.  Once again this House has shown its determination to work tirelessly to ensure this island which we all share will have an ever hopeful future and that we will not be dragged back to the violence of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">On Sunday last I spoke to the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, MLA, and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, MLA, and I am aware that the shared sense of purpose, North and South, is deeply valued.  I also spoke to the Secretary of State, Mr. Owen Paterson, on Saturday last.  As co-guarantors of the British-Irish Agreement, the Irish and British Governments will continue to work together to support the Executive in order to ensure that the potential of the Agreement for a shared and better future will be fully realised.  This tiny minority, without conscience or mandate, will not be allowed to deflect or deter the work of a generation of Irish men and women.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Ronan Kerr chose to build a career in a transformed police service increasingly representative of the entire community and supported across the political spectrum.  It is this very openness — this positive change — that Ronan's murderers fear.  As a result, they seek to deny change through callous acts of violence and intimidation.  However, they will not succeed because the ordinary men and women of this island will not allow them to do so.  We will not be bullied back down the blind alleys of the past.  We the people of Ireland, North and South, set our course for change when we adopted the British-Irish Agreement.  We opted for peace, reconciliation and a shared future within agreed political structures.  We took our decision democratically, through the ballot box — that most definitive, effective and enduring of all political weapons.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">I join Ronan's brave mother, Nuala, in her call for us all to "stand up and be counted".  We will stand up together, whether northerner, southerner, Nationalist, republican, Unionist, loyalist, Catholic, Protestant or none of the above.  We will stand up together for peace for ourselves and our children, for justice for Ronan Kerr's family and in support of the men and women in the PSNI and the Garda Síochána.  I join all of those who have called on anyone with information about Ronan's murder to contact their local police force.  I echo the Kerr family's message to Catholic and Nationalist members of the PSNI not to be deterred by this attack.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">On behalf of the Government, I encourage men and women on all sides of the community in Northern Ireland, but particularly those from the Nationalist and republican traditions, to continue to apply to join the PSNI — their own police force, an Irish police force — in ever-increasing numbers.  I encourage their families and their communities to support them and to be rightly proud of any son or daughter who wishes to play his or her part in assisting and protecting their fellow citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Those who murdered Ronan will undoubtedly attempt to style themselves as republicans fighting for Ireland.  It is difficult to express the anger and sadness which such a claim evokes in any genuine patriot.  To commit violent acts in direct contravention of the democratically expressed will of the people of all 32 counties of the island is perverse.  To claim to be opposing British rule by seeking to undermine the constitutional and political settlement freely chosen by the people of Ireland — and them alone — is absurd.  To assert that the goal is a united Ireland when every action aims to divide is illogical.  What is the Ireland these people seek to build?  I have no answer and neither do they.  They can only destroy, maim and frighten and have not the stomach or the skills for the real work of nation building.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">Those of us who truly aspire to unite all the people of this island, in all the diversity of their identities and traditions, know the path.  It is one of peaceful means, compromise and political persuasion.  It is neither glamorous nor quick but it is true patriotism.  True republicanism does not seek glory or expedience but looks to the national interest and to the good of the citizen.  Constable Ronan Kerr epitomised many of the ideals of our republic.  We will not allow those who murdered him to besmirch the name of Ireland or its citizens by wrapping a green flag around their shameful act.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">I have seen at first hand the deep well of goodwill and support for the peace process that exists beyond these islands, and particularly in the United States of America.  Secretary of State Clinton and the Friends of Ireland congressional group have condemned the murder of Ronan Kerr in the strongest terms and made clear their unstinting support for Northern Ireland's political leadership and the peace process.  I draw the attention of the House to the words of Congressman Richard E. Neal who, I believe, perfectly captures the feelings of Irish people at home and abroad.  He stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_601">Those responsible for this murder are cowards.  If these criminals think they are going to turn back the clock and stop the change that is happening across Northern Ireland they are mistaken.  They have no support on the island of Ireland and they have no support in the United States of America.  Quite simply, they are on the wrong side of history and they must be brought to justice.  The overwhelming majority of the people in Northern Ireland support the democratic institutions and want peace and reconciliation.  The United States supports their hopes and aspirations during this sad and difficult hour.  We will continue to stand with them as they work together to transform their society and to build a shared future.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">This evening, all of us in this House have expressed that willingness to stand together.  I note the comments of Deputy Martin, who said we want to send a clear message.  I thank him for his support of the Government in any measure needed to combat those who are responsible.  Earlier today, Deputy Martin and others proposed that an all-Party motion be tabled.  I understand arrangements are being made to do that tomorrow.  A draft is in circulation and I think it will be agreed formally.  It will express the unanimous and strong views of the House condemning the murder of Ronan Kerr, expressing our sympathy with his family, friends and colleagues and calling for those responsible to be brought to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">I listened to the contribution of Deputy Adams, who also unequivocally condemned the murder.  I heard his comments recalling his party's offer to meet some of the groups who reject the Good Friday Agreement.  That offer is helpful and should be supported.  There can be no doubt of where Deputy Adams stands on this issue.  I heard his comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">It is clear that the House strongly and unanimously condemns this murder and supports the efforts of the PSNI and the Garda Síochána in bringing those responsible to justice.  I expect that, tomorrow morning, we will agree the motion reflecting those sentiments.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_612">there is widespread and justified outrage felt among very wide layers of Irish society that ordinary citizens, and most particularly those on low and middle incomes and the vulnerable in our society, are being forced to pay for the speculation and gambling of bankers, bondholders and developers by way of swingeing cutbacks and austerity;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_613">a wide body of civic, political and expert opinion, both nationally and internationally, believes that the debt burden arising from the bank bailout, the EU-IMF package, and the conditions attached to the package in the memorandum of understanding, are economically unsustainable or potentially will become so, and will damage rather than enhance our country's prospects for future economic growth;</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_621">My apologies, I did not see Deputy Keaveney.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">I appeal to the Government to withdraw its amendment to the motion and allow, as the motion calls for, a referendum to be held on the continuing bailout of the banks and the EU-IMF deal.  The Government will be aware, as is I am sure everyone in the country, that we are facing the most grave economic crisis in the history of the State.  Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs, while tens of thousands have been forced to emigrate.  Brutal austerity measures are being imposed on ordinary families, working people and the poor and vulnerable in Irish society whose incomes have been savaged, while services have been cut.  Many families are threatened with repossession of their homes.  People are not able to pay their bills or make ends meet.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">It is important to point out that the people suffering the consequences of this austerity which is being dictated by the IMF are not bankers or speculators but individuals who have worked and reared families and are now trying to enjoy their old age.  They did not cause the crisis, yet they are being asked to pay for the criminal greed of bankers and speculators.  This is often obscured in technical economic argument.  It is often suggested this is a complicated matter, one above the heads of ordinary people.  However, it is a simple one.  It is about whether ordinary working people, families, communities and the vulnerable in our society, including the young and the old, should pay for the crisis created by the reckless gambling and speculation of bankers and bondholders or whether the bankers and bondholders who caused it should pay for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">Before entering government, Fine Gael and the Labour Party were unequivocal about on which side of the debate they stood.  In February Fine Gael stated it was morally wrong and economically unsustainable to ask the people to beggar themselves to enrich speculators and profiteers.  What has changed?  With another €24 billion being pumped into the banks, the case for saying we should not beggar ordinary citizens country to enrich bankers and speculators is even greater than it was when Fine Gael made that statement.  If it was morally wrong and economically unsustainable to pour €46 billion into the banks, surely it is even more morally wrong and economically unsustainable to put €70 billion into them.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">It is a pity the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, is not here.  He went further in stating his view of the case when he said for the second time earlier this year that the previous Government was guilty of economic treason for continuing to bail out the banks at a cost to taxpayers.  It is worth quoting what he said: "If your Government [talking about the previous Government] knew that Anglo Irish Bank was insolvent and you asked the Irish taxpayers to bail it out and to pay the cost we are now paying for it that was and is economic treason ... I stand over that."  If it was economic treason to bail out an insolvent bank at the expense of taxpayers, is it even greater economic treason to bail out all of the banks at greater cost to ordinary taxpayers?</p>
          <p eId="para_626">I put to the Government the charge which the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, put to the previous Government, namely, that it is guilty of economic and political treason for saying one thing before the general election and something quite different afterwards and continuing with the same policies.  It is shocking for ordinary people to hear Fine Gael and the Labour Party, given all the rhetoric about change and ohow they would do things differently, sound exactly the same as the previous Government.  They are using the same phrases, justifications and arguments for defending a continuation of the failed policy of bailing out the bankers, speculators and bondholders.  Whenever these points are put to the Government, it states there is no alternative.  We believe there is.  If we were to threaten to default, this would put the ball back in the court of the IMF and the European Union, the ones who are trying to dictate to us who should pay for the banking crisis.  We must put it up to them that if they wish to save the euro and the banks, they should pay for it and unload the cost of so doing onto the banks, bondholders and speculators guilty of causing the crisis in the first instance.  By standing up to them and threatening to default we would at least force the ball back into their court and put it up to them to come with a fair, just and sustainable package to deal with the crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">It is important to point out that other countries have defaulted and that the sky has not fallen in on their heads.  Iceland defaulted.  As a result of campaigning by ordinary people for months, the Icelandic Government was forced to concede default.  The Icelandic people, because they were outraged by the thought of this type of package being imposed on them without their having any say, took to the streets, surrounded their Parliament and demanded a referendum on whether to accept a similar package from the IMF.  In a referendum they voted by a figure of 93% against a similar deal and the sky did not fall in on their heads.  The IMF was forced to consider the outcome of the vote and reduce by a significant amount the interest rate it was charging Iceland.  I am not suggesting that is the end of the story for Iceland, but the referendum outcome forced a change and debate.  Other countries that defaulted, including Ecuador and Argentina, are still alive and kicking.  The sky has not fallen in on their heads.  If we leave the European Union to its own devices, as the Government is proposing to do, it will squeeze us.  It will use the debt burden it is imposing on us to squeeze more concessions out of us in terms of the agenda it is pursuing.  That is clear from what happened in the case of Greece.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">The Government states it will negotiate a 1% reduction in the interest rate charged on this unsustainable package.  To achieve a 1% reduction in the interest rate applied to its loan, Greece had to agree to a €50 billion programme of privatisation.  Will such a programme be the <i> quid pro quo</i> required of the Government in the event that it manages to wangle a tiny concession from the International Monetary Fund and European Union in the forthcoming negotiations?  The Government has already been forced to agree to sell State assets worth €2 billion.  What will the IMF and EU demand at the next round of meetings if they are not satisfied that Ireland is doing enough or believe it will not be able to repay its loans?  What will they seek in return for a small reduction in the interest rate on our loans?  How many more privatisations of State assets will they demand?  How many more cuts in social welfare and the incomes of ordinary people will they require?  Is the Minister aware that at its most recent meeting with the IMF and EU, the Greek Government was told by the IMF-EU representative to start selling beaches and islands.  Is this what the Government wants for Ireland?</p>
          <p eId="para_629">While some of the Technical Group may differ from me on what are the alternatives, there are other options available.  It is unconscionable that the Government refuses to reverse budget cuts which took €6 billion from ordinary people and the vulnerable given that just a few weeks ago we discovered that the 300 richest people in the country are €6.7 billion richer than they were last year.  Why will the Government not consider introducing a wealth tax?  Why will it not even agree that such a tax would be fair?</p>
          <p eId="para_630">While the Government and even some members of the Technical Group will not agree with many of the points I have made, surely they accept that it would be democratic to have a referendum on the bailout.  The purpose of our call for a referendum is to enable people to debate the options and allow everyone to set out their stall in order that the country can make a decision on the issue.  Does the Government not trust people to consider this matter objectively and make the best decision for the country?  This is what democracy and the motion are about.  I ask the Government not to move its amendment and instead allow citizens to vote on the bailout package which will determine their social and economic future for many years to come.</p>

        <speech by="#MaureenOSullivan" eId="spk_195">
          <from>Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_631">If our circumstances were not so serious, I would be tempted to cite the line frequently used in Laurel and Hardy films on this being another fine mess.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">The motion before us is about democracy and allowing citizens to decide what they will pay for the foreseeable future.  The country faces a massive debt.  Notwithstanding the Government's argument that the recent general election was a referendum, the goalposts have been moved because it has made a number of U-turns on the election commitments for which people voted.  For this reason, it is vital that a referendum is held on the bailout.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">Under Article 27 of the Constitution, taking the referendum route to have legislation overturned is onerous.  It is a comment on how we value democracy that the system in place for this option is so complicated, involving as it does a majority of the Seanad and not less than one third of the Dáil petitioning the President if it is considered by them that a Bill contains "a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people thereon ought to be ascertained".  The bailout is an issue of extreme national importance.  The figures suggested by various economists on the cost of the bailout for each citizen are staggering.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">It is difficult to consider this motion separately from the stress tests for banks and bank restructuring plans announced last week.  While newspaper headlines tend to be sensational by nature, some of those that I have read contain an element of truth.  They include such headlines as "Only a miracle can save the financial system from complete meltdown", "Disastrous world of Irish banking", "Ireland has lost the capacity to borrow", "Frankfurt's way prevails as harsh economic reality confronts Noonan", and "Bondholders escape as €24 billion put into the banks".</p>
          <p eId="para_635">I accept that we need money to pay our bills, including salaries, wages and social welfare.  However, given the nature of the terms and conditions of the bank bailout and EU-IMF package, the nation must have a say.  While every citizen will pay, some will pay more than others.  Those who will pay most are the people on lower and middle incomes.  The bailout will not make an appreciable, proportionate difference to the wealthy who live abroad for certain times of the year to avoid paying taxes, disposed of shares just in time or transferred property into the names of family members or out of the country.  The vulnerable and disabled, on the other hand, will pay heavily.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">Senior bankers who held positions of responsibility during the banking bubble and who are now on bank boards remain <i>in situ</i>.  The Financial Regulator announced that he intended to conduct a fitness and probity assessment of all members of bank boards but not until the beginning of next year.  In the meantime, the bankers in question may decide to resign to avoid undergoing such an assessment and will, without doubt, receive extremely lucrative pensions and severance packages should they do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">During Leaders' Questions Deputy Ross asked the Taoiseach a significant question, namely, why private debt has become public debt.  Why has a protective curtain, almost like an iron curtain, come down around the senior bondholders?  The nature of their investment implies risk.  When they made profit on their investments were they pouring money into the State or rewarding it in any way?  When they lost money did they take the loss?  They did not do so because the people of Ireland, who are not being given a say in the matter, did so on their behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">I have read the Government amendment and I accept a radical restructuring of the banking system is necessary to ensure it becomes viable.  The IMF-EU bailout is not the way forward, however, as it is too harsh.  Ireland will not survive by continuing to take emergency loans from the IMF and EU.  In the previous Dáil, I spoke about how IMF actions contributed to the destruction of economies in Africa, Asia and South America.  The measures applied included the imposition of strong limits on public expenditure and the pursuit of excessively strict monetary policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">I welcome the section of the amendment regarding the Government's commitment to protect ordinary depositors.  Its final point on a jobs fund to support employment growth and sustainable enterprise appears paradoxical, however, given that it is juxtapositioned with a reference to the EU-IMF programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">On the most recent capitalisation, I note the statement by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, that it does not score well on fairness.  Fairness would be served if citizens had an opportunity to express a view in a referendum and have their say on whether the EU-IMF agreement will lead the economy on a sustainable path.  When a referendum was put to people in Iceland, it resulted in change.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">The €70 billion price tag of the current crisis makes it one of the costliest crises in history.  Ireland is used to making history for positive reasons, whether through our achievements in sport, the arts or humanitarian work.  I support the motion because it proposes to give people a say in their destiny.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_196">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_642">The Taoiseach claimed the general election was a referendum on the EU-IMF deal and the four year programme put forward by the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government.  If that is the case, the people have spoken by resoundingly rejecting the deal and the programme of the previous Government.  In that case, why is the Government pursuing exactly the same insane policies pursued by the previous Government?</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Everyone knows the current policy cannot and will not work.  Bailing out the banks to the tune of €105 billion effectively means 400,000 workers will pay taxes for their entire working lives to cover the cost of the bailout.  In other words, 20% of the workforce will be enslaved for their entire working lives paying back the debt through their income tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">The amendment refers to breaking the "massive dependence of the banks on the State" and the separation of "bank risk from that of the Sovereign".  This is drivel, as the Government and international money lenders are well aware.  Every time the insane step of pouring billions of euro into sovereign banks is repeated, the risk of sovereign default increases.  The possibility of such a default raises major issues regarding the banks and markets.  First, it will be impossible for the State to exit the EU-IMF deal in 2013 or 2014 and borrow at reasonable rates on conventional money markets.  We will be forced into the 2013 EU bailout package which involves debt restructuring.  This will expose Irish banks which hold €11 billion in Irish sovereign bonds and €11.5 billion in NAMA bonds.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">Second, the banks are reliant on the State guarantee.  Can the Central Bank maintain emergency liquidity funding?</p>
          <p eId="para_646">Third, major questions arise regarding Ireland's ability to grow out of the current crisis.  International patterns indicate that ten years of slow growth is the norm following a banking crisis.  The point is proved by the ten years of zombie banking and economic stagnation experienced by Japan following its banking crisis.  The only way to break the link between the sovereign and bank debt is by renouncing the private debt of the banks.   We should establish a State banking system to take over the assets, boards and workforce, leaving the debts to those who took the risks in their chase for super profits.  This Government came to power on a pledge to renegotiate the IMF-EU deal.  Even the current Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, called it an obscenity.  The Government came to power on a pledge to burn the bondholders and have burden-sharing.  Now we are told that debate is over, but may I ask what debate occurred?  Was it the Taoiseach's chat with Angela Merkel or Nicolas Sarkozy?  Or was it the Minister, Deputy Noonan's, chat with Jean-Claude Trichet?  Was that the debate?  The way to have a debate is to put the matter to the people, which is why I support this motion.  Let the people speak.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_199">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_649">No Fianna Fáil.  Absolutely.  Notable by their absence are those who promised change in Irish politics and Dáil reform, so we have a long way to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">I am grateful to the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on the urgent need for a referendum on the EU-IMF loan package scheme.  Before going into the details, I should highlight the amount of stress that some politicians, senior bankers and developers have caused our people.  They have tortured our citizens and now we are all suffering the consequences.  They have left the poor, the unemployed and others with major economic and social problems, and now we all have to try to clean up the mess.  It was a scandal, a shame and a crime against the people for which those responsible should be jailed.  There should be no fence-sitting on this issue: those people should be charged, prosecuted and jailed.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Our country is being dictated to and controlled by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, not in our interests but in the service of global finance houses.  Our children and future generations have become virtual indentured labour for as long as it takes to pay off the debts of a speculative clique or golden circle that has controlled our country.  They will sell off more and more of our public companies and assets, including our natural resources, in their efforts to pay back money owed to these bankers.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">As people will appreciate, the crisis is not about sovereign debt but has resulted from the socialisation of the private debt of financial institutions and developers.  That is the truth.  Despite it not having been the people's fault, the State — supported by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund — is imposing a continuing transfer of billions of euro in national wealth from the people to domestic and international banks in regressive tax increases, cuts to services, pay cuts, redundancies, an assault on workers' pension entitlements and the National Pension Fund, and through the disposal of national assets.  Far from being sovereign debt, this is the illegitimate and odious debt of a handful of private financial institutions and developers and a corrupt political establishment that was taken on by the State against the people's wishes.  On this most critical issue, the people have not been consulted, which is why I demand a referendum.  Instead, we have suffered a circus of political commentators and so-called experts presented to us by State and private media.  We should face up to the fact that there is not an informed debate going on.  Look who controls many of our national newspapers.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">I commend my colleagues in the technical group for having tabled this motion.  The details show that the bank bailout and the EU-IMF loan package arrangements impose an onerous debt burden on Ireland which will have profound consequences on the economy and society for years to come.  There is widespread and justified outrage across a wide spectrum of Irish society.  There is an overwhelming democratic case for putting the continuing bank bailout and EU-IMF agreement to a referendum, given the profound implications for the economic and social future of our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">The motion "resolves to call a national referendum providing the Irish people the opportunity to accept or reject the bank bailout and the EU-IMF loan package arrangement".  That is what this debate is about.  The technical group is putting it up to the Government and to Fianna Fáil on these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">We have not yet heard about bank staff, many of whom will probably get the boot from their jobs in the next six months.  Low-paid staff in various banks will be affected and there is major concern among them.  I fully support the Unite trade union's campaign to defend jobs and services in the banking sector.  We must also consider what some bankers have done to small businesses.  More than 200,000 jobs in local communities around the State are now being hammered and we may expect 20,000 or 30,000 people to lose their jobs as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">Last week, we saw how the Government — shame on the Labour Party — still supports the universal social charge, which is an unjust and regressive tax.  It is important to highlight these issues.  The Irish people should have the right to decide this issue.  I reject those who say that as we have had an election the current Government has a mandate on this issue.  It does not.  It got a mandate to do the opposite.  It is time for Members of this House to stand up for democracy and for the people, including the unemployed and weaker sections of society.  It is not fair that they should have to suffer the consequences.</p>

        <speech by="#LukeMingFlanagan" eId="spk_201">
          <from>Deputy Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_658">Thank you, sir, but I will not need six minutes because much of what I had planned to say has already been said.  It has also been said by nearly everyone I meet on the street and socially.  They all seem to say the same thing.  Until one is in Government one also seems to say the same thing — that we cannot afford this bailout.  I would not support a referendum on this issue if the Government parties had done what they said they would do.  Labour famously said it was either their way or Frankfurt's way, but they did not put up much of a battle there.  As far as I can understand it, Fine Gael promised us limited burden sharing.  It then copperfastened that by running Mr. Peter Mathews as a candidate, who agrees with nothing it plans as far as I can see.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">The long and short of it is that we cannot afford to do what the Government plans.  Those who claim that we cannot go down this road are told there is no alternative.  There is an alternative, but it will also be difficult.  It is similar to discovering that one has cancer, which leaves a person with two horrible choices.  The first is to face up to the fact and go under the knife, as well as getting chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  One might survive the treatment but there is no guarantee.  That is what defaulting would be; there is no guarantee at the end of it but at least one would have some hope.  The alternative is to ignore the cancer, saying "It'll be all right.  At least you won't have to go to hospital for a year.  You might survive for another year after that and at least you wouldn't have to put up with the pain of the knife".  The pain of death would be much worse, which is what the Government has opted for.  It says it cannot do the right thing because it will be too painful in the short run, but in the long term what the Government plans will cost us much more.  It will cost us the ownership of our forests, rural schools and a decent health service.  It will cost us so much that it will destroy this country.  For that reason I support a referendum on this issue.  I understand it would not be simple to hold a referendum; we would have to do a variety of things for that to happen, but where there is a will there is a way.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">If the Government had done what it said it would do, I would not support a referendum.  We have just had an election and the people had a chance to speak.  The problem is that the people spoke on the basis that Labour and Fine Gael would do something different to what they now plan.  Because of that, we need a referendum.  If it is put before the people — with a choice between supporting the gamblers who took a risk and are now being sorted out by their friends in Europe, or having an extra special needs assistant, or being able to see a urologist for the first time in more than two years — I know what decision they would make.  If the Government is that definite it has made the right choice, why not put it to the people to find whether they will support it on this?  The Government has not put this to them before.  It did not put it to them that it would become the new Fianna Fáil, which is what it has become.  The Government should put the following question to the people, namely, do the people accept it is okay for Fine Gael and the Labour Party to become Fianna Fáil or do they not?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#StephenDonnelly" eId="spk_202">
          <from>Deputy Stephen Donnelly</from>
          <p eId="para_661">The motion before the House is that the Irish people should decide whether they are willing to pay back the private losses of wealthy investors and European banks.  The motion is not that the Irish people should not pay these losses, it is whether they should be given the choice to pay them.  The Government claims the people were given this choice in the recent election.  In the Chamber today, the Taoiseach referred to the large Government majority and the mandate this brought with it.  In regard to paying back the losses of private investors, this is not true.  The people voted for the Government based on what its candidates said during the election, as we heard in the House today.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">Fine Gael previously claimed: "The banks aren't getting another cent.  Anglo Irish Bank is not getting another cent of our money.  Not another cent."  As Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan pointed out, the Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, said that when it came to the banking debt it would be Labour's way or Frankfurt's way.  That is unambiguous language.  Had I voted for either Fine Gael or Labour, which of course I did not, I would have been pretty sure I was voting for a major push-back on the bondholders.  Last week, however, we discovered this was not to be.  We discovered that, when it comes to paying unguaranteed senior bondholders, the new Government's policy is to continue Fianna Fáil's policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">The Government now talks about the Irish people not bearing 100% of the burden — that is the language we hear in this House.  Unfortunately, what the Government is not saying is that the Irish people will instead bear the vast majority of this burden, which is clearly contrary to what the people thought they were voting for.  This is why we need a referendum.  The amounts of money are so big, and the moral argument so abhorrent, that the Irish people have a right to decide.  They thought they were voting for this policy but it has vanished.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">We learned in December last that the previous Government, whose Members are conspicuous by their absence from the Chamber, had already paid back more than €70 billion to bondholders.  We know there is still €35 billion of unguaranteed bonds to be paid, which brings the total to at least €105 billion, or over €80,000 per household.  As we are borrowing that money at 6%, this means every household in Ireland is paying €5,000 a year just to service the interest on these debts.  For the Irish people to pay back €105 billion of private losses would be the equivalent of the French paying €1.3 trillion or the Germans paying €1.6 trillion.  I had a conversation with an MEP during the week who said that if the French people were asked to pay €1.3 trillion of private losses, they would burn down the Champs-Élysées.  Yet, the Irish people are being asked to accept this.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">I believe the Government would prefer not to pay this money.  I believe the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, meant what they said, namely, that they would prefer not to pay it.  Why, therefore, are we doing this?  We understand from Professor Honohan that the Europeans have threatened us because he told us this in an interview last Thursday.  He confirmed that, should we choose not to pay the investment losses of others, "there will be consequences."  He explained that paying the remaining €35 billion was about "expediency and calculation".  This is not a marginal policy decision.  Paying back the remaining €35 billion amounts to a debt of €27,000 for every household in Ireland.  Therefore, what we will be saying to members of the public is that even though they cannot afford petrol for their car, to pay their rent, to service their mortgage or to deal with cuts to disability allowance, we will not help them.  However, if they are foreign billionaires who gambled on Irish banks but should not have, not only will we help them, we will cover their entire loss and pay them profit.  We will pay not just the total amount of the bond but we will pay the interest earned on that bond.  I do not believe that is who we are as a people because it is clearly abhorrent.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">To the best of my knowledge, this type of transfer of public money to private losses has never been undertaken anywhere in the world throughout history.  I cannot figure out why it is happening here.  We know there is no moral argument for this.  The only argument is whether we should pay the money and not have the Europeans threaten us or should we not pay the money and accept the consequences of whatever the Europeans have threatened to do.  Professor Honohan said we have weighed up those options and believe the consequences of what Europe would do to the Irish people are worse and, therefore, we will pay back on the bonds to foreign investors.  I argue, and the reason I support the motion is, that because the money is so big, and the people do not know what these threats are, we have to have an open conversation and decide.  The people of Iceland will decide this Saturday and that is what we should do — a referendum would be democracy in action.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">The Government's counter-proposal to the motion is astonishing.  First, the Government commends itself on its policy, which in regard to the debt is a continuation of Fianna Fáil policy.  Then, it "supports all of the actions necessary for the Irish banking sector to become ... better funded and better capitalised".  While I do not know who wrote that, I presume "all of the actions necessary" includes the servitude of the Irish people.  Let us think about it in this way.  To pay back €1.5 billion of private losses would be the equivalent of everyone in Ireland working all day every Monday for the next 20 to 30 years to pay back that money because all tax paid on each Monday would be used to pay that amount.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">It does not surprise me there are not many Government Deputies in the Chamber as they would find it difficult to face the people who voted for them on the basis they will come to the House tomorrow to vote for the amendment which states that "all of the actions necessary" will be taken.  A vote by Government Deputies on the amendment says the following to the people of Ireland, namely, it is okay for the Irish people to continue to pay the vast unguaranteed losses of private investors, it is okay that the Irish people thought they were voting for something that they were not voting for and it is okay for the Irish people not to have any say in this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">For all of these reasons, I call on the Government to hold a referendum.  I call on Government Deputies to vote for the motion — in vain, I am sure.  I believe a vote for the amendment would constitute a genuine betrayal of the people who voted them in.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_686">I am not speaking from a script because I do not believe Ministers should do so on Private Members' business.  I am here to listen and I took detailed notes on what Deputies said.  I ask for the opportunity to respond in a mature way rather than the type of yobbo, old-fashioned politics this country needs to move away from.  I ask colleagues to engage in that spirit.  I take this debate seriously and have listened attentively to what Members have said.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">We must get back to an honest debate about this issue rather than pretending that a referendum will solve the problem one way or the other.  The reality is that it might make the situation infinitely worse.  We are in a rolling situation and the Government has had to negotiate in very difficult circumstances.  Members are well aware of the enormous legacy we must deal with.  We did not take the decision on the bank guarantee in 2008, an open-ended and wrong guarantee which has put this country in a straitjacket.  We did not take the decision to put €30 billion of the €46 billion of recapitalisation into the zombie bank that is Anglo Irish Bank.  We are left with that legacy from the previous Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">It is the clear ambition of the Government to do everything in our power to renegotiate the terms of the EU-IMF deal.  Of crucial significance for the Government right now is the necessity to seek a lower rate of interest on the EU portion of the overall package of funding coming into the country over a period of time.  That is a live issue.  It is an issue we will fight for to ensure we get that reduction in the same way a reduction was secured by Greece.  It remains the ambition of the Government to seek a write-down of senior Government debt, but that is not possible at the moment because the majority view is not there within the ECB.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">However, a fundamental aspect of the restructuring plan announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, last Thursday was, first and foremost, a very substantial write-down of up to €6 billion on subordinated debt, which will be part of the €24 billion package.  In addition, we will demand a sale of the non-core elements of the banking system abroad, which are profitable and successful, at a time when we need that money in this country.  We will demand that the banks concentrate on their core work, that is, lending to SMEs and businesses and getting the country running again.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">I refute the charge by colleagues opposite that there is no new start from this announcement.  This is a radical restructuring of the Irish banking system, with the subordinate debt, with the package of funds — €12 billion on an annualised basis, which will be pumped into the Irish economy — and with the demand that the banking sector shed the non-core international activities in which it became far too involved over a period of time.  I refute the notion that there is nothing new in this, that this is not a major and fresh initiative.  It is a new start; it is a turning point.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">When the previous stress tests were announced the international ratings agencies did not believe a word of the findings.  What is significantly different on this occasion is that there is an international perception that we have got to the bottom of this, that this is as bad as it will get.  It was significant that on the day following the announcement Standard &amp; Poor's said it accepted the robustness of the stress tests.  The whole objective of Government policy is to overcapitalise the banks to such an extent that, first, they can get lending into the real economy and, second, we can get to a sense that this is the end of the end in terms of the big black hole in the banking sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">We all saw how private, corporate funds have left the system.  We will not have a stable banking system until we can attract those funds back.  It is interesting that when it comes to retail deposits — ordinary deposits by individuals and businesses — there has not been a dramatic reduction in comparison with the flight of funds on the corporate side.  It must be a key objective of Government, in order for the banks to function again and to make a real impact in the economy, that they are overcapitalised.  Mr. Arthur Beesley observed last week in <i>The Irish Times</i> that our banks are now better capitalised than many Swiss banks.  The task of Government is to overcapitalise the banks to such an extent that they recommence lending.  That is how we will rebuild our country.  Why does the real economy — the domestic economy — lag so far behind?  It is because people are frightened to spend.  There is no confidence that the situation they face next week or the following month will not deteriorate, that their partner or spouse will not suffer unemployment.  The real task of Government is to use the Irish banking sector as the engine for growth.  The only way that can be done is to overcapitalise.  The way in which the international markets and the rating agencies have responded to the stress tests is constructive.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Those who argue for a default need to answer a fundamental question — Deputy Boyd Barrett and I had this debate in public last Saturday.  If they are suggesting to the Irish taxpayer that there is a better way, will they please show me where we will obtain at 1%, anywhere in the world, the enormous liquidity that is required for our banking system?  As I said to Deputy Donnelly, we will have to assess the question of risk.  We cannot play with people's lives; we cannot play with the ordinary incomes of people working in this country.  Irrespective of the banking crisis, we face a fiscal crisis which is nothing to do with the banking issue.  The fiscal crisis arises from the total imbalance between income and expenditure.  It is absolutely essential that people are honest in this debate.  They must answer the question of where we would obtain the liquidity to keep the banking system going and keep businesses going were the ECB tap to be turned off.  That is a fundamental issue in this debate and people must be honest about it.  The issue will not simply be wished away by the notion that others will provide the funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">We should not forget that on the evening when our ratings were reduced because of the enormity of the stress tests, the ECB changed its rules to allow medium-term funding to operate within the Irish banking sector.  Without that funding at 1% the banking system would cease to exist.  We should never lose focus on this point, that the economy is being held together because of ECB support.  That support comes at a price, but the Government view is that we must continue to negotiate and continue to build bridges following the enormous reputational damage done to this country by the previous Administration.  We will do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">I very much welcome the initiative taken by the Tánaiste this week in bringing  together our diplomats and all of us involved in public administration, so that we are all singing from the same hymn sheet in terms of trying to build those international bridges.  Who knows what the landscape will be in Europe in three months, let alone six months?  Who knows what will happen to the Portuguese or the Spanish?  We have to box clever.  We must use the hand we are given, albeit a very difficult one, in such a way that we get the best results for Ireland.  I would not go around quoting the Icelandic example of default.  I would not go around talking, as Deputy Boyd Barrett did, about Argentina and Ecuador.  This is a developed economy, part of a single currency zone.  There are huge risks for the country in talking up the notion of default, huge risks for the people dependent on social welfare and the people in the public sector who are dependent on the Exchequer to pay their wages.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">Where default has happened it has led to a collapse, to a 70% reduction in the ordinary wages of teachers, doctors, nurses and public officials.  This notion that there is some type of free-range option is a dishonest position.  It is not fair, it is not honest.  It is fine for the type of polemical, theatrical performance which some people want to continue, but it will not help the honest debate this country needs.  Such a debate is needed and in so far——</p>

          <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_701">Last week's announcement is not in any sense the end to our problems and nor does it pretend to be.  It creates a new structure for the banks and hopefully constitutes the last and final figure regarding the recapitalisation of the pillar banks.  However, since the announcement much of the debate, including the debate this evening, has pertained to default.  I understand how people feel about default.  Everything within me rebels against the notion of being obliged to repay money to all the bondholders who lent to us.  I undoubtedly share the rage felt by many people about being obliged to pay back money to lenders who were as reckless as our own banks were feckless.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">However, were we to opt for a default, we instantly would become international pariahs in the face of the markets.  As the previous speaker noted, we already have suffered huge reputational damage and we cannot now or ever in the future allow ourselves to be in a position in which we were the kind of pariahs to whom no one ever would lend money again.  We certainly should not do so at present, when Ireland is completely dependent on the willingness of the bailout troika to continue funding next week's salaries and pension and social welfare payments.  We should not do so when our banks are dependent for continued funds on the ECB.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">Moreover, one should be in no doubt but that this is about funding tomorrow morning, to allow banks to dispense money through the ATMs and to pay people's mortgages, food bills and so on.  While it may be that people would continue to lend to us were we to default, I do not believe this to be the case.  It certainly would be a high-risk action and no Government is entitled to play such a high-risk game with people's precious savings and futures.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">The European Union has said "No" to bank default as far as the pillar banks are concerned and the Government agrees.  It must agree because these are the banks the Government is asking it to fund tomorrow, the day after and the day after that.  The key point is that at present, we have more to lose by defaulting then we have to gain.  This is an equation with which one cannot argue.  While everyone wishes it were different, it is not something with which one can argue.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">I believe that at some future point, the European Union will agree to some form of debt restructuring.  I believe this to be almost inevitable and that in time, the European Union will come to perceive that it is in its interests, as well as in ours.  After all, Ireland is joined at the hip with other European Union states in the eurozone and the process of negotiating and renegotiating our financial interactions with them will be an ongoing business.  Last week's summit is by no means the end of the story but for the present, we must work the deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">The deal that was on offer to the previous Government has not changed, although the Government will continue to try to change it.  However, for the present it must show determination in its efforts to reduce our primary balance.  As the previous speaker stated, I hope the Government can negotiate a reduction in our interest rates because there is no doubt but that if we are ever to achieve the overall deficit target of 3% of GDP, we will be obliged to grow faster than we accumulate debt and at present, it is difficult to envisage how this could happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">These are the facts of the legacy of the previous Government and they will not change by having a referendum.  The result of the bailout and the bankruptcy that led to it is that we do not get to choose these solutions any more.  This is the price we all are paying for the last Government's actions.  It is fantasy to pretend to the people that were they to have a referendum, they would have different choices.  Alternatively, it may constitute a genuine misunderstanding of what is going on but it is not the reality.  The only choice left to the people was to choose a new Government to try to get them out of the hole the country is in.  This primarily now means stabilising our debt, which in turn depends on interest rates, growth rates, the size of the primary balance and the requirements of the bank losses.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">However, we will have no growth without functioning banks and unless there is improved market confidence at home and abroad.  The holding of a referendum on how to proceed or on whether to default or otherwise will not bring that day a single moment closer.  It will postpone it because it will increase uncertainty, which is the last thing the country can have at present.</p>

          <p eId="para_716">——default is in the interest of this country.  Deputy Boyd Barrett has spoken of those whose fingerprints are on the scene of the crime of this country's economic disaster.  As he tucks himself up in bed tonight with a cup of cocoa, I ask him to think carefully about who would benefit from a default, with reference to those who tiptoed out of the market in 2005, 2006 and 2007.  In the context of the significant deleveraging that would be forced on Ireland with regard to the assets on the books of the Irish banks, who would bottom-feed on the forced sale of the aforementioned banks' Irish performing assets?  It would be those richest 300 people to whom the Deputy referred, who would take advantage of the strategy of default.  Such people would return and would bottom-buy assets that would have been forced on to the market as a consequence of the default.  One would see a frenzy of bottom-feeding on Irish and international property.  If the objective of Deputy Boyd Barrett is to line the pockets of those 300 people whom he regards to be the richest, then the default strategy will benefit them.</p>

          <p eId="para_721">Both Government parties have made clear that they favour burden sharing with senior bondholders in banks as long as it is part of a European-wide framework for senior debt.  The Government has made clear that burden sharing will not apply to banks that will form part of the two new pillars of Irish banking.  This makes complete sense.  The Government seeks a systemic banking force in Ireland that will be supported to ensure the domestic economy's ability to get through this dark period.  Were burden sharing to be introduced, it would only involve banks that were not part of those new pillars, namely, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">Ireland is not in a position to act unilaterally with regard to the senior bondholders as this would create serious difficulties for the Irish economy in respect of international confidence.  One need only consider last weekend's commentary regarding our international competitors and how they view the Irish situation with regard to confidence within the domestic economy.  We must try to position the country to be able to attract outside investors to have confidence in this economy and to have the confidence to take risks by creating jobs here.  Some commentators argue that Ireland should engage in some form of high-risk game of brinkmanship on the basis that burden sharing with senior bondholders is in the country's immediate interests.  That is a highly risky strategy because it would create serious doubts in the minds of those investors who Ireland so desperately needs, including in my constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">I would be grateful were the Minister of State, at some point this evening, to expand on the significance of the restructuring approach that ensures there will be €12 billion per annum in lending made available for each of the next three years.  In light of the Central Bank's estimation of a requirement of between €11 billion and €16 billion during that period, how will we ensure these moneys will be circulated into the local and national economies to encourage risk-takers in the SME sector to get involved in job creation and to keep the next generation of young people in this country?  Iceland faces a greater crisis in respect of emigration, the delivery of public services and job creation.</p>

          <p eId="para_727">Like other Members of Dáil Éireann, I agree with much of the thrust of this Private Members' motion, although I do not see the value of holding a referendum.  The general election gave an answer to the previous Government's handling of the nation's economic affairs, be that the failure to engage in the EU-IMF discussion process or the bank bailout.  The general election brought out the public's views in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">While canvassing on the doorstep, I made it clear to people that there would be no easy fix for this crisis and that it would take a long time to sort out.  This got a positive response.  Had I said anything else, I would not have been believed.  I am glad I did this and that the new Government has made honesty its <i>modus operandi</i> with the public, as the scale of the challenge is of such monumental proportions.  Unquestionably, the essential next step is to persuade our EU partners to lift some of the burden from our shoulders.  Most if not all Deputies believe this to be an imperative, but the difference in the ways to go about it is the reason I will not support the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">The extent of the task before us is best seen through two examples.  First, there is anger among our European partners at the previous Government's attempts to deal with the crisis, in particular the lack of consultation on the bank bailout.  Second, Ms Catherine Day, the Irish born head of the civil service element of the European Commission, stated: "The responsibility for the Irish debt crisis rests primarily in Ireland".  Her comments show the amount of work we have to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_731">My points indicate that we have a considerable amount of footwork to do to rebuild the bridges badly damaged in recent years.  Like the Minister of State, I welcome the Tánaiste's diplomatic initiative to explain our case in Europe.  This is how we can begin the job of working with as opposed to against our European partners to help solve this crisis.  Every Deputy should give his or her full backing to this work.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">Undoubtedly, there is a degree of European responsibility for our debt and banking crisis.  For example, how many European institutions lent money to Anglo Irish Bank?  However, this argument if used on its own will not sway hearts in Europe.  As a country, we must persuade our European neighbours that it is in their interests as well as ours that bondholders accept some burden sharing.  We may need to soldier on with the current plan, but it will undoubtedly be shown down the road as not working adequately.  I hope I am wrong, but the evidence may take the form of rising unemployment or long-term unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">Unfortunately, Ireland will need to wait until Europe sees that we cannot cope with the burden placed upon us.  If we cannot pay our way, it is likely that the losses will fall on other national central banks or the European Central Bank, ECB, which is locked into its exposure for the foreseeable future.  It is our job to ensure it is made aware of this fact as soon as possible and arrange an arsenal of arguments to put to the ECB and our European partners, namely, that a renegotiation of the deal is in their national interests.  We must make this case as soon as possible.  The sooner that point is arrived at, the better for Ireland and the whole of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">Like my colleague, Deputy Keaveney, I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could demonstrate how the money being pumped into the banks will be made available for lending to small to medium-sized businesses.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Mathews</from>
          <p eId="para_735">We all agree that we must pull together in assessing and measuring the situation.  Last Thursday, we received a full and honest presentation from the Minister for Finance regarding the report prepared by New York's BlackRock Solutions, suitably adjusted and edited by the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator to allow for a presentation on the up-to-date position of the viable banks after restructuring.  BlackRock parked to one side two of the moribund banks that are being wound down.  Loan losses estimations were made for the banks that would become the two pillars.  The amount of loan losses recognised resulted in estimated capitalisation requirements of €24 billion, including €3 billion of contingency funds.  This was the starting point of an action plan, added to which was the statement that there would be a review of the overall regulation and operation of the banking sector, including at Department of Finance and other supervisory levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">Getting across this restructuring plan to all of us in three weeks is commendable.  It is the starting point for introducing a closer and more focused examination of the six banks in terms of asset evaluations and estimations, a double checking, as it were.  If we do this, it may transpire that we must adjust a little bit more for the further losses that I and some others would suggest are to be found in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  When the full picture becomes clearer, we can present the composition and amount of funding in the six banks, most of which comes from the ECB and our Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">The losses that have arisen in the banking sector are probably in the order of €90 billion to €95 billion.  The foreign institutions that supported the banks that created those loans that resulted in the losses participated in what some journalists have been calling in recent days "Ireland's party".  The institutions that invested in our banks' bonds benefited from that party, received interest from the bonds and, apart from subordinated bonds, have seen them redeemed to the extent of €60 billion without any cost.  This issue ought to be reviewed and represented to Europe and the ECB.  We are all on the same side, namely, the side of the Irish people.  The opportunity for us is to present this report card truly, fairly and in a balanced and reasonable way to Europe.  It is like when jigsaw pieces are presented so that a viewer can join them and the answer becomes obvious.  That is what we should do.  The result of the election is tantamount to a referendum, as only 20 seats remain in the hands of the Government parties from the previous Dáil.  In itself, that is a startling fact to present to Mr. Trichet, Mr. Rehn and Mr. Chopra.  We have had a referendum so we can now arm ourselves with facts, present them coherently and explain the provenance of the unsustainable loan losses that Mr. Noonan very intelligently and diplomatically raised in a shot across the bow when first meeting European officials.  That is the challenge for us all so we should rise to it.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_234">
          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_738">Tá áthas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an gceist seo.  Reading the motion from the Technical Group, there is much in the first three or four paragraphs with which nobody could find fault.  In a just world it is horrendous that people in Europe who speculated with money are having debts paid by taxpayers right across the Continent.  Nobody can have an argument with this and I have no brief for bankers, banks or the way they acted over the past ten or 15 years, particularly since the inception of the euro.  The question is whether there are easy answers that can wipe away debts without repercussions if the country acts unilaterally and in a fashion that is not co-ordinated.  That is where the difficulty lies, as the previous Government found out.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">Deputy Mathews has argued that the election was almost a referendum.  With a referendum the people normally get a choice and the people's will is implemented.  In this case there was a choice but the current Government realised that what was put to the Irish people was not exactly the best choice; I am thankful an about turn was implemented.  When one considers coldly the choices, some of the proposals which were so handy and attractive are not so practical when one reads the small print.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">As we do not want to repeat the problem we should go back to its beginning.  I said this last week and will do so again tonight.  When the euro was constructed, there was a major fault line going back to a hang-up which Europe and America has that profit is might and people in private industries, where there is enough competition, will always make profits and good decisions for the people.  When the euro was introduced, it came with rules and regulations concerning what governments could do.  There was a fixated idea that the private sector could do no wrong and if there was enough competition, all people would get better and cheaper services, although this is not necessarily true.  It certainly was not true in this case and what we are discussing are some of the most expensive private services ever provided to people.  No rules were laid concerning the international transfer of money and there was no proper European oversight.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">Deputy Mathews is correct in that it is absolutely astounding that at a European Central Bank level nobody considered the transfer of funds between the states.  The Irish banks made significant mistakes but it is also fair to point out that the non-Irish banks in this market, such as Bank of Scotland, Ulster Bank and so on, made the same mistakes and followed the same pattern.  Even if the Irish banks had not gone down that road, other banks may have.  If we are to ensure this does not happen in future, we must introduce control on private competition and move away from a concept that seems to be one of the basic tenets of the European Union.  It may have been founded in food security but now the simplistic notion is that competition solves all problems.  That certainly has not been the case with us and ultimately it has been a very expensive choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">There are other issues, such as banking oversight by the Oireachtas and the Government.  There are people who argue that we should not have provided a guarantee, which is a fair point that can be examined.  I am willing to consider any point.  I have never heard anybody contradict my understanding, which is if there had not been a guarantee, Anglo Irish Bank would have collapsed and may have brought many financial institutions in the State with it.  In the event of the bank's default, depositors were at risk.  The idea of the guarantee was not to guarantee shares in the bank — they are worthless — but to hold money in the system and reassure depositors that the money was safe.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">Over time we reduced the extent of the guarantee but the question arises as to why, in the short term, both bonds and depositors were guaranteed.  The answer is simple; if only depositors were guaranteed, all the bondholders would have cashed in as quickly as possible and a difficulty would have ensued.  The idea was to create stability and space.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">What has happened to the guarantee in time?  In practice, the guarantee has been superseded by liquidity provided on a fortnightly basis.  In other words, we never paid out directly on the guarantee but paid out on solvency issues in the bank.  People have withdrawn money in the past few years so the guarantee has been overtaken by liquidity provided by the European Central Bank.  By November last year the relevant figure had risen to €100 billion.  Banking issues rather than sovereign problems triggered the EU and IMF deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">There is a simple equation as I saw it at the time.  We had enough money to run the State to June this year because we had pre-funded but a problem would have occurred if the ECB indicated the money it rolled over every fortnight was no longer available or that there was a cap to it.  If that had occurred, there was potential for the banking edifice to come down around our ears.  That money is at 1% but if the interest is doubled, the cost to the State becomes absolutely enormous as any cost to banks is a cost to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">In those circumstances it is being argued that people would vote in a certain way.  I would be very happy for a referendum on the issue because the Irish people are pragmatic.  They are mad at Fianna Fáil and we got that message.  They are mad at bankers, which we also understand.  Faced with the equation we saw in November, the Irish people would have made the same choice the previous Government made and which the current Government is making now.  To make any other choice and stop that flow of money coming from the ECB which is shoring up banks' liquidity — I understand the figure has gone up considerably since November — would lead to the whole show coming to a shuddering stop.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">If the State could not borrow money to run the country and keep the banks open, the cutbacks arising from the EU and IMF deal would have looked very small because the country would have run out of money.  Faced with such a dilemma, we took the view that a maintenance of services and our ability to borrow €16 billion for this year and more money for subsequent years was absolutely vital.  We saw only one show in town and if we tried to unilaterally renege on bonds, Europe would have not given us a guarantee to keep liquidity in the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">The Government got it absolutely right last week with an issue that was of great concern to me last November.  There was a tacit understanding that the money would be injected from the ECB.  However, I would be much happier if that money was put in on a medium-term basis.  I am not comfortable with the idea of tacitly rolling it over every few weeks.  It is better than not having it at all but is not a satisfactory situation.  What we must do next is ensure stability and the only way to do that is to ensure the money from the ECB and the Central Bank, which latter, in terms of currency, is only a sub-office, is there for the long term.  That would create a climate of certainty within the banking sector.  In addition to corporate depositors, many ordinary people still move their money out because they are not absolutely sure whether the banks will continue to be funded from the point of view of liquidity.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">My understanding of this, in simple terms, was that the ECB would provide the liquidity if we provided the capital.  There was to be a total package.  As far as I have heard, nobody has put in the totality, an alternative package that would give us the possibility of ensuring that, in the course of the medium term, we can fund the Exchequer services that require to be funded and ensure there is not an implosion of the banking system.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">I reiterate I have no love for banks or bankers.  What they did was absolutely scandalous and unprecedented.  However, ordinary people depend on the financial system.  The notion that one hurts nobody but bankers by allowing banks to collapse is naive in the extreme.  Therefore, as in a chess game, before making any moves one must work out all the forward steps to ensure one does not create an unforeseen situation that would cause enormous damage to a great number of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">Another issue which was overlooked when we considered bond markets, financial markets and so on, is that there is a great mixture present, just as in the case of depositors in the banks.  There are those who have big money and big investments but side by side with these are the moneys from the small people which are put into life insurance policies, pension funds, and so on.  If one starts to burn people willy-nilly there is no way of knowing which person one will burn.  Looking at the top end, nobody can know where the trail will lead, whether to a big person or a small person.  That is a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">I took part in a radio debate recently where a person suggested he would have paid the big depositors who were socially acceptable but not those who were not socially acceptable.  I am afraid the law does not provide for that.  When one enters this House the price one pays is that although one makes the laws one must live by them no matter how inconvenient it is.  One cannot change the law retrospectively.  The notion that one can say one does not like such a person and therefore will not pay out but one likes another and will pay is naive in the extreme.  It is strange for people who are part of the law-making system to talk in that fashion because the moment we bring into disrepute law-making and abidance with the law by the Government and the Oireachtas we undermine our democratic system and the Constitution.  There are calls for a referendum but we must try to solve this problem within the law.  If one tried to act outside the law one would be brought quickly to the courts.  If we did not stick by the law the courts would bring us to heel very quickly and give an order that we had to comply with the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">When one sits in the Cabinet room there is a constant constraint.  Many solutions are put forward but may not comply with the law.  For example, matters may be treated one way in a certain jurisdiction and certain bonds were taken out of this jurisdiction.  However, by changing domestic law one does not change the status of those bonds.  That matter would not be decided in a court in Ireland in any event.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">Very attractive solutions have been put forward that I wish would work.  I wish there was a magic bullet because I certainly do not wish to put any burden on the backs of the ordinary people.  However, many of the propositions are either not legally possible or would create such great collateral damage that the resulting fallout would be much more severe on the people than the way we have taken to date.  The Government which is now facing these constraints——</p>

          <p eId="para_765">Will the senior bondholders of Anglo Irish Bank bear their burden?</p>
          <p eId="para_766">Regarding the substantive issue, the most recent bailout has put an enormous burden on this State.  The reckless bucketing of €24 billion of Irish people's money by this Government into the banking system will bring this State closer to unsustainability.  In other words, this has the capacity to break the State.  It will deepen austerity measures that are crippling thousands of people, the weakest and the most vulnerable in society.  It will also have the effect of deepening the procyclical recession that is currently affecting the State.  In the end it may cost every individual worker €13,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">This bailout is probably the most severe and important policy that has been implemented in this State since Partition.  It is of such importance to the people that they should have their say by way of referendum.  In the coming days we shall debate some of these issues further and tease out the economic effects and the effects of the actual bailout on the people.  However, there is another major inherent cost to the deal, namely, the price of Irish sovereignty.  Sovereignty is about having supreme independent authority over the country.  In the Republic, this sovereignty lies with the people.  In practical terms this means having the right to determine fully the laws that affect the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">The goal of self-determination has been central to Sinn Féin since 1905 and my party has continued with that goal to the present date, with the aim of ultimately achieving full Irish independence and sovereignty on the island as a whole. Sovereignty is not a woolly or vague aspiration.  It is a bread and butter issue, affecting the material wealth of each individual.  The referendum is the ultimate tool of sovereignty.  In this situation it is the people who have a say over the future of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">Over the years, this hard-won sovereignty has been diluted by a number of EU referenda such as that on the Lisbon treaty.  The passing of such treaties was surrounded by substantial debate and, in some cases, major controversies.  In some cases there were re-runs of referenda.  In contrast, in this situation we are on the cusp of a silent revolution, one which sees extensive transfer of macro-economic sovereignty and decision-making to Brussels.  The debt mountain created by Fianna Fáil has not only strangled this economy but is leading to a substantial relocation of power from the Irish people to unelected bureaucrats in Europe.  It is a debt for sovereignty swap.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">Much of the loss of sovereignty has been obscured from the current debate because of the more immediate and pressing issues of the massive debt burden accumulating at present.  However, the outworkings of this debt for sovereignty swap will cause major difficulties in the future.  In the future, this State will have to go cap in hand to the EU and ask for permission.  The EU may or may not allow us permission to pursue certain economic activities.    The EU may say, to quote the Minister for Finance, that we can bring in the policy if we introduce a counter-balancing measure.  Some people will say it does not matter if we hand over the economy because the EU cannot make as much of a mess of it as Fianna Fáil did.  I can see it is hard to imagine anyone making a mess bigger than that made by Fianna Fáil but it is important to understand the dynamics of EU decision making.  It makes decisions for the benefit of the greater European economy.  Ireland only represents 1% of that economy and does not register regarding decisions that are made.  In the past 20 years, Ireland has been on a completely different economic cycle from the core European states.  This means monetary policy which would have a beneficial impact on Germany could have a devastating impact on Ireland.  In this State, low interest rates were partly responsible for the largest boom and bust cycle the world has ever seen.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">Our reticence regarding the ceding of sovereignty to Brussels is not based on an idealistic pipe-dream, it is based on bread and butter side effects that such a sovereignty swap would have.  It is worth noting that the so-called reform energy emanating from the EU that is driving this approach on decision-making capacity is not ideologically neutral, much of it comes from deep seated EU federal aspirations.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">I appeal to TDs, especially those in Fine Gael and the Labour Party who went from door to door not 40 days ago to convince people the new Government would fairly share the burden of debt with senior bondholders, now they have been elected, to stand up for the people and economic sovereignty and survival of the State.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</from>
            <p eId="para_773">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating this debate on school transport and small schools in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">I acknowledge and fully appreciate the difficulties regarding this issue and the present proposals for changes to school transport schemes have been inherited by the present Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">The problem with the proposals is that the new charges will place a further burden on young families that are already under severe financial pressure to make ends meet and keep a roof over their heads.  The removal of eligibility under the closed school rule will have an especially devastating effect on rural areas, particularly the increase from the current minimum of seven to ten children for the establishment or retention of services.</p>
            <p eId="para_776">In Tuosist there is an excellent national school run by an excellent principal and staffed by excellent teachers who provide a solid education in this rural area.  There are 73 pupils at the school, with 43 from outside the catchment area, seven from inside the eligible area, while the others live inside the 3.2 kilometre radius, making them ineligible for free transport.  Their parents must pay €200 per pupil for the concessionary ticket.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">In the townland of Dromuchty in the parish of Tuosist, I met a young family with young children, some of whom now go to the national school in Tuosist.  If these changes are made, the younger children must go to the national school in Kenmare, because it is nearer.  We have nothing against the school in Kenmare but there has always been a cherished tradition that when a small child went to school, an older sibling would be there to take him by the hand and mind him if he was afraid.  That bit of comfort existed not just for the first few days, but for the first few months.  Problems further down the line could be helped by having an older sibling in the school.  This, however, will split families down the middle, with some going one way and some the other.  Then, parents will be trying to drive children to school while working hard to pay for the increased charges they face.  They are being asked to drive some children one way, some the other while they are supposed to drive to work to pay for the charges they must now face.  This situation will be replicated across the country, with thousands of families affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_778">Another problem is the short timeframe.  Many schools only received notification on 20 March that they had an opportunity to apply for new passengers, on behalf of new infants, and the deadline was 31 March.  Many of these schools will not have children enrolling until just before the summer holidays in May or June.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">Will the Minister of State reconsider the proposed charging for a service that was free until now and which provided an excellent service to the rural school-going population?  More important, will he increase the current minimum of eligible children for the retention of services?  In light of an ongoing Government review of small primary schools, which also worries me, I contend that the school transport service gives value for money and is the last remaining lifeline for hundreds of rural communities and schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">The success of the rural transport initiative, where value for money is of paramount importance, is a model I recommend the Minister of State considers when making decisions on school transport.  In these difficult times we must have value for money, but how do we place a monetary value on a vibrant community?  In many rural areas, the school is the only remaining focal point; the creameries, pubs, shops and post offices are gone.  Please do not take away our rural schools as well.  We have lost enough and do not want to lose any more.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)</from>
            <p eId="para_781">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter today.  Before I address the issue of the changes to the primary school transport scheme, I will give the House an outline of the extent of the school transport service.</p>
            <p eId="para_782">School transport is a very significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on the Department's behalf that covers over 82 million km annually.  In the region of 123,000 children, including more than 8,000 children with special needs, are transported in approximately 4,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  Children eligible for transport may use scheduled public transport services, including the DART and Luas.</p>
            <p eId="para_783">A number of changes to the school transport scheme were introduced in the last budget of the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government.  The changes to the primary school transport scheme derive from recommendations in the recently published value for money report of the scheme and relate to the introduction of charges, changes to the "closed school rule", changes to the minimum numbers required to establish or maintain a service and new arrangements to be put in place with Bus Éireann on a phased basis for the operation of the scheme.  The changes to the closed school rule and the minimum numbers required to establish or maintain a service will have an impact on the overall provision of school transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_784">The closed school rule for school transport eligibility purposes was introduced in the 1960s in circumstances where a primary school was closed and amalgamated with another.  Under this rule pupils residing in the closed school area are eligible for transport to the school of amalgamation, even though they may be residing less than 3.2 km from that school.</p>
            <p eId="para_785">There is also what is termed a central school rule, resulting from the amalgamation of a greater number of schools.  In these instances, transport is provided for children residing not less than 1 mile or 1.6 km from the new central school.  No time limit has been applied to the closed school central school rule.  In some cases, the primary school in question was closed up to 40 years ago and amalgamated with another school.  In some instances, a newer school has been built subsequently in the general area of the original closed school.  However, under the primary school transport scheme the transport provided is to the amalgamated school only, even in circumstances where there is a newer school closer to the pupil's home.  A pupil in these circumstances is not eligible for free transport to the newer school.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">With regard to forward planning policy to meet pupil places annually, the Department of Education and Skills assesses school accommodation needs in each area based on local demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places.  The closed school rule can operate to distort parental decisions and result in pupils travelling longer distances than necessary, were they to go to the nearest school.  Put another way, the closed school rule operates to deny school transport eligibility to children travelling to their nearest school and meeting the requisite distance criterion.</p>
            <p eId="para_787">The specific changes announced in respect of the closed school rule are as follows.  From the commencement of the 2011 school year, the distance criteria will be applied to all pupils attending primary schools and the exemption under the closed school rule will cease.  This means children who reside less than 3.2 km from the school of attendance and who are currently availing of free transport to that school under the closed school rule will no longer be eligible for school transport.  From the 2012 school year, eligibility based on the closed school rule and the central school rule will cease for all new children entering primary schools.  However, I emphasise that existing primary pupils availing of transport under the closed school rule will retain transport eligibility for the duration of their schooling, provided the requisite distance is met.  Moreover, given that the change in question will not come into being until September 2012, all new pupils enrolling this September will be eligible under the closed school rule.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">The practical consequence of these changes are as follows.  The principle of using the distance criteria as the key eligibility criterion, having regard to language and ethos, will be applied equitably nationally.  Transitional arrangements for a period of seven years will be provided to cater for the eligible primary cohort attending the amalgamated school to allow them to complete their schooling at the school.  In the case of all future primary school amalgamations, eligibility will be based on the distance criteria applying at that time and attendance at the nearest school.  From 2012 onwards pupils residing in a closed school area, for whom the amalgamated school is not their nearest but who enrol in their nearest school, will be eligible for school transport provided the requisite distance of 3.2 km is met.</p>

            <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
            <p eId="para_789">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for affording me time to discuss this important matter.  Also, I welcome the new Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills and I wish him the best of luck in his new portfolio.  This matter concerns the need for the Minister to provide essential funding for a new school building for Curraghmore national school, Mullingar, County Westmeath, which currently has seven out of eight classes accommodated in prefabs at an annual cost of €84,800 and at a total cost of €450,000 for the past ten years.  Some of these temporary structures were second-hand when installed ten years ago and they have deteriorated considerably in the intervening years.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">The wastage by the previous Government has played a large part in the predicament in which many schools have found themselves.  One of the major scandals associated with the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government was that so much money was wasted on white elephants while schools were neglected.  Schools which should of necessity have been provided with the construction of new buildings many years ago have had to struggle on in sub-standard temporary accommodation, which has cost taxpayers millions of euro.</p>
            <p eId="para_791">Curraghmore national school has been informed of a rapid school development list which can enable schools to be built in 35 weeks.  While I am not fully aware of the provision, Curraghmore would be a contender for a top ranking on such a list.  Despite being informed by the Department ten years ago that an eight classroom school was required and should be built for Curraghmore, nothing has materialised in the intervening time.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">Curraghmore is an eight teacher school of 210 pupils with seven classes in prefabs for the past ten years.  Costs for this temporary accommodation have already amounted to €500,000.  With pupils receiving all of their primary education in such accommodation, which is seriously outmoded, there are serious associated health and safety risks.  Poor ventilation can cause asthma, leaks and decay of the prefabs are a serious concern, flooding, rot, broken gutters, leaking pipes and traffic congestion impact adversely on education and well being.  Physical development is at risk with lack of exercise facilities potentially leading to obesity.  There is no green area for play.  Outside breaks and physical education take place on a tarmacadam surface.  Since the school has no general purpose room or gymnasium, exercise is weather dependent.  The school has no money for the provision of buses to local sports facilities.  Cold winters have led to pipes freezing.  In turn, this has lead to a lack of water, heat, toilet facilities and, ultimately, school closures.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">The Department of Education and Skills has identified a need for extra primary school classes in the Mullingar area and has made it clear that funding will be provided for a new school only if extra class spaces are provided.  All other schools in the area are operating to full capacity.  If it were provided with the necessary facilities, Curraghmore could relieve some of this pressure on places.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">A four acre site is required for the new school as near as possible to the current location.  Westmeath County Council has agreed to begin the compulsory purchase order process on zoned land on the Ardmore Road, Mullingar.  The local bishop has given a commitment in writing to the Department of Education and Skills that the parish will purchase the land.  While I am aware that the Minister has inherited a flawed system with limited resources, I impress on him the urgent need for a permanent built environment for this school, which has waited for ten years for a commitment to a new school building to be met.  I hope to hear good news from the Minister of State this evening.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ciarán Cannon</from>
            <p eId="para_795">I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.  I thank Deputy Bannon for raising the matter since it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the Government's strategy for capital investment in school building projects and to outline the current position on the building project to provide for a new school building to replace the existing Curraghmore national school in Mullingar, County Westmeath.</p>
            <p eId="para_796">In its programme for Government, the Government is committed to drawing up a new national development plan that reflects Ireland's changed economic circumstances, covering the seven-year period from 2012 to 2019.  The plan will be based on a comprehensive study of Ireland's public investment priorities in that period.  In the initial years, when resources will be most heavily constrained, the programme for Government commits to prioritising investment in several specific areas, including school buildings.  The Government will insist that major capital projects are subjected to proper cost-benefit analysis and evaluation, improving future productivity and growth prospects, and that the value for money obtained is significantly enhanced compared to the most recent period.  Modernising facilities in our existing building stock as well as responding to the emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth will continue to be a significant challenge.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">All applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity and so forth, leading to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">Projects are selected for inclusion in the schools building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need which is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  There are four band ratings overall, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest.  Band one projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exists but there is a high demand for pupil places, while a band four project makes provision for desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities such as a library or new sports hall.</p>
            <p eId="para_799">A project to provide new accommodation for Curraghmore national school has been assigned a band two rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  The provision, however, of a new building for the school necessitates the acquisition of a site.  In this regard, the Department is in ongoing discussion with the local authority with a view to acquiring a suitable site for the proposed new school building.  However, due to the commercial sensitivities pertaining to site acquisitions generally, it is not possible for me to comment further at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">When a site is available, consideration can be given to the inclusion of a building project for the school in the Department's multi-annual schools building and modernisation programme.  However, in light of competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of this project at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_801">I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding the school building project for Curraghmore national school.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Kyne</from>
            <p eId="para_802">Is é seo an chéad seans dom labhairt san áit seo agus ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na daoine ó dháilcheantar Ghaillimh Thiar maidir leis an tacaíocht a fuair mé san olltoghchán.  Gabhaim buíochas leis an iar-Theachta Dála Fhine Gael don dáilcheantar, Padraic McCormack, tar éis 21 bliain go leith ag obair ar son mhuintir iarthar na Gaillimhe.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé fíor-bhródúil go bhfuil beirt Teachta Dála nua as Fine Gael sa dáilcheantar anois.</p>
            <p eId="para_803">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for facilitating the raising of this issue on the Adjournment.  As a fellow County Galway man, I congratulate him on his election as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</p>
            <p eId="para_804">Lough Corrib is the second largest lake on this island and the largest within the State.  It is predominantly within the Connemara electoral area which elected me to Galway County Council on two occasions.  It is a prized asset within my county and within this country.  The Galway county development plan in respect of Lough Corrib notes:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_805">It is possibly the single most significant natural asset in the County.  Its waters serve as a domestic supply for half the population of the County.  It is one of the most important wild fisheries in Europe, making it a prime tourist asset and an important habitat.  As the second largest inland waterbody on the island with free and frequent access to its largely unspoilt shoreline it is a vast leisure area for locals and visitors.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">Lough Corrib, however, has faced and is facing huge problems and challenges.  The threats of pollution from sewerage schemes, septic tanks, nitrate and phosphate enrichment are real, although improvements have been made to address these threats during the past number of years.  Zebra mussel has also made an unwelcome appearance.  Another very serious issue is the rapid encroachment of African pond weed or Lagarosiphon major.  The origin of this invasion was likely to have come from a domestic water pond where these plants are part of ornamental gardens.  Whatever the origin, the consequences are very serious.  The weed has spread across many of the Lough Corrib's bays since first identified in 2005.  Its spread has had a number of consequences for navigation, fishing and water quality.  The weed poses a threat to navigation channels because it can get entangled in equipment on boats, etc., and it poses a threat to the supply of clean drinking water.  All of Galway city receives its drinking water from Lough Corrib. The weed also increases the threat of flooding.</p>
            <p eId="para_807">The Central Fisheries Board launched a campaign after the identification of this weed as a problem and over the years made presentations to Lough Corrib Navigation Trustees and Galway County Council, both bodies of which I was a member, and to Galway City Council.  Funding was provided initially by the State.  A boat to allow for the weed cutting was purchased in 2008 by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Galway County Council then came on board with funding and last year a commitment was also made by Galway City Council in its 2011 budget.  Today, Inland Fisheries Ireland has commitments from Galway County Council and the city council in their 2011 budgets for the control of this weed as well as commitments from the Office of Public Works and the Heritage Council.  This commitment to funding is recognition of the seriousness of the situation on Lough Corrib.</p>
            <p eId="para_808">An innovative method of dealing with this weed has involved competent individuals diving to the bottom of the lake, cutting the weed, bringing it to the lake surface, hauling the weed onto a boat and bringing it ashore for disposal.  A mat is then placed over the lake bed from where the weed has been removed to prevent regrowth of the weed, but it allows the natural flora of the lake to regrow.  This is very technical and labour intensive work.  Three local individuals with expertise and, as locals, a love for the lake saw their contracts end on 31 December.</p>
            <p eId="para_809">I note previous responses from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or the Department with responsibility for natural resources that the reason behind the refusal to allow Inland Fisheries Ireland issue new contracts is the public service recruitment ban.  I understand our commitment to the IMF-EU deal and the need to impose restrictions on public sector and State body worker numbers to satisfy this deal.  In this instance, however, I am not seeking additional moneys for new staff to be employed but moneys budgeted by Galway's local authorities, the Office of Public Works and the Heritage Council to be spent and to allow local individuals with the expertise to continue the vital job they have being doing for the sake of Lough Corrib.</p>
            <p eId="para_810">I understand the Minister's Department is tied by the Department of Finance's insistence on the moratorium, but I ask the Minister of State if the Department accepts the necessity for this work to be completed and if he can persuade the Department of Finance to allow contracts be issued where the moneys are already sanctioned by the bodies listed.  Three young men are receiving social welfare assistance when instead they could be working, being paid by moneys already sanctioned by the listed authorities and bodies and doing a vital job cutting and removing African pond weed from Lough Corrib.  This whole story reeks of red tape and bureaucracy and makes no sense.  I appeal to the Minister of State to liaise with the Minister for Finance to allow Inland Fisheries Ireland issue new contracts in order that these staff can continue with these necessary works.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ciarán Cannon</from>
            <p eId="para_811">I am replying to this matter on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte.  I thank Deputy Kyne for raising this very important issue and congratulate him, his family and community on his election to Dáil Éireann.</p>
            <p eId="para_812">I am advised that the biggest threat to biodiversity in Ireland, after habitat destruction, is that of invasive alien species.  Indeed the negative impact of invasive aquatic species such as Lagarosiphon major is widely acknowledged.  Lough Corrib, the second largest lake in Ireland and a vital amenity for the west, is currently under threat from a number of invasive species, in particular Lagarosiphon major.</p>
            <p eId="para_813">It is not known how the weed arrived in Lough Corrib, but similar plants can be purchased for use in ornamental garden ponds.  My colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, has responsibility, through the National Parks and Wildlife Service, for the enactment of legislation in this area under the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2000 and is currently considering proposals that will further regulate the restriction of invasive plant species.</p>
            <p eId="para_814">Funding was secured by Inland Fisheries Ireland under the EU Life plus programme for a project on the control of aquatic invasive species and the restoration of natural communities in Ireland, known as CAISIE.  Control and eradication of the weed can be achieved through projects like this which adopt a co-ordinated approach in highlighting the destruction to habitats caused by invasive species.  Indeed, the National Parks and Wildlife Service is co-financier of this project.</p>
            <p eId="para_815">The Deputy is aware that the economic position of the country is profoundly changed, even since the initiation of that project, with implications and challenges for the public sector generally and Inland Fisheries Ireland's business specifically.  The board and management of Inland Fisheries Ireland are assessing the implications of these challenges for the organisation and its business plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">In the context of the National Recovery Plan, 2011 to 2014, and under the terms of the joint EU-IMF programme for Ireland, Departments and State agencies have to deal with reduced budgets and the prospect of further reductions into the foreseeable future.  This has clear implications for the level of employment that can be sustained across all areas of the public sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">Inland Fisheries Ireland was established last year and the intention is that this body will support a more efficient and effective management of the inland fisheries resource.  There is an improved national perspective in the formulation of inland fisheries policy, supporting a more streamlined, coherent and integrated approach.  While the reality is that the organisation faces pressures on its direct grant from the Exchequer, I can confirm that funding has been made available to Inland Fisheries Ireland to continue its efforts at controlling the weed in Lough Corrib.  It employs a number of research staff on the project which will continue to focus on control and containment.  Work on the systematic removal of the weed — in collaboration with the local authorities in County Galway — by using a wide range of tried and tested, as well as new and innovative, methods is being conducted over a three-year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_818">The contracts of three temporary personnel involved in cutting and clearing the weed which was mainly done by means of scuba diving expired in December 2010.  It was not possible to renew these contracts because of the public service staffing moratorium.  Notwithstanding the ongoing constraints on public expenditure, Inland Fisheries Ireland has indicated that it will continue to prioritise this work from its available resources.  It is considering options for undertaking works to control the weed this year.  In that context, on 1 April it requested tenders from suitably qualified contractors and competent suppliers and contractors who would supply equipment or be subcontracted for the control and removal of Lagarosiphon major from Lough Corrib for a 12-month period.  The successful tenderer will work in conjunction with existing IFI research and operational staff on Lough Corrib.  This important work will continue as resources permit.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_252">
          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_819">I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  While the reduction in electricity prices is welcome, I would like it to be passed on to the more than 100,000 ESB customers currently in arrears.  The Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, has also made a call in this regard and I hope the ESB will take account of what he had to say yesterday.  I also hope heed will be paid to the calls made by other parties and the different groups involved in working with those in financial difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">The Government must communicate to the energy regulator the wide range of opinions in respect of this matter.  I hope the regulator will bring pressure to bear on the ESB to change its decision regarding customers in arrears.  While there this no doubt that there are persons who are in arrears simply because they do not pay for reasons other than not being able to afford to do so, it is clear that the vast majority of the relevant individuals are in arrears for genuine reasons.  As the Consumer Association of Ireland indicated yesterday, those to whom I refer have experienced probably the most difficult period of their lives in recent years.  People have lost their jobs, have had their wages reduced and, as a consequence, have fallen into difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">No one likes to fall behind with his or her mortgage repayments, rent or vital household bills.  If people do fall behind, it is not only a question of their homes being placed in danger or their not being in a position to heat them properly, there is also the huge element of pride which comes into play.  People are embarrassed if they cannot keep up their payments.  As I stated last week, when commenting on the universal social charge, I have met individuals who are obliged to make major decisions on what appear to be small amounts of money on a daily and weekly basis.  They must contemplate whether they should buy food, pay their rent or mortgage in full, pay their gas or electricity bill or whether they will be able to put some petrol into their cars on a Monday morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">The worst aspect of all of this is that the people in the position I have outlined are often in employment.  There is no doubt that many of those who are in arrears on their electricity bills are also working.  That is a shameful situation for decent, hard-working people to find themselves in and it is not as a result of anything they have done.  It is a shame that they are on such low wages and obliged to meet so many financial impositions that they find it impossible to make ends meet.  It would surely be of assistance to them and would address the issue relating to arrears if the ESB was to extend the welcome reduction in prices to those of its customers who are in arrears.  This is an issue in which the energy regulator ought to intervene in order to ensure the reduction in prices will be passed on.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">I hope the regulator will refuse the expected request from Bord Gáis Éireann to significantly increase its charges for domestic gas supplies.  Such a move would not only cancel out the limited relief provided by the reduction in charges for ESB electricity customers, it would also add to the financial stress imposed on the households to which I have referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">Social welfare recipients who may be in arrears are entitled to a 6% discount on their energy costs.  However, those who are genuinely in arrears and not in receipt of social welfare payments do not qualify for the reduction announced by the ESB.  I hope the Minister of State will give this matter his immediate attention.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CiaranCannon" eId="spk_253">
          <from>Deputy Ciarán Cannon</from>
          <p eId="para_825">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, has no statutory function in the setting of energy prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated sectors.  The regulation of the electricity and gas markets is the responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, which is an independent statutory body.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">The residential electricity market has changed dramatically during the past two years following the introduction of competition.  This has brought significant pressure on ESB Electric Ireland, with the loss of some 800,000 customers to date and customer exits continuing at a rate of 5,000 a week.  The electricity retail market was fully deregulated as of 4 April, with the entry of ESB Electric Ireland to domestic competition.  As a result, business and domestic customers can now avail of the competitive offerings from a number of electricity supply companies.  Even in this deregulated energy market, the CER will continue to monitor the position to ensure tariffs are cost reflective, that is, that there will be no below-cost selling.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">The Minister and I welcome the ESB's announcement yesterday of price cuts of up to 17% for electricity and gas customers.  ESB Electric Ireland is responding to competitive pressure, while maintaining a balance between its business viability — last year over €20 million in bad debts was written off — and customers' needs.  This is a further positive example of competition at work in the market, with good results for consumers.  As the Minister indicated at Question Time, he has asked the ESB to distinguish between those customers who will not pay and those in genuine trouble.  He has also requested that it pay particular attention to the needs of customers with genuine payment problems who want to avail of the price cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">ESB Electric Ireland has a well established practice of agreeing payment plans with customers in order to facilitate them in paying off their arrears over a period appropriate to their individual financial circumstances.  It makes approximately 150,000 of these arrangements each year.  In addition, token meters are offered to customers as an added help in household budgeting.  A new generation of pay-as-you-go keypad meters will be rolled out this winter by ESB Networks under the auspices of the CER.  By adopting this new technology, it is ESB Electric Ireland's objective that disconnections will no longer occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">ESB Electric Ireland has confirmed that customers in receipt of social welfare payments who may have arrears can register for the household budget price plan.  This plan offers reductions on their electricity unit rates provided they sign up to having a minimum amount of €15 a week deducted at source from their social welfare payments via An Post's household budget scheme.  The scheme is strongly recommended by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  ESB Electric Ireland is incentivising its customers to participate in the scheme by means of its new household budget price plan offering.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">The current economic climate is placing additional pressures on consumers and many are experiencing problems in meeting domestic outgoings.  The numbers experiencing difficulties in paying utility bills is a concern for the Government, the CER and the energy utility companies.  Ultimately, this can result in disconnection from service.  However, the key message for all customers is to contact their suppliers to make arrangements before the situation reaches the point of disconnection.  In addition and in line with the programme for Government, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is working with his colleagues, the Ministers for Social Protection and the Environment, Community and Local Government to bring forward the proposed strategy to tackle energy poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">Energy affordability is a cross-cutting policy issue.  Tackling the root causes of energy affordability or fuel poverty requires action on a number of fronts.  Energy poverty is caused by the interaction between energy prices, thermal inefficiency of the home and income.  Considerable work has been undertaken by the interdepartmental-agency group on affordable energy which is chaired by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and represents all key Departments, agencies and energy suppliers, as well as the energy regulator and NGOs.  The Minister expects the affordable energy strategy group to finalise its work in the coming weeks.  Its analysis and recommendations will form the basis of a strategy to be agreed and brought to the Government as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_834">I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 39 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">In line with the Programme for Government, I am working with my colleagues the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government to bring forward the proposed strategy to tackle energy poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">Considerable work has already been undertaken by the Inter-Departmental/Agency Group on Affordable Energy which is chaired by my Department and which represents all key Departments, Agencies and energy suppliers as well as the Energy Regulator and NGOs.</p>
            <p eId="para_837">Energy Affordability is a cross-cutting policy issue and tackling the root causes of energy affordability or fuel poverty requires action on a number of fronts.</p>
            <p eId="para_838">Energy poverty is caused by the interaction between energy prices, thermal inefficiency of the home and income.  Action to mitigate energy poverty has traditionally focused on providing assistance through the schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection.  In recent years there has been a growing focus on providing energy efficiency upgrades to low-income, or at risk households, under the Warmer Homes Scheme.  The Scheme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_839">The Warmer Homes Scheme was established to systematically address poor thermal efficiency performance of low-income privately owned housing.  The scheme provides energy improvements at no cost to eligible households.  It brings benefits to recipients in terms of energy affordability, tangible health improvements and overall well being.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">In 2010, over 24,000 homes underwent upgrades with a total spend of €30 million.  The Scheme has resulted in quantifiable energy savings for low-income households worth almost €3 million.  The scheme has addressed over 64,000 fuel poor homes since 2000.  My Department and SEAI have a target of an additional 17,500 homes in 2011 of which 2,096 have been completed to date.  The Scheme is delivered by a network of private contractors and community-based organisations nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">In addition to the Warmer Homes Scheme, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government operate a retrofit programme for social housing. Approximately 1,850 units were approved in 2010 with a similar number expected this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_842">I expect the Affordable Strategy Energy Group to finalise its own work, in the coming weeks.  Their analysis and recommendations will form the basis for a strategy to be agreed with my Ministerial colleagues and brought to Government as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_843">Since ESB Electric Ireland's announcement of price cuts yesterday, there has been understandable focus on the requirement for customers to have their accounts up to date in order to take up the price reduction offers. It is the case that ESB, and all other energy suppliers, are commercial operations and therefore business viability is an issue for them — balanced as far as possible with customers' needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_844">In light of the concerns expressed, ESB has confirmed to my Department that Social Welfare customers who have arrears are indeed eligible for the new Household Budget Price Plan. What is required is that they sign up to a minimum 15 Euro payment via the Household Budget Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">I have also asked ESB to immediately review ways in which other customers that are in arrears, but have a payment plan, can benefit from the price reductions. ESB have committed to undertaking this review.</p>

            <p eId="para_847">I have no statutory function in the setting of energy prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated sector.  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body. The electricity retail market is now fully deregulated as of 4 April and the CER are engaged in progressive de-regulation of the gas retail market.  As a result, business and domestic customers can now avail of the competitive offerings from a number of electricity supply companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_848">I welcome ESB's announcement yesterday of price cuts of up to 17% for electricity and gas customers. This is a further positive example of competition at work in the market with good results for consumers. As I outlined to the House earlier I have asked ESB to pay particular attention to the needs of customers with genuine payment problems and who want to avail of the price cuts.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">Competition helps to put downward pressure on energy prices.  But the Government is concerned to ensure that all possible additional actions are taken to mitigate business and for domestic customers.  This is essential for competitiveness, for employment and for the economy as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_850">I acknowledge the action taken over the last two years to bring Ireland's energy prices into line with, or below, European averages.  This is confirmed by Eurostat figures for 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">This has been an important factor in improving the competitiveness for Irish enterprise and foreign direct investment.  However, there is no room for complacency.  Global gas and oil prices have risen sharply since the start of the year driven by events in North Africa and Japan and high demand from the emerging economies of China and India.  Ireland's concerns about the risk of price rises are shared by the European Union.  Oil and gas prices and security of supply were discussed at the Special Energy Council on 21st   March which I attended.  We agreed at Council that high energy prices, if sustained, would endanger economic recovery.  We also agreed on the imperative to enhance energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes thus reducing dependency on high priced fossil fuels.  My Department will continue to work with the enterprise community, the energy sector, and the energy regulator to take action where possible to reduce the cost of energy for business, domestic customers and for vulnerable customers.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</b>
         the steps he will take to provide broadband access outside the main urban centres; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_853">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter in the first instance for private sector service providers operating in a liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  The telecommunications market in Ireland has been fully liberalised since 1999 and, since then, has seen the steady growth and development of vibrant well-regulated competition in the provision of the full range of telecommunications products and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">The Government is not a player in this market and can only intervene in cases of market failure.  Such interventions, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme, are subject to State Aid clearance by the EU Commission.  Under the NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government there is a commitment for NewERA to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband to every home and business in the State.  Consideration of how best to advance the NewERA proposals, for which my colleague Minister of State O'Dowd has specific responsibility, is being advanced by my Department with other stakeholders across Government.  The State has already intervened, with EU approval, to invest in improving broadband access to areas outside of urban centres.  Accordingly my Department entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) in late December 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">This targeted State intervention was aimed at addressing rural areas where broadband services were unlikely to be available due to reluctance on the part of commercial operators to invest because of uncertain financial returns.   The NBS network has now been completed and services have been available in all 1028 Electoral Divisions since October 2010, in line with contractual commitments.  The NBS contract remains in place until August 2014.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be isolated cases of premises throughout the country that are not capable of receiving a broadband service.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (e.g., suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, or no ‘line of sight' from the premises to the wireless base station).  The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_856">Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I intend to formally announce the launch of a Rural Broadband Scheme in the coming weeks.  This scheme will aim to provide a basic broadband service to individual unserved rural premises outside of the NBS areas.  There will be a competitive process to engage a service provider who will offer a broadband service to qualified applicants under the scheme.  While the exact details have yet to be finalised, I expect that the service offered under this scheme would at least match the service offered under the NBS and that the scheme will be fully rolled out by the end of 2012.  The combination of private sector investment, the NBS and the Rural Broadband Scheme should ensure broadband coverage for effectively the full country.</p>

            <p eId="para_860">I did not receive an advance copy of the Moriarty Report.  I set out in some detail my comments in the course of the debate in this House last week.  In my initial speech in the Debate I accepted that the Tribunal did make criticisms of the process and its administration by the then Department.  The Tribunal did refer to systemic failures in the Department in their report but as I pointed out in my address last week this should be seen in the context of the Tribunal statement that the officials in question had no means of knowing the then Minister was conveying information to one of the bidders and no reason to suspect Mr. Lowry.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">As the Deputy will be aware the system for issuing spectrum licences has changed fundamentally since the time of the second mobile phone licence competition.  The administration of the competition for the award of spectrum licences is now a matter for the statutorily independent regulator ComReg.   The latter in turn operates under an EU Regulatory framework which requires that the allocation and assignment of such radio frequencies is based on open, transparent and non-discriminatory procedures for the granting of the licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">I would point out to the Deputy that the Government has directed Departments to examine the recommendations of the Tribunal and to report back on them with four weeks.  In addition the Government will embark on a programme of major reform of political and public administration as set out in the Programme for Government.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_864">As I outlined in my reply to Priority Questions Nos. 24 and 25 today, Ireland's petroleum potential is largely unproven and this is likely to remain the case until there is a significant increase in the level of exploration activity, particularly exploration drilling.  Ireland competes with other countries to attract mobile international exploration investment. It is important that Ireland maintains a licensing regime that appropriately reflects both the risks and rewards of investing in petroleum exploration in the Irish offshore, relative to investing in exploration in other jurisdictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">A comprehensive review of Ireland's licensing terms was carried out in 2007 by independent economic consultants, following which both the fiscal and non-fiscal licensing terms were revised.  The revised terms apply to all exploration licences issued since 1 January 2007 and provide for a new profit resource rent tax of up to 15% in addition to the 25% corporate tax rate previously applying.  The revised terms ensure that the return to the State would be up to 40% in the case of very profitable fields.</p>
            <p eId="para_866">Ireland's petroleum taxation rate is deliberately pitched at a level that is consistent with countries such as France, Portugal and Spain, who like Ireland have limited petroleum production, rather than with major petroleum producers such as Norway or the UK.</p>

         asked the

            <p eId="para_868">The Public Obligation Service (PSO) levy has been in place since 2001 and is the support mechanism for peat generation and the development of renewable electricity.  The PSO also supports the output of two gas fuelled power plants built in 2005 to secure much needed generation capacity at the time.  The levy is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by the three peat stations and renewable energy sources.  The levy has supported the connection of more than 1,400 MW of renewable energy, mostly wind, to the electricity grid over the last decade.</p>
            <p eId="para_869">The Commission for Energy Regulation determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers.  Its legal basis and method of calculation are set out in the regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">In general terms the cost of the PSO levy to the consumer tends to be low or zero when gas and oil prices are high, as in these cases the market adequately rewards renewable and conventional generation including the peat stations.  However, when fossil fuel prices fall, peat and renewable generators become less competitive and suppliers need to be compensated for purchasing their output.  The significant fall in oil and gas prices over the last two years gave rise to the re-emergence of the PSO levy on all customers' bills from October 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">In line with the Programme for Government commitment to review and reform the PSO levy, I have firstly requested my Department to review the operation of the peat PSO to ensure that it is as cost efficient as possible.  The bulk of the cost of the PSO levy currently derives from supporting the peat stations.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">I have also asked my Department to confirm that the development of renewable energy, supported by the PSO levy, is being achieved in a cost effective way.  Ireland already has the second lowest rates of renewable energy supports across Europe.  It is also vitally important to guard against market and investor uncertainty by sending the message that supports for renewable energy will continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_873">It is the case that the development of renewable energy in Ireland is lowering electricity prices to consumers in the long run and that the existing feed-in tariff reflected in the PSO levy is essential to support this development.</p>

            <p eId="para_879">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter in the first instance for private sector service providers operating in a liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</p>
            <p eId="para_880">In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) represents such an intervention.  Broadband services are now available throughout the entire NBS area.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be isolated cases of premises throughout the country that are not capable of receiving a broadband service.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (e.g., suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, or no ‘line of sight' from the premises to the wireless base station).</p>
            <p eId="para_882">The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I intend to formally announce the launch of a Rural Broadband Scheme in the coming weeks.  This scheme will aim to provide a basic broadband service to individual un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_884">There will be a competitive process to engage a service provider who will offer a broadband service to qualified applicants under the scheme.  While the exact details have yet to be finalised, I expect that the service offered under this scheme would at least match the service offered under the NBS and that the scheme will be fully rolled out by the end of 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_886">As I outlined in my reply to Priority Questions Nos. 24 and 25 today, while Ireland has recognised potential as a petroleum producing area, the Irish offshore is relatively underexplored.  As a result Ireland's petroleum potential is largely unproven.  This is likely to continue to be the case, until there is an increase in the level of exploration activity offshore Ireland and there is an increase in the level of exploration drilling in particular.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">Ireland competes with other countries, both in Europe and much further afield, to attract mobile international exploration investment to Ireland.  To that end, it is important that Ireland maintains a licensing regime that appropriately reflects both the risks and rewards of investing in petroleum exploration in the Irish offshore, relative to investing in exploration in other jurisdictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">In relation to periodic publicity about Ireland's oil and gas resources, recent assessments of yet-to-find potential, based on petroleum systems studies, indicate a total reserve potential in the order of 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent (oil and/or gas) for the offshore frontier basins west of Ireland. This divides roughly into 6.5 billion barrels of oil and 20 trillion cubic feet of gas. It should be understood that these figures only represent ‘potential' reserves, or the reserves that might be present based on geological criteria and regional comparisons, and that they have not been discovered. Actual reserve figures are likely to vary widely from these estimates and will not be known without a dramatic increase in the level of exploration activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">A comprehensive review of Ireland fiscal terms was carried out in 2007.  This review, which was underpinned by independent economic analysis, considered the appropriateness of Ireland's licensing terms in comparison to other European countries that Ireland competes with for exploration investment. The review concluded that there might be potential to capture a higher share for the State on more profitable finds, but that the potential for this should not be over estimated.  The outcome of that review was the introduction of a supplementary tax, known as a profit resource rent tax, of between 5% and 15% that will apply in the case of more profitable fields. The supplementary tax would be payable in addition to the standard petroleum corporate tax of 25% which is of course double the standard corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  Since that review concluded in 2007 there has been no significant change in terms of the level of exploration activity and no new commercial discoveries have been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">As I have already identified, the level of exploration activity will continue to be the critical factor in Ireland obtaining a benefit from our indigenous oil and gas resources.  We need to get drilling levels above the recent levels of one or two wells per year, if more commercial discoveries are to be made.  As part of an ongoing strategy to attract new companies and new investment, my Department is currently running a licensing round that is deliberately structured to attract new exploration companies to Ireland. This licensing round, which closes at the end of May, also aims to encourage companies to look at areas of the Irish offshore where little data currently exists and as a consequence, little is known of the potential prospectivity of these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">While I will keep the licensing terms, both fiscal and non-fiscal, under review in light of relevant future developments, at this juncture I believe that the focus should be on attracting a larger share of mobile international exploration investment to Ireland, to increase the chances of new commercial discoveries being made</p>

         in view of the turbulent events in the oil producing countries of north Africa and the Middle East and in light of the fact that Ireland imports 23% of its oil from Libya, the measures he is planning to take to develop renewable energy sources and develop jobs in this area to reduce our dependence on imported oil.

            <p eId="para_893">International Energy Agency statistics show that Ireland obtained 23.3% of its crude oil supply from Libya in 2010, which represents 8.78% of Ireland's total crude and refined oil imports in that particular year.  The crude oil was sourced on the commercial market.  There is no strategic dependence on oil from Libya.  The Whitegate refinery is currently sourcing adequate crude oil supplies on the world market.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">However, the present crisis in North Africa once again underlines the imperative for Ireland and Europe to reduce dependence on fossil fuels through accelerated development of renewable energy resources and radically enhanced energy efficiency.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">In line with Ireland's binding national target under the EU Renewable Energy Directive, the National Renewable Energy Action Plan sets out the measures being taken to deliver 40% renewable electricity by 2020.  The target is ambitious but is achievable.  In the last five years Ireland has doubled the amount of renewable electricity on the system from over 6% in 2005 to over 13% in 2010.  Reducing our national reliance on oil in the transport sector is a daunting challenge.  Ensuring that Ireland is to the forefront of the electrification of transport over the next decade will be a critical priority together with progressive penetration of biofuels in to the fuel market.</p>

However it is important to note that all applicants for enumerator positions were assessed at interview on their availability for census work (given the need to make frequent calls to households at different times of the day); those in full-time work were assessed as having low availability and so would be unlikely to be offered enumerator positions ahead of other suitably qualified candidates. It is more likely that those in existing employment are working part-time elsewhere. It was not open to the CSO to exclude people on this basis. Out of the total of 4,854 enumerators, 740 indicated at interview that they were on the Live Register representing 15% of all enumerators.</p>

            <p eId="para_987">The Government attaches great importance to the continuing development of Ireland's relations with Africa as a whole, and with individual African countries.  My Department manages a significant development cooperation programme, Irish Aid, which is strongly focused on sub-Saharan Africa.  Our broader relations with Africa are managed through our Embassy network across that continent, as well as through our relationships with the European Union, the United Nations, and other international bodies.   While development needs remain very evident, Africa is also undergoing major political, economic and social change, and it is important that we consider ways of strengthening our approach to Africa in order to respond to these changes. Trade, investment and business-to-business exchange are increasingly important emerging facets of our relationship with Africa, and we will be sharpening our focus on identifying opportunities in these areas.  As  the Deputy will be aware, officials in my Department have been examining ways to strengthen all aspects of our relations with our African partners in the political, economic, and development spheres, including through the development of a strategy for the mutually beneficial enhancement of trade between Ireland and Africa.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">Some practical work has already been done in this area in terms of staff training and enhancing the capacity of our Embassies in Africa to undertake economic and trade work and we are looking to build on this.  The enhanced role for the Department of Foreign Affairs in the trade area will also facilitate greater coherence in this regard in Africa. A broad review of our relations with Africa, and options for strengthening these, is at an advanced stage in my Department, and I envisage that I will be making a more detailed statement on our plans and priorities in this regard in the near future.  I would underline that poverty, hunger and under-development continue to be the greatest obstacles for Africa, and efforts to eradicate these will continue to be a key focus in our work with African partners.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
            <p eId="para_993">The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were agreed by world leaders at the United Nations in 2000 as the framework for international development policy up to 2015. For the first time the MDGs provide a clearly measurable way in which the world can track progress in relation to reducing global poverty. Last September, the MDG Review Summit in New York assessed progress against each of the Goals and set out the measures required for their achievement by 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">Hunger is one of the key determinants of poverty and exclusion. The first MDG aims to halve the proportion of people suffering from poverty and hunger. Yet almost one billion people go hungry each evening. This is unacceptable. As a result of the work of the Hunger Task Force, reducing hunger has been placed as a key pillar of Ireland's development cooperation policy and indeed foreign policy. In Ireland this is an issue which has garnered support right across the political spectrum. The Government will continue to ensure that hunger remains at the forefront of our development efforts in the years ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">In particular I would emphasise the close cooperation we have with the US in advancing this priority. At the recent St Patrick's Day meetings in Washington the Taoiseach and President Obama discussed hunger. The Tánaiste and Secretary of State Clinton also discussed the matter and agreed to work closely in the coming months to galvanise action, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa, to combat under-nutrition in pregnant women and infants. We are also working closely with our EU partners to advance the issue. In my role as Minister of State with responsibility for development I intend to visit a number of our Programme Countries in the coming months to see what more Ireland can do to prioritise this issue and to strengthen our work on hunger.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">The Government remains strongly committed to working with our partners for the achievement of the MDGs, with a strong focus on sub-Saharan Africa and on the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger.</p>

It is advertised internationally to attract the most highly qualified young candidates in the countries in which Fulbright operates to study at America's leading universities.  Each year it provides successful candidates with fully funded PhD studies worth approximately $60,000 per annum for a maximum of 5 years. To date, Ireland has had 5 successful awardees in the competition which opens in February and closes in May two years before the relevant academic year.  Ireland's two International Fulbright Science and Technology Awardees, for the 2011 — 2012 academic year, Ms Ellen Roche and Ms Elizabeth O'Sullivan, were notified on 3  September 2010 and are currently finalising their choice of US institution. The 2012-13 competition for the International Fulbright Science and Technology Award opened in February 2011.  The deadline for applications is noon on 18 May 2011.  Eligible candidates will be interviewed thereafter by the US-Ireland Commission for Educational Exchange and the applications of shortlisted candidates must then be forwarded to an international selection panel in the US by 15 June 2011.  Candidates successful in the 2012 — 2013 competition will be notified in September 2011<b>.</b>

            <p eId="para_1005">Addressing the situation of the undocumented Irish and reforming our migration arrangements with the United States are important priorities for the Government in its relationship with the US Administration and Congress.    I believe that the inclusion of Ireland in an amended reciprocal E3 visa scheme is the most effective way of creating new opportunities for Irish citizens to work in the US on a two year renewable visa. The introduction of such a scheme, which has attracted support from a  number of members of Congress from both parties, will require the passage of legislation in Congress.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">The successful passage of E3 visa legislation would not provide a comprehensive solution to the situation of the undocumented Irish.  It would, however, strengthen the human bridge between the two countries, which underpins our excellent existing bilateral relations, and provide a mechanism for Irish nationals seeking to work in the USA in the future.  The most realistic long term solution for our undocumented citizens remains through comprehensive reform of the immigration system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007">The Taoiseach raised the issue of the undocumented and the potential for the introduction of an E3 visa with President Obama during his St Patrick's Day visit to Washington.

            <p eId="para_1008">While the agenda for President Obama's visit to Ireland in May is not yet finalised, I expect that immigration related issues will be raised by the Government in our meetings with the President.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">The Government is encouraged by President Obama's continued commitment to addressing the question of immigration reform. Speaking as recently as 28 March, the President reiterated his support for comprehensive reform of the immigration system, allowing a pathway to citizenship for those who are just looking for a better life and contributing to the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_1013">The United States operates a range of non-immigrant visa programmes to facilitate entry into that country by nationals of other countries to undertake a number of work related and other activities. One such scheme is the H-1B visa which is limited to applicants with a US sponsoring company, working in a number of specialty occupations.    Under US Congressional legislation, a maximum of 65,000 H-1B visas can be issued each year. It is a requirement that the visa holder has completed a specific course of higher education. The quota of visas can often be filled early in the year. Figures from the US State Department indicate that 616 H-1B-type visas were issued to Irish citizens in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">The participation of Irish citizens in US visa programmes helps to maintain the human bridge between the United States and Ireland and underpin the excellent relations between the two countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_1018">Ireland conducts its international relations in accordance with the values set out in Article 29 of the Constitution.  These include commitment to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality, adherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes, and acceptance of the generally recognised principles of international law.  Ireland attaches considerable importance to the peaceful resolution of conflict and, together with other countries which share these values, works towards this end through its action in the United Nations, the European Union and other international obligations.  Partly because of the history which has shaped us and our experience of the Northern Ireland peace process, we bring a distinctive perspective to the resolution of conflict around the world and I look forward to the opportunities which our Chairmanship of the OSCE next year will provide for a strengthened Irish contribution in this respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1019">As a member of the United Nations and in accordance with the UN Charter, we also acknowledge that primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security rests with the UN Security Council, and we agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility the Council acts on behalf of all members.  We take seriously the obligation we have assumed to give the organisation every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the Charter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020">This obligation is reflected in our readiness to participate in a significant number of peace operations authorised by the United Nations, whether these are undertaken under direct UN command or are led by the European Union or by NATO, and in our support for the actions of other States acting in pursuit of and consistent with Security Council Resolutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1021">As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland is not a member of NATO.  I foresee no change in this position.  Our relations with NATO are conducted within the framework of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) and Partnership for Peace (PfP), which we joined in 1999.  The EAPC is a forum for consultation involving all PfP participants on a wide range of issues, from peacekeeping to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.  Participation in the PfP has also strengthened the ability of the Defence Forces to participate effectively and safely with other nations in UN-authorised operations.</p>

            <p eId="para_1030">I refer the Deputy to my answer to Question No. 16 answered on 22 March, which is outlined as follows.  A number of countries, principally in Latin America and including Brazil, Argentina and Chile, have recently decided to recognise a Palestinian state.  This is in addition to those states — mostly in Africa or in the Islamic world — who have recognised Palestine for many years.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1031">Over thirty years ago, Ireland, in a speech by my predecessor of the day, the late Brian Lenihan, was the first EU Member State to declare that the resolution of the Palestinian issue must involve the establishment of a Palestinian state.  That is now the policy of the EU and of the international community.  I share the commitment of successive Irish Governments to this policy and will be working towards its realisation.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1032">It would be premature to declare such recognition now, in advance of actual control of the territory in question, a condition to which we in Ireland attach significance.  It is also important to recall that the Palestinian leadership, while clearly working towards the declaration of a State in the near future, have not yet done so.  The timing of such a declaration will be an important decision for them to take, and may involve potential negative consequences on the ground.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1033">Separately, a number of EU partners, including Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal and the UK have recently taken steps to upgrade the status of the Palestinian Delegations in their countries, largely in recognition of the continuing progress being made by Prime Minister Fayyad and the Palestinian Authority in building up the institutions of a future Palestinian state.  By a decision of the previous Government in January — which I fully endorse — the Palestinian representative office in Ireland was upgraded to Mission status, headed by an Ambassador.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1034">I very much hope to be able to extend Irish recognition of an actual, functioning Palestinian state during my time in office.</p>

            <p eId="para_1036">I take it that the Deputy is referring to recent reports of sectarian behaviour at football matches which took place in Scotland in the last month or so.  Matters of this nature are kept under constant review by the Scottish Government, which has repeatedly stated that there is no place for racism or sectarianism — in relation to any community — in Scotland.  I welcome the decision in March by the Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond to establish a Joint Action Group to implement a series of measures to support the work of football clubs, local authorities and police with communities to address alcohol misuse, sectarianism, racism, domestic abuse and violence.  I am very aware of the concerns of the Irish community in Scotland and know that they will help to contribute to this initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">We share the view of the Scottish Government that racism and sectarianism are abhorrent in all their forms and are contrary to the spirit in which any sport is played.

The following additional categories have been so determined: youth, welfare, national heritage and amenities.  In order to give effect to this statutory provision, the surplus from the National Lottery is transferred to the Exchequer on a regular basis and is applied each year to part-fund the Exchequer allocations to a specified range of expenditure subheads across various Votes.  Each year, the amount transferred to the Exchequer from the National Lottery surplus, together with details of the total Exchequer allocations to the relevant subheads, are set out in Appendix 1 of the annual "Revised Estimates for Public Services".</p>

The Valuation Act 2001 which came into effect on 2 May 2002, provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059">The basis of rateable valuation for all business premises is net annual value (NAV) i.e. the rental value of the premises.  Like all commercial property, the valuations of business premises are determined by reference to the values of comparable properties on the same valuation list.</p>
            <p eId="para_1060">Under section 27 of the Act, an owner/occupier of an individual business premises who has concerns about the valuation of their property or any part thereof, including its rateability or the method of calculation may, on payment of a statutory fee of €250, apply to the Valuation Office for a revision of the valuation.  A Revision Officer of the Commissioner is then appointed, who may carry out a revision of valuation in relation to a particular property only if a material change of circumstances (MCC) has occurred since the property was last revised.  MCC is defined in section 3 of the Act as a change of circumstances, which consist of a new building, a change in value due to structural alterations of an existing building, total or partial demolition of a building or a sub-division or amalgamation of relevant property.  The definition does not allow for a revision of valuation where the change in value is due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as roads or other infrastructural development in the vicinity of a property.  The valuation of commercial property is determined by reference to the values of comparable properties on the same valuation list.</p>

            <p eId="para_1065">The Valuation Act 2001 which came into effect on 2 May, 2002 provides for the valuation of all commercial and industrial property in the State.  I should point out that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Act and that I, as Minister for Finance, have no function in decisions in this regard.  The recent revaluation of the Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council rating authority area was undertaken after the required consultation by the Commissioner with both the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and the subsequent making by the Commissioner of the requisite Valuation Order in June 2008.  The Valuation date was 30 September 2005, the same date as was used for the revaluations of South Dublin and Fingal.  The new valuation list was published on 31 December 2010.  By reference to this list, approximately 54% of ratepayers experienced a decreased rates liability, while 46% will have an increased rates liability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1066">As provided in the Act, and as advised to all ratepayers in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area, there is provision for any ratepayer to formally appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation against the rateable valuation accorded his/her property in the valuation list published on 31 December, 2010.  These appeals are now being considered by the Commissioner.  If any ratepayer is still dissatisfied with their valuation, they can appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal and, ultimately, to the Courts on a point of law.  The purpose of a revaluation is not to increase the total amount of commercial rates collected by local authorities.  The legislation (Valuation Act 2001 and the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Act 2006) provides that the commercial rates income of local authorities in the year following a revaluation will be capped.  The only increase in the total rates income of a local authority permitted in the year following publication of the new valuation list is an increase to cover for the rate of inflation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1067">The choice of Valuation Date does not affect the overall commercial rates income of a local authority.<b>  </b>The amount of rates payable on any property is the result of multiplying two variables: the Valuation, which is in line with rental values at the Valuation Date and the ARV- the annual rate on valuation, which is calculated by the local authority.  Since the total amount of rates to be collected by the local authority is capped in the year after the revaluation takes place, the only movements are between the total amount of valuations and the ARV.</p>
            <p eId="para_1068">If the valuation date of 30 September 2005 was altered and, as a result, produced a lower total valuation overall, then the ARV would increase, so that the local authority receives the pre-determined amount of rates income in the year following the Revaluation.  Likewise, if a different valuation date produced a higher total valuation overall, then the ARV would reduce to provide the local authority with the same pre-determined amount of rates income.  Therefore, changing the date of valuation will not affect the overall amount of rates income received by a local authority in the year following Revaluation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1069">While individual increases or decreases in rates liability will inevitably be the result of a revaluation, such increases or decreases will reflect movements over time in the overall property market, and result in a fairer, more transparent rating system.</p>

I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are engaged in the Graduate stream (stream 1) on a pilot basis in its Research and Analytics Branch.  The available placements, which are in the Statistics and Economics areas, are currently advertised on the FÁS website and at <i>http://www.revenue.ie/en/about/careers/fas-work-placement/index.html.</i>  Following the outcome of this pilot, I understand Revenue will consider the rollout of the programme to other areas across the organisation.

            <p eId="para_1074">I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 73 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">The Government supports a strong policy of pay restraint within the public sector, including the application of pay caps.  On assumption of office the Taoiseach, other members of the Government and a number of other officeholders have, in line with that commitment, voluntarily reduced their salary rates, with the Taoiseach's salary now set at €200,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1076">Following the announcement of the proposed salary cap of €250,000 in the public sector in his budget 2011 speech, the then Minister for Finance acknowledged there would be contractual issues in relation to the application of that cap to current incumbents of posts.  This remains the position.  I propose to give further consideration as to how best to effect reductions in the remuneration of such posts in the light of the contractual issues identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">From information available there are 28 individuals in the Commercial State Companies (9), Non Commercial State Agencies (5), the Oireachtas (1), the Education Sector (4) and the Judiciary (9) in receipt of salaries in excess of €250,000.  There are no persons in either the Civil Service or in the Local Authorities with salaries in excess of €250,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">In addition to the above, certain Academic Consultants at professorial level in the Health Sector are in receipt of remuneration in excess of €250,000 per annum. While the HSE have confirmed that there are 168 Academic Consultants, it has advised that a break down of the numbers between professorial and other grades in the academic consultant stream by contract type is not available. However, full details of current remuneration payable to consultant grades in the Health Service Executive in respect of each contract type can be found at <i>www.hseea.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">It is to be noted that remuneration rates in the Central Bank Financial Services Authority of Ireland are solely a matter for the Board of the Bank and the Authority to determine while the remuneration packages of all National Treasury Management Authority staff (which includes the staff of the National Asset Management Authority) are negotiated on an individual contract basis and are confidential.  In these circumstances any staff in these bodies who may be in receipt of salaries in excess of €250,000 are not included in the 28 posts cited above.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">The amount of actual earnings for the first three months of 2011 of the persons in the 28 posts cited above is not available as payments are not made centrally but through each relevant person's own payroll section.  It is also to be noted that some individuals may be taking a voluntary reduction in pay. The salary to apply to future appointees to relevant positions in the public service will be considered on a case by case basis, having regard to the overall need for pay restraint.  In terms of the salaries of CEOs of Commercial State Companies such salaries require the agreement of both the relevant Minister and the Minister for Finance.<b><i> </i></b> The current arrangements for setting the remuneration of the commercial State sponsored bodies is based on comparative posts in the private sector — the last such review took place in 2007.  It is my intention to give further consideration to the overall remuneration package of CEOs of Commercial State Companies.  In the interim the salary to apply to future appointees to any such positions that fall vacant will be considered on a case by case basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_1083">I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 86 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">The Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 ('the Act') enacted in December 2010 provides legislative scope for appropriate burden-sharing in relation to subordinated debt.  A subordinated liabilities order can be made under the Act in relation to the subordinated liabilities of a relevant institution to which the Minister has provided or intends to provide financial support.  These orders can postpone, terminate, suspend or otherwise modify specific rights, terms and obligations associated with subordinated liabilities or require the institution concerned to acquire the subordinated liabilities for a specified consideration.  Burden-sharing can also be achieved under the Act by granting subordinated creditors a shareholding in the relevant institution and where this happens the debt owed to affected subordinated creditors can become instead an equity interest in the relevant institution.  No subordinated liabilities orders have been made under the Act to date.  It is important to note that a number of institutions have, however, undertaken liability management exercises where they have purchased their securities at a discount thereby generating a gain for the institution and an effective burden sharing with creditors and investors.  Sub-debt holders have contributed, through this channel, almost €10 billion to the recapitalisation of the Irish banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">Regarding burden sharing with senior bondholders, as I set out in my Statement to the House on Banking Matters last Thursday, it is vital that, after going through the reorganisation, the proposed three banks (Bank of Ireland, AIB/EBS, and IL&amp;P) are able to operate in the market place as strong banks with a positive future and ongoing positive relationships with counterparties of all kinds.  Therefore the Government has decided, informed by the reservations of the ECB, that these banks will not burden share with senior bondholders of their constituent banks, whether guaranteed or unguaranteed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086">It is Government policy to work out Anglo Irish Bank and INBS in an orderly manner over time and to minimise further injections of taxpayer capital into either institution.  Should additional capital be required, the Government will then consult with the external partners on the timeframe and means of recapitalising those institutions at minimum cost to the taxpayer, having regard to the financial stability impacts in Ireland and abroad.</p>

            <p eId="para_1088">The Government Programme includes a commitment to establish a Fiscal Advisory Council.  Indeed, the issue of reform of Ireland's Budgetary framework, including the establishment of a Fiscal Advisory Council, is a priority for the Government.  As mentioned by the Deputy, the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support requires that such a body be in place by the end of the second quarter of 2011.  It is the Government's intention that this deadline will be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089">In this regard, there would be merit in providing for a Fiscal Advisory Council in law as this would underline the Government's commitment to fiscal reform and to the independence of the body.  At the same time, the establishment of such a council does not strictly need to be underpinned by law and could proceed in advance of legislation on fiscal reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090">The question of the legislative arrangements surrounding fiscal reform is a matter which has yet to be considered by the Government. The Deputy may wish to note that last Friday my Department published a discussion document on its website entitled <i>Reforming Ireland’s Budgetary Framework</i> with a view to assisting debate and to setting out a range of potential policy options on this important issue.  It is intended that in due course a seminar will be organised to allow for discussion and debate among all interested parties and experts with a view to arriving at the optimum set of proposals for fiscal reform which can then be taken forward for Government approval and subsequent implementation, within the timeframe already set out.</p>

            <p eId="para_1092">One of the purposes set out in the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 is "to contribute to the social and economic development of the State".  Where it can be shown that, for example, providing units for social and affordable housing needs can create a commercial proposition for NAMA, then NAMA may play a role in the provision of social and affordable housing.  I understand that officials of NAMA have had some contact with officials of the Department of Environment Heritage and Local Government, local authorities and other public bodies to explore the scope for such arrangements.  It is not intended at this stage to amend the NAMA legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1094">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the EU VAT Directive 2006 permits Member States to limit the scope of the VAT exemption for betting, lotteries and other forms of gambling.  Under Irish VAT law, the exemption for gambling is confined to licensed betting, betting on the Tote and lotteries.  Accordingly, all gambling and gaming activities carried on in casinos and private members clubs in the State are regarded for VAT purposes as taxable activities, and the persons carrying on such activities must register and account for VAT in respect of those activities where their annual turnover from the activities exceeds a threshold of €37,500.  The rate of VAT applicable is the standard rate, which in Ireland is currently 21%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">The VAT rating of goods or services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  There are no provisions in the VAT Directive that permit the reduced rate (currently 13.5%) or the zero rate to be applied to gambling or gaming activities.</p>

            <p eId="para_1098">Occupational pension contributions made by public service employees are not generally paid into a separate or ring-fenced fund.  The vast majority of public service occupational pension schemes are financed on a pay-as-you-go basis, with the annual cost of pensions being met from current revenue.  The contributions received from employees are usually recorded under the Appropriations-in-Aid heading of the appropriate Vote, rather than netted off against pension payments.  There are a small number of public service bodies who have funded pension schemes, such as the Commission for Communications Regulation, and scheme member's pension contributions are paid into the fund in these cases.</p>

Consequently, with effect from 1 January 2011, biofuels are subject to full mineral oil tax rates; however, unlike conventional fuels, biofuels are exempt from the carbon charge.  The promotion of biofuel is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p>

The National Biofuel Obligation requires suppliers of road transport fuels to ensure that 4% of their volumes sold on the Irish market is biofuel; it will underpin delivery of the national biofuel target and will take full account of EU biofuels policy, including the sustainability criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">Experience in Ireland and elsewhere has shown that short term fiscal measures cannot provide sufficient certainty to producers, and that only an obligation type system can ensure that Ireland seizes the opportunity to take advantage of biofuel, and that the considerable opportunities for the indigenous production of biofuel are exploited.</p>

            <p eId="para_1129">As I stated in the Dáil last week, a new bank will be created from Bank of Ireland which will be smaller, more focused on core operations, better funded and better capitalised and more focused on serving the economy of the island of Ireland.  The bank will split into separately managed non-core and core divisions and will begin to shed €30 billion of assets by 2013.  It will become a significantly more domestically focused bank and retain its businesses in Northern Ireland, its Post Office joint venture in the United Kingdom and limited capital markets businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1130">The bank will be given time to raise additional private capital and limit the State's need to invest in the banks but the Government will step in to ensure that the bank meets the Central Bank capital requirements if it needs to.

It will be a largely domestically focused bank, retaining its Northern Ireland operations and certain deposit funded operations in the UK.

            <p eId="para_1136">Consequent upon the results of the stress testing on Irish Life and Permanent (ILP) and the determination of its capital requirements by the Central Bank, ILP must raise a substantial additional equity capital which will require a significant restructuring of their business and the disposal of certain non-banking assets.  The sale of these assets should raise significant capital for the Group.  It is the intention of the State, subject as necessary to any approval required under State Aid rules, to provide the remaining capital to the Group which will involve, in all likelihood a majority stake in the Group being held by the State.  This approach will provide sufficient flexibility to the State to decide where the Group fits into the planned revised banking landscape outlined above as the radical restructuring of the Group evolves.</p>

The sum of €572,878,664.46 was also paid into the Exchequer on 28 October 2010 in respect of fees and interest accumulated under ELG. This means that a total of €1,333,346,232.06 has been paid into the Exchequer in respect of both Schemes since 30th September 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1139">A further sum of €282,269,427 has been received in fees under ELG from the participating institutions since 28 October 2010.  The amounts expected to be received in respect of guarantee income from the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee are: 2011 — €800 million, 2012 — €300 million, 2013 — €150 million, and 2014 — €150 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1140">The Deputy will of course appreciate that, in accordance with the fundamental accounting principle of prudence, all forecasts made by my Department must be based on the current position vis-à-vis EU State aid approval. Therefore, forecasts for the period after June 2011 are only in respect of fees for long-term debt issued under the ELG Scheme before end-June, which are paid for the lifetime of the debt up to five years.  Accordingly, the Deputy should note that these estimates may change if there are changes to the availability and scope of the guarantee or to the level of guarantee fees approved under EU State aid rules.</p>

            <p eId="para_1162">The legal position is that in the absence of a subordination agreement, where a financial institution is being wound up the principle that applies is <i>pari passu</i>, meaning all unsecured creditors have equal ranking to be repaid by the financial institution. So, where there is a shortfall in assets all unsecured creditors are entitled to an equal dividend. The principle of creditor equality is also enshrined in the Credit Institutions Winding Up Directive 2001/17/EC.</p>
            <p eId="para_1163">In the context of a company that is continuing in business as a going concern the principle of pari passu does not apply although the effect is similar. Where a company has debts, they are liable to pay those debts and each debtor has an equal right to be repaid whether that person's debt arises on foot of a bond or a deposit. In either case the terms of the repayment will obviously be determined by the instrument creating or evidencing the debt — repayable on demand or at a certain future time. I would add that the principle of equal entitlement to be repaid their debts as amongst unsecured creditors is subject to the absence of one of them being obliged by contract to be postponed in favour of another.</p>
            <p eId="para_1164">It must also be remembered that depositors who suffer a loss in the event of a financial institution being wound up insolvent are entitled to compensation under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme and/or the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme. The Deposit Guarantee Scheme covers all retail deposits with all credit institutions authorised in Ireland (including credit unions) up to a maximum of 100,000 euro  per qualifying depositor per institution.  Deposits in excess of 100,000 euro that meet the terms and condition of the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee are also guaranteed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1184">The section in the Finance Act 2010 that provides for application of the carbon tax to solid fuels (coal and commercial peat) is subject to a Ministerial Commencement Order.  This approach was primarily adopted in order to allow time for a robust mechanism to be put in place to improve the control of high sulphur coal being sourced from Northern Ireland suppliers.  The Department of Environment in conjunction with the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) have proposed new regulations for coal which would effectively extend the existing voluntary agreement for low sulphur coal to the entire State on a compulsory regulatory basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185">A stakeholder committee was established last year to provide an input into the proposed regulations. Under EU law dealing with technical barriers to trade, Ireland is required to notify the European Commission of all draft technical regulations concerning products before they are adopted in national law. Formal notification of the proposed new standard for coal issued from NSAI to the EU Commission in November 2010. It is understood that the Commission's response is expected in the near-term.</p>

            <p eId="para_1187">The position is that legislation to provide the same tax treatment for civil partners as that provided for spouses is currently in preparation.  It is intended that the legislation will have effect for the tax year 2011 and subsequent years.  As the Deputy is aware the shortened timescale for this year's Finance Act meant that it was not possible to include the legislation in that Act but it is intended that the legislation will be put before the House shortly as part of Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011.  The treatment of civil partners for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.  However, I am informed that the social welfare legislative provisions for the introduction of civil partnership are contained in the Social Welfare and Pension Act 2010 which came into effect on 1 January 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_1209">The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 provides for the reduction in the pay rates of all persons employed by public service bodies with effect from 1 January 2010.  Such reductions apply irrespective of whether a particular post is funded in whole or in part through non-Exchequer funds or income.  The school secretaries (and other non-teaching staff) referred to in the question are, whether employed in recognised public or private schools, deemed to be public servants within the meaning of and for the purposes of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.  This position has been confirmed by legal advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1210">The former Minister for Finance approved a temporary exemption under Section 6 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act for certain categories of workers in the education sector (including certain school secretaries) until 31 December 2010. Accordingly, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act has been applied to those specific categories of workers in the education sector since 1 January 2011 only.</p>
            <p eId="para_1211">It is important to understand that while there is a variety of staff across the education sector who are employed by public service bodies but who are either wholly or partly funded from non-Exchequer sources, there are also staff undertaking the same or very similar duties whose posts are fully Exchequer funded.  All of these staff have now been subject to the terms of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act.</p>

            <p eId="para_1213">I have been informed by the Central Bank that issues such as the process in place in respect of the setting of interest rates are usually covered in the terms and conditions applying to a particular mortgage.  The Consumer Protection Code, issued by the Central Bank,  requires that a regulated entity must provide each consumer with the terms and conditions attaching to a product or service, before the consumer enters into a contract for that product or service, or before the cooling-off period (if any) expires. A regulated entity must also ensure that all information provided to consumers is clear and comprehensible and that key items are brought to the attention of the consumer.  The method of presentation must not disguise, diminish or obscure important information.  In this regard, the bank referred to by the Deputy may impose the conditions in relation to the lending rate as long as it complies with the requirements of the Consumer Protection Code and all other applicable legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1216">The security required in commercial property transactions and the banks' acceptance or not of these undertakings is a matter for the legal and other divisions of the individual banks and I am aware that some banks do not accept them even where the amount is less than €75,000.

            <p eId="para_1224">I propose to take Questions Nos. 101, 103 and 104 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1225">As agreed in the Programme for National Recovery 2011 to 2016, the Government will examine a number of proposals aimed at helping mortgage-holders in difficulty.  These will include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1226">Increasing mortgage interest relief to 30% for First Time Buyers in 2004-2008 (from the current sliding scale of 20% to 25% depending on the year the mortgage was taken out).</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1227">Directing any mortgage provider in receipt of State support to present Government with a plan of how it intends to cut its costs, over and above existing plans, in a fair manner by a sufficient amount to forego a 25 basis point increase on its variable rate mortgage.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1228">I ntroducing a two year moratorium on repossessions of modest family homes where a family makes an honest effort to pay their mortgage.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1229">Fast-tracking personal bankruptcy reform needed to bring Ireland into line with best international standards, such as introducing a flexible discharge period for "honest bankrupts", defined as one that has materially complied with the Tax, NAMA and Companies Acts among others.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1230">Converting the Money Advice and Budgeting Service into a strengthened Personal Debt Management Agency with strong legal powers.  The agency will support families who make an honest effort to deal with their debts, including non-mortgage debt, providing protection from their creditors where appropriate, so that they have time to sort out their affairs.  In order to do so, the Personal Debt Management Agency will have quasi-judicial status.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1231">Making greater use of Mortgage Interest Supplement to support families who cannot meet their mortgage payments, which is a better and cheaper option than paying rent supplement after a family loses their home.</p>
            <p eId="para_1232">The Deputy will be aware that the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt produced two Reports, an Interim Report published in July 2010 and a Final Report published in November 2010.  All of the Expert Group's recommendations are listed in Chapter 2 of the Final Report. They can be accessed at www.finance.gov.ie .</p>
            <p eId="para_1233">Since the publication of the Reports, the Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) has been revised by the Central Bank to reflect many of the recommendations of the Expert Group including key recommendations relating to the introduction by all regulated lenders of a standardised Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).  The most significant changes in the revised CCMA include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1234">Borrowers in arrears who co-operate with the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) are  not charged penalty interest charges;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1235">Harassment of borrowers through unsolicited communications is outlawed; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1236">Borrowers in financial difficulties, but not in arrears, are allowed to come under the MARP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1237">The revised CCMA was published on 6 December 2010 and came into effect on 1 January 2011.  The revised CCMA can be accessed at www.centralbank.ie  . Lenders are required to comply with the CCMA as a matter of law but have been given a period of six months grace, ending on 30 June 2011, to put in place the requisite systems and training of staff necessary to support the implementation of the MARP.  In addition, the Central Bank has also written to lenders to issue directions under Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which will mean that lenders cannot impose arrears charges or penalty interest on borrowers who are co-operating with the MARP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1238">The Deputy will also be aware of the existing importance of the Mortgage Interest Supplement (MIS) Scheme and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) in assisting consumers who have fallen into arrears or who are experiencing difficulties servicing their mortgage repayments.  The MIS Scheme currently supports approximately 18,000 mortgage-holders while MABS provides a national, free, confidential and independent service operating from 53 offices nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_1239">Regarding the question on replacing the courts repossession system, I am unclear as to whether the Deputy is suggesting that neither lenders nor borrowers should have ultimate recourse to the courts in the event of other avenues being exhausted.  Insofar as the regulation of lender policies in this area is concerned, the Deputy may wish to note certain provisions contained in the CCMA.  For example, Provision 46 of the CCMA states the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1240">"The lender must not apply to the courts to commence legal action for repossession of the borrower's primary residence, until every reasonable effort has been made to agree an alternative arrangement with the borrower or his/her nominated representative."</p>
            <p eId="para_1241">Provision 50 of the CCMA states the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1242">"In cases where legal action to obtain an Order for Possession has commenced, a lender must endeavour to maintain contact with the borrower or his/her nominated representative. If an alternative repayment arrangement is agreed between the parties before an Order for Possession is granted, the lender must put the legal proceedings on hold, for the period during which the borrower adheres to the terms of the alternative repayment arrangement." Thus, the CCMA effectively prohibits lenders from pursuing and continuing with court based repossessions of a borrower's primary residence, without having first sought to agree alternative arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">The Central Bank's quarterly data series on Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions show that the level of repossession activity in the courts, with respect to the primary residence of borrowers, can be considered very low in comparison with the scale of mortgage arrears pertaining.  For example, the level of home repossessions per hundred thousand mortgages in the UK is over 5 times greater than the Irish rate.  Furthermore, it can be observed that the majority of repossessions taking place are not by way of a court order, rather via voluntary surrenders and abandonments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1245">I stated in my announcement of 31 March 2011, to the Dáil on banking matters, that the banking system must be the enabler of economic recovery by restoring public and market confidence in its financial health, management competence and ethical integrity.  The Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR) and Prudential Liquidity Assessment Review (PLAR) examinations undertaken by the Central Bank, which are a component part of the EU-IMF Programme, are designed to restore market confidence to Ireland and, in particular, to the State's finances and our banks.  As a result, the present exercise is on an exceptionally intensive and elaborate basis and is designed to respond to market scepticism about our banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">Under the PCAR stress testing, additional capital is required in respect of loan assets arising from personal debt across all four of the examined banks.  The Government will ensure that all of the tested banks are recapitalised in respect of these additional requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">The results of the PCAR and PLAR on Irish Life and Permanent concluded that the Group required further capital of €4 billion.  This will entail a significant restructuring of their business and the disposal of certain non-banking assets.  The sale of these assets should raise significant capital for the Group.  It is the intention of the State, subject as necessary to any approval required under State Aid rules, to provide the remaining capital to the Group which will involve, in all likelihood a majority stake in the Group being held by the State.  This approach will provide sufficient flexibility to the State to decide where the Group fits into the planned revised banking landscape, outlined by me to the Dáil on 31 March 2011 in my Statement on Banking Matters, as the radical restructuring of the Group evolves.</p>

            <p eId="para_1300">Within the central government area, the Accounting Officer is normally the Secretary General or civil service head of a Department or Office to whom the Minister for Finance has assigned responsibility for preparing the annual Appropriation Account for each vote under his/her charge.

            <p eId="para_1301">The special nature of the Accounting Officer's responsibilities requires that there <i> </i>are specific procedures to be followed where there is a difference of opinion between the Accounting Officer and the Minister on an issue where the Accounting Officer has a responsibility, and the Accounting Officer considers that the Minister’s opinion is not a reasonable one.  In such circumstances, the guidelines for public financial procedures<b><i> </i></b>provide that the Accounting Officer should inform his/her Minister in writing of his or her view, the reasons for it and suggest a consultation with the Department of Finance.

            <p eId="para_1303">The Royal Irish Academy is an All-Ireland, independent academic body that promotes study in the sciences, humanities and social sciences.  Its mission is inter alia to promote excellence in scholarship, organise lectures, conferences, academic exchanges and visiting fellowships, manage national research and publication projects and publish academic journals etc.  The Academy is funded through the Higher Education Authority.  Core grant funding amounting to €3.5 million was provided to the Academy in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1304">The internal disbursement of such funding is a matter for the Academy and my Department has no role in its day to day operational affairs.  However, I understand that the issue referred to by the Deputy relates to the award of a contract in respect of typesetting for the publication of the Academy's journals, the value of which is in the region of €3,500.  Whilst the vast majority of the Academy's typesetting is done within the Academy, journal typesetting requires specific skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1305">The Academy is bound by best practice in public procurement under the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies to choose the most economically advantageous tender following an invitation to tender. As the work in question was less than €5,000, the Academy in line with best procurement practice sought five quotes for the work in question.  In this case, the contract was awarded to an Irish company based in Dublin who the Academy understands outsourced a portion of its work outside of Ireland.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_1330">I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 165 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">I wish to advise the Deputies that a proposal for an academy for children with autism has been received by officials in my Department who will revert to the organisation in question shortly.  However it is important to emphasise that the proposal will be considered in the context of my Department's policy in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1332">My Department's policy is focused on ensuring that all children including those with autism can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including ABA, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. As each child with autism is unique it is important that children have access to a range of interventions so their broader needs can be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1333">My Department's policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated. Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school. Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports. In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios. Special needs assistants may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.</p>
            <p eId="para_1334">Reflective of the important role of continuing professional development my Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) and Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) through the Special Education Support Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1335">The Deputies will be familiar with the ABA pilot scheme which was funded by my Department for the past decade. All of the centres which participated in this scheme have been granted recognition as special schools for children with autism. These schools will operate in line with my Department's policy. I am pleased to update the Deputies that following their recognition the new schools are currently progressing well in the transitional phase.  Eight schools have opened and the remaining five are scheduled to open shortly. It is my intention to continue to support this transitional process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1336">The pilot scheme was established in the absence of a network of school-based special classes for children with autism which is now available. The Deputies will be aware that the establishment of this network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 430 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1337">I am aware that my officials have met previously with some members of the group who have submitted the proposal for the establishment of an academy for children with autism. The need for a meeting with my officials will be considered as part of the examination of the proposal.</p>

As part of this, a thorough reform of the Irish curriculum and the way Irish is taught at primary and second level will be undertaken. The priority is to take steps to improve the quality and effectiveness of the teaching of Irish.  When these steps have been implemented,  the question of whether Irish should be optional at Leaving Certificate will be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1363">A  revised Leaving Certificate curriculum in Irish began in all schools in September 2010 for first examination in 2012. The revised programme provides for an increase in the proportion of marks available for oral assessment to 40%, and is aimed at  promoting a significant shift in emphasis towards Irish as a spoken language, where students can communicate and interact in a spontaneous way, and where Irish is spoken every day in schools. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment  has been asked to review this syllabus in the light of the experiences of students in the first examination.</p>

            <p eId="para_1402">The standardisation of the staffing schedule for Gaelscoileanna so that it is the same as that which applies to primary schools generally was one of a number of measures introduced in Budget 2011 by the previous Fianna Fáil /Green Party government to control and reduce teacher numbers. These changes are effective from September 2011. Given the financial constraints in which this country now finds itself, it is not possible to reverse these changes.  This change will result in a reduction of the order of 50 posts in Gaelscoileanna. There are currently a total of over 1,500 teaching posts in these schools. The Gaelscoileanna movement is well established and I do not believe that the growth of Gaelscoileanna will be impeded by way of this measure.  The actual impact at individual school level is determined as part of the allocation process for 2011/12 school year and schools are being notified in the normal manner.  This Government will endeavour to protect front line education services as best as possible. However, this must be done within the context of bringing our overall public expenditure back into line with what we can afford as a country. All areas of Government, including Gaelscoileanna, will have to manage on a reduced level of resources. The challenge will be to ensure that the resources that are being provided are used to maximum effect and in a fair manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_1405">With regard to additional financial assistance, under the terms of the Higher Education Grant Scheme which covers full time programmes of study, a student is not eligible for grant assistance in respect of a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously.  However, financial assistance may be available to eligible candidates who wish to study full time at higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained.  The main objective of this policy is to assist as many students as possible in obtaining one undergraduate degree and in progressing, where appropriate, to a postgraduate course of study. Subject to the conditions of the individual schemes, free tuition and grants are available where students are progressing to a course at a higher level.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_1441">The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government clearly states that education will be a priority for this Government and that we will endeavour to protect and enhance the educational experience of children, young people and students. To that end, we will endeavour to protect front-line services in education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1442">However, I do not intend to revisit the decision of the previous Government to withdraw resource teacher for traveller posts. The Deputy will understand that Ireland is effectively now in economic receivership because of the disastrous legacy of the last Fianna Fáil/Green Party Government. The requirements to make expenditure savings and to ensure that staffing numbers remain within the Public Service Employment Control Framework prevent me from re-visiting this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1443">The decision to withdraw resource teacher for traveller posts is broadly in keeping with the recommendation in the Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy that an integrated, collaborative and in-class learning support system should be adopted for all children, including Travellers, with an identified educational need. The strategy aims to enhance access, attendance, participation and engagement for Travellers and is underpinned by the principles of inclusion and mainstreaming with an emphasis on equality and diversity.  Traveller pupils who are eligible for learning support teaching will, from the next school year, receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools. All schools should select students for learning support on the basis of priority of need.</p>
            <p eId="para_1444">I do recognise that withdrawing all RTT posts will place a strain on existing learning support services in schools. In recognition of this, limited alleviation measures are being provided to assist schools that have high concentrations of Traveller pupils and who were previously supported by Resource Teachers for Travellers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">In respect of DEIS (Developing Equality of Opportunity in Schools) Band 1 schools, Traveller enrolments have been included in the valid enrolment for the purpose of allocating additional staffing under DEIS from the 2011/12 school year. The schools involved have already received their staffing allocations for next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">With regard to allocation of SNA support, the Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447">It is important to understand in relation to the SNA allocation process that SNA allocations are not permanent.  The level of SNA support allocated to a school is increased or decreased as pupils who qualify for SNA support enrol or leave a school.  They are also decreased where a child's care needs may have diminished over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the SNA allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of SNA support to eligible schools. The NCSE will consider applications for additional SNA support in the context of this process for the 2011/12 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">Schools will be engaging with the NCSE in this regard ahead of the next school year and the NCSE will review the SNA staffing requirements for schools, taking into account all of the students who will be attending school from September next and any new students that the school are intending to enrol. As such, the overall SNA allocation for the school referred to by the Deputy will be reviewed for the coming school year in this context.</p>

            <p eId="para_1454">Over half of the Gaelscoileanna are under catholic patronage and the redeployment of surplus teachers from these schools is through the relevant diocesan panels. Under the existing redeployment arrangements a Board of management has the right to interview, once there is more than one teacher on a panel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">My Department had discussions recently with An Foras Pátrúnachta in relation to its request for a separate panel for Gaelscoileanna under its patronage. These discussions are on-going and a key issue for my Department is how best to facilitate this request in a manner that avoids the inherent inefficiencies of a separate panel for a relatively small number of schools. Given our budgetary situation we need to have sufficient flexibility in the redeployment arrangements to ensure that surplus teachers in all schools regardless of patronage type can be readily redeployed to vacancies wherever they exist.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">The existing arrangements for the redeployment of surplus teachers operate between schools of the same patronage and are not certain to bring about the redeployment of all surplus teachers. To address the current limitations my Department will be seeking in the coming period to recommence discussions with the relevant education partners, including An Foras Pátrúnachta, on changes necessary to achieve our objective of absorbing all surplus teachers into vacancies that exist in other schools. These discussions can also deal with the request for a separate redeployment panel for Gaelscoileanna under the patronage of An Foras Pátrúnachta.</p>

            <p eId="para_1458">Music is a core part of the arts curriculum in all classes in all primary schools and comprises listening, and responding, performing and composing activities.  A revised primary curriculum in Music was introduced in 2005, supported by a national programme of professional development for teachers. I am very aware of the excellent work being done by schools using music as a key vehicle to promote inclusion and effective learning.</p>
            <p eId="para_1459">Schools in DEIS and School Completion Projects are provided with additional funding and have discretion as to how best to spend these funds within a framework of guidelines set out by my Department. The guidelines provide that funding may be used on initiatives to support retention, supporting and engaging parents and the wider community, co-operation with the youth sector, promoting cross curricular literacy initiatives, music, dance, drama, and promoting social, sport and leisure activities which impact on children's learning. The music education project falls well within the parameters of what can be funded under DEIS and the School Completion Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1460">Other than the additional resources available through DEIS and the School Completion Programme to schools designated as disadvantaged, my Department is not in a position at this time to provide additional funding to support the "Music Made Easy" programme in primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1461">However, a partnership between U2, Music Network, the International Funds for Ireland and the education sector is enabling a series of music education partnerships to be established around the country on a phased basis to provide vocal and instrumental music tuition for young people. The initiative was made possible by a donation of €5m from U2, and a commitment from the Ireland Funds to raise €2m. These contributions will fund the initiative in the early years of development, with the intention that programmes will be continued into the future with Exchequer funding when the donations cease.</p>
            <p eId="para_1462">The initiative is being managed by a company called Music Generation (<i>www.musicgeneration.ie</i>). A call for proposals was issued on 17 January 2011 seeking applications from local Music Education Partnerships across the country who wish to apply for funding. Music Generation aims to help children and young people to access music education in their own locality. The focus is on co-ordinated area-based provision as part of a partnership, not on funding for individual schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1463">Funding for up to twelve Music Education Partnerships will be awarded by Music Generation on a phased basis from 2011-2015, most likely in three locations at a time. Music Education Partnerships are eligible to apply for 50% funding, up to a maximum of €200,000 per annum over three years. The closing date for Round 1 applications was  March 31st, 2011, but there will be further rounds of the initiative each year until 12 partnerships are established.  The lead partner in the Music Education Partnership must be a statutory agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1464">The provision of music in the school curriculum, supplemented by an expanding network of music education partnerships, and the provision of some 68,000 hours of music tuition provided in certain locations in the form of co-operation hours through the VEC system, allied with flexible funds for DEIS and School Completion Programme schools together form part of the strategy to widen access to music education for young people in the period ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_1466">The current financial situation and Ireland's reliance on external funding through the EU/IMF Support Programme means inevitably that the funding situation will be extremely difficult in the period ahead. I would be misleading the Deputy if I pretended otherwise. The Government will do its best to prioritise education spending and protect front-line services but the reality is that my Department will have to bear its share of the Government's overall effort to cut public spending in order to deal with our fiscal crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1467">In these circumstances, it is not possible to restore the grant to local authorities for the provision of library services to primary schools, and I do not believe that it will be possible for any other Department to replace this funding. Individual Boards of Management may allocate their combined capitation and ancillary funding according to the priorities of the school.</p>

Letters to this effect will be issuing to the schools shortly.  It is open to the schools in question to apply for funding under future rounds of the Summer Works Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">In the meantime, for works that are of a very urgent nature, it is open to the school authorities to consider if the works in question qualify for funding under my Department's Emergency Works Scheme. An emergency is deemed to be a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action and, in the case of a school, if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening.

            <p eId="para_1488">TBG Learning Ltd was one of those who were successful in the tendering competition and were contracted to provide programmes of 12 weeks duration for the unemployed under the Labour Market Activation Fund.  TBG Learning promotes ‘JobFit' as a free, new, innovative training programme for unemployed people looking to get a job or to move onto further education and training. Work experience is provided by local employers for periods of up to 4 full weeks, delivered flexibly according to employer and participants needs.  The contract with TBG Learning provides for the training of 1,500 participants a total sum of €7.03m for the provision of these programmes in 2010 and up to March 2011.</p>

I understand that Blanchardstown is not one of the locations covered by the TBG proposal for extended funding but this was the decision of TBG itself. I do not propose to make any further funding available under the LMAF at this time.   A full examination of the Fund is to be undertaken during 2011 and the findings from that exercise will, among other things, inform labour market policy priorities into the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1492">My Department, most recently in the context of the Transforming Public Services strategy, has been evaluating the potential to secure savings and efficiencies by extending the use of shared services as widely as possible across the education sector. This consideration has included examination of the feasibility of operating systems of shared payroll services for bodies and agencies under the aegis of my Department.  Progress is being made in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1493">The payroll system operated by my Department provides payroll services for the Civil Servants employed directly in the Department and for staff in a number other bodies with similar type staff structures. These include the State Examinations Commission, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Residential Institutions Redress Board, certain staff in the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta. The Department is examining with other aegis bodies how their payroll systems can be operated in the most cost-effective manner. In some cases, including due to the specificities of the staffing structures in these bodies, the provision of a payroll service by my own Department may not be the most cost-effective solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1494">My Department is also examining the potential for the movement of the Civil Service payroll to a common shared services platform to be operated by a central payroll services provider. In this regard, my officials are currently involved in discussions with potential providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1495">The pursuit of the Transforming Public Services strategy in relation to payroll is also visible in a number of other areas of the education sector.  For example, the Higher Education Authority has identified the progression of shared services and procurement initiatives in the sector as a key outcome for 2011 and is in ongoing consultation with the sector in relation to progression of such initiatives.  With regard to the Institutes of Technology, new forms of enhanced collaboration are being considered, including the possible merger of payroll services. The University sector is now considering payroll systems in the context of a more extensive shared services vision, where critical mass and economies of scale strengthen the business case. Work is also progressing on the development of a shared payroll and financial services model for Vocational Education Committees. The business case for this proposal is currently being evaluated by the Department of Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1496">My Department will continue to encourage bodies across the education sector to harness the potential for savings and efficiencies offered by shared services technologies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1512">The changes to school transport services were announced in the 2011 Budget by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and derive from a recommendation in the recently published Value for Money Review of the scheme. The change to the rule, referred to by the Deputy, means that the distance criteria will be applied uniformly and equitably on a national basis. From the 2012/2013 school year, school transport eligibility for all pupils newly entering national schools will be determined by reference to the nearest national school, having regard to ethos and language.  Existing eligible primary pupils availing of transport under the Rule in question will retain transport eligibility for the duration of their schooling, provided the requisite distance criterion is met.  Given the major financial constraints facing the country, it is not my intention at this stage to reverse the changes to school transport as announced in Budget 2011. We all have to remember that the decisions of the last government effectively put this country into receivership.</p>

            <p eId="para_1522">The Employment Subsidy Scheme (Temporary) was introduced to help employees maintain their jobs while at the same time assisting employers to retain their productive capacity.  The Scheme was operated as part of an Irish State aid scheme approved under the European Commission's Temporary Framework on State aid, introduced in December 2008.  The Framework was brought in on a temporary basis to allow Member States increased flexibility to assist companies in the real economy that were facing difficulties in accessing finance as a result of the economic downturn.</p>

The role of my Department is to ensure that we have the right policies to support enterprise and innovation so that quality employment opportunities can be grown and maintained.  It is only by creating the right environment for businesses to expand that we will see new jobs coming on stream.</p>
            <p eId="para_1526">Limerick's FDI base is concentrated for the most part in the city environs of the National Technology Park and Raheen.  IDA Ireland supports 38 companies in County Limerick that employ almost 6,000 people.  IDA's strategy is to re-position the region as a hotspot for knowledge based industry, while focusing on marketing Limerick as a key location for investment, by building on the strengths already evident in the county.  To support this strategy, IDA Ireland works closely with educational institutions in the region to develop the skill sets necessary to attract high value-added employment to the county.   In March 2010, IDA published its strategy for the forthcoming decade, "<i>Horizon 2020</i>”. “<i>Horizon 2020”</i>  sets out IDA’s targets for the five-year period to 2014.  One of these targets is to secure 50% of investments outside Dublin and Cork</p>
            <p eId="para_1527">The CEO of IDA informed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Employment last December that IDA expected three project announcements in the Limerick region in the first half of 2011. The first of these companies announced in December 2010 that it was establishing its European sales and marketing headquarters in the National Technology Park; the first employees have now been recruited and the project is up and running.  With regard to the other two investments for Limerick, IDA remains confident that both projects will proceed and will be announced in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">Enterprise Ireland will continue to support job creation through a number of interventions, such as supporting the establishment and growth of high potential start-up companies and supporting companies to target new opportunities in overseas markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1529">In 2010, Enterprise Ireland paid €7.3m to client companies in Co. Limerick.  At present, there are 264 Enterprise Ireland client companies in Co. Limerick, employing over 6,000 people.  The agency has approved funding under the Community Enterprise Centre Scheme for eight community enterprise centres amounting to €2.19m to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1530">The priorities for the Enterprise Boards based in Limerick in 2011 are to assist owner/managers in enhancing the survival and sustainability of their businesses in these difficult economic times and to assist people wishing to start their own business including those made redundant.  A budget of over €775,000 has been made available to the two Enterprise Boards in Limerick for the provision of supports (financial and non-financial) in 2011.  At present, there are over 1,800 people employed in companies supported by the two enterprise boards operating in Limerick City and County.  In addition to their core activities both Boards are distributing funding available under the Dell European Globalisation Fund facility to former Dell workers who have set up their own business subsequent to being made redundant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1531">The  Government has committed to the introduction of a Jobs Budget within its first 100 days. This will facilitate the implementation of a number of measures across a range of Government Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">As part of my jobs and growth plan I will be promoting in the context of the upcoming Jobs Budget measures such as:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1533">A reduction in PRSI costs for employers;</p>

            <p eId="para_1550">My Department processes applications in respect of the different types of employment permits (Green Cards Permits, Work Permits, Spousal/Dependant Permits and Intra-company Transfer Permits).  All applications are processed in line with the Employment Permits Act 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1551">I wish to advise the Deputy that this particular application was refused on the 20th January 2011 on the grounds that it is current Government policy to issue new employment permits only in respect of:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1552">highly skilled, highly paid positions or;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1553">non-EEA nationals who are already legally resident in the State on valid employment permits or;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1554">where there is an officially recognized scarcity of workers of a particular type or qualification.  A list of the ineligible job categories for employment permits is available at my Department's website at <i>www.deti.ie </i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_1555">The job category described as work rider is currently not eligible for the granting of new employment permits and new permits are normally only considered where a starting salary of €30,000 is on offer.  Having examined the appeal, the Appeals Officer upheld the original decision in this case on the 1st April 2011 and the fees are in the process of being refunded to the applicant.  In these circumstances, therefore, I regret that it is not possible to re-visit this application.</p>

The Department is working closely with the PRTB to ensure that all tenancies where rent supplement is in payment are registered with the PRTB. To that end, the Department provides details of new rent supplement payments to the PRTB to enable them identify tenancies that are not registered and to take any follow-up action necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1750">Landlords are legally obliged to register tenancies with the PRTB within one month from the start date of the tenancy or at a later date on payment of an increased fee.  For this reason, it is not practicable for the Department to insist that a tenancy be registered with the PRTB before payment of rent supplement can be made.  There are also instances where a rent supplement tenancy need not be registered with the PRTB, for example, in the case of renting a room in a house or where a premises is owner occupied. Rent supplement tenancies which are liable for registration with the PRTB, should be so  registered. In that regard, the close working arrangements which the Department has with the PRTB should ensure that over time, all tenancies that come within the area of rent supplement comply with the statutory system of tenancy regulation and safeguards.</p>

            <p eId="para_1756">The overall objective of the pension system is to ensure that people have an adequate income in retirement.  At present only 50% of workers have a private pension, with low levels of coverage among moderate to middle incomes a particular concern.  In addition, it is also evident that many of those in pension schemes are not contributing at a level which will secure an adequate pension in retirement.  While the State pension is expected to provide sufficient retirement income for the lowest paid workers, most people will have a significant income gap if they do not make some provision for a private pension.   The issue around the adequacy, coverage and sustainability of pension provision are being addressed through a range of measures outlined in the National Pensions Framework which was published in March 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1757">The aim of the framework is to deliver security, equity, choice and clarity for the individual, the employer and the state.

Electronic information transfer (EIT) to the post office network  or cheque payments are also provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">However, there are some instances whereby the Department may limit the choice of payment method.  This is determined by reference to the scheme payment which the customer is in receipt of, the payment options available under that scheme and by reference to control and risk considerations for example where it is a condition of scheme that a claimant be resident in the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_1781">I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that the average waiting time for a domiciliary care appeal dealt with by way of a summary decision in 2010 was 26.8 weeks, while the average time to process an oral hearing was 49.1 weeks.  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  These include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the deciding officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's inspectors and medical assessors, that is deemed necessary.  As can be seen from the figures, a considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.   In order to be fair to all appellants, these appeals are dealt with in strict chronological order.  There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 when the intake rose to 32,432.  In the context of dealing with the considerable number of appeals now on hands, the Department has made a further 9 additional appointments to the office in recent weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_1784">During 2008, an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, undertook work, to develop a National Carers' Strategy.   The Departments of Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Health and Children, and Social and Family Affairs, as well as the Health Services Executive (HSE) and FÁS were represented on the group.  The group met on six occasions during 2008 and the expertise of other Departments and Agencies was drawn on as particular issues were being considered. Discussions were also held with colleagues in Northern Ireland.  A wide ranging consultation process was also undertaken which included a meeting with the social partners; two meetings with carer representative groups; and a public consultation process.</p>

The Deputy will appreciate that the pressure on the public finances has significantly impacted on the resources available to this and similar programmes.  The priority with respect to the programme has been to protect the jobs of some 2,700 people employed by the 450 or so community-based service providers approved for support.  In order to do this, it was necessary to reduce the level of non-wage funding made available to service providers, as well as cutting technical assistance and administrative costs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1799">The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The scheme is intended as a temporary income support payment and is not designed to be a medium to long term housing support or a permanent solution to a person's housing needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1800">Current legislation already provides for the making of a rent supplement payment to another person (e.g. a relative, a landlord or landlord's agent) on behalf of the recipient, at the tenant's request and is subject to the consent of the Community Welfare Service. Approximately 20% of rent supplement payments are currently paid to a person other than the tenant.  Community Welfare Officer's were recently reminded that the guidelines already allow for the rent supplement to be paid directly to a person other than the tenant including the landlord.</p>
            <p eId="para_1801">Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department's relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant. Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1802">Under the current arrangements, even with direct payment, landlords still have to collect the tenant contribution towards their rent (a minimum of €104 per month). The amount of rent supplement payable depends on the tenant's income; in some cases tenants pay only the minimum contribution while for others the tenant makes an additional contribution to their rent based on their financial circumstances. For example, where a person is in part-time income and receives just 10% of his or her rent directly from the State, the landlord would receive the 10% directly whilst still having to collect the 90% from the tenant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1803">The efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected if this arrangement were to be changed, for example Community Welfare Officers (CWOs) would potentially have to create a formal relationship with some 97,000 additional clients, the landlords. This would involve greater complexity and significant resources to deal with a new set of third parties. In particular, it would also result in CWOs being drawn into disputes between landlords and tenants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1804">There may also be financial and control implications in cases where a tenant moves address and neither the landlord nor tenant informs the Department. Similarly, where a tenant is no longer eligible for rent supplement and the Department ceases paying the landlord, the Department may find itself involved in eviction proceedings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1805">Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the board's dispute resolution process. It is also open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the CWO, any instance where a tenant is receiving rent supplement but is not paying their rent. Where a CWO becomes aware that a person receiving rent supplement is not using that supplement for the purpose for which it was intended, the matter is investigated and the payment can be suspended.</p>
            <p eId="para_1806">The current arrangements provide tenants with flexibility in terms of location, the freedom to move to a different location whilst allowing recipients time to seek alternative long-term housing solution provided by their local authority. The tailoring of additional payments, such as rent supplement, to meet the specific needs of individuals and making the payment direct to the tenant is regarded as an effective way of helping individuals realise their potential and take individual responsibility. To remove the right of the tenant to receive this payment by making it payable only to the landlord would require legislative amendment and I have no plans at present to make this change.</p>

         the position regarding the work placement programme (details supplied) and the internship development programme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1818">The Internship Development Programme aims to provide those who are at least three months unemployed with a 12 month work placement in a host organisation in the private or community and voluntary sectors, while simultaneously offering them the opportunity to avail of education/training that is accredited/aligned to the National Framework of Qualifications. This programme aims to enable the unemployed maintain their links with the labour market while also facilitating their upskilling and reskilling, thereby improving their employability. Whilst on the work placement element of the internship, interns will receive an ‘upskilling bonus' in addition to their social welfare entitlements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1819">State support for an initial 5,000 internship places on the programme has been approved, however, the number of places on the programme is entirely dependant on the level of take up by participating organisations.  A call for Expressions of Interest to organisations that may be interested in providing internship opportunities to the unemployed was issued by FÁS Employment Services recently. The purpose of this call is to assess the number of internship opportunities and the number of host organisations who wish to participate in the Internship Development Programme. To date over 150 organisations have expressed their interest in participating in the programme. It is expected that the programme will be operational in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1820">The Work Placement Programme was established to provide an opportunity for people who are unemployed to take up voluntary, unpaid work experience placements within companies.  The rationale for the Programme is to keep people as close to the labour market as possible during a time of job shortages and increased competition for jobs. In terms of outcomes from the programme, FÁS have indicative statistics which were gathered from a survey of 1,600 WPP participants in November 2010 who were either on a WPP Placement or had left the programme. Of the 1,600 surveyed, 628 people responded. Of the 628 that responded 133 respondents left early because: 25% of those who responded got a job with the WPP provider and  42% of respondents left their WPP Placement as they got another job elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_1821">The Work Placement Programme provides up to 9 months work experience to unemployed individuals, including unemployed graduates. The programme is targeted at both graduates and non-graduates.  For graduates the programme provides an opportunity for them to apply the skills learned in college in a work place setting, thus adding to their CV and making them more employable.  For graduates and non-graduates alike, the programme also provides an opportunity to keep their skills up-to-date and to network so that they can hear about jobs that come up, and gain work experience in new sectors/areas of work. While the above statistics are for a small sample of those who have participated on the WPP, it does demonstrate that the programme does help unemployed people gain work experience and find employment.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_1835">I propose to take Questions Nos. 218 and 219 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1836">The Deputy may be aware that oyster fishing licences are issued by Inland Fisheries Ireland in accordance with Section 278 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959 (as amended).  I understand that the Oyster fishery in Clarinbridge is located in a Special Area of Conservation (SAC No. 000268). Under the Habitats Directive (as transposed by the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997 (S.I. No. 94 of 1997)) it is necessary that, in advance of any activity taking place in the SAC, an appropriate assessment is undertaken to ensure that the fishery achieves the conservation objectives for protected species in the area. I am aware that the Marine Institute undertakes such assessment in respect of consents issued by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and I understand that the Marine Institute will also take account of oyster licences in any assessment of SACs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1837">Given that an Appropriate Assessment of this SAC has not yet been undertaken and, in accordance with section 278 (5)(a) of the 1959 Act, Inland Fisheries Ireland has adopted an approach to the  issue of licences that would not contribute to the intensification of the oyster fishery, until such time as the outcome of an Appropriate Assessment has been determined.  The future licensing of the fishery will be informed by the results of the Appropriate Assessment and the appropriate consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and in the context of the management of inshore fisheries generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1838">Consequently, in accordance with the statute, Inland Fisheries Ireland are to ensure specifically that the maximum number of oyster fishing licences issued in 2011 shall not exceed the number issued in 2010 or the average number of oyster fishing licences issued for the last five years, whichever is the greater.</p>
            <p eId="para_1839">I have been informed by Inland Fisheries Ireland that the average number of licences issued over the past 5 years in the Galway Fishery District was 16, but in 2010 17 licences were issued.  Consequently 17 licences have been issued for the current season.</p>
            <p eId="para_1840">I will arrange for a copy of the correspondence between my Department and Inland Fisheries Ireland in this matter to be forwarded to the Deputy for his information as requested.</p>

            <p eId="para_1842">There is no royalty regime in Ireland applying to petroleum production. In 1987, Ireland followed the lead of other countries such as the UK and Norway in moving away from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system.  Under a tax based system the return to the State is linked directly to the profitability of the individual oil or gas field, as compared to a royalty system where payments would be linked to the actual volume of production, without taking account of differences in development cost or actual profitability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1843">The Corrib Gas field was discovered in 1996 under Frontier Exploration Licence 3/94 which was granted in March 1994.  Profits from petroleum production arising from exploration licences granted prior to 2007 are taxed at a rate of 25% and this is the rate that applies in the case of profits from the Corrib Gas Field.  As regard an early review of the fiscal licensing terms governing petroleum production, I refer the Deputy to Priority Questions Nos. 24 and 25 today.</p>

          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_425">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_1862">I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 to 238, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1863">Exploration for oil and gas in Ireland, in common with most other jurisdictions, is carried out under licence from the State.  Petroleum exploration authorisations are issued under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960 and the operational framework is set out in the Licensing Terms for Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration, Development &amp; Production 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1864">Recent assessments of yet-to-find potential based on a Petroleum Systems Analysis of the Rockall and Porcupine Basins indicate a total reserve potential in the order of 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent (oil and/or gas) for the offshore frontier basins west of Ireland.  This divides roughly into 6.5 billion barrels of oil and 20 trillion cubic feet of gas.  I must emphasise that these figures only represent ‘potential' reserves, or the reserves that might be present based on geological criteria and regional comparisons, and that they have not been discovered.  Actual reserve figures are likely to vary widely from these estimates and will not be known without a dramatic increase in the level of exploration activity.  The Petroleum Systems Analysis of the Rockall and Porcupine Basins Offshore Ireland (Digital Atlas and accompanying GIS version) is a commercial report available to the industry at a cost of €25,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1865">The primary purpose of the assessments was to highlight the existence of significant hydrocarbon potential in the Irish offshore area in order to encourage increased activity by the exploration sector in areas receiving very little attention because of low perceived success rates, high exploration costs and long lead in times required to develop any discovery.  There are no comparable assessments available for the reserve potential of remaining offshore and onshore basins as the geological complexity of those areas, where smaller sized discoveries can be expected, makes it much more difficult to generate meaningful estimates. Petroleum exploration investment is encouraged through the active promotion of Ireland's petroleum potential and the holding of regular licensing rounds.  The 2011 Atlantic Margin Licensing Round, which includes all of Ireland's major Atlantic sedimentary basins with proven petroleum systems, is due to close on 31 May 2011.  Based on experience to date, I expect that the majority of applications for the Round will be received on or immediately before the closing date for the competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1866">There are seven standard exploration and fourteen frontier exploration licences active in the Irish offshore.  Exploration activities under these licences are divided into a number of phases with each phase subject to the performance of an agreed work programme including detailed reporting and the release of exploration data and evaluation reports to my Department.  When each phase of the licence is complete, the licensees must determine whether they want to proceed to the next phase or whether they wish to relinquish the acreage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1867">Where a prospect is identified and positively evaluated, an exploration well needs to be drilled before the presence of hydrocarbon resources could be determined.  If an exploration well shows that hydrocarbons are present, additional work, which may include one or more appraisal wells, is required to estimate the quantities of recoverable hydrocarbons and to determine if the discovery is commercial. If a commercial discovery is made, the licensee must apply for a petroleum lease in order to proceed to the development and production stage.  Where a discovery is made and the licensee is not in a position to declare the discovery commercial by the end of the licence period, but expects to be able to do so in the foreseeable future, the licensee may apply for a lease undertaking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1868">My Department is currently considering applications for two lease undertakings relating to exploration licences in the Celtic Sea, however at this stage it is not known whether these or any of the other nineteen active exploration licences will result in commercially extractable finds of hydrocarbons.  There are no applications for petroleum leases before my Department at present.   The Corrib Gas Field is the only discovery covered by a petroleum lease and not yet in production.</p>
            <p eId="para_1869">The potential value of any commercial petroleum discovery will depend on a combination of factors including, the volume of recoverable resources, the cost of developing and operating the infrastructure, the price of petroleum over the life of the field, together with the timing and profile of production.</p>
            <p eId="para_1870">Turning to the onshore area, there are currently no petroleum prospecting licences in place. Following a detailed evaluation of applications received last year for licensing options in the Northwest Carboniferous Basin and the Clare Basin, my Department has offered onshore petroleum licensing options to: Tamboran Resources PTY Ltd covering 986 sq km over parts of Cavan, Leitrim and Sligo; Lough Allen Natural Gas Company Ltd covering 467 sq km over parts Cavan, Leitrim, Roscommon and Sligo; and Enegi Oil Plc covering 495 sq km over part of Clare.  Two of the companies have already accepted the licensing options on offer and applications for petroleum prospecting licences are expected from both companies shortly.  Maps detailing the area covered by the onshore licensing options are available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1871">In relation to exploration drilling that might take place in the Irish offshore over the next twelve months, while my Department is aware that plans are being advanced for exploration or appraisal drilling, no application for approval has been received by my Department to date. I would expect that over the next few months greater certainty will emerge in relation to potential drilling.</p>
            <p eId="para_1872">In relation to the Deputy's query regarding the status of certain exploration licences, I can confirm that Frontier Exploration Licences 2/05 and 2/06 were relinquished with effect from 30 October 2010 and 31 August 2010 respectively.  Standard Exploration 3/07 was relinquished with effect from 31 March 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1873">I am separately forwarding by post to the Deputy a table that details the eighteen significant hydrocarbon discoveries made on and offshore Ireland to date. The inclusion of that table in the body of this reply was not possible for technical reasons.  The table includes details of petroleum authorisations currently in place along with details of the original discovery authorisation.  Full details of petroleum authorisations are updated and published on my Department's website on a regular basis.  I hope that the comprehensive information provided is of assistance to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1875">I am informed that in the case of bays and estuaries into which two or more rivers flow, the expert advice requires that all impacted rivers are meeting their conservation limits before harvest of salmon stocks is permitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1876">At present, the published assessment in respect of the common estuary in Lough Swilly indicates that the rivers Mill, Swilly and Lennan are not meeting their conservation limits.  The only river meeting its conservation limit is the Crana according to the Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Regulations 2011 (No. 323, 2010).  Accordingly, for conservation reasons, the harvest of fish is not permissible in the area referred to by the Deputy.  The status of the stocks of salmon rivers is reviewed annually.</p>

            <p eId="para_1948">I propose to take Questions Nos. 249 and 265 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1949">In order to facilitate the continued independent occupancy of their own homes by older people and people with a disability, and following a review of the old Disabled Persons, Essential Repairs Grant Schemes and Special Housing Aid for the Elderly scheme, which was administered by the HSE, a revised suite of Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes was implemented on 1 November 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1950">Three separate schemes are available:</p>
            <p eId="para_1951">Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability:</p>
            <p eId="para_1952">This grant assists people with a disability to have necessary adaptations, repairs or improvement works carried out in order to make their accommodation more suitable for their needs. Eligible works include the provision of access ramps, stair lifts, accessible toilet and shower facilities, wheelchair access and extensions. The effective maximum grant under the scheme is €30,000, which may cover up to 95% of the approved cost of works for applicants, including those in full-time employment, who have gross household incomes of up to €30,000 per annum, tapering to 30% for those with incomes of €54,001 to €65,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1953">Mobility Aids Grant Scheme:</p>
            <p eId="para_1954">This scheme is available to fast track grants of up to €6,000 to cover a basic suite of works to address the mobility problems of a member of a household. Qualifying works include the provision of stair lifts, level access showers, access ramps, grab rails and some minor adaptation works to the fabric of the house such as adaptation of downstairs room/closet to provide sanitary facilities etc. The effective maximum grant available is €6,000 and may cover 100% of the cost of works subject to a maximum annual household income threshold of €30,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1955">Housing Aid for Older People Scheme:</p>
            <p eId="para_1956">This scheme provides grants of up to €10,500 to assist older people living in poor housing conditions to have necessary repairs or improvements carried out. Grant eligible works include structural repairs or improvements, re-wiring, repairs to or replacement of windows and doors, provision of water supply and sanitary facilities, provision of heating, cleaning, painting etc. Maximum grant available is €10,500 which may cover up to 100% of the costs of works for applicants with gross annual household incomes of less than €30,000, tapering to 30% for those with incomes of €54,001 to €65,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1957">The Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department together with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  Exchequer allocations totalling almost €64m were notified to local authorities under the schemes on 17 February 2011, giving a combined allocation of almost €79.5m.  The detailed administration of these schemes, including the assessment, approval and the specific level of funding to be directed to each of the various grant measures from within the allocations notified to them by my Department, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1958">The Scheme of Improvement Works in Lieu of local authority housing allows local authorities to improve or extend privately owned accommodation, which is occupied or intended to be occupied by an applicant approved for social housing, as an alternative to the provision of social housing. Funding is provided by way of a secured loan which is repaid by the applicant over a 15-year period. A beneficiary under the scheme will be required to make repayments to the local authority based on household income and their ability to pay.</p>
            <p eId="para_1959">Outside of these measures, there is no specific housing grant scheme currently available from my Department for persons in receipt of income support or other support services from the Department of Social Protection.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1963">In 2002, the Report of the Review of Fire Safety and Fire Services in Ireland was published by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1964">The principal recommendations included more focus on fire safety, including the introduction of community fire safety initiatives; the enhancement of fire safety legislation, the adoption of a risk-based approach to determining emergency cover as well as new approaches and structures for major emergency management. In addition, the Report called for continued capital investment to improve infrastructure and further development of safety, health and welfare arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1965">A great deal has been accomplished in the past decade since publication of the Report and the key recommendations of the Report have been implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_1966">Substantial financial resources were provided to local authorities over the last ten years, and have resulted in a quality fire and rescue infrastructure throughout the country. Most of our fire stations have full facilities, the appliance fleet is in very good shape and equipment is generally regarded as top class.   Our emergency management arrangements, with the production of a new Framework for Major Emergency Management and the implementation of the Major Emergency Development Programme 2006-2008, are in line with international best practice, and were widely acknowledged to have been fundamental in ensuring effective response to the recent Cork Airport tragedy and during the severe weather emergencies in January and December 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1967">A range of other measures have been introduced in line with recommendations contained in the Review. Fire safety legislation was strengthened in 2003 as recommended in the report, with increased powers for fire prevention officers. A series of excellent initiatives has been developed under a community fire safety programme, including a domestic smoke alarm campaign, and a Primary Schools Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1968">The recommended Risk-based approach was developed through a procurement process and piloted in a number of counties. This is being made available now to other local authorities to ensure service managers have access to appropriate information to enable them to decide on the effective deployment and use of resources and to ensure that an appropriate balance between prevention, protection and response measures is achieved. Health, safety and welfare initiatives have also been progressed, with the preparation of an Ancillary Fire Services Safety Statement, the development of a National Incident Command system and the preparation of a suite of Standard Operational Guidance for the fire services activities. There are comprehensive Occupational Health Systems in the retained fire services, and Critical Incident Stress Management services have been made available to staff in all fire authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1969">Finally, the establishment of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in 2009 addressed conclusively the main Farrell Grant Sparks recommendation on revised institutional arrangements at central Government level. The new structures confirm responsibility for local delivery of fire services, while strengthening the national oversight and leadership role appropriately. The National Directorate, which is located in my Department, has taken over the functions of the Fire Services Council, and is an approach in keeping with the desire to reduce new agencies, while providing appropriate political accountability. Given the progress which has been made, and that the current arrangements are working satisfactorily, I have no plans to conduct a new study of fires services in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_1985">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to complete ratification of the Aarhus Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters. Delivering on this commitment by addressing the remaining legislative requirements to allow ratification to proceed is a high priority for the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1986">The three pillars of the Convention are partially implemented in EU law by two Directives. The first of these deals with public access to environmental information and was transposed into Irish law through the European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1987">The second, known as the Public Participation Directive, deals with public participation in decision making and access to justice. Several pieces of legislation have been used to transpose the Public Participation Directive, including:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1988">Section 33 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1989">the European Communities (Public Participation) Regulations 2010;</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1991">the Waste Management (Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 2010; and</p>

            <p eId="para_1996">My Department has responsibility for fuel quality standards from the perspective of ensuring that petrol and diesel sold in the State meet prescribed environmental specifications to reduce the polluting effect that certain substances have on the environment when emitted to air as part of the fuel combustion process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1997">Directive 98/70/EC relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels is transposed in Ireland through the European Communities Act, 1972 (Environmental Specifications for Petrol, Diesel Fuels and Gas Oils for use by non-road mobile machinery, including inland waterway vessels, agricultural and forestry tractors, and recreational craft) Regulations 2011. As required by the Directive, Ireland reports annually to the European Commission the results of a sampling programme for both petrol and diesel, including any breaches of the environmental specifications of the fuel.  Ireland's latest results were submitted to the Commission on 30 June, 2010 and indicated that fuel sold in the State during 2009 was predominantly compliant with the environmental specifications set out in Irish legislation.  The Commission collates the data received from Member States and publishes annual reports, including a summary for each country, which are available to download from the Commission's website, http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/transport/fuel_quality_monitoring.htm.</p>
            <p eId="para_1998">Sampling of the fuel is carried out by Officers of the Revenue Commissioners and the samples are analysed by the State Laboratory. In addition, the Irish Petroleum Industry Association contracts an independent laboratory to sample and analyse fuel and the results of that process are included in Ireland's report to the Commission. My Department does not have a role in regulating fuel standards from the perspective of the operational performance of the fuel.</p>

            <p eId="para_2002">The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure in County Cork.

            <p eId="para_2004">In February 2011, Cork County Council submitted a Design Brief for the appointment of Consultants to prepare a Preliminary Report for the upgrade of the wastewater treatment plant.  Following examination of this submission my Department has recently advised the Council of amendments required to the brief.  It is now a matter for the Council to submit a revised brief to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2005">My Department is also currently awaiting the submission by the Council of revised Contract Documents for the network element of the scheme.  Certain flood relief infrastructure is included in the scope of work proposed.  This work involves the provision of storm sewerage pipework and two storm relief pumping stations.  Proposals for a flood relief scheme would be a matter for my colleague, Mr. Brian Hayes, T.D., Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works and Public Service Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_2006">Contracts for both a wastewater treatment plant (Design Build Operate) and network for Youghal Sewerage Scheme are also included among the contracts to start during the life of the 2010-2012 Water Services Investment Programme at an estimated total cost of €18 million.  Cork County Council has submitted contract documents to my Department for both the wastewater treatment plant and network contracts and this documentation is currently under examination.  A decision will be conveyed to the Council as soon as possible.</p>

The working group's terms of reference include examining the regulatory requirements for the site and advising the Government on the site's most beneficial future use.  Plans for future use will determine the levels and extent of further works and/or remediation required, as well as helping to clarify further regulatory requirements, national and European, which may fall to be met.</p>

The board meets regularly and is working towards the preparation of a report for my Department that will outline the various options for regeneration.  This is awaited at present.  It is a matter for Dublin City Council, in the first instance, to prioritise and manage the advancement of regeneration proposals in the context of its overall programme.

Until now there have been different practices in housing authorities regarding the way in which applicants for social housing support had their income means-tested.

            <p eId="para_2188">The Social Housing Assessment (Amendment) Regulations, made on 29 March 2011, amend the original regulations and provide for a general increase of €5,000 in the income bands.  The new increased limits are €35,000, €30,000 and €25,000 for a single-person household, depending on the local authority area concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2189">The overall impact of the new arrangements, and of the amending regulations, is expected to be an increase in the number of households eligible for social housing support.  I acknowledge that this may lead to a rise in waiting lists but I believe that it is important to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, in order to promote sustainable communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2190">As regards older citizens, under previous arrangements, authorities used different definitions of older persons for purposes of social housing support.  The new Regulations provide for a single national indicator, based on the commonly accepted figure of 65 years.  While this is a primary indicator of particular accommodation requirements for those in the older age bracket, my Department's guidance to housing authorities makes it clear that individual households should be allocated the social housing support most appropriate to their particular needs.  This approach gives housing authorities discretion in individual cases in the provision of housing support, in accordance with their allocation policies.</p>

            <p eId="para_2202">I propose to take Question Nos. 283, 293, 297 and 310 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2203">Let me say at the outset that I am concerned at the length of time currently being taken to process vetting applications.  I recognise that it is important to process these applications within a reasonable time frame both for the benefit of the applicants and the organisations for which they will work.</p>
            <p eId="para_2204">There are currently a total of 89 gardaí and Garda civilian personnel assigned to the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU).  This represents a very significant increase in the level of personnel assigned to the unit, which stood at only 13 before the current process of development in Garda vetting began in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2205">A number of immediate measures are being taken to improve the processing times.  The sanction of the Department of Finance has been obtained to retain the services of 10 temporary employees in the GCVU.  A further sanction has been obtained to engage an additional 10 temporary employees for the unit and these are now being recruited.  This should have an impact on processing times.  In addition further steps are under consideration with a view to alleviating the pressure on the staff of the GCVU and reduce the time taken for the processing of applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_2206">The Garda Central Vetting Unit, based in Thurles, County Tipperary provides a centralised employment vetting to organisations in Ireland registered with the Garda Síochána for this purpose and which employ or engage persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that, at present, the average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is approximately 10 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2207">The service has been expanded greatly in recent years as part of an ongoing, phased programme to roll-out vetting to an increasing number of organisations in the child and vulnerable adult care sectors.  This target group is the clear policy priority.  Within this programme the vetting service has now been extended to over 18,000 organisations.  The GCVU has managed a substantial increase over recent years in the numbers of vetting applications it receives.  The figures since 2006 are as follows:</p>

            </table>
            <p eId="para_2218">The average processing time for vetting applications fluctuates in line with periods of increased demand.  In processing an individual vetting application, additional time may be required in cases where clarification is needed as to the details provided or where other inquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad.  There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  Registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection process.  However, the gardaí make every effort to reduce the time to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out what are very necessary checks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2219">The question of legislative proposals to provide a statutory framework for vetting will necessitate consideration of a wide range of issues including information sharing with other relevant bodies, such as the HSE.  It will also have to have regard to how responsibility for the management of information relevant to the vetting process is assigned and the need to protect the constitutional rights of all citizens.  Any legislative proposals will be announced and brought forward in the usual way.</p>

            <p eId="para_2228">I wish to inform the  Deputy that  the current legislation already makes provision for the non-disclosure of the criminal records of young offenders in certain circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2229">The governing statutory provision is section 258 of the Children Act 2001.  Section 258(1) of the Children Act 2001 provides for the non-disclosure of most offences committed by persons under 18 once specific conditions have been met.  Section 258(4)(<i>b</i>) expressly provides that when someone seeks information with respect to a person’s previous finding of guilt for any such offence, the question is to be treated as excluding the need to make any reference to such matters.  The effect of this provision is that where the relevant conditions have been met, the person need not make a disclosure and is to be treated for all purposes in law as a person who has not committed, been charged with, prosecuted for, found guilty of or dealt with for an offence and the person may, except as provided for in the section, withhold information about the offence and the circumstances relating to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_2230">As persons meeting these conditions are no longer regarded under Irish Law as having committed offences they essentially have a clean record and in the context of travelling abroad, or seeking employment, they can truthfully claim to have a clean record.</p>
            <p eId="para_2231">I hope that this clarifies the position for the Deputy.  I have asked officials to examine whether further clarification on this matter is required and advise me if a Ministerial Order pursuant to Sub Section 4(<i>d</i>) is necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_2233">I can assure the Deputy that this Government is committed to the elimination of slopping out in all prisons and places of detention.  Along with the proposal to review the Thornton Hall project, I would like to point out that the Programme for Government acknowledges the need to provide in-cell sanitation to all prisons, and in so far as resources permit, to upgrade prison facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2234">As things stand, I am informed by the Irish Prison Service (IPS) that 72% of prisoner accommodation has in-cell sanitation at present.  I am told this will rise to in excess of 80% when the extension currently under construction in the Midlands Prison is opened in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2235">A refurbishment project is also under way in the basement of the C–wing at Mountjoy prison which will result in an additional 36 cells with in-cell sanitation coming on stream by mid 2011.  In addition, the IPS recently awarded a contract to provide in-cell sanitation in the remaining 74 cells on the same wing.  Depending on the findings of a post project appraisal, the IPS will consider installing in-cell sanitation facilities in the remaining cells of that prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_2236">Finally, the IPS is currently appraising the logistical, financial, operational and other aspects of an outline proposal to provide in-cell sanitation in all cells in Cork Prison and all remaining cells in Limerick Prison that do not have in-cell sanitation.

            <p eId="para_2245">I am informed by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the Division is currently commencing further processing of applications received in mid 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2246">The average processing time from application to decision for the generality of valid applications for a certificate of naturalisation is currently 25 months and this has been maintained despite the substantial increases in the volume of applications received in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2247">The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is an honour not an entitlement.  Applications must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is given only to persons who satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_2250">Long term residency is granted on the basis that a non EEA national has completed a minimum of five years legal residence in the State on work permit conditions.  This is a major concession with successful applicants being granted Permission to Remain on a Stamp 4 which is valid for 5 years thus obviating the need to re-register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau on an annual basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2251">I am informed by the Long Term Residency Section of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that applications generally take approximately six months to process.  For example, a person who submitted a valid application in January 2011 can expect a decision on their application in June/July 2011.  Of course, for a variety of reasons, some applications may take longer than six months to process.</p>

They were each given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why Deportation Orders should not be made against them.  In addition, they were notified of their respective entitlements to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2592">The persons concerned submitted applications for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of these applications has been completed, the persons concerned will be notified in writing of the outcomes.</p>

            <p eId="para_2650">I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as of the latest date for which figures are readily available, the personnel strength of each Divisional Traffic Unit, and the number of traffic vehicles allocated to each Divisional Traffic Unit is as set out in the table. In addition to this there is a Superintendent attached to each of the 6 Garda regions in the Country.  The Deputy will also be aware that an Assistant Commissioner, based in the Garda National Traffic Bureau,  has overall responsibility for traffic policy.  The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, the numbers in any unit will fluctuate from time to time due to, for example, transfers, retirements, resignations etc.</p>

            <p eId="para_2853">Within the context of consolidating the public finances, the Government is focused firmly on maintaining the operational efficiency of the Permanent Defence Force. In the context of Budget 2010 the previous Government approved a level of 10,000 all ranks. This reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes. However in 2011, the Permanent Defence Force, like all areas of the public service, will operate on a reduced budget.    I am advised by the Military Authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force as of 28 February, 2011 was 9,582 comprising 7,805 Army, 761 Air Corps and 1,016 Naval Service personnel. Targeted recruitment is being carried out in 2011 in order to maintain the operational capability of the Defence Forces.  In this regard approval has been granted for the recruitment of 200 general service recruits in 2011. In addition there will be an intake of 30 cadets from the Cadetship Competition 2011 and a number of technical appointments will be filled.</p>
            <p eId="para_2854">I can confirm that with the support of the Chief of Staff, and within the resources available, I intend to retain the capacity of the organisation to operate effectively across all roles while contributing to the necessary public service economies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2855">While these are challenging times, my priority is to ensure that the Defence Forces are organised, equipped and staffed in a manner which will ensure that they can continue to deliver the services required of them by Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2856">I am advised that at this time the Defence Forces retain the capacity to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.</p>

            <p eId="para_2944">The 2008 report of the Independent Monitoring Group included 46 recommendations to chart the way ahead in continuing to meet the demands for dignity and equality in the military workplace. The 2008 report highlighted the initiatives undertaken by the Defence Forces in the area of human resource management and workplace culture in the period from 2004. The Report confirmed that the culture of the Defence Force organisation had evolved positively and noted that the recorded number of incidents of unacceptable behaviour was low.  Of the 46 recommendations contained in the 2008 Report, 23 have been implemented, with work underway in respect of the majority of the remaining 23. As the implementation of these recommendations requires the concerted and combined effort of both the military and the Department and in some cases ongoing monitoring, the Independent Monitoring Group  report is considered monthly by the joint military/civilian Standing Committee on Defence Forces Personnel Policy Issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2945">Turning to the specific issues raised in the questions, I am advised  that the syllabus for induction training has been revised.  Greater emphasis is placed during initial training on ensuring that new entrants understand what is and is not bullying/harassment and inappropriate behaviour.  Pre-course orientation for Instructors is included in annual seminars for Cadet School/Brigade Training Centres including the Naval Service and Air Corps and is revised as necessary.  Defence Forces Training Establishment Standing Orders are updated where necessary prior to the commencement of a course.  Pre-course training for attached instructors must include familiarisation with the revised Standing Orders.  Relevant and realistic case studies are included as part of the annual seminar for Cadet School/Brigade Training Centres including the Naval Service and Air Corps.  In addition, the role of Unit/Sub-unit Commander in the area of corrective action is included in the revised Junior Command and Staff course.</p>

            <p eId="para_2962">Bord na gCon is a commercial State Body. The Board of Bord na gCon is responsible for leading and directing the activities of the Company. My Department is aware that Bord na gCon is exploring possible business opportunities in China. Bord na gCon has repeatedly confirmed its commitment to the highest standards of animal welfare in the greyhound industry. Consequently my Department would expect that any proposal involving Bord na gCon engaging with the greyhound industry in China would consider animal welfare matters. The Department's consideration of any proposal would be based on the overall case put forward and would as a matter of course remain mindful of the need to ensure the welfare of animals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2963">Any proposal to export greyhounds from Ireland to China would require the establishment and agreement of export health certification protocols with the Chinese authorities, and appropriate transport arrangements would have to be put in place to ensure the welfare of the animals in transit. My Department endeavours to ensure that all exporters comply with Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations.</p>

            <p eId="para_2977">Under the provisions of the governing EU Regulations, payments under the Single Farm Payment may be made only in respect of eligible land and applicants under the Scheme are obliged annually to declare the land parcels available to them. Details of the eligible area of the land parcels are recorded on my Department's Land Parcel Identification System. It is also necessary for applicants to exclude ineligible features such as scrub, roadways, etc. Therefore, the LPIS database has to be amended on an ongoing basis to reflect any permanent changes such as parcel boundary changes, addition of new parcels, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_2978">Having reviewed the declarations made by the person named, specific issues were identified with regard to the areas declared, in that it was found that one of the land parcels contained buildings, while another contained forestry, which are ineligible areas under the Single Payment Scheme. Furthermore, as the person named was found not to have made sufficient allowance for these ineligible areas, the payments which issued were calculated accordingly, subject to the regulatory reductions. However, following consideration of an appeal from the person named, the areas initially deemed ineligible were reviewed and re-calculated, the net effect being the issuing of a supplementary payment to the person named on 24 January 2011.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2983">Castlemaine Harbour is designated as a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive and a Special Protection Area under the EU Birds Directive.  The designation of the Harbour places restrictions under EU law on the activities that can take place in the harbour.  Any such activity is subject to prior scientific assessment of its potential impact on the conservation objectives for the site.  Following such assessment the planned activity if approved may be subject to mitigation measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2984">The European Communities (Control on Mussel Fishing) Regulations 2008 (S.I. 347 of 2008) closed Castlemaine Harbour and other known mussel seed fisheries located in Natura 2000 sites.  When the national mussel seed fishery opens each year, these are excluded unless and until they have been scientifically assessed against the conservation objectives for the Natura site.  In the absence of published conservation objectives, a proposal to fish for mussel seed in Castlemaine Harbour was the subject of an ‘interim' assessment in 2008, 2009 and 2010 and this required the support of the European Commission, given the negative findings in 2007 of the European Court of Justice against Ireland concerning non-compliance with the Habitats and Birds Directives in Natura sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_2985">Conservation Objectives for Castlemaine Harbour were published by the National Parks and Wildlife Service in August 2010.  With the availability now of conservation objectives, a full assessment can be carried out of fishing and aquaculture activity in the Harbour.    Since last year, my Department has been working closely with NPWS, BIM and the Marine Institute to ensure that this first full assessment will be completed in good time for the traditional mussel seed fishing season in Castlemaine Harbour.</p>
            <p eId="para_2986">I understand that the Fishermen's Co-Operative in Castlemaine Harbour has prepared a fishing plan for 2011, with the assistance of BIM.  Crucially, that plan is expected to set out proposals for a 5-year period.  I expect to receive that plan very shortly.  Given the scientific work that has been undertaken by the Marine Institute over the last year, in consultation with the NPWS, BIM and my Department, the Marine Institute expect to complete their scientific assessment of the fishing plan for Castlemaine Harbour within a short period.  I am advised that this will see the assessment completed by the end of April and as a result the statutory public consultation can be completed by the end of May.  I will then make my statutory decision on the mussel seed fishery for Castlemaine Harbour during the month of June.  I note that the traditional mussel seed fishing season in Castlemaine Harbour starts in August or September, depending on the maturity of the seed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2987">Should the Co-operative's proposals for a 5-year plan prove acceptable, this will remove the need for annual assessments and Castlemaine Harbour will be able to open with the rest of the national mussel seed fishery, subject to any necessary mitigating or management measures included in the adopted Natura Fisheries Plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_2989">A Veterinary Inspector from my Department made contact with and visited this farmer in May last year, in response to an earlier query. Previously a Department Veterinary Research Officer visited the farm in May 2008 at the request of the farmers' Private Veterinary Practitioner (PVP).  From time to time samples from the farmer's herd have been submitted to the Department's Regional Veterinary Laboratory by the PVP as an aid to diagnosis. To date, other than a specific diagnosis of lungworm infestation in one sample submitted, there has not been a definitive diagnosis which would lead to the identification of a common cause of death in the adult animals. As advised at the time of the visit by the Veterinary Inspector, a metabolic disorder could be suspected. In this regard, as well as engaging the services of a PVP, there would be merit in the farmer also engaging the services of a nutritionist to investigate this possibility and an Inspector from my Department is available to advise him further in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2990">To date, whilst the farmer has indeed experienced losses in his dairy herd, there is no evidence that these have resulted from any scheduled or notifiable disease.

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_3012">Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 of 30 March 1998 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms specified that crawfish of less than 110 mm may not be retained on board or be transhipped, landed, transported, stored, sold, displayed or offered for sale, but shall be returned immediately to the sea.  This so-called "minimum landing size" (MLS) was reduced by Council Regulation 724/2001 to 95 mm in 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_3013">Ireland was supportive of the original MLS of 110 mm as it helped protect the reproductive potential of the crawfish stock, which had been in a sustained and steep decline in Ireland since 1990.  In 1998, the Irish lobster Association Society Limited wrote to the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources requesting that a MLS of 100 mm be introduced in Irish law in order to assist in halting the serious decline in crawfish stocks and as a transitionary measure towards the EU MLS of 110 mm, which was due to take effect from 1 January 2000.  The Association stated that landings of crawfish were so small that it was imperative that a minimum size be introduced and advised that such a measure had the support of all lobster fishermen.  Lobster fishermen commonly target both lobster and crawfish.  The industry request was accepted by the Minister and signed into law in 1999 through the Crawfish (Conservation of Stocks) Order 1999 (S.I. No. 244 of 1999).</p>
            <p eId="para_3014">Council Regulation 724/2001 lowering the MLS to 95 mm took effect from 2 May 2001.  My Department and the Marine Institute were opposed at that time to the lowering of the MLS and advised that it offered no conservation protection for the species, which was suffering from severe over-fishing, primarily because of the use of tangle nets.  It was felt that Ireland should introduce national measures to restore the MLS to 110 mm.  It was noted at the time that the industry agreed with such a measure.  The proposal was accepted by the Minister and signed into law in 2001 through the Crawfish (Conservation of Stocks) Order 2001 (S.I. No. 322 of 2001).  This was possible as Council Regulation 850/98 allowed Member States to enact national measures for the conservation and management of stocks going beyond the minimum requirements laid down in the Regulation, provided that the national measures applied solely to the Member State's vessels.</p>
            <p eId="para_3015">While the EU Regulation requires a minimum MLS of 95 mm, I am aware that Member States have enacted various national MLS limits above that figure, so Ireland is not unique is taking such conservation measures.  However, I am conscious that continental markets have a preference for smaller crawfish and that this is presenting difficulties for Irish fishermen in maximising the economic return from their catch.  In that context, I am examining the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_3023">I am advised that, in January 2001, following an evaluation of projects under Round 1 interim funding, project funding for three part-time community development worker posts in the communities referred to by the Deputy was mainstreamed to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which was then responsible for the continued funding of this service.  However, in April 2001, under Round 2, Phase 1, additional funding was approved to increase the level of service provided by these community development workers by the creation of full-time posts.  The channel of funding for the project was Dublin City Council.  However, in May 2005 the additional funding under Round 2 was discontinued by the former National Drugs Strategy Team (NDST), which managed the funding at that time, on the basis that the funding had not been drawn down.  The Canal Communities LDTF then submitted proposals, which were accepted by the NDST, to re-allocate this funding to other measures.  Dublin City Council continued to fund the full-time posts until December 2010.  The Council has recently indicated that this practice will not continue in 2011.</p>

It is for this reason that the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003-2009 provide that prescriptions for medicines are not valid for more than six months.  This is the rule that applies in the case of the Long Term Illness Scheme.  In the case of the GMS (medical card) scheme, prescriptions are not valid for more than three months.  This is designed to ensure regular reviews by GPs of their patient's medications.

The existing radiotherapy centre at St. Luke's, plus the new centres at Beaumont and St. James's Hospitals, have together become the St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Network, with some staff and resources now transferred from St. Luke's to the new centres.  The first patients were seen at Beaumont on 28 March, while St. James's is due to begin seeing patients on 11 April.</p>
            <p eId="para_3079">The development of the St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Network increases capacity for radiation oncology patients by 50% in 2011 over what has previously been available in St. Luke's Hospital.  Treatment will be available at all three sites and, using a central referral process, patients will be offered the next available treatment slot which will factor in the location of the patient and any specific clinical requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_3080">Radiation oncology services will continue at St. Luke's until at least 2015, when further radiation oncology capacity will be available at Beaumont and St. James's.  A firm commitment is given in legislation that the HSE must continue to use the St. Luke's site for the provision of health services.  In addition, the legislation states that the HSE may not sell or dispose of St. Luke's or any land on the site, without the consent of the Minister.</p>

These proposals will form the basis of legislation in the area of AHR and related practices, and are subject to Government approval.  If and when Government approval is obtained, it will take a considerable period of time before the enactment of legislation, as the process would then involve the drafting of a Bill and its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas in the usual way.</p>

            <p eId="para_3097">In recent years the HSE has been working to reorganise services in the Louth / Meath Hospital Group and Louth County Hospital has continued to play an important and expanding role in the provision of health services in the North East region, with a particular focus on diagnostic and day services.  A minor injuries unit and additional ambulance services were put in place to support the plan. Stroke rehabilitation, day surgical, day medical, step down services, gynaecology and radiology services remain in Louth County. In addition, the care of the elderly service has transferred to the hospital from Drogheda. General and orthopaedic rehabilitation services are currently being developed in Dundalk.</p>
            <p eId="para_3098">A dedicated Venesection service has been established and a new Colposcopy Unit has been opened at the hospital.  Louth County Hospital has also been selected by the National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) as one of the 15 candidate screening colonoscopy units to provide the colonoscopy requirements for the colorectal cancer screening programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3099">It is important to stress that patient safety has been central to all decisions taken regarding the operation of health services in the region as well as nationally.</p>

            <p eId="para_3108">The Health Service Executive (HSE) has advised my Department that approximately 150 of 4,638 Non Consultant Hospital Doctor (NCHD) posts are vacant and that some vacancies exist in anaesthetics.  The moratorium on public sector recruitment is not a factor in these NCHD vacancies. The moratorium does not apply to NCHDs and in addition allows for the recruitment of one consultant for every two NCHD posts that are suppressed.  Other countries are also experiencing difficulties in recruiting NCHDs at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_3109">The HSE has developed a range of strategies and initiatives to maximise recruitment.  It has advised that a recruitment process is currently in progress for the July 2011 intake of NCHDs. It is currently organising an additional overseas recruitment campaign in India and Pakistan.</p>
            <p eId="para_3110">In relation to redeployment it is appropriate that resources are shared, moved and redeployed across hospital groups to meet service demands, mitigate against risk and improve the patient's experience.  Local management teams have the flexibility to move local resources to best meet patient need. This does not reduce the services available to the population of the area served.</p>
            <p eId="para_3111">The Louth Meath Hospital Group (LMHG) had a significant shortage of junior hospital doctors in Anaesthesia in July 2010.  During 2010 the LMHG undertook extensive recruitment abroad to address the shortfall.  Currently the Hospital group has 14 registrar positions all of which are filled by suitably qualified staff.  In addition approval for seven additional Anaesthetic NCHDs has been received to extend the provision of On Call to a third layer of Registrars.  Currently 2 Registrars and a Consultant provide on call out of hours, this third layer is in line with recommendations from a previous review of Anaesthesia. In addition, the group have been working closely with the College of Anaesthetists to increase the number of accredited teaching posts to attract a high calibre of doctors to these posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_3112">The Louth Meath Hospital group comprises one hospital, operating across three sites.  It is appropriate that resources are shared, moved and redeployed across the group to meet service demands, mitigate against risk and improve our patient's experience.</p>

Applications come primarily from community groups and voluntary organisations with an involvement in the provision of health services to specific client groups (for example persons with an intellectual disability and/or physical disability, elderly, etc.), national groups providing information and support for various disabilities and illnesses and groups with a specific interest (for example equipment for hospitals, mini-buses, homes, etc.).</p>
            <p eId="para_3177">Applications for funding are generally accepted throughout the year.  My Department assesses, evaluates and makes a recommendation in respect of the proposed project in consultation with the Health Service Executive.  I then consider all applications along with the Department's recommendations.  In 2010, a grant of almost €172,000 was approved from the Department's allocation of National Lottery funds to Dignity 4 Patients.  This was given towards the cost of providing information and support to victims of abuse wishing to attend the Drogheda Review.  This independent review was established by the then Minister for Health and Children to advise on whether any additional information or insights were likely to be achieved from a further full investigation.  A former High Court Judge, Mr. TC Smyth, was appointed chair of this Review.</p>
            <p eId="para_3178">This report recommended that a further investigation should not be held and that, in order to avoid prejudicing any civil or criminal cases, the report should not be published.  The Attorney General concurred with this advice but agreed that a short summary of the report could be prepared and published.  Accordingly the Department, in consultation with the Attorney General and Judge Smyth, prepared a summary which was sent for information to two patient support groups, including Dignity 4 Patients, in January 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_3179">An application for funding for the current year has been received by my Department from Dignity 4 Patients.  The HSE has also received an application for funding.  I am considering the application to my Department having regard to the services that the HSE already provides for victims of abuse.  It is most important that any services supported by Departmental funding are fully compatible and supportive of similar services provided by the HSE.  I will consider Dignity 4 Patients's request with that in mind.</p>
            <p eId="para_3180">It is also very important to ensure that appropriate counselling is available to all those who wish to avail of it.  Both I and the HSE are anxious that all former patients of the consultant are made aware of the free counselling support that is available.  Persons affected by these issues, but who do not wish to avail of counselling can also speak with a psychologist or counsellor in confidence.  The need for additional support will be continuously monitored by the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_3181">The HSE has assigned co-ordinating responsibility for these matters to the Regional Manager for Consumer Affairs in the North East who will continue to liaise as required with former patients and support groups.  I will respond to Dignity 4 Patients's application as soon as possible, when I have had an opportunity to examine the matter fully.</p>

            <p eId="para_3219">As outlined in the programme for Government, I am committed to re-opening discussions with Irish survivors of thalidomide.  In February of this year, my Department voluntarily disclosed a large volume of records to solicitors representing both the Irish Thalidomide Association and the Irish Thalidomide Survivors Society.  These records relate to the circumstances surrounding thalidomide in the 1950s and 1960s and arrangements made in the 1970s relating to survivors of thalidomide.  I expect that both representative bodies are currently examining the documentation provided.  I will be happy to meet both representative bodies in the future following their examination of the documentation provided.</p>

            <p eId="para_3221">The Report of the Inquiry Team into the Roscommon Child Care case was published in October 2010 and it recommended that an audit of current practice of chronic neglect cases should be undertaken in County Roscommon.  A review of serious neglect cases in Roscommon commenced in September 2010, and was completed in February 2011.  The review was carried out by Dr. Lynne Peyton, Independent Consultant and former member of the Northern Ireland Child Protection Services.  The results of the review identified case specific concerns, which were referred to the Local Health Manager and the appropriate corrective and protective actions were applied to the cases; and case specific need for further intensive social work review by local management, which has been undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_3222">The Review identified a general issue concerning vacant posts in psychology services in Roscommon which has been brought to the attention of the HSE National Human Resources as a matter of urgency.  The Review also indicated that parental alcohol abuse was a concern in 50% of the cases examined.  The Roscommon regions multidisciplinary implementation team has been charged with implementing and monitoring the findings of the Roscommon Child care report and the findings which apply locally out of the Child Neglect Case Review  in Roscommon.</p>

            <p eId="para_3240">The Strategy for Cancer Control in Ireland set out the rationale for the restructuring of cancer services that paved the way for the establishment of the National Cancer Control Programme.  Since then, there has been a considerable change in the way previously fragmented cancer services in our hospitals, in particular, are organised.  Breast cancer diagnosis and surgery were transferred from Sligo General Hospital to University Hospital Galway in August 2009.  Women now have their initial diagnosis and surgery under the care of a multidisciplinary team, with immediate breast reconstruction available, in a centre which has the minimum volume of new cases, as recommended by the National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease.  Patients only travel for diagnosis and surgery and can have their chemotherapy, where necessary, in Sligo.  A breast care nurse based in Sligo follows up women with minor complications locally and provides ongoing support and breast care where required.</p>
            <p eId="para_3241">The National Quality Assurance Standards which were adopted by HIQA were prepared by a national group that was chaired by Professor Niall O'Higgins.  The purpose of the standards was to improve the quality of care for women with breast cancer in Ireland.  I am committed to ensuring that quality and optimal care are at the heart of our health services, including our cancer services, which must be delivered in line with best practice in a safe and quality-approved setting.  I will shortly meet Dr. Susan O'Reilly, who is the Director of the National Cancer Control Programme, to discuss a range of strategic issues in relation to cancer services, including the provision of breast cancer services at Sligo General Hospital.</p>

            <p eId="para_3243">The report on Cardiovascular Health Policy 2010-2019 recommended that stroke services be reconfigured into stroke networks, with a number of hospitals working together to provide the comprehensive range of services needed for optimal stroke care and working closely with community services.  The HSE has appointed two lead clinicians within the Directorate of Quality and Clinical Care to direct the implementation of the recommendations in so far as stroke is concerned.  Discussions are taking place at local and regional level to further improve access and quality of stroke services for patients.  In relation to services for stroke patients in Dún Laoghaire, there are stroke rehabilitation units in the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire, the Royal Hospital in Donnybrook and St. Colmcille's Hospital in Loughlinstown which cater for some patients from the Dún Laoghaire area.  Discussions are under way in the HSE to determine how the service for acute stroke patients in St. Vincent's Hospital could be improved further.  The numbers of stroke patients attending St. Michael's Hospital in Dún Laoghaire are too small to justify the establishment of a dedicated unit there.</p>

            <p eId="para_3255">Planning permission was received from Cork County Council in November 2009 for a new two-storey station house for the Irish Coast Guard Crosshaven Unit at Lower Road, Knocknagore, Crosshaven, County Cork.  In line with Public Procurement Regulations, the Office of Public Works ran a pre-qualification process whereby a number of suitably qualified contractors were invited to submit a tender for the project.  Five firms satisfied the criteria set and were invited in October last to submit a tender for the station.  The process of selecting the contractor is currently in hands by the OPW and building work is expected to commence later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_3257">The relevant sections of the Road Traffic Act 2010 will be commenced and will come into force when the necessary operational and administrative supports are in place. The 2010 Act consolidates many of the provisions of previous road traffic legislation, particularly those relating to intoxicated driving. The Act also provides for the lowering of the blood alcohol concentration limits for drivers of vehicles. As the intoxicated driving provisions are so inter-related, I intend to commence all the sections relating to intoxicated driving together when new breath testing instruments have been procured and are in place.</p>

         the number of agencies, authorities and other bodies coming within his Department’s remit that operate independent payroll systems and the reason such a function could not be provided by the Department.

            <p eId="para_3259">My Department is currently pursuing arrangements for the provision of payroll services for its staff by another Department and as such is not proposing to become a service provider to agencies.  While I have no direct function in relation to the day-to-day functioning of such agencies, the Croke Park agreement and the Employment Control Framework require non-commercial State agencies to achieve very substantial cost and staffing efficiencies.  They are looking at the best way of achieving these including, where appropriate, shared services.  In the case of the commercial State agencies, current economic market realities dictate that they must also seek the maximum cost and staffing efficiencies including, where appropriate, shared services.</p>

No. 158 of 2009 which gives effect to EU Directive 2007/46/EC and includes a reference to EU Directive 76/115/EEC), if he has considered allowing for any derogations for wheelchair accessible vehicles purchased prior to April 2009 which are required to be compliant by 29 April 2012 given the need for more wheelchair accessible vehicles in the taxi fleet; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3261">The regulation of the taxi industry is a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA) under the Public Taxi Regulation Act 2003, as amended. Among the principal functions of the NTA, as provided for under section 9 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, is the promotion of access to small public service vehicles by persons with disabilities.  In 2007, the former Commission for Taxi Regulation (whose functions have been incorporated into the NTA) published accessible standards for taxis and hackneys, which took into consideration the implementation of type approval under the European Communities Directive 2007/46/EC. I understand that the National Transport Authority will be commencing a further vehicle standards consultation process this year which will include the accessible vehicle requirements for taxis and hackneys into the future.</p>
