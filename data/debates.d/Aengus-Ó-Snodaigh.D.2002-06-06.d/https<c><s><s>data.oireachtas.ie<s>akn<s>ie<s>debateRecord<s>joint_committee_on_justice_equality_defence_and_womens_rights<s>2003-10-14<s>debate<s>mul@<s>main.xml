        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Commissioner Noel Conroy</from>
          <p eId="para_19">Thank you Chairman. Good afternoon Deputies. As the Chairman outlined, there are five topics for discussion. I will deal with crime first.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">On the international dimension of crime, the activities of organised crime groups are increasingly transnational. Sometimes they operate from one country, directing their business in another country and having a major impact on the crime situation in the countries concerned. The principal type of activity undertaken by organised crime groups are drugs trafficking, trafficking in human beings, smuggling goods, such as tobacco and fuel oils, counterfeiting and forgery and, finally, moneylaundering. As greed is the driving force behind most organised criminal activity, those involved do not confine themselves to any particular area of crime. The same groups are frequently involved in drugs trafficking, trafficking human beings and smuggling. They use the same tried and trusted routes and distribution networks for their products and engage in counterfeiting, forgery and moneylaundering to support their activities and dispose of their ill-gotten gains.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">Ireland, like most other countries in Europe, is a victim of transnational organised criminal activity. Until relatively recently, organised crime in Ireland was driven by Irish nationals. This trend is changing with the influx of non-nationals, some of whom have close criminal links with organised crime groups in other jurisdictions. We also have Irish nationals living in places such as the south of Spain and the Netherlands, who have maintained links with criminal organisations in Ireland while building links with similar groups in their homes and further afield. The Garda Síochána, through its international contacts and its involvement in organisations such as Interpol, Europol and the various EU institutions, plays an active part in the fight against organised criminal activity at home and abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">The creation of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, Garda National Drugs Unit, Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda Immigration Bureau, enable the Garda Síochána to tackle organised crime in areas of violent crime, fraud, counterfeiting, drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings and moneylaundering in a structured and co-ordinated fashion. These units function on intelligence driven operations. They are also able to target and seize the proceeds of crime from which criminal groups draw their motivation and strength.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">On drugs, cocaine and heroin are the two main areas of concern at present. A major international investigation targeting Irish, UK, Spanish and Colombian based criminal organisations involved in trafficking of cocaine and cannabis is ongoing and has resulted to date this year in two Irish nationals being charged by gardaí and over 37 kilograms of cocaine and 1,032 kilograms of cannabis being seized.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">In another ongoing investigation targeting heroin trafficking by Irish, UK and Dutch criminal organisations, two persons have been sentenced to five years imprisonment each, while three more are currently awaiting trial. The Garda Síochána work closely with the Customs National Drugs Team in targeting the activity of suspected drugs traffickers. Earlier this year heroin with an estimated street value of €2 million was seized and four individuals, one from Ireland, one from Spain and two from the United Kingdom, are currently before the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">During the first six months of this year, more than 72 kilograms of cocaine have been seized compared to just 32 kilograms during the whole of the year 2002. During the same period, more than 22 kilos of heroin were seized compared to 26 kilos during 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">On the issue of crime overall, as the committee will already be aware from figures published in July by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, headline offences statistics in respect of the first six months of 2003 show an overall decrease of 7%, or 4,039 incidents, in comparison to the same period of 2002. Violent incidents of assault and robbery show a downward trend. The greatest decrease was noted in the number of assaults causing harm, which was down by 828. It is worth noting that Irish crime trends tend to mirror closely trends in the UK. This is particularly evident in the areas of public order and violent crime which have experienced notable increases in both jurisdictions in recent times.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">During the first six months of this year, violent crime accounted for less than 11% of the total headline crime. This compares to over 12% during the same period of 2002, a reduction of almost 1,500 violent incidents. In England and Wales during the 2002-03 accounting year, violent crime accounted for 17% of police recorded crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">On homicide, during the year of 2002, there has been a total of 59 homicides in this country, which can be broken down further into 52 murders and 7 cases of manslaughter. Of these, 49 were detected. In 2001, there were 58 homicides, which were further divided into 52 murders and six cases of manslaughter, of which 51 were detected. To date this year, there have been 42 homicides, which can be broken down into 39 murders and three instances of manslaughter. Of these, 24 have been detected. A number of current year killings are under active investigation. Suspects have been identified and the prospect of criminal prosecution seems positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">I am concerned at the number of homicides and other instances involving the use of firearms. Of the 42 deaths this year, 19 involved the use of firearms. This compares to ten in the year 2002 and nine in the year 2001. There are a number of factors which explain this increase. Some former paramilitary weapons have found their way into the hands of criminal organisations and this has contributed to the general increase in the use of firearms in recent times, in particular in so-called gangland style murders and shootings. There have also been cases where former paramilitaries have turned to crime. Criminal gangs are also known to import firearms with their consignments of drugs and cigarettes and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">In Limerick city and its environs, many lives have been needlessly lost in recent times. A very substantial effort has been made to readdress this situation. No resources are being spared in this effort. Current indications are that these are meeting with some success. Likewise in Dublin, a number of murders have taken place recently involving the use of firearms. Major investigations are currently ongoing and suspects have been identified and in some cases charged. Other investigations are progressing satisfactorily.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">On the preventative side, two specific operations have been established over the past four weeks. Operation Lance was established to counter proliferation of incidents involving the use of firearms and to prevent serious crime in the Dublin region. A team of gardaí under the direction and control of a detective superintendent have been assigned to the operation. Already some success has been achieved. A number of people are currently before the courts. As a result of the increased use of firearms and crime generally in the Finglas area of Dublin, Operation Crossover was put into effect in September. Dedicated Garda resources have been deployed in the area to counter the unlawful carriage and use of firearms. In addition to local uniformed and plain clothes personnel, the resources of the special detective units and the emergency response unit are also deployed on this operation. Garda activity is focused on known and likely flashpoints.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">If Commissioner Conroy would not mind, we have an hour to discuss this. The crime trends that the witness discussed have included many different areas. Would the witness mind if some questions were asked on that particular item and then, if we have time, we could come to public order.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">I welcome Commissioner Conroy and congratulate him on his new appointment. I hope that today will be the first of many visits to this committee. There is a lot of work to be done between both of our respective areas to increase co-operation and the flow of information. Hopefully, we can improve matters. I welcome the Commissioner's team.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">I will put all of my questions together briefly. My first question is about traffic and fines. I saw a newspaper article recently indicating that because of the poor collection of fines, such as parking fines, speeding fines and so on, the Garda are contemplating letting this out to the private sector. Is that the case? If so, how do the Garda intend to do it? My second question also concerns traffic. Unfortunately, there are far too many fatalities in this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">All right. My next question might not relate to crime, as such, Chairman, but it concerns public order and is very topical. It concerns fireworks. I receive many calls from elderly people who are annoyed and upset by the use and availability of fireworks. It is a major concern for elderly people at this time of year as fireworks are pushed through their doors, and so on. Can the Commissioner tell us if this is being specifically targeted? It seems to me that there are known suppliers in every area. I understand that the law indicates that it is not an offence to possess fireworks but it is an offence to sell them or to have them for sale. Can the Garda do something about this and what is it going to do?</p>
          <p eId="para_42">My final question also relates to public order. I wish to raise the question of privacy in Garda stations. If, for example, I go to my local Garda station in Mullingar and have some business to transact, everybody else in the public area will know exactly what my business is. There is no privacy whatsoever. It is an open room. One approaches a hatch and unless everyone else present is deaf, they will hear one's business. Has the Commissioner any ideas how this situation can be improved? This Garda station has already been improved and is relatively new. I remember that Assistant Commissioner Crummy was at the opening. What can be done to improve privacy at Garda stations?</p>

          <from>Deputy Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_43">I too, welcome the new Garda Commissioner, Mr. Conroy, and welcome Deputy Commissioner, Mr. Fachtna Murphy and Assistant Commissioner, Mr. Patrick Crummy. The Commissioner is new to the job and I hope we will meet him on a regular basis. He certainly has a lot of work to do. I do not know what his opinion is, although I would welcome it, but it is my opinion that we have a policing crisis in relation to crime, on which we were asked to concentrate. We seem to have a number of gangland style killings in urban areas, particularly in Limerick and parts of Dublin. There seem to be no-go areas and that gardaí are unable to deal with them. Finglas is a case in point and I have no doubt Deputy Carey will refer to it. Neither the gardaí in the local Garda stations, whether in Blanchardstown or elsewhere, nor those at national level know what to do about the situation. The Commissioner gave some figures on homicides and prosecutions but I have no evidence of a gangland style murder committed this year being prosecuted in the courts or a culprit, who committed a murder this year, going to prison. There is a major concern that drugs and firearms are readily available and that there are barons who control their own patches and who do so with impunity. How does the commissioner propose to deal with that because it is a major threat to law and order?</p>
          <p eId="para_44">My second question, which is related, concerns garda discipline. As recently as this morning, we heard the appalling case of gardaí behaving badly towards jurors. That is happening across the board on a regular basis and the Garda Complaints Board is certainly not adequate to deal with it. I would like to hear the Commissioner's views on ensuring we have a top of the range Garda force with the best behaviour, discipline and morale and whether he supports movements towards an independent Garda complaints unit - for example, an ombudsman. How does he envisage ensuring there are independent mechanisms to ensure that in the future gardaí are seen to be above reproach?</p>

          <p eId="para_50">In the course of your address, Commissioner, you mentioned Limerick and Finglas almost in the same sentence, if not in the same paragraph. Limerick has a large number of Garda stations while Finglas has one, which you know very well. It is an old run-down Garda station with approximately 70 members. Your staff is carrying out four investigations into major crimes in Finglas, all of which have to be carried out in Blanchardstown Garda station as there is no room to do so in Finglas Garda station. The six murders which have taken place in Finglas in as many months are extremely worrying. I do not believe there are no-go areas in Finglas. I want to give the lie to that. The majority of the population in Finglas are anxious to co-operate with the gardaí, although some are genuinely afraid to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">There is no doubt there has been a proliferation of firearms in the Finglas area in the last two years which was brought to the attention of senior gardaí by my colleagues and myself at regular meetings. I do not believe sufficient seriousness was taken of our concerns articulated locally over the last number of years. Will the Commissioner assure my colleagues, myself and the Finglas community that an ongoing policing plan will be put in place to ensure this almost rampant terror is ended? It happened on a previous occasion in Finglas and gardaí at the time were successful in countering it. It is time for a radical policing plan to be put in place to engage with the local community, to renew confidence in the gardaí and to ensure people co-operate with and give information to the gardaí and to no other source. There is danger that information will be channelled elsewhere in the hope that matters will be tackled by others outside the standard police force. What plans are you and your colleagues putting in place to ensure this particular spate of gangland violence in the Finglas area is brought to an end quickly and that it does not spread throughout the city?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_18">
          <from>Deputy F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_52">I welcome the Commissioner, the Deputy Commissioner and the Assistant Commissioner and congratulate them on their promotions. It is always refreshing to see another west of Ireland man doing well in the public service and I wish the Commissioner good luck in his job which is an extremely difficult one.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">Deputy Carey and Deputy Costello talked about gangland and the serious crime in the city. It is important we realise this is not just confined to Finglas or to Limerick. There are many places in this State, including many parts of my constituency, in which there are elements that are bullying and intimidating communities. Even Members of this House have been threatened by these so-called gang leaders or people involved in gangs. I have been threatened by a number of them over the years so I know what is happening in the real world. They are dominating communities in many areas and it is really disheartening for the people who live in them. What safety and security plans can you put in place to reach out to those communities which feel totally let down by middle or civic Ireland or whatever one wants to call it?</p>
          <p eId="para_54">On the numbers game in the gardaí, it is often said to us that there are many gardaí in stations working on computers and on administration and that is one of the reasons we do not see them on the streets involved in direct policing. Is that correct? In regard to drugs, it appears the cocaine situation has got worse over the last six or 12 months compared to the heroin situation. What is the updated situation in terms of dealing with those issues?</p>
          <p eId="para_55">I have mentioned this before, but it is crucial to restate it if one is talking about crime and crime prevention. Some 90,000 children in this State are living poverty. Approximately 2,000 of them come from violent, dysfunctional and disruptive families. Those children will be in Mountjoy in seven to ten years' time. Do the gardaí have an early response to this nightmare scenario which is about to happen in ten years' time? The figures are there and they will be backed up by community workers, youth workers and teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">The next question is linked to the last one. In modern policing, is there too much emphasis on solving crime rather than preventing it? For example, the garda who solves a murder seems to get rapid promotion whereas the garda or the sergeant who goes out on a Saturday night and prevents attacks and stabbings outside chip shops and pubs is not really taken seriously within the force. Is that the case?</p>
          <p eId="para_57">Deputy Costello touched on the following point. There is a massive lack of confidence in the Garda given all the scandals and the lack of response to anti-social behaviour calls. People are getting in contact with TDs and councillors to say they have a major problem. They will not say it directly to your face, but they are telling councillors and TDs. Is the Commissioner aware that this lack of confidence is rampant in Irish society?</p>
          <p eId="para_58">I refer to the numbers game. There are 12,000 gardaí. I was in Pollothomas, County Mayo, yesterday visiting the residences damaged by the recent landslide. I left Pollothomas at 3 o'clock in the afternoon and after four to five hours' driving I arrived in Collins Avenue at 7.55 p.m. Between Pollothomas on the west coast of Mayo and Collins Avenue in Dublin city I did not see one garda or one Garda vehicle. If I drove the same distance in France or Spain - which I did in France during the summer - I would have had six or seven sightings of police patrols. Where are the gardaí? That is a regular complaint from my constituents.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">I congratulate the Commissioner on his appointment and wish him good luck in the future.</p>

I ask that we keep the questions to the area of crime because the Commissioner will only address questions on crime. We will then deal with public order items. A number of the questions have already been asked but I would prefer if members waited until we come to that point.</p>

          <p eId="para_62">I come from a Border area where there has been a significant decrease in the number of personnel in Border Garda stations. In places such as Pettigo, Castlefin and Carrigans there has been a huge reduction in the number of gardaí based in such stations and I am sure that is the case across the Northern Ireland southern Border to Carlingford. Has there been any change in the crime rate or the number of paramilitary activities in those areas in the wake of the Good Friday Agreement and following the foot and mouth disease outbreak?</p>
          <p eId="para_63">What is the extent of the co-operation between the Garda and the Police Service of Northern Ireland? An area of major interest to us in Donegal and about which there has been much public comment in recent weeks are the number of terrible traffic accidents that occur in my county involving people from Northern Ireland. A year ago, two cars from Northern Ireland travelling at over 100 miles per hour crashed on a road in Donegal resulting in three fatalities. If such people are apprehended, can they be pursued? Are they subject to our laws? What is the extent of the co-operation between the Garda and the authorities in Northern Ireland? Does any co-operation exist, either on a formal or informal basis?</p>
          <p eId="para_64">I may be out of order raising this issue but we have lost quite a few small Garda stations in Donegal. Are there plans for further closures?</p>

          <p eId="para_68">I welcome the Commissioner and his colleagues. I hope that when his period of office is completed, the Garda Síochána will have regained the confidence and trust that has been lost in the past few years in some areas in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">My question relates to the areas of reporting and the crime trend. Has the PULSE system settled down? Can we take it that the figures we are getting now are accurate? When the PULSE system first came into being some areas were not fully on board and we were not getting full reportage. Can we take it that from now on there will not be any under-reporting or over-reporting in respect of crimes committed in the past which the Garda did not have an opportunity to record?</p>
          <p eId="para_70">On the figures given to us, I am trying to distinguish between the figures for manslaughter and murder. How is that determination made by the Garda? People are often not charged with these crimes until a number of years later when the investigations are complete. One figure shows a reduction of 11% and the other shows an increase of 17%.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">The Commissioner mentioned an operation currently under way in Finglas and said that Limerick had a major problem with crime lords using unlawful weapons to murder people. In my own area of Crumlin, Drimnagh and Inchicore, which crosses over two boundary divisions, there have been a number of shooting incidents in recent months and years. We would be comparable to Limerick in that area yet there has not been a specific operation to move against some of these gangs.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">My final point relates to drug offences. I welcome the recent seizures in my own area. Good work is being done by the gardaí on the drugs issue but many more Garda resources need to be redirected towards tackling the drugs issue. The previous Commissioner, or the one before him, once stated that up to 75% of crime in Dublin was drugs related but if Garda resources were directed towards tackling the issue of drug crime, we would all have a better quality of life in Dublin. Some of the thuggery and intimidation mentioned by my colleagues could be tackled by targeting drug crime.</p>

          <from>Deputy O’Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_73">Like my colleagues I welcome the Commissioner and congratulate him on his appointment. I welcome his two colleagues also. The presence of the Assistant Commissioner reminds me that Dublin South-West continues to produce gardaí at the highest level and in that regard, the appointments of Noel Smyth and Noel White recently have greatly pleased those of us on the ground. Perhaps the Commissioner would note that.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">I notice all three gentleman are taking copious notes. Perhaps they might write down the word "Tallaght" because I want to talk about Tallaght and crime. I strongly believe that we should support the gardaí in every way. I have always taken that view in my public and community life. As a resident of my area, I feel strongly about that. Tallaght is the third largest population centre in the country. Other colleagues talked about Garda stations and resources but as a public representative representing the community, I can easily say that I have no problem with the manner in which tackling crime has been managed, except to say that Tallaght, Firhouse, Greenhills and Templeogue is a huge population centre and as I have pointed out on a number of occasions, including to the Commissioner's predecessor, there is only one Garda station in Tallaght.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">I want to put on record that the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors recently pointed out that it is now its policy to look for a public/private partnership in respect of the redevelopment of Tallaght Garda station. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform surprised me last week by telling me that he was not aware of that. Therefore, I am putting it on the record. In regard to crime and crime prevention, proper resources and facilities have to be provided if gardaí are to be able to deal with the areas of crime prevention and solving crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">In respect of crime prevention, I strongly support the community policing concept, which Deputy McGrath highlighted. Seeing uniformed men and women of the Garda Síochána doing their job on our streets is the way forward. I often take a walk around Tallaght late at night and the gardaí often stop me to say hello.</p>

The mountain bike units and horse units are very important in areas such as Tallaght. The Commissioner has my absolute support in dealing with the problems arising in such areas.

          <from>Mr. Conroy</from>
          <p eId="para_94">Thank you, Chairman. Without the support of the public, the detection of crime would not be as good as it is. We constantly depend on the public for information in relation to crucial issues. Without that support, our level of success, in terms of our detection rate which is currently in the region of 40% of reported crime, would not be achieved. I would be disappointed if a large proportion of society had lost confidence in the Garda organisation. Having visited other countries to discuss policing methods with other police forces, I can say that we are equally good in terms of skills, training and equipment.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">However, there are areas in which I would like to see improvement with regard to the detection of crime. I know the Minister and Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are currently looking at those areas. I refer in particular to a DNA data bank which, I am confident, will come in due course. It will help, in no small way, in dealing with organised crime and gangland killings. Undoubtedly, we have a problem at present in terms of the number of guns out there. A number of speakers asked what we are doing about it. We are targeting known people. The individuals concerned are known to us and, no doubt, to public representatives who are in touch with their constituents.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">However, getting the evidence requires rather more than knowing the individuals concerned. We have arrested those people on numerous occasions and questioned them for the permitted period. Our experience is that they will not tell us anything or account for their movements in general. While the number of those involved in criminal gangs may not be of major proportions, they constitute a serious problem. We are achieving some success in relation to some of the gangland killings. Within the last fortnight, a person was convicted in the courts in that regard and, while I know that the individual concerned was responsible for more than the one killing, our difficulty is to convert the available intelligence into evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">That is a major problem, not just in Ireland but in most democratic countries. While we cannot change that situation, we are targeting the individuals concerned with special patrols. Also, as part of a two-tier approach, we are investigating crimes they have committed and we are hopeful that such targeting will be a significant factor in crime prevention. However, that requires substantial resources where people are on the move 24 hours a day. Even to target one individual requires six or seven gardaí per eight hour tour of duty. That requires a great deal of resources and I do not have such resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">However, I make the best use of the resources I have in terms of bringing in national units to support local Garda units, whether in Finglas, Crumlin, Limerick or wherever. We shift our resources to deal with the situation at a given time. Because of changing methods and modus operandi by criminals, we also have to change our operations. Regularly, in the course of debriefings of our people, we can see the need for change. We are changing in an effort to deal with the issues pertaining at a given time.</p>

          <p eId="para_101">On the question relating to fireworks, Deputy McGrath's comment with regard to prosecutions was quite valid. We have a specially targeted operation currently in progress and, indeed, we have had some success within the last four or five days where a large consignment of fireworks was seized in the Border area. I recognise that one seizure does not cure the problem, but we are working on it and I hope the elderly people concerned in the Deputy's constituency will not experience a problem during the coming Hallowe'en period. That is as much as we can say in that regard at this stage.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_56">
          <from>Mr. Conroy</from>
          <p eId="para_115">There is very good co-operation with our colleagues in Northern Ireland. In the last two months we held a cross-Border meeting in County Cavan with our colleagues and several joint investigation teams were set up to deal with cross-Border crime. Since then several successful operations have taken place on this side of the Border and on the Northern Ireland side.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">Petty crime has increased along the Border since the Good Friday Agreement but not substantially. The resources are made available to the local divisional officer who is based in Letterkenny but the allocation of those people is a matter for the Chief Superintendent there. I am not sure whether there is a manning problem in the stations the Deputy mentioned but I will look into this matter and maybe come back to the committee on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">Yes, prostitution is a major problem and it is unfortunate that very young girls are being used by a certain number of criminals, particularly in Eastern Europe and in other European countries. Some of the girls are being moved around Europe very quickly, including several of those recently taken from premises in Dublin. People may say we were trying to prosecute those individuals. To the contrary, we were trying to protect those unfortunate young women who came into member states of the EU thinking they were going to take up employment in certain areas, but this did not happen and they were put to work as prostitutes. There is a problem and we are working on it. Operation Quest, which is ongoing, has had good results.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">I know of no case where somebody has reported a crime to a Garda station and that case has not been recorded. I would be very disappointed if that was so. Once a crime is reported it is entered using the PULSE technology and as the investigation develops it may be categorised as a particular crime early on but may later have to be recategorised. That is why we have a continual review based on the information in PULSE. It may change from time to time but once the crime is reported it should be there on record, without doubt.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">We are sending people to the United States to look at best practice for dealing with missing persons. We will do some work with the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and with the New York Police Department. We are disappointed that those unfortunate women mentioned by Deputy Hoctor have not been located. I continually appeal to the public because there are people out there who know the answer to the problem. It is a very difficult time for the families expecting somebody to come up with an answer. I have no solution to that but we will investigate any snippet of information that we receive and search any areas on which we receive information.</p>

When we consider that it has been detected we send an investigation file to the Director of Public Prosecutions who decides the issue and on what charge it should be preferred. It may also happen that where a person is charged with murder the court decision might be one of manslaughter and the crime in the PULSE system is altered accordingly.</p>

          <p eId="para_128">You indicated, Chairman, that I could ask one question on public order offences which might be a good lead in for the Commissioner. I would like to know what level of priority the Commissioner will attach to public order offences and what level of importance he attaches to anti-social behaviour in urban areas throughout the country. I am not taking away from the important issues of serious crime which the Commissioner has already addressed, but my colleagues will know that I have been pushing this line with the Minister and others over the past few months.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">For those of us at the coalface of the community, this can be most important type of crime. It can be worse than anything else for elderly people or those in disadvantaged areas because the more serious crime tends to be on a one to one basis, whereas this sort of crime can terrorise entire communities and neighbourhoods. To reiterate what Deputy Paul McGrath mentioned earlier, the proliferation of firecrackers is causing enormous problems. People in Limerick are now attaching not one but ten, 20 or 100 together and making mini bombs, bringing them into the middle of estates and terrorising those estates. For us, that is the face of crime as we confront it in our communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">In one estate, incidentally, one woman had a heart attack when she heard such an explosion and is now in a very serious condition. The Garda officers in Limerick will bear that out. Bearing in mind what I have said, what importance does the Commissioner attach to these sorts of offences and will they retain that level of importance for the duration of his tenure in office?</p>

Operation Encounter has been up and running since February 2002, and the figures on the detection of offences are encouraging in that they have shown quite a substantial decrease in the last nine months.

If we could bring a major change in that type of area then peace should follow, but it will not happen overnight and is something we have to work hard on. We are doing that right now.</p>

          <p eId="para_143">Maybe we should adopt a one-item agenda over a long period. Coming in with lots of items means the Commissioner is not able to respond adequately to us and we go away dissatisfied and all wanting to say our bit and so on. Maybe the Chairman could at some stage sit down with the Commissioner and his officials and work out the best way of handling such meetings so that it is of best value to the Garda, to us and to the public that we represent. They are putting the questions to us, and they are hard task masters and want us to get responses.

          <p eId="para_150">I thank the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and his officials for attending the meeting, the purpose of which is to consider a motion, referred to the joint committee by both Houses, concerning proposals for a Council regulation on non-contractual obligations - Rome II. Members have been already circulated with a copy of the original proposal document and the briefing material supplied by the Department. I invite the Minister to make his comments.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_151">I thank the Chairman and the committee for making time available to discuss this motion relating to the exercise by Ireland of the option to take part in the adoption and proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and Council on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations, known colloquially as Rome II. As this is a measure to which the Fourth Protocol of the Amsterdam Treaty applies, the committee will note there is a three month period within which we must notify the President of the Council of our intention to opt into any discussions from the beginning. That period will expire on 22 October, hence our desire to progress this motion as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">Our difficulty on timing has arisen because the proposed regulation was only presented by the European Commission on 22 July last. The earliest opportunity for the Government to consider it arose on 30 September. With the Oireachtas resuming in the first week of October this presented us with a very tight deadline to be in a position to notify the Presidency of the Commission by the 22 October of our decision to opt in. The co-operation of your committee, Chairman, is very much appreciated.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">Motions on which the approval of both Houses must be sought for the State to exercise an option provided under the Fourth Protocol in respect of proposals for an EU legal instrument in the civil law area, had been debated previously by the Dáil and Seanad and also by this committee. I look forward to hearing the views of the committee members who are present today. No doubt the committee is familiar with the background to this kind of motion. I do not propose to go over the constitutional and Treaty provisions in any greater detail than is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">When the Treaty of Amsterdam came into operation on 1 May 1999 annexed to it was a protocol which exempted both Ireland and the United Kingdom from the provisions of Title IV of that of that treaty. That title deals with matters related to the free movement of persons and includes civil judicial co-operation. The protocol in question does, however, allow either or both countries to opt into particular measures, under specified terms and conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">Under Article 3 of that protocol, the State has three months from the date on which a proposal is presented to the Council of Ministers within which we can notify our wish to take part in the adoption and application of that proposal or initiative. By opting in within the three month period Ireland can actively participate in and have a real voice in the negotiations leading to the final terms of the measure as adopted. To do otherwise would disadvantage Ireland's representatives at the Council working group and also, ultimately, myself at the Council meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">Ireland has made a declaration under Article 3 of the protocol to take part in the adoption of measures pursuant to Title IV of the EC Treaty to the maximum extent compatible with the maintenance of the common travel area arrangements with the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">Of course we may accept a measure any time after it has been adopted but if an adopted measure contains provisions which do not properly take account of Irish concerns we may find ourselves at that stage unable to accept it. There are accordingly advantages to exercising the opt in to proposals which are still in draft so that we can ensure that its final form will be acceptable to Ireland. This particular measure - a proposed regulation on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations, more commonly known as Rome II - which we are discussing can be seen against the background of the development at EU level of measures geared towards the enhancement of judicial co-operation in civil matters. The overriding aim of this development is that of making access to justice easier for the individual litigant. In December 1998, the Vienna Action Plan, the aim of which was to create an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union, was endorsed by the European Council. Subsequently, in October 1999, the Tampere European Council, in looking to the creation of a genuine European area of justice, focused on the need for better access to justice and enhanced recognition of decisions in civil and commercial matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">The proposed Rome II regulation can be viewed as a further advance in the development of private international law rules in the Community. It continues the process initiated by the Brussels convention - subsequently the Brussels I regulation - on jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters and the Rome Convention of 1980 on the law applicable to contractual obligations, ratified by Ireland through the Contractual Obligations (Applicable Law) Act 1991.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">The Brussels regulation deals with jurisdiction rules in the broad civil areas and covers both contractual and non-contractual obligations. The purpose of Rome I Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations was to have uniform choice of law rules in relation to contracts which would govern both member states, among themselves, and relations with non-Community countries. The main benefits of that convention were that it raised the level of legal certainty in contractual cases involving an international element by making it easier to predict the law which would be applied to a case and thereby reducing the level of forum shopping in such cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">Thus the proposed Rome II regulation will attempt to bring consistency found with regard to private international law rules in contractual obligations to the issue of non-contractual obligations and so try to complete the development at European Union level of those rules with respect to civil and commercial obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">The objective of the draft regulation is to introduce clear rules governing the law that will apply in a wide range of potential disputes in regard to non-contractual obligations. This would mean that courts in all the member states could apply the same law to cross-Border disputes involving non-contractual obligations, generally known in Irish law as torts, thereby facilitating mutual recognition of court rulings in the European Union. Member states do not at present have common rules for deciding which law should apply in cases concerning non-contractual obligations, so each court applies its own national rules. Consequently, the outcome of cases can vary widely from one member state to another, prompting plaintiffs to bring their actions before the courts which will apply the most favourable legislation, known as "forum shopping". The conflict of laws rules proposed by the Commission seek to strike a balance between the interests of the person claimed to be liable, that is, the defendant, and the person sustaining the damage, that is, the plaintiff.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">In regard to the question of civil liability for damage caused to others, the draft regulation specifically mentions issues such as defective products, unfair competition, violation of privacy or violation of the environment. A key element of the draft regulation is that it would provide that the law of the place where the direct damage occurred should be the law applicable.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">Efforts have been under way since the mid-1990s to bring forward a Community instrument on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations. In May 2002 the Commission launched a public consultation process based on a proposal for a draft regulation with regard to developing the rules that would apply in cross-Border non-contractual disputes in any situation involving a choice between the laws of different countries. The responses from Government, business, media, consumer and other organisations were varied. Those in support of the proposal felt that a Rome II regulation would increase legal certainty. The European Consumers Association strongly supported consumers being allowed to take action where the loss occurred, if that was the best choice for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">However, other contributors expressed doubts as to the necessity of Rome II, arguing that, in practice, businesses do not face problems with diverging rules on conflict of laws in the member states. The proposed scope of Rome II was also criticised as too extensive. The less than universal welcome for the Commission proposal may ultimately be reflected in the negotiating process.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">I emphasise that no change in substantive Irish law in the area of non-contractual obligations will be effected through this draft regulation. We should be clear that the proposed regulation deals only with the choice of applicable law where a dispute has arisen and there are different jurisdictions involved. In other words, if what we call a tort is caused by an action in Ireland, but the damage is sustained by somebody in France, the issue is whether the Irish law of negligence, if it was a negligence tort, or the French law applies. Members of the committee will appreciate that given the individual nature of potential disputes which might arise in this context, it is not possible to indicate at this point, the commencement of negotiations, what the exact nature and extent of the potential benefits for Irish consumers, business or private individuals might ultimately be. That would depend on future situations in which persons who feel they have an actionable complaint seek to vindicate their rights in a cross-Border situation. The proposed regulation, if eventually agreed by the Council, will be adopted by qualified majority voting. It is also subject to co-decision with the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">It is important that Ireland should respond positively by exercising our right to opt-in to the negotiations from an early stage in order to be in a position to influence the eventual outcome. This will enable the State to play a full and constructive role in the negotiations in the relevant Council working group, which have just commenced under the Italian Presidency and will proceed under the Irish Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">I hope the committee will support the proposal that Ireland exercises its opt-in to the discussions on this proposed regulation and I look forward to hearing the comments of members on that proposal. I need hardly add that any points raised by members of the committee on the current draft of the instrument will be taken into account by the Irish delegation in the negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">I thank the Chairman for his co-operation in making time available, particularly given the short notice that circumstances dictated.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">In opting-in to the negotiations, we do not prejudge in any way whether we will opt-in to the instrument. In effect, we are given an opportunity to have an input and our opt-out under the Amsterdam Treaty is not ultimately compromised, in that at a later stage we can say what has emerged from the negotiating process is not acceptable to us and we need not go ahead with it.</p>

          <p eId="para_173">I do not want to exaggerate its importance in this respect. This is simply a proposal for a regulation that would determine what tort law of what member state is applicable to any particular wrong, in other words, if I am sued in Ireland for negligence in Spain, this regulation would state whether the Spanish or the Irish civil liability law applies to my actions in Spain. The regulation is not saying that the Spanish law and Irish law should in any sense be the same. It is purely saying that in a particular set of circumstances with a cross-border dimension, the applicable law is either Irish or Spanish. It is not saying that Spanish and Irish law should converge or that one should approximate to the other.</p>

Which would have the better chance of succeeding, the case in the French courts or in the Irish courts, all other things being equal?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_90" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_175">Our unfair competition law is modelled on the European Union provisions about anti-competitive practices and abuse of dominant position. Some member states of the European Union have different concepts of what amounts to unfair competition, including notions of using misleading advertising, using forced sales, acts impeding competing supplies, enticing away a competitor's staff, acts that exploit a competitor's value, passing off and so on. Thus, the laws in relation to unfair competition are quite different across the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">Apart from breach of contract, this jurisdiction does not recognise any right of action for unfairly enticing away one's competitor's staff. If somebody is free to go contractually within our system it is not unfair competition to hoover them up into one's company and turn them into one's employees. There would be some reservations in this area in deciding what the applicable law would be. If the effect of this particular regulation was to somehow provide that French law would apply to certain actions, even if tried in Irish courts, there could be some cross-infiltration of laws in those circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">Likewise, in relation to violations of privacy, we do not have an identical law to many civil law states. The committee will know that at the moment there is quite a controversy about press councils and things like that, and many people are writing a lot of articles condemning my proposals in this area. This is interesting because I have no proposals in this area. However, that does not stop people from writing the articles anyway.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">In some European states, if a prominent politician was having a private clandestine affair, it would violate a privacy law if a newspaper was to splash that all over its front page. In Ireland and the United Kingdom, no such law has yet been developed. That is another area with which the United Kingdom has significant problems because it raises various questions. Where did the violation of privacy take place - is it where the magazine is published? If an English magazine is published in Britain and sold in France in a way that violates French privacy law, which law is applicable? Where will the damage have been suffered by the politician in France whose privacy in France is violated by something perfectly lawful in London? There is a big question there and I do not purport to have an answer, in case anyone in the media intends to report what happened here today. I have no proposal at the moment on that subject.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_91">
          <from>Deputy Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_179">We could start with the old saying that if you are not in you cannot win, so we should not tie our hands on this, and I am sure the Minister's extensive diplomatic and negotiating skills would be much appreciated in the Council working group on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">First, I seek clarification that, under Article 3 of the protocol, what we are deciding here relates to tort matters across the board in relation to all Ministers. Are we talking about the entirety of matters that might be dealt with in the Council of Ministers no matter which Minister has responsibility for it, and not simply dealing with the Minister's brief in relation to justice?</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Second, the premise that has been put here, that the draft regulation would provide that the law of the place where the direct damage occurred should be the law applicable, would seem to be more a bureaucratic than consumer oriented presentation. I can imagine a number of European states, including present members and accession states, in which the consumer might not be top of the list in priority terms in relation to, say, defective products, unfair competition, the violation of privacy or the environment. From the consumer or citizen's point of view, there would seem to be a benefit from forum shopping, whereby one would shop for the best forum and the best deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Our function is to represent the individual and collective citizenry of Europe and ensure they get the best deal if there is a tort or question of civil action in relation to damages inflicted upon an individual citizen. Are we starting with the draft regulations from the wrong premise? It might be more bureaucratically simple to say that the law of the place where the damage occurred is the law applicable, but it may not be the best law.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">I do not know to what extent conflict would arise between the civil law successors of the Napoleonic code in Europe and our common law system. Has any serious survey been done on the individual countries? I presume we are now talking about 25 countries rather than 15 being involved in the Council of Ministers that will look into the matter. I presume there is no proposal for harmonisation as such. That is not part of the exercise and instead there will be a decision on agreed mutual recognition on the criteria to determine where an action should take place. Are there any statistics governing the extent of the problem that has arisen to date in legal terms, or is there is a perception that no action is being taken simply because it is too complicated to do so? Is there a problem of some substance that needs to be addressed?</p>

We can then decide whether to opt-in rather than sitting out now. I exhort the Minister to get involved in the discussions. Deputy Costello's last question is probably the most relevant one. Where is the need for this legislation and where does it arise? I am a little confused as to what exactly is covered in these transnational contracts.

If I book through an English company and wish to sue that company, should I sue the company in Dublin and, if so, must it turn up? Under which law can I take my case? Is it the Irish or British law or the country where it happened? How will all these issues be decided? Are those the issues that are covered?</p>

          <from>Deputy McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_188">May I begin with the last point? Is there a need for this legislation? One has to ask oneself whether much of the European Union legislation is driven by a need or by a theoretical perception that a problem exists and a desire to arrive at a solution. One of the judgments I have arrived at on a provisional basis is that there is a major tendency at EU level for people to generate problems on paper and to arrive at a paper solution. Then everyone has to get into practical mode to find out how this will work out in practice, whereas the great benefit of the common law, as I said on another occasion, is that it deals with cases as they arise. In our jurisdiction we tend not to work out a theory of the world but to work out a solution for the problem in front of us. The question is whether there is major evidence of forum shopping across Europe. There is none that I have seen on these issues. Are there major problems of this kind across Europe where people are coming in throngs to their politicians to solve this problem? My clinic is not full of these people. Deputy Costello probably spends his Saturday mornings sending off people in their throngs demanding a regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">A general rule is that the law applicable to a non-contractual obligation - booking holidays and so on is normally contractual - shall be the law of the country in which the damage arises or is likely to arise, irrespective of the country in which the event giving rise to the damage occurred and irrespective of the country or countries in which the indirect consequences of that event arise. One might ask what that means. The general rule is that the law of the country in which the damage occurs is to be the applicable law to a tort. If one buys a defective product and it explodes in one's house, the general rule is that the place where the damage occurred, one's kitchen in Ireland, is the country whose law will apply to whether one is to be compensated and, for what amount, and whether one is liable in those circumstances. It is not that easy. One is left with a situation where acts which are perfectly legal in country A can give rise to a claim in country B. The question then arises whether the person in country B can be sued for something which is legal at home. That is an issue which is not easily got around.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">In relation to product liability, the proposed rules provide that the law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising out of a damage, or risk of damage, caused by a defective product shall be that of the country in which the person sustaining the damage is habitually resident - in other words, where the consumer is habitually resident is the issue - unless the person who claimed to be liable, that is, the defendant, can show that the product was marketed in that country without its consent, in which case the applicable law shall be that of the country in which the defendant is habitually resident. In other words, if one produces a product and it is marketed in France and in Ireland; with one's consent Irish law applies, without one's consent French law would apply. Whether that is a great advance is for others to query.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">In relation to unfair competition, it is proposed that the law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising out of an act of unfair competition shall be the law of the country where competitive relations are the collective interests of consumers or are likely to be directly and substantially affected. That is easier said than done.</p>
