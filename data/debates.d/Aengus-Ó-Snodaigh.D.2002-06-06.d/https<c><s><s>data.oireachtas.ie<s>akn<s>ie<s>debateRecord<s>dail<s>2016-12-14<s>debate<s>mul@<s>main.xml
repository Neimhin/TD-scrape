          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Andrew Doyle)<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_3">Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2016,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">copies of which were laid in draft form before Dáil Éireann on 21 November 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">The most recent estimates available suggest the horse and greyhound racing industries combined underpin more than 24,000 jobs and stimulate approximately €1.6 billion in economic output. The Estimates for my Department, passed by both Houses as part of budget 2017, include an allocation of €80 million for the horse and greyhound racing fund. This will be distributed in accordance with section 12(6) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, with 80%, some €64 million, going to HRI, Horse Racing Ireland, and 20%, some €16 million, to Bord na gCon.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> To allow my Department to provide the moneys allocated in budget 2017, it is necessary to comply with the technical requirement under section 12(13) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, to increase the cumulative limit on the amount payable from the horse and greyhound racing fund by €80 million to €1.118 billion. This is achieved by way of the regulations submitted to this House today. The aggregate limit on the horse and greyhound racing fund has been increased in this manner in 2004 and from 2009 to 2015, inclusive.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> It is estimated the Irish bloodstock industry provides 14,000 jobs and contributes almost €1.1 billion to the economy. In 2015, bloodstock export sales rose to €268 million in what was a remarkable year for the Irish bloodstock industry. Ireland holds a distinguished position in the thoroughbred racing world, being the largest producer of thoroughbred foals in Europe and the fourth largest in the world. Approximately 40% of the EU output of thoroughbreds and 11% of the total worldwide are produced in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> The greyhound racing sector is also an important driver of employment and economic activity in both rural and urban areas. A report by the economist Jim Power in 2010 estimated the greyhound industry employed over 10,300 people and contributed an estimated €500 million in economic output to local economies around tracks which have a wide geographic spread. As part of the Government’s commitment to the sector, its overall objective is to ensure the horse and greyhound racing industries achieve their maximum potential and, in so doing, contribute to economic and social development.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> I will shortly be bringing forward the heads of a greyhound industry Bill to ensure the principles of good governance and regulation are clearly and unambiguously laid down in primary legislation. In broad terms, the Bill will seek to provide a statutory framework for improved governance, tighter regulation and stronger powers to deal with breaches of the racing code. It will also address issues identified in a report authored by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in January 2016, as well as those contained in both the Indecon report and the Morris review of anti-doping and medication control. This Bill will strengthen the greyhound industry and give it the powers to deal with issues of regulation in a more effective way.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">Without doubt, Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon face significant challenges as they work to grow and develop the horse and greyhound industries in an extremely competitive market segment. The €80 million allocation is vital to help secure rural jobs and sustain rural communities. Given that these two industries have footprints in many parts of rural Ireland, I am confident it is the goal of all of us here to realise fully the contribution of these sectors to the Irish economy, employment and the social and cultural fabric of the country. Accordingly, I ask Deputies for their support to ensure Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon receive the funding provided for in budget 2017 and that the very important role of these industries and the economic activity generated by them are sustained into the future. I commend this regulation to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_11">There are nine speakers and the business has to conclude in 40 minutes so I ask Deputies to be as prompt as they can.</p>

        <speech by="#JackieCahill" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Jackie Cahill<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_12">Fianna Fáil supports this motion. Both industries have attracted a lot of negative publicity in recent months. We should not lose sight of the importance of these two industries to our economy as a whole. The €80 million is money well spent. We have a bloodstock industry which is the envy of many countries around the world. We are also one of the leading countries in the greyhound business and are the envy of many countries. We see that 25 years ago London had 26 dog tracks, but come March there will be no dog tracks left there. We have to see what we have here and while everything has not been done perfectly in the past while, we recognise the great importance of our industry and the significant contribution these two industries make to our economy as a whole. While we are contributing €80 million, we have to recognise the revenue that is coming back into the Exchequer from these two industries, which is not insignificant.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> Will the Minister of State look at the position of track bookmakers in regard to levy and taxation? Track bookmakers have come under increasing pressure in recent times. The number of track bookmakers at dog racing and horse racing has declined very significantly. They are an integral part of the industry. The atmosphere and entertainment value of the industry depends greatly on having track bookmakers present. Legislation needs to be changed to allow these track bookmakers to operate on a level playing field with the larger operators which are multinational companies. The one cap fits all method of taxation and levy will not work into the future for track bookmakers, so change needs to be made.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_14">I, too, welcome this motion. The horse and greyhound sectors are important industries to the economy. The money being proposed is welcome. Many families supplement their incomes from their involvement in the horse and greyhound sector. It has to be welcomed. It shows we are backing the industry. Deputy Cahill mentioned the bookmakers. I wholeheartedly agree with him. It causes despondency to go to a greyhound track and see only one bookmaker on site. The banter usually happens when there are two or three bookmakers hitting off each other to tout in a bit of money. The online betting issue should be addressed in regard to taxation so there is a level playing field. I welcome and wholeheartedly support the motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrassil" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Deputy John Brassil<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_15">I will also support this motion. I very much welcome the €80 million funding for 2017 for both the horse and greyhound industries. As has been alluded to, they provide valuable employment, particularly in rural Ireland. The figure is in the region of 24,000 people, both directly and indirectly, and that is of huge value to the rural economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> I refer specifically to the greyhound industry because the challenges for the industry are very significant. The Minister of State will be aware that a recommendation from the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the greyhound industry was published in January. We need to move on that and we need to implement the legislation. I welcome that the Minister of State will be briefing interested members on the legislation at 6.30 p.m. with a view to having it in place early next year. We need to restore public confidence in the greyhound industry by ensuring there is correct governance in Bord na gCon. The testing procedures for greyhounds should be adhered to strictly in order that people have confidence that the industry is clean and well run. We also need to ensure there is value for money in the very welcome funding we are giving and that the industry rewards the Government's commitment to it. Both industries are estimated to be worth €1.1 billion to the economy. Our investment of €80 million is well rewarded, but there is still very much a need to restore public confidence in the greyhound industry and the confidence of the people who work in the industry. There are many small owners who are in it for the love of the sport and who need the backing of Bord na gCon and the legislation the Minister of State is about to implement and brief us on this evening. While the funding is welcome, there is a lot of work needed in the background. The Minister of State has my support in getting that over the line in order that we can look forward to the industry having a bright, profitable future.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinKenny" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Deputy Martin Kenny<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_17">The horse racing and greyhound industries not only have economic benefits but also bring great enjoyment to hundreds of thousands of people in Ireland every year. I have no wish to restrict the growth or development of these industries, although I have serious doubts about the funds dispersed by Government to Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon. Every time this funding is discussed, I hear about the thousands of jobs in the industry, but sometimes I wonder about the quality of these jobs and whether they are counted as whole-time equivalents as they are in the HSE, schools and other State bodies. How many real jobs are there? Bord na gCon claims there are 10,300 people employed in the greyhound industry. I would love to know where these people work and the basis of the claim that the industry contributes €500 million to the economy each year. I am told by dog breeders and trainers that the greyhound industry is in crisis and will disappear within the decade if radical reform does not take place. According to Horse Racing Ireland, the horse racing industry employs 14,000 people and contributes €1.1 billion to the economy. With two such healthy and vibrant industries, why does the Exchequer have to hand out such an amount of money? Why does horse racing prize money, in a sport populated by very rich owners and trainers, have to come from an Exchequer which cannot pay for the basic medical needs of our senior citizens, for instance? We cannot always make those simple comparisons but for this amount of money - €80 million - there has to be clear and demonstrable benefits to society and our economy. Along with that, there must be strict adherence to corporate governance and transparency in all financial aspects of the industry. The excessive salaries and expenses being drawn down in both organisations is beyond the realm of reason and the decisions about where to spend Exchequer money will have to be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> It was confirmed to me at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine that almost €3 million of taxpayers' money would be spent on the redevelopment of Galway racecourse, mainly on the construction of a champagne bar. There was a time when the people at the Galway races were happy to drink their champagne in a tent but now it seems the taxpayer has to pay for the construction of a bar for them. Is this value for money in the context of the economic hardship so many people are suffering throughout the country?</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> Horse Racing Ireland has been in the news over the past six months due to the manner of the reappointment of its chief executive officer for a third term. I am led to believe that the irregularities in the appointment of the CEO have continued for more than a decade, according to correspondence released by HRI and reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday. I have raised this matter before in the House and representatives of the board of HRI attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine to inform us about this appointment. At that time, the chairman admitted quite openly that the appointment was against Government guidelines, that the CEO's salary had exceeded the Government cap and that the latest appointment was made without even a gesture towards open competition. It was suggested that the board had no option as the CEO had accrued rights with a contract of indefinite duration. This state of affairs suggests either extreme incompetence or, more probably, an intentional lapse to provide the CEO with a contract of indefinite duration allowing this situation to transpire.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the board of HRI, it seems, feel that this was acceptable behaviour. When I raised the matter in the House with the Minister, Deputy Creed, asking if, considering the blatant disregard for corporate governance displayed by the board of HRI, he would consider reviewing the amount of money the Exchequer was providing to it, he referred to my misgivings as "a fit of pique". Somebody needs to have a fit about it. I still have not been given any justification for the way this appointment was allowed, except that it seems it does not matter because they say the right man was appointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">The House must exercise more vigilance regarding appointments and funds and the way in which they are expended and distributed throughout these two industries. It would be more appropriate for less Exchequer funding to go to prize money for big races, and more to other sectors of the industry such as point-to-point racing, harness racing and programmes for better breeding and husbandry, incentivising small breeders to improve their stock. It is hard to understand why there is resistance on Government benches, and presumably among Fianna Fáil Members, to increasing betting tax so the industry can be more self-funded.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> Anyone who takes even a casual look at the way in which the greyhound industry is run would have to be alarmed. We have had various reports and inquiries, such as the Morris report into doping in the greyhound industry and the Indecon report into Bord na gCon which found more disregard for corporate governance and people outstaying their terms on the board. The Oireachtas joint committee published a report highlighting serious flaws in the running of the sector. The integrity of the greyhound industry is in tatters, mainly due to the seemingly <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude to the use of performance enhancing drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> The Greyhound Board of Great Britain warned owners, as late as 2014, of the dangers of buying dogs from Ireland and urged all trainers to exercise caution and due diligence in assessing the drugs status of dogs they might purchase from Ireland. The use of artificial insemination, AI, straws from dogs who are more than two years deceased is illegal, yet this rule is continually flouted to the detriment of the quality and renewal of the breeding stock. This is a terrible state of affairs and it seems as if the Government turns a blind eye and does not enforce the necessary discipline and governance on the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> What is the rationale for the expenditure of this money? The House deserves more than a shrug from the Minister and should demand action to reverse this. Bord na gCon has failed to do its job. The recommendations of Morris, Indecon and the agriculture committee have not been implemented. The Government tells us it is preparing new legislation. There is already legislation to deal with these irregularities and it is not being used. Under these circumstances, I cannot support the funding allocation to these two bodies and I will call a vote on the matter. It is outrageous that this money is being spent in this way.</p>

          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_25">The horse and greyhound sector plays an important role throughout Ireland. It is an important contributor to the economy of rural Ireland and the enjoyment and recreation of rural life, and it supports thousands of jobs. However, the figure of 10,500 jobs in the greyhound industry is more than questionable and does not stand. Jim Power's report was produced six or seven years ago. Let us come into reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> Given that €80 million has been allocated to the two industries, of which €60 million goes to the greyhound industry, it is important we acknowledge that it is taxpayers' funds which have been granted despite many competing demands across society for limited resources. The taxpayer is entitled to expect and get top value for money for this significant investment. I support the allocation of these necessary funds and recognise their importance. However, surely the aim of the industry is to reach a point at which it is less dependent on public funds and becomes self-financing. Representatives of the industry routinely tell us about the circular return of tax money collected from the betting industry. However, it is incorrect. Much of the betting industry is generated through a melee of other sports such as soccer, rugby and darts. Horse racing is one of the smaller contributors. Let us not cod people with lies.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> I support Deputy Jackie Cahill in his point about all bookmakers being treated the same. They should be classified on the basis of turnover. Small bookmakers and offshore bookmakers are gone from the high streets. They have disappeared like nobody's business. Any bookmaker with a turnover lower than €2 million should be classified differently from the likes of Ladbrokes and BoyleSports.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> HRI must ensure a value for money audit is undertaken without delay and assure people that any hiccups in corporate governance are fully addressed. We do not need any further spectacles regarding appointments at the top or elsewhere. All contractual issues should be fully complied with and should be airtight so Government policy is fully recognised as it is laid down and lessons are learned from the debacle we have witnessed. HRI must ensure adequate funding is provided to small racecourses throughout Ireland, such as Kilbeggan, Roscommon, Limerick, Sligo and Ballinrobe. This is the sport of kings, but it should not be for kings. It is time to get away from it. There is an old saying that one stops rubbing fat onto the fat pig's bottom. Too many people are getting well off. It is time to get it down to the very grassroots. They wanted to bring in point-to-points under the regulation. I stopped it, and I am very proud of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> IGB is to receive more than €280,000 per week from the taxpayer this year. A plethora of reports have pointed out significant concerning issues and shortcomings in the industry, which has alarmed many of the stakeholders. The Indecon report, the Morris report and an excellent report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine under the excellent chairmanship of the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, shone a light on significant issues in the greyhound industry in a number of areas, including integrity, doping, medication and general governance.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> The heads of a new Bill for the sector will be ready to go in the new year, and the sooner the better. Hopefully, it will give us all, particularly the stakeholders in the industry, an opportunity to turn over a new leaf and tackle once and for all the use of prohibited substances and ensure welfare objectives are examined and maintained and regulatory controls are strengthened. It is timely to update the legislation. The current legislation was introduced in 1958, almost 60 years ago. No wonder things run out of control. We have two extremes. We have no regulation, or we regulate things out of existence. There is no such thing as a happy medium. This is a major fault. Bureaucrats then get in and regulate things out of existence. When all this is addressed, there will be a renewed confidence in the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> The stakeholders are very concerned about the future, particularly in the dog industry. The old figure of 10,500 people employed in the industry is bandied about. We need full answers, not incomplete or half-baked answers. IGB must be forthcoming in addressing shortcomings and listening to concerned voices when they raise issues. They should not always question the motives of people when they raise issues. People such as Deputy Martin Kenny and others raise issues with the best of motives and I take no issue with them. The Minister has the national greyhound consultative forum which brings together all the stakeholders. It should not be just another <i>pro forma</i> talking shop. It should have teeth and strong powers of recommendation, which IGB should hear. IGB listens only to what it wants to listen to. It comes here and presents us with fairy tales. This must stop. There is money there and IGB must account for it in a proper and efficient way.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_32">The motion will allocate €80 million of public funds to the horse and greyhound racing industry for "business, financial and development plans". It increases the cumulative limit in funds to over €1.1 billion. We understand 80% will be allocated to horse racing and 20% to greyhound racing. These funds are linked to the revenue received from the gambling industry and excise duty on off-course betting. This is a toxic link. It gives an incentive and a massive boost for the promotion of gambling, one of the most parasitic industries. Some reports estimate that 30% to 35% of the industry's profits come from problem gamblers. In other words, it is an industry that destroys people's lives. This link ensures profit is put at the core of the horse and greyhound industries, therefore providing incentives for cruel practices and corruption.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> In recent years, there have been many scandals in the greyhound industry. As part of its anti-doping programme, IGB has reported that 1% of samples tested positive last year. This is only the tip of the iceberg. Pharmacology experts, vets and many in the industry treat those official figures with understandable scepticism. IGB's Morris report on doping has identified severe problems with anti-doping measures in the greyhound industry. The report found the national greyhound laboratory does not have facilities to test many of the drugs used to dope greyhounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> Another major scandal in the greyhound racing industry is that of the dogs behind the scenes that never make it to the tracks. It is estimated that approximately 10,000 greyhounds retire from racing or, as is more common, are born but never make it into racing. Approximately 1,200 were homed last year, leaving 88% with an unknown fate. It must be investigated. We have had high profile cases of dogs being cruelly killed with little or no consequence for those caught. In 2014, there were only 15 investigations into welfare incidents in the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">It is clear that the IGB and the Government is turning a blind eye to the cruelty that exists. Furthermore, we see attempts by the top of the industry to establish new markets in east Asia, China in particular. It is clear that exports to Macau and those involving any states with poor animal rights records and no proper protection for animals should be banned. We have argued for this and will continue to do so in debate on the legislation due on the question of the greyhound industry. We will oppose the motion for these reasons and because it places further profit at the core of the industries and does nothing to tackle the cruelty and corruption involved.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaureenOSullivan" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_36">The greyhound industry is getting some €16 million in funding from the Government, yet within the industry we see appalling examples of animal abuse and lack of concern for animal welfare. I acknowledge that there are greyhound owners who look after their animals, but there are also those who have no compunction and who are always ready to sell off their unwanted greyhounds to places such as Macau. Only for animal welfare campaigners this practice would still be going on. Then there are the greyhounds who do not make the cut and who are abandoned and left to the rescue shelters to be looked after. How much of the €16 million will go to the animal rescue centres? This is an industry in which attendance is down, sponsorship is down and support is down. I draw the Minister of State's attention to Australia, where the Government is leading an investigation into the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> To return to the other aspect of cruelty, namely, live hare coursing, there are so many examples of the hare, the gentlest of animals, being tossed, mauled, injured, killed and terrorised in the name of so-called entertainment. There was the most recent savagery in Rathdowney Coursing Club in County Laois, where the 78 hares in the compound were killed by dogs. This is not an isolated incident. There are other such examples and independent evidence to support it. The coursing gangs illegally capture hares and use them to blood greyhounds. They are given <i>carte blanche</i> to do as they please. I want to know where this fits into the "social and cultural fabric of the country". The Minister of State mentioned good governance, but I want to see a commitment to the principles of animal welfare and the eradication of the blatant cruelty to animals we see in the greyhound industry.</p>

        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_10">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_38">I agree with the points made by my colleague. The idea of giving taxpayers' money to Bord na gCon, an organisation which oversees the barbarism of hare coursing, is absolutely abhorrent. We know from the scandal that engulfed Horse Racing Ireland earlier in the year that the organisation is incapable of handling public money. We must ask ourselves why we are doing this. Why is a salary of €247,000 for the CEO of Horse Racing Ireland, way above the pay cap, being sanctioned? When the scandal broke in the autumn, the excuse given was that Mr. Kavanagh had a contract of indefinite duration, but the lobbying started long before there was even a whiff of his first contract. The documents revealing correspondence back to 2003 are very serious not only for the industry, but also the Department. It seems incredible that in 2010 the Department accepted HRI's contention that Mr. Kavanagh was covered by the transfer of undertakings directive, TUPE, when he was not. He had voluntarily left the Turf Club in 2001 to apply to become the first CEO of HRI, so TUPE did not even exist or apply in this case. The Department surely could have queried this.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> The issue before us is the fact that in the period 2001-16, €1.3 billion has been given to the horse and greyhound racing industries. This is some amount of public money to be given to two commercial enterprises which base themselves on the exploitation of animals for profit - not only animals, but also people. There is a scandal much more significant than that which engulfed the CEO of Horse Racing Ireland earlier this year. I refer to the scandal of the working conditions of people in the industry, which are not only illegal and immoral, but also potentially criminal. The idea of our sanctioning a cent of public money for these organisations is utterly abhorrent. Stable staff are treated in complete breach of the Organisation of Working Time Act, which is being ignored. The vast majority of these people never get two days off in a row, they never get a full weekend off unless they are on holiday and they are not paid for the travel involved in their work. Given the number of hours they are forced to work, it is very likely many are paid less than the minimum wage, which is not only illegal but also a criminal offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> I put the House on notice that come early next year when we return I will call for investigations into this industry way beyond what we have seen already. It is completely out of control and unchecked. The idea that most of the public money going to HRI is spent on prize money is absolutely disgraceful against the backdrop of a severe exploitation of both animals and staff. I will oppose the motion before the House.</p>

        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_11">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_41">The small greyhound owner and the small horse trainer I knew as a buachaill óg were the backbone of rural communities. I listened to the comments of Teachtaí Maureen O'Sullivan and Clare Daly. I have asked them countless times to come and see what really happens in Clonmel at our national coursing meeting but, of course, they have always refused. They are entitled to their points of view, but there are none so blind as those who will not see. The small greyhound owner and the small horse trainer were the backbone of the industry but not any more, unfortunately. The small bookmakers must be supported. Everything in this country has become subject to the idea that big is powerful and wonderful and to hell with the small people. This has got us where we are. We have little control over industries, jobs and much else. Jobs figures were quoted. There once were jobs in this industry, but whether they still exist I do not know. We need a proper holistic evaluation of where we are going. We do not need CEOs on €250,000 per year in either association or €84 million for HRI and €16 million for the greyhound industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> A documentary was aired on RTE last week which I believe is quite damning. Philip Boucher-Hayes said in the documentary that the management of the Irish Coursing Club would not appear in the documentary to be interviewed. It had a right to appear in it and be interviewed and defend the industry and the good people in it. There is no place for the rogues, blackguards and vagabonds that destroy the industry. There is no place for rogue exports of greyhounds such as those spoken about by Deputies O'Sullivan and Daly. These must be weeded out and sorted out because they will destroy our industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> We have fabulous grounds in Waterford, Clonmel and Thurles which can be used for many other social events, such as hospice and schools fundraising and so on. There is a huge industry around the people involved. Everyone I meet who has a greyhound says he or she must have a little trailer and a kennel. Everyone who owns a pony for hunting must have a horsebox, veterinary aids and tack. We cannot be like Sinn Féin and just deny that this is happening at all. Our own people create this industry. It is the big part of the industry I have many issues with. I also have many issues with what is happening in the horse racing industry. Conglomerates such as the one in my area have done great work and are recognised all over the world for their prowess in the racing industry. However, why do they need Government support and the generous tax regime Charlie Haughey introduced in his day to stimulate the industry when they can buy up every parcel of land that comes up for sale in Tipperary, Limerick, Waterford, Cork, Kilkenny, Kildare and beyond? They are not leaving a living for anybody else. We cannot support an industry that takes the lifeblood out of our communities, which is what is happening in the bloodstock industry. The same is happening in other parts of the country. I have called for legislation in this regard. The Minister of State spoke about legislation due next year. I ask him to consider this issue in the legislation. He has failed to do so in the Finance Act or in any other legislation. We do not have a land league. We do not have anybody to protect ordinary small farmers who want to extend their farms to survive and to keep up with quotas, costs and the necessary investment. They can no longer buy a cottage acre; they now resort to buying the cottages with the acres. They want a landscape free of anybody else. Nobody is allowed to live or support anything else.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> I support Deputy Daly's call for an examination of the wages paid in the industry, the pay below minimum wage and the other issues. I have previously met both staff and industry representatives during lobbying of the previous Government on this issue. I understand that racing is normally a weekend event, but I asked them why they must have flexi hours and so on. We need openness and transparency and we need this to be investigated properly. We need to support the small trainers, small bookies and ordinary small families that handle the greyhounds and bed the horses. They have a little luck and bravery and get a little satisfaction out of the sport and love and want to protect it.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> We must also consider animal cruelty. Last year, we could not have our national coursing open in Clonmel because all the hares had been killed by marauding gangs of people whom the animal rights campaigners do not want to tackle at all. These marauding gangs are the same people to whom we talk about giving ethnic status in the very near future in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">The individuals to whom I refer went out with terriers and lurchers. They had videos of the killing of hares. Up to five and six dogs with no muzzles were going after a hare. That is what happened to the industry and that is what is happening because of the gangs to which Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan referred. This is not happening where regulated coursing meetings are held because the representatives of the Irish Coursing Club are present, and rightly so. Moreover, vets and officials from the Department are also present, and rightly so.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> We want a regulated industry and we want to protect it. However, we cannot have people terrorising homes. When people ring the Garda, they are threatened and told that they will be burnt out or that their fences will be cut down. All the hares were killed by dogs, including lurchers and terriers, accompanied by gangs of men in vans. They put up videos on Facebook featuring the hares they had captured and killed using five or six dogs. That is not sport; that is animal cruelty at its worst. Animal rights people, including some Deputies, do not want to know anything about that. These people have protection and are above the law. That is where the problems have to be weeded out.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">On behalf of the Green Party, I wish to add my voice to those of Deputies who have already spoken and raised real concerns about the development of the horse racing, horse breeding and greyhound industries in Ireland. This is not out of disrespect or a dislike for the people involved in those industries. They have a significant role in Irish society and the business world. Sometimes, however, we have to regulate business for the sake of its protection and long-term future. For too long, this House and a succession of Governments have sought to turn a blind eye and have been unwilling to address the real problems that exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> In recent times we have seen scandals emerging relating to exports of Irish greyhounds to the UK. Internationally, questions have been asked about the doping of animals, animal treatment, over-breeding and animals being sent to China. These questions have raised a range of different animal rights issues, which, I believe, we cannot ignore. It is in the interests of people with an interest in dogs and horses that we set the highest standards and get matters right. No one can argue that this exists in the country at present. Let Ireland be one of the best countries in the world for breeding horses and dogs. If it is to become such a country, then let us ensure the highest possible animal welfare and industry standards. I do not believe such standards are currently in place. For that reason, we will oppose the motion and support the vote that will be called by others.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">As we know, the rate of rent increases has been spiralling out of control in recent years. Rents have been soaring across the country. We know from various surveys, particularly the most recent <i>daft.ie</i> survey, which related to the third quarter of 2016, that there have been extraordinary increases in rent inflation. The annual rate of rent inflation was 11.7% last year. This was the highest increase recorded since 2002. Up to 2013-14, Dublin was the major driver of national rental inflation. Other areas have caught up dramatically since 2012-13. Some extraordinary increases were recorded last year. There were rent increases of 14.4% in Cork city, 12.5% in Cork county, 13.27% in Limerick, 10% in Galway, 13% in Waterford city, 15% in Meath, 13% in Kildare, 15% in Louth and 10.6% in Wicklow. I have itemised those increases to give people a sense of the scale of rental inflation across the country, including key urban areas and commuter belt areas, over recent years. There is a need to bring these increases under control and bring clarity to this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> We acknowledge that there have been changes in recent months. The possibility of increasing rent supplement was resisted for many years until the confidence and supply agreement between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael resulted in such an increase, despite misgivings in Fine Gael, as well as increases in payments under the housing assistance programme. We also acknowledge that there has been a long struggle in relation to rent certainty and clarity. The Labour Party tried to bring that about when it was a member of the last Government, but it failed to get a breakthrough. It must be acknowledged that there seems to have been strong resistance in Fine Gael to any idea of a rent cap or rent clarity.</p>

          <p eId="para_62">I make these points to acknowledge that there has been change within the Fine Gael Party regarding the idea of rent clarity. I think that has been brought about by public pressure. Our view is that the Minister's announcements are far too limited in scope and scale. Given the figures I have just outlined, the geography issue is for too restrictive and too limited. The boundaries of the cities do not take account of the suburban conurbations contiguous to the cities of Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Galway, etc. In many ways, these proposals appear to be too little, too late.</p>

          <p eId="para_74">I thank Deputy Martin for his question. This situation is unprecedented. It has been around for a very long time. Particular aims are set out in the Minister's comprehensive, targeted and focused rental strategy programme, which is the first intervention in the housing market here to be made by any Government. A great deal of discussion is going on with Deputy Martin's spokesman, whom I heard speaking this morning and at other times about the three issues Deputy Martin has just raised. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has responded to the three issues in question. Deputy Martin will be aware that the Minister for Finance has set up a working group on the taxation issue. In this year's budget, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, said he intends to increase the deductibility limit in respect of landlords until it gets to 100%. He set out the timescale for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> Deputy Martin also asked about contiguous areas of the cities of Dublin and Cork, which have been included in the Minister's proposals. It is clear that this will be assessed on the basis of local electoral areas by the Residential Tenancies Board. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, is confident that the areas in question can be extended. He will have an answer to that question by February, by which time he will have received the board's assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> The decision to set the cap at 4% was made for a number of specific reasons. First, there is a need to ensure there is a reasonable rate of return on investment so that there is no spike effect at the end of the period of the designation. In other words, a lower limit could have the effect of storing up a sudden upward correction for tenants after three years. Second, the Government previously endorsed a limit of 4% per annum on a rolling five-year basis as a reasonable rate of return in the target portfolio set out in the ISIF investment strategy report, which was published in 2015. Third, the level we have chosen is 20% lower than this country's long-run annual rent increases over seven decades. Fourth, the maximum allowed inflation in rental pressure zones will be less than half of the current rate of annual rent inflation nationally. It is below the allowed rental inflation in a number of other countries where rents are indexed, including Germany, where rents may be increased by a maximum of 20% over a three-year period;-----</p>

          <p eId="para_85">The Government has left it very late in terms of the consultation and the publication of the amendments. They have to be in by 1 p.m. today. It is important to have engagement and consultation. It is incredible that we are where we are, in terms of proposals of this gravity and importance, in the last Dáil sitting week of the year. We are here and we do not want to render tenants more vulnerable now that the proposals have been announced by leaving them to be exploited over the intervening period. We will constructively try to get a resolution to this. We are not satisfied with the capacity of the Residential Tenancies Board to deal with all of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">We believe the extended areas should be included in the amendments. It is just too restricted at present in respect of Dublin city and Cork city. It has to be expanded beyond those cities and that expansion has to be included in the amendments to the legislation, in our view, and that has to happen forthwith. The proposed increase of 4% is, again, a matter that has to be resolved by the Dáil. We have a view that it is excessive and we are holding to that. We are prepared to be constructive in our engagement with the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_94">I point out to Deputy Micheál Martin that this came into the Seanad approximately six weeks ago. It was made perfectly clear - and every spokesperson and all the parties understood - that it would be in the final week session that the matter would come before the Dáil, so it is not a case of it being very late for consultation. Consultations are ongoing with Fianna Fáil and with anybody else who wants to have them. Yesterday, the Minister spent the full day at the select committee dealing with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> The RTB has been given extra resources. As pointed out, the start is with Cork and Dublin but, clearly, there are pressures in other locations. The RTB has been given extra resources to deal with this and it can respond and will have answers to the question by February. This is a really important matter for thousands of people and I hope this legislation will not be delayed. I have pointed out to the Deputy the very strong reasons why the Government set the cap at 4% and, obviously, those reasons stand up. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, is quite willing to continue to discuss with the Fianna Fáil spokesperson the issues surrounding landlords, taxation in respect of the geographical areas and how that can be implemented expeditiously, and the very strong reasons for striking a balance which is structured and directed to help tenants and continue the supply of housing.</p>

          <p eId="para_99">Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil do dhícheall á dhéanamh agat. Yesterday, I raised with the Taoiseach the Government's ill-thought-out proposals on the rental sector. I focused on two elements, namely, the absence of rent certainty and the Government's failure to deal with the difficulties - or even acknowledge the difficulties - faced by families in rented accommodation outside of the cities of Dublin and Cork. I did so because these are the two big failures with the Government's proposals but also because, like other Deputies, we did not have any sight of its propositions. That is the way the Government does business. The media was briefed and the document, complete with glossy brochure and all the other PR accoutrements, was launched outside the Dáil Chamber. This Government has produced more reports and press releases on housing and homelessness than it has built homes - that is the record of the Government. Deputies, who actually have the responsibility to vote on these measures, were kept in the dark about the detail. Now, contrary to the Taoiseach's protestations, he is rushing it through.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> Sinn Féin's housing spokesperson, Deputy Eoin Ó Broin, tabled 90 amendments on Committee Stage, including one on rent certainty. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael voted it down once again. We have tabled more substantive amendments today but the Government does not want any of them. All the bad old practices that marked the Government's previous term are being carried through into this term. The Taoiseach cannot even rely on Fianna Fáil on this one, or maybe he can. Part of Fianna Fáil's play-acting at being an Opposition party - the party of verbalised republicanism, the party which caused the crisis - is that every so often it has to engage in a sham fight with the Government. All the while, the 700,000 citizens in the private rented sector are being fleeced.</p>
          <p eId="para_101"> When we first brought these issues of homelessness, families in mortgage distress, the absence of social housing and the exploitation of families in the private sector to the Taoiseach's attention three or four years ago, he refused to act. He said it is clear that "interference in the market ... is not something we should do. While people are calling for what they call clarity on rent certainty, if we interfere in the wrong way, we will make matters worse." In fairness, the Government has interfered in the market - that is what it did yesterday. It has not quite abandoned its ideological position but it has set aside the principle in an inadequate way which, to use the Taoiseach's own words, has made matters worse. The people it has made matters worse for are the 700,000 citizens in that sector. They cannot afford the thousands of euro the Government proposals demand of them. I appeal to the Taoiseach to do the right thing, the proper thing, namely, introduce rent certainty, not rent punishment, and link rent increases to the consumer price index. That is the only solution that will adequately tackle this crisis.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_58">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_103">First, Deputy Adams has not read this document. It is not ill-thought-out at all. It is the result of intensive discussions, negotiations and presentations in recent months. Some 500 submissions were sent to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and they have been very carefully scrutinised. Of course, the starting point is the rental pressures in Cork and Dublin but that does not exclude other areas, and these are defined by sustained rental increases over a period that are above the national average. The RTB is being given extra resources to enable it to define those and by February it will have an answer to those questions of where rental pressure zones should be endorsed by and sanctioned by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> This year, 2016, 17,000 social housing units will be provided, not all new houses, but including returned voids, others that have been renovated and so on. Deputy Adams's idea seems to be that he wants to shut down supply entirely. He wants the Government to provide everything for everybody. He wants to have a cap right across the country which would simply stifle progress entirely. What is involved in this rental strategy is one of the five pillars of the comprehensive housing strategy provided by the Minister. It presents the opportunity for tenants to understand that their tenancies can continue. At the same time, it also ensures that there is a reasonable rate of return for private property let into the rental market and does not interfere with new houses or second-hand dwellings that are extensively renovated, even within rental pressure zones.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> The fundamental issue is a supply problem. Due to the fact that the supply is not there, the rental situation has been exacerbated. We understand and appreciate the great difficulty that thousands of people have in respect of increasing rents in tenancies. That is why the Government is intervening here and is only doing so after very careful analysis of the conditions that should apply. The Fianna Fáil Party raised a number of issues and these are being discussed. I hope this House will see fit to let this legislation through this week, which will benefit thousands of people who are tenants in houses and who have a legitimate fear of or concern about rent rising. At the same time, it will not stultify supply of housing, as Deputy Adams would.</p>

          <p eId="para_106">The Taoiseach says that the supply of houses is not there. Why is it not there? It is because the Government will not put public money into it. Instead, it put taxpayers' money into the pockets of the big bankers and their cronies.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> The Minister said yesterday, "Really, we're kind of putting a bridle on the horse that has been almost out of control for the last two years". He said: "kind of". That describes it well - it is a "kind of" proposal and a "kind of" policy. Yesterday's announcement locks in rent increases of 12% for renters in Dublin city and Cork city, and that is on top of the runaway rent increases for everybody else. Four families a day are becoming homeless. What about the people outside Dublin city and Cork city? What about the people in the commuter belt? They are doomed to expect even higher increases in rents, which is what this plan envisages.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">The Taoiseach ignored my substantive point when he responded to me a moment ago. The Government has interfered belatedly but inadequately with the market. It has conceded the principle. Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that? Having conceded the principle, why not follow through with rent certainty? He should explain why the Government will not follow through with rent certainty.</p>

          <p eId="para_116">I took part in a concert last night that was raising funds for two charities, one of which was the Capuchin day centre in Church Street and I listened to Brother Kevin make a speech. It was staggering to hear of the increasing numbers the centre is feeding and it was heartbreaking to listen to the stories of individuals and families who are engaging with the centre. We know the situation is worsening. We also know of the difficulties facing those with a disability and in our health service. We live in a very unequal society yet we live in the so-called developed world and can imagine what it is like for those living in the developing world. A major driver of this inequality is the economic, financial and tax policies of governments. What kind of society do we want to live in? If we want a fairer more equal society then, strange as it may seem, we have to apply morality and ethics to taxes and finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> Last Monday, there was a very damning analysis in the report by Oxfam which puts Ireland in a list of 15 countries that are tax havens. While the Minister for Finance is very dismissive of the report, we have to take it seriously and consider it. Oxfam and other non-governmental organisations are highlighting tax injustice which has repercussions for our societies. Tax injustice comes from businesses, multinationals and corporations avoiding and evading tax. Over the past 30 years, the net profits posted by the world's largest companies more than tripled in real terms from €2 trillion to €7.2 trillion but that increase was not matched by a rise in corporate income tax returns. If we are serious about eliminating poverty, we have to have an efficient, well thought out and fair tax system. That means examining the taxing and profits of companies and large corporations because if we do that countries have more to invest in public services such as housing, education and health. Developing countries are up to three times more vulnerable to the negative effects of our tax policies than are the rich countries. It is calculated that they are losing $100 billion yearly as a result of this tax avoidance. Our role and reputation on the sustainable development goals will be completely undermined unless we commit in real and practical terms to the principle of tax justice which means a fairer world for everyone. </p>
          <p eId="para_118"> The Taoiseach gave a commitment to hold a conference and high level meeting on tax in early 2017. I would like to see a real adequate space for tax justice with the voices of those active in this area who see the effects of the tax policies of the developed world impacting on us and on the developing world. There has to be an input from those tax justice people and a commitment to the principle of tax justice.</p>

          <p eId="para_119">The report published by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, yesterday showed that those on lowest incomes benefited most from the budget. We have tried over recent years to improve the lot of those on lower incomes, principally by reducing the level of unemployment and providing a pathway and a road into jobs which is the route out of poverty but also by assistances such as reduction in or elimination of tax in some cases and the improvement in the minimum wage as recommended by the Low Pay Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> The Deputy raises a couple of important points. I heard comment on the Oxfam report yesterday. Ireland very strongly rejects allegations that this country is a tax haven.</p>

          <p eId="para_122">We do not meet any of the international standards for being considered a tax haven. We are fully compliant with all the best practices in the areas of transparency and exchange of information. We have and want real substantive foreign direct investment, the kind that brings real jobs and investment into the country and the wider community. The Oxfam report includes Ireland's 12.5% rate as one of the factors in saying that this country is a tax haven. I reject that and strongly refute this characterisation of our tax rate. The 12.5% is fully in line with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, and international best practice in having a low rate and applying it to a very wide tax base. The 12.5% rate is available only on trading profits where there is a substantial activity in Ireland and our corporate tax policies are designed to attract real and substantive operations to Ireland. We have not been and never will be a brass plate location. The Deputy is aware that we got rid of the stateless and the "double Irish" concepts. This is the first country to have a fully OECD compliant knowledge box which is available to make our country continue to be attractive for investment in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> The Oxfam report mentions Ireland in the context of profit-shifting activities. We have been clear that we believe that aggressive tax planning can be best countered by international tax reform and have been at the forefront of that movement for some time. We are an active participant in the global work to reform the international corporate tax system. We have implemented country by country reporting. We have agreed the anti-tax avoidance directive and are working towards the implementation of the remaining elements of the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, recommendations domestically and internationally. On budget day the Minister for Finance published an update on Ireland's international tax strategy which highlights our continuing efforts in this regard. I completely refute allegations of Ireland being a tax haven.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> The Deputy mentioned having a forum for tax justice. We will hold a major economic forum in Dublin in January. Perhaps it would be appropriate to build an opportunity for that kind of discussion around that time and I will communicate with Deputy O'Sullivan on that issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_125">I do believe damage has been done to our reputation. There is one way to ensure our reputation is restored. We can be more proactive in supporting and adhering to the public country by country reporting and committing to the highest level of transparency. We should ensure that companies are made to conduct their tax business in a more just and open way. That is the way to disprove and challenge the Oxfam report.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> Our development aid programme is one of the world's best. It is acknowledged that human rights are at the heart of our foreign affairs policy so they should be at the heart of our domestic policy also. Joseph Wresinksi, founder of All Together in Dignity, said "extreme poverty does not have to exist. Human beings create it and they are the ones who can put an end to it." The Taoiseach mentioned the meeting in January but I want to talk about the other high level meeting that I think was part of his commitment. We have nothing to fear. Let us read the Oxfam report and let Oxfam and the other NGOs come in and have a real debate on tax justice and the implications of tax policies for Ireland and other countries.</p>

          <p eId="para_127">We have nothing to hide. We have been very clear and upfront about all these matters. I will find an opportunity where that can happen, where the Oxfam report can be debated in public and where we can stand over what we say about the changes we have made in the tax position, the actions we have taken both nationally and internationally and disprove any claims or allegations that this country belongs to a category of what one might call tax havens. I value the Deputy's suggestion and I thank her.</p>

          <p eId="para_128">I, too, would like to raise the issue of the Oxfam report that came out on Monday. Deputy O'Sullivan quite rightly refers to the need for tax justice. Another way to look at this might be enlightened self-interest in that if we do our bit for global taxation, it will make for a stronger reputation for Ireland and a stronger investment in Ireland. As the Taoiseach knows, Oxfam has ranked Ireland as the sixth-worst tax haven in the world. It would be easy to dismiss Oxfam's report as unfair, misleading or alarmist. However, it is not alone. In 2013, Ireland was singled out as a tax haven by the US Senate committee on homeland security. In 2015, the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty reported that, when lists of tax havens are drawn up, Ireland is always prominent among them. Just a few months ago, Brazil added Ireland to its list of tax havens. I agree with the Taoiseach that Ireland is absolutely not a tax haven. However, there is a growing international perception that we just might be. That is damaging our international reputation, but it could do far worse. Our international trade treaties are predicated on us not being a tax haven.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> Oxfam has levelled three charges at Ireland. The first charge is that our corporation tax rate is too low. With the greatest of respect to Oxfam, I would suggest that that is none of its business. That is entirely within the competence of this country. The second charge that Oxfam levels is that Ireland facilitates large-scale profit sharing. Several years ago, that would have been a very reasonable charge. However, I agree that considerable progress has been made in recent years. The third charge that Oxfam levels at us is that we offer tax incentives to certain sectors that allows them to avoid paying tax. On this point, unfortunately, Oxfam is absolutely on the money.</p>
          <p eId="para_130"> In recent years, we have seen the creation of new suite of investment funds for property investors. Some of the investors are domestic, but they are mainly foreign. These include real estate investment trusts, qualified investment funds, Irish collective asset management vehicles, and now, most recently, Irish real estate funds. Until a few years ago, property companies paid tax on their profits, just like other companies in Ireland. Almost every OECD country applies that principle. Ireland does not anymore. Using these new vehicles, big foreign landlords can pay no tax in Ireland on massive profits. Critically, they do not have to file publicly accessible accounts. We do not know what level of taxes are being avoided, we do not know what profits are being offshored and we do not know what rulings these funds have received from the Revenue Commissioners. What is worrying is that the OECD lists four criteria for tax havens, and in Ireland, foreign landlords now meet three of those four criteria. I have two questions. First, does the Taoiseach agree that property companies in Ireland should pay taxes on the profits they make in Ireland? Second, does the Taoiseach agree that investment funds availing of tax avoidance mechanisms in this country should have to file publicly accessible accounts?</p>

          <p eId="para_131">I thank Deputy Donnelly for his comments and question. I acknowledge his assistance with the Finance Act and other matters, particularly with section 110, which the Deputy raised and to which some changes were made and brought about in this House. I recall the comments that were made at the US Senate committee indicating that Ireland was alleged to be a tax haven. That was later disproved and commented upon. I am aware of the action taken by Brazil. Ireland is not the first country that that has been applied to. We reject that as well. In respect of the Deputy's comments on the international trade treaties, corporation tax is a matter for each individual country. National competence is enshrined in the European treaties. The Deputy is right that this is Ireland's business. In respect of the profit-sharing issue the Deputy raised, he also referred to the third charge which was about tax incentives to avoid paying tax. There was an appeal lodged by the Attorney General on behalf of the Government in respect of a finding or ruling made by the European Commission in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> Irish collective asset management vehicles, or ICAVs, as they are called, are one of a range of legal structures which regulated collective investment schemes can take. Others include investment limited partnerships, common contractual funds, unit trusts and investment companies. Of these, only the investment companies are obliged to publish their accounts in accordance with the Companies Act. ICAVs are still obliged to keep proper books of accounts that must be audited and be made available to persons who have a right to inspect the accounts, including the competent authorities for investment funds, which are the Central Bank of Ireland and the Revenue Commissioners. Failure by the directors of an ICAV to ensure this happens is subject to very serious consequences, including the possibility of prosecution and administrative sanction. I have also noticed that ICAVs are subject to additional layers of regulation that most other companies are not. These are not only additional domestic rules but European rules that also apply to such structures under the requirements imposed by the undertaking for collective investment of transferable securities, UCITS, directive and the alternative investment fund managers, AIFM, directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> In the Finance Act, the Minister for Finance also made changes to the taxation of Irish funds that hold Irish real estate. Irish real estate funds must deduct a 20% withholding tax or certain property distributions to non-resident investors. The legislation there addresses the concerns raised regarding the use of fund vehicles to invest in Irish property. The Finance Act also introduced legislation to address concerns that had been raised by Deputy Donnelly in respect of the section 110 regime whereby some investors minimise their Irish tax liabilities on Irish property transactions. This will close off the unintended use of the section 110 regime for Irish property transactions.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> The Irish funds industry is obviously a key part of the internationally traded financial services sector, often referred to as the IFSC. Some 12,500 people are employed directly and indirectly, both in Dublin and in a number of locations throughout the country. There is some €2 trillion of assets under the management of funds in Dublin. The sector services a further €2 trillion in assets domiciled elsewhere. This area of IFSC remains by some margin its biggest sector of employment. Clearly, the funds may be structured in different ways, as the Deputy has pointed out. The Minister has moved in the Finance Act to address two issues-----</p>

          <p eId="para_138">Let me give the Taoiseach an example. Cerberus has just filed its 2015 accounts for Project Eagle. By my reckoning, it made about £168 million in taxable profits and paid less than £1,600 in tax. That is a 0.001% tax rate. I acknowledge the very significant moves by the Government in the Finance Act on companies under section 110. What is interesting about the Project Eagle accounts is that Cerberus has moved about half of the assets out of section 110, because section 110 companies have to file publicly accessible accounts. The only reason vulture funds were shut down was because Deputies in this House, journalists and Senators were able to see them and raise this issue. They could not hide the amount of tax that was being avoided. However, about half of what came under section 110, hundreds of millions of pounds of assets, has been moved out of it. We have no idea where it has gone. If it has gone into a qualified investment fund, an ICAV or one of these, we will no longer be able to see what is being done with it. That is the core of my question. The Taoiseach stated to Deputy O'Sullivan that we have nothing to hide in Ireland. I agree. Were I or another Member to table a Bill stating that these funds, ICAVs and qualifying investor funds, QIFs, in particular, had to file publicly accessible accounts, would the Taoiseach look upon it on favourably?</p>

          <p eId="para_139">As I said, I acknowledge the fact the Deputy raised section 110 on a number of occasions, which was a subject of quite intensive discussion and change during the passage of the Finance Act. The second of the changes the Minister brought in related to the Irish fund vehicles. The Finance Act provides for the introduction of a tax regime for Irish real estate funds, or IREFs. That legislation will ensure the Irish tax base is appropriately protected, where Irish funds are used to hold Irish real estate. The key feature, as the Deputy knows, is that an IREF is a fund in which 25% or more of the value of the fund is made up of Irish real estate assets. Any rental income or development profits earned by that IREF will be included in the calculation of its profits.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">Capital gains will be included in the calculation of profits unless the asset is held for five years or more, except where the investor can influence or control the IRF. Where an IRF makes a distribution, non-resident investors will be subject to a withholding tax of 20%.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> I am not saying that everything has been done here in terms of dealing with the issues that Deputy Donnelly raises. I do not have the details regarding Cerberus, as mentioned by him. Clearly, this is a matter in which the Minister for Finance has taken an interest and he has moved to change the law to make it more open, accountable and transparent where that is necessary. I am sure if further changes have to be made, he would be willing to do that too.</p>

          <p eId="para_143">I wish to make a short correction. On 6 December last, in response to a question from Deputy Micheál Martin on the case of the murder of Brian Stack, I said that it was "beyond comprehension that a Member of the House can drive someone in a van with blacked out windows to meet another person to talk about who had shot his father, that the names are given to the Garda Commissioner and that the son of the murdered man says he did not supply the names". I received a letter from Deputy Gerry Adams saying that I should correct the Dáil record. I now do so. I understand from the statements made by Deputy Adams himself that he drove the Stack brothers in his own car to a point where they then travelled in a blacked out van, in which I assume he was the passenger. I wish to correct the record of the Dáil to the effect that Deputy Adams did not drive the blacked out van but he did travel in it.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">There are commitments in the programme for Government to improve waiting times for hospital procedures and to reduce the length of time from when a patient presents at an emergency department to his or her discharge home or admission to a ward. To implement these commitments, however, there must be a full quota of nursing staff. Today there are 3,500 fewer nurses employed by the HSE than in 2009. There are shortages in most specialised areas. The HSE is spending €1.2 million on agency nurses per week instead of making real efforts to fill the vacant positions. There are no real incentives to attract Irish nurses home to work in Irish hospitals. In the past two to three years, up to 20,000 Irish nurses applied for certificates to work abroad. This in an alarming reality in our health service today.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> Nurses are working overtime, are not being replaced when on leave and are expected constantly to meet increased demands with fewer staff. The Government and the HSE seem detached from this and are not tackling the issue. Last August a report was prepared on the crisis in emergency departments. It recommended recruiting 200 additional nurses to cope with the extra patients in emergency departments who were waiting for admission, but not one nurse has been recruited. The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, will launch the HSE service plan today which will read like a work of fiction unless practical measures are taken to address what is, by any yardstick, a substantial manpower crisis in our health service, particularly in nursing where there is an acute shortage. That shortage is now impacting on the quality of care and the delivery of services to patients. It is quite staggering.</p>

          <p eId="para_147">I thank Deputy Martin for his question. The HSE service plan will be published today. The agency's budget is €14 billion, the highest amount ever allocated to a health service plan. The plan contains a number of very important and positive developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> The Deputy raises an important point. The HSE has recruited 500 staff for each of the past two months and before that. Of the most recent 500, 160 were nurses, 180 were community therapists and professional health care workers and 73 were medical posts. We have difficulties in some areas because of viruses and other illnesses which have led to a shortage of staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> I welcome that the HSE announced today that it will host a further open recruitment event on 28, 29 and 30 of this month for nurses and midwives from all disciplines who are interested in working in the Irish health service. This will target nurses returning home for Christmas. There will be walk-in interviews on each day. This will be the first in a series of career day events for nurses throughout 2017. The Deputy will also be aware that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, restored the incremental credits to trainee nurses. When they emerge from training, they are offered permanent jobs. Recruitment is a challenge, admittedly. Other countries offer different facilities, but I hope that we can make an improvement as time goes on.</p>

          <p eId="para_150">The former Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, told the Traveller community more than 20 months ago that Traveller ethnicity would be recognised within six months. This, understandably, raised expectations which were not delivered on. I have raised this issue consistently with the Taoiseach and have pointed out that there is no legislative or constitutional bar to the Government recognising Traveller ethnicity immediately. All it requires is the Taoiseach or some nominated Minister to come into the House and make such a declaration.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> I know that the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy David Stanton, has been working on this very important issue. I support him, have met him and wish him well. My party will do anything it can to help. Recently Government sources were quoted as saying that the Taoiseach was going to recognise Traveller ethnicity. Pavee Point described this possibility as a "major step forward for Travellers, cultural diversity and equality". The Taoiseach can make this possibility a reality. When will he move to recognise Traveller ethnicity?</p>

          <p eId="para_152">I discussed this with the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, at a recent meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee dealing with social affairs. He is doing quite an amount of work on the issue. I have asked him to invite the four Traveller representative non-governmental organisations, NGOs, to speak to the Oireachtas committee in January. There are a few particular issues that need to be addressed. I would expect, if we can reach agreement on this, that there would be all-party support for it. These are the last two pieces of work that the Minister of State is undertaking. I will report to the House again at the end of January on the matter.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T12:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_153">One of the hidden crises in society is gambling addiction. It gets far less attention than other forms of addiction but in many ways it is more insidious and causes incredible harm. The gambling control Bill, which has been promised for some considerable time, was to provide a new regulatory and licensing framework to deal with gambling and to provide for a new regulatory body. The Taoiseach will recall that the previous Administration established a regulator for the national lottery. Part of the thought process at that time was that, in time, the lottery regulator might well become the gambling regulator. We need to have an authoritative body with strong legislative powers to deal with gambling and especially the growing propensity of people to gamble incredible amounts of money online. What progress has been made on the gambling control Bill? Will the Taoiseach make it a priority? Will he share his thoughts on the possible structure of the authority?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_87">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T12:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_154">Yes, I will make it a priority. The Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy David Stanton, is also working on this. This morning I attended an event hosted by the Gaelic Players Association. GAA players, who are ambassadors for sport and role models for young people, are working hard on the issue of addiction to drugs, drink or gambling. In many cases, the latter addiction is the worst of all.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> The general scheme of the gambling control Bill was published in July 2013 following approval by the Government, which I am sure Deputy Howlin will recall. The scheme was then referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. That committee received 29 submissions and held public hearings. It finalised its report on 6 November 2013 which considered eight conclusions, and that report was laid before the Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">That 2013 scheme provides for the conferring of responsibility for all regulatory matters in this area on the Minister for Justice and Equality, including licensing, inspections and prosecution. It is envisaged that these functions will be carried out by a body located within the Department of Justice and Equality. That scheme also provided for a dedicated inspectorate to ensure compliance by licence holders with the terms of their licences and the new legislation generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> On the current situation, it remains the intention to proceed with this legislation at the earliest opportunity. Quite a lot of legislation has been coming through, as the Deputy is aware. I will regard it as a priority and I will have the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, update Deputy Howlin on the current state of progress in respect of the Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jackie Cahill<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_158">There is a commitment in the programme for Government that Fáilte Ireland would be directed to develop the Irish lake lands brand as a separate proposition alongside the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East. The Wild Atlantic Way has worked in terms of tourism along the western seaboard. However, only 4% of tourists visit lake lands districts and the potential of the Shannon as a tourism attraction is seriously under-developed and under-resourced. I press the Government to move ahead with this direction to Fáilte Ireland to develop the lake lands of the Shannon region for tourism. Undoubtedly, it has potential but it needs to be branded and progressed.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_159">I accept what Deputy Cahill is saying. I would assume that no area will thrive unless those who live in it make it attractive so that people will hear about it and want to visit for a good hospitality experience. Fáilte Ireland has its brief in this regard. The concept of the Wild Atlantic Way is one that has caught on very much because of its very nature. Lake lands are beautiful areas across the midlands of the country, and the Ancient East. Part of the Creative Ireland strategy and the strategy to be published in January for the development of rural Ireland will include this aspect. All these things are interlinked but at the end of the day, it is up to the proprietors and proposers in those regions to market their areas and outline the reasons tourists should visit them. Whether it is lake boating, fishing, the scenery or whatever, there are endless opportunities. I would like to think it can happen over the next number of years and that a lake district will become very much better known than heretofore.</p>

          <p eId="para_160">Following on from the Stormont House Agreement, the Irish and British Governments came to an agreement to establish the Independent Commission on Information Retrieval, ICIR. The ICIR agreement was signed by the Irish Minister in 2015 and laid before the Oireachtas in January 2016. The objective of the ICIR was to enable victims and survivors to seek and privately receive information about the deaths of their kin in the conflict. The independent commission will only be formally established after the necessary legislation has been enacted and the two Governments have notified each other of completion of all other domestic legal procedures required to bring the agreement into force. When will the Government complete this domestic legal procedure, and when will we see the ICIR agreement being established?</p>

          <p eId="para_161">We might have made more progress on this but for the arrival of the Brexit decision and the fact that 2016 was a different year, with the election and a long period in between before a partnership Government was put together. I strongly supported the principle behind the agreement. The heads of this Bill are being prepared here. I will advise Deputy Crowe of the current state of preparation. The intention is that where somebody lost a loved one, however far back, whatever information is available, from whatever source, will be produced by an independent adjudicator. It remains to be seen whether that will become a reality. There were many difficult cases over many years, as the Deputy is well aware, where people were not able to find out the full truth and extent of what actually happened. I will advise Deputy Crowe of the progress being made on the heads of the Bill.</p>

In a very short space of time, therefore, we see a Damascene conversion, which is welcome, but St. Paul went the whole nine yards and became a Christian. The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, falls well short of sainthood in these proposals in finally introducing the discussion around rent controls, but we have not seen the amendments. When will the Bills Office receive those amendments so that we can read them, and how much time will we be given to amend them and to deal with them? I remind the House that the question of the introduction of rent controls was strongly resisted by this Government for years.</p>

        <heading>Famine Memorial Bill 2016: First Stage<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T12:50:00+00:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#PeadarToibin" eId="spk_119">
          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_189">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_190">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for the holding of Famine Memorial Day on the same day each year and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">The aim of this Bill is simple. It is to place our Famine memorial day on a fixed date each year, namely, the second Sunday of May. While we have had the commemoration date since 2008, this Bill will ensure that the date does not swing, as it currently does, from May to September each year. It will mean that, nationally and internationally, Irish people and the diaspora can plan, prepare and commemorate this time in our history with the recognition it deserves. For example, we do not know at this late stage when the national Famine day will take place next year. This annual uncertainty over the commemoration date is shocking, given it is the biggest event to befall the people of this country. We have a national day of commemoration in remembrance of the Irish people who died in past wars, which falls on the Sunday nearest to 11 July. It is surprising, therefore, that we do not have a fixed date for the commemoration to honour the victims of the Great Irish Famine and its survivors.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> The Irish Famine poses an uncomfortable stain on the legacy of British imperialism. While the potato blight was a natural aberration, Ireland's people, who were utterly subjugated and whose land and resources were mercilessly exploited, were incredibly vulnerable and suffered far more than any other people who suffered famines in Europe at the time. The scars of the Famine are still visible throughout the countryside, physically in the ruined cottages and on lonely ridges where the blighted potatoes were left unpicked.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">However, the lasting consequence of the Great Hunger was the massive depopulation of this country where more than 1 million people died and a million people were forced to emigrate. These are conservative estimates. This country has still not returned to its pre-Famine population level. It is estimated that halfway through the 19th century 9 million lived on the island of Ireland. By 1861, this had fallen to 4.4 million. That population decrease continued until the 1960s.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> The legacy of emigration still exists. The sad fact is, because of the start of emigration during the Famine, we still have emigration as a defining characteristic of the Irish population and we still see its effects in rural areas today.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> The language shift from Irish to English was compounded by the Famine, and those who lived throughout the Famine knew that if they had to go to America or to England, they would have to use the English language to survive. That language shift was enhanced by that brutal pragmatism forced by the Famine at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> The dearth of Irish poetry and music from the era will testify to the utter horror that befell the Irish people. The following is an extract from one of the few songs that exists from this time, "Amhrán na bPrátaí Dubha", written by Máire Ní Dhroma when the worst effects hit Ring in Waterford:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_197">Tá na bochta so Éireann ag plé leis an ainnise,</p>

          <p eId="para_209"> The response to the Famine by England was at best indifferent and at worst utterly inhumane. Public works were established in order that the impoverished and weakened men would labour at building useless roads, follies and other pointless projects for pitiful sums of money. Irish ports did not close during the Famine for exports and it is a matter of historical fact that millions of pounds worth of Irish food, including grain and even butter, were sent for export while hundreds of thousands were literally left starving to death. I am not deliberately being emotive on this issue. These are matters of fact. While myths abound with regards to the Great Hunger and how it could happen under Britain's watch, some have speculated that it was an attempt at depopulation or a manner to quell dissent by the obliteration of the poorest cottier class. No doubt the Famine painfully impressed upon the generation of O'Donovan Rossa that self-determination was a matter of life and death.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> We need a fixed memorial day to remember the Great Irish Famine, to remember the human cost and consequences of neglect, to remember the effects when an economic imperative is prioritised and to recognise the dark shadows of colonial might. Most of all, a fixed day of remembrance would honour those victims and survivors of the Great Famine and allow us to remember what our ancestors lived through.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> It is an Irish tragedy, but with global significance. There is a plaque on the Dublin Mansion House honouring the Native American Choctaw tribe who contributed so generously to the Famine victims. It reads: "Their humanity calls us to remember the millions of human beings throughout our world today who die of hunger and hunger related illness in a world of plenty." There are 800 million such people around the world today. Let us fix this day of national commemoration in order that we can remember those who suffer today, as those in this country did once.</p>

          <p eId="para_219">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_220">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Employment Equality Act 1998 to allow for the abolition of mandatory retirement where an employee can provide evidence of full fitness to work as required in their contract of employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">This Bill arises from a policy document issued by Fianna Fáil in 2012. That policy document gave rise to a Bill, published by the then Senator Mary White, entitled the Employment Equality (Amendment) Bill 2012. Now, in 2016, I am pleased, alongside Deputy Butler, to publish the Employment Equality (Amendment) Bill of 2016 which again seeks to end compulsory retirement in this country. To broaden choice and rights, Fianna Fáil seeks an end to compulsory retirement of persons at the age of 65, whether in the public or the private sectors, and to make it unlawful to require a person to retire at or above the age of 65 unless there are clearly specified grounds justifying such compulsory retirement, such as competence and performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> Fianna Fáil believes that we should do what we can to recognise the potential of our ageing population to contribute to and enrich our society in many diverse ways given their talents, experience and wisdom and the many years of healthy life expectancy which, happily, most can enjoy. With that in mind, it is time to abolish mandatory retirement in order that people can continue to work beyond normal retirement age should they wish to do so, and that is precisely what this Bill proposes to do.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryButler" eId="spk_128">
          <from>Deputy Mary Butler<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T13:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_223">In Ireland today, people are living longer and have more years of healthy active living than previous generations enjoyed. Today, a woman, when she reaches the age of 65, has an average life expectancy of a further 20 years while a man can anticipate 17 additional years of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> We have an ever-growing number of older people in our midst. They are projected to double in number from 500,000 today to 1 million in less than 20 years. It is simply wrong that people who are productive, working, contributing to society, paying tax, are healthy and want to keep working should be compelled to retire.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> Compulsory retirement based on age is discrimination. Unless there are convincing reasons, such as health and safety concerns, workers should have the right to choose when they retire. When Canada ended mandatory retirement last year, its human rights commission pointed out, "We're not born with date stamps saying our fitness for work expires at 65." We agree and that is why we are moving this Bill today.</p>

            <p eId="para_234">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_235"> As I will be outlining in my statement to the House later this afternoon, the next meeting of the European Council will take place tomorrow when EU leaders will discuss migration, security, economic and social development, including youth, and external relations.</p>
            <p eId="para_236"> The discussions on migration will include an update on the EU-Turkey deal, signed in March, along with a consideration of the migration compacts with five African countries, the progress achieved on the European Fund for Sustainable Development, and the European Investment Bank, EIB, external lending mandate. There is also likely to be an exchange on the future common European asylum system.</p>
            <p eId="para_237"> On security, there will be review of a number of measures, including the passenger name record, PNR, directive, database checks, and the European travel information and authorisation system, ETIAS. We will also consider the implementation of the EU global strategy, the European defence action plan, and EU-NATO co-operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_238"> Under economic and social development and youth, we will discuss the legislative proposals to extend the European Fund for Strategic Investment which were agreed recently by finance Ministers.</p>
            <p eId="para_239"> On particular Irish interests, we have highlighted the importance of pressing ahead on key Single Market initiatives, particularly in the area of services and the digital Single Market. I am sending a letter to President Tusk on this matter and have co-ordinated the support of a number of other member states to ensure a sufficient level of ambition is maintained by the Commission in setting out its plans across these initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_240"> Under external relations, political developments in Syria and the appalling humanitarian situation there will be discussed, and there will also be an exchange on how best to address the outcome of the Dutch referendum on the EU-Ukraine agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_241"> The meeting of the European Council is expected to conclude in the early evening. Leaders of the 27 member states, that is, not including the UK, will then meet where there will be a discussion on the mechanics of the EU negotiations with the UK which will commence once Article 50 has been triggered. Under the close political guidance of the European Council, that is, Heads of State and Government, the Commission will lead the technical negotiations, with the European Parliament also playing an important role.</p>
            <p eId="para_242">At the dinner tomorrow, there is also likely to be an exchange of views about the Bratislava process on the future of Europe and the meetings planned for Valletta and Rome in early 2017. I will, of course, provide further details on both meetings in my regular statement to the House this afternoon.</p>
            <p eId="para_243"> At this time, I have no specific plans for bilateral meetings at the European Council, although I will meet and engage with other EU leaders there. I wrote to the former Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, this week to wish him well as he leaves office following the Italian referendum on 4 December. I will send a note to his successor, Paolo Gentiloni, as soon as he takes on his new role.</p>

            <p eId="para_247">Are the letters he has written agenda items? I am interested in the Taoiseach's view on the second of the proposed meetings, that is, the one without the United Kingdom. Court proceedings have begun in this jurisdiction challenging the legality of the exclusion of the United Kingdom from the Council. The UK is a full member of the European Union and pending at least the triggering of Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, the contention is - and it is a matter that will be determined by our courts - that there is no legal basis to exclude the United Kingdom from these considerations. The allegation in the stated case in the legal proceedings is that Ireland colluded with others to exclude the UK. Has the Taoiseach received legal advice on the legality of such a gathering, or is it an entirely informal arrangement?</p>
            <p eId="para_248"> Will the Taoiseach indicate whether he has a view on another issue, namely, once Article 50 is triggered or invoked, can it be revoked by a member state? Has he received legal advice in respect of this matter or has the EU Council Legal Service provided advice on it? There appears to be no clarity on that matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_249">We cannot deal with every issue but I wish to raise the appalling atrocities in Aleppo and the Russian involvement in that. The people of Syria wish to live in their own communities in peace and freedom, but what they have gone through in recent years has been unspeakable. It is, without question, the worst crisis for a population since the Second World War. It is extremely important that one sees a sense of urgency from the European leadership at the European Council meeting about the crisis and the role of Russia in Aleppo. What is taking place is incomprehensible. It is also instructive that Russia is seeking to withdraw from the International Criminal Court. The sole reason, of course, is to avoid being accountable to the only international body capable of holding people responsible for war crimes. The blanket bombing of hospitals and humanitarian convoys and the extraordinary scenes this morning of children being brought out by their parents and families, one of the children with an intravenous, IV, drip still attached, are harrowing, and there is a sense that the world is turning a blind eye. There is a horrible sense of people not engaging with that reality, which will involve tough decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_250"> There is pressure in Europe to lift the sanctions on Russia, and we must resist that. What Russia did in Ukraine was wrong and if we start a policy of appeasement, acceptance or acquiescence, the parallels with the 1930s will be very obvious. In recent years, Russia has placed a great deal of emphasis on destabilising or undermining democracies and public faith in democratic systems. I am not just talking about the American election. Russia has close ties to the neo-Nazi Jobbik party in Hungary, the Freedom Party of Austria and, even worse, the Golden Dawn party in Greece. It has provided an acknowledged loan of approximately €9 million to support the Front National party in France, and Nigel Farage has long played a starring role in the Russian state-controlled media. On the far left, there are people who are directly linked with Russia, including the communist parties in the European Parliament, such as in Sinn Féin's European Parliament group, while-----</p>

            <p eId="para_257">I have a question about the recent political changes in Italy and the European People's Party, EPP, the group in the European structures of which the Taoiseach is a prominent member. Does the Taoiseach regret the very hard line the EPP has pushed not just in countries such as Ireland but also in Italy? Italy is one of the largest economies in the European Union. The efforts of its previous government to create a situation where, for example, it could avail of Mr. Juncker's plan to have a public investment programme basically foundered on the rocks of EPP intransigence, and particularly the intransigent attitude of Chancellor Merkel and the German Minister of Finance, Mr. Schäuble. Now Italy, one of the core European countries, is facing an unknown future of populist politics. We have seen what happened with Mr. Trump in the United States and with other issues in different countries. The Taoiseach is a prominent member of the EPP and is one of the longest-surviving Prime Ministers in that group. However, the EPP appears to be hell-bent on destroying the concept of a European Union based on solidarity, economic progress and supporting countries when they encounter difficulties. Has he had discussions on the future of the three large and prominent Italian banks, which are now in dire circumstances? There are issues with the bail-in. Unlike the debates in this House previously, the slogan now from many of the ultras is to save the bondholders, particularly the junior bondholders, because so many of them are ordinary Italian savers. The Taoiseach will attend the summit tomorrow. Christmas is coming and most people feel reflective at this time of the year. Is the European Union going to survive what the leadership of the EPP has done to the Union in general?</p>

            <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_262">That is the point I am trying to make.</p>
            <p eId="para_263">Four questions are being taken together. When the Taoiseach's contribution is included, it means that we have two minutes each. That does not work. I appreciate that this new way of doing business means we are dealing with topical issues but we do not have sufficient time to listen to the Taoiseach's response because he does not have sufficient time to deliver it or to elaborate on issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_264"> In moving on to my questions, I ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to be indulgent with me. We will be having pre-European Council meeting statements later. Like the Taoiseach, I want to raise a few issues at the next European Council meeting, the first of which is the case of Ibrahim Halawa. Yesterday was Mr. Halawa's 21st birthday. We should send very hearty belated birthday solidarity greetings to him, lá breithe shona duit. Yesterday was the 17th time his trial has been postponed. I know the Ceann Comhairle is leading a delegation, of which we will be a part, and we support that. However, I note the President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, has written to the Egyptian President to express his concern about the case. I ask the Taoiseach not only to raise it at the Council meeting but to seek in advance the support of other EU Heads of State to ensure Ibrahim's release.</p>
            <p eId="para_265"> The situation in Syria in general and in Aleppo is shameful. It is desperate to sit watching this on our television screens in our living rooms. The claim by the Russian envoy to the UN that no one is going to harm the civilians is incredible. It is unbelievable. This siege has been a shameful episode in international politics and we should be firm in our opposition to all the forces, the Russians, the French and the Americans. Any forces that are operating there should not be doing so. We need a political solution. I again ask the Taoiseach to raise this issue. There is an opportunity to do something positive in the middle of all the horror. </p>

            <p eId="para_269">Deputy Howlin raised the question of what is on the agenda of the Council meeting. I submitted the letter in respect of the digital single market, which has been going on now for 30 years, and with which we need to deal. On the question of whether the EU-27 member states can meet legally, it is not the European Council that is meeting, rather it is 27 members of the European Council. The 27 are meeting informally and not as the European Council of 28 members because Britain is still a full member until it leaves.</p>
            <p eId="para_270"> I agree with Deputy Micheál Martin that what is happening in Aleppo is savagery beyond contemplation. I am not sure, given all the discussions we have had at European Council meetings all over the world, in Geneva and everywhere else, whether the issue here relates to whether the United Nations, as a world body, should be reformed and perhaps given greater influence to intervene. This is a complex operation in the context of Russia being supported by Iran and Hezbollah supporting Assad. Aleppo has been the scene of humanitarian crimes and war crimes, and I strongly believe we should and will prosecute where possible in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_271"> Deputy Burton made an extraordinary assertion that because the European People's Party took a very strong line, Italy decided to vote against a referendum on the Senate. That was a constitutional issue, not a verdict on the European Union. While I am very much acquainted with the former Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, and supported him on many of his issues, clearly, there were other reasons the Italian electorate decided to vote down the referendum. Mr. Gentiloni comes from the same stock as Matteo Renzi and has set out to place a very steady hand on the tiller. I would point out to the Deputy that in Austria the people - at the second attempt - voted for an independent Green candidate, that the Government of the Netherlands lost a vote on a referendum on Ukraine, that Spain had two elections before it could form a government and that Britain has its own result on Brexit, which I respect. Therefore, the Deputy cannot say that the European People's Party is responsible for the demise of Italy. I would be the first to say that in terms of the recession that occurred in the European Union, the European Central Bank might have acted differently in the context of what happened in America. However, we have moved from that point to where we are now.</p>
            <p eId="para_272"> Deputy Adams commented on matters that I support in the context of the horrific scenes we have seen in Aleppo, with men, women and children being butchered in a savage fashion in 2016. It is appalling.</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_286">I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 16, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_287"> I travelled to the United States on Wednesday, 30 November, for a three-day programme of engagement with key business leaders in Silicon Valley and New York. The primary focus of the visit was to emphasise and promote Ireland’s attractiveness as a location for investment and trade and to communicate Ireland’s priorities in the context of Brexit and other recent significant international developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_288"> In Palo Alto, I spoke at a reception attended by approximately 250 Enterprise Ireland clients and representatives from the west coast business community. I used that opportunity to promote Ireland as a source for world leading information technology products and services, referencing the success of many Irish companies both in the Silicon Valley region and across the United States. I emphasised Ireland’s attractiveness as a location for US firms and delivered key messages about Ireland’s economic progress and the importance of immigration reform. I also met representatives of a number of Enterprise Ireland clients who were exhibiting their products at the event.</p>
            <p eId="para_289"> I also met that afternoon with George and Jackie Donohoe, whose daughter, Ashley, and niece, Olivia, lost their lives in the Berkeley tragedy in June 2015. Also present was Celine Kennelly, executive director of the Irish Immigration Pastoral Center. In advance of my first visit to the region since the tragedy occurred, I also met the Irish-based families of those who were killed and injured in the tragedy, including some of the injured themselves, in Government Buildings on 24 November. In renewing my condolences, I expressed my admiration for the work the family had done in driving Senate Bill 465. I assured them that the Government would continue to do what it could to support improvements in US building regulations in order to prevent such a tragedy ever occurring again. I paid particular tribute to consul general Philip Grant for the way he conducted his business on behalf of our country arising from that tragedy in Berkeley.</p>
            <p eId="para_290"> On Thursday, 1 December, I visited Apple Headquarters where I met Tim Cook, the chief executive officer, along with a number of other senior Apple executives. We discussed the company’s substantial investment in Ireland. Mr. Cook highlighted Apple's ongoing commitment to Ireland, including the company's current expansion plans, noting that it is on target to create 1,000 additional jobs here. We had a brief discussion regarding the European Commission’s decision on the Apple state aid investigation. I noted that Ireland had already submitted a very strong appeal to the General Court of the European Union. Mr. Cook noted the company’s intention to lodge its own appeal in due course. The remainder of our discussion focused on global political developments and policy challenges, including Brexit.</p>
            <p eId="para_291"> Following this, I addressed the San Francisco Bay Area Economic Council, an influential group of leading Bay Area companies, which was hosted by Facebook at its headquarters. I used this opportunity to underline the strength of both Ireland-US relations and Ireland-California relations. I updated the council on Ireland’s economic progress, reiterated Ireland’s attractiveness as a location for investment, highlighted our highly skilled workforce and our focus on innovation and our strong commitment to EU membership. While at Facebook I also took the opportunity to meet some of Facebook’s many Irish staff working there.</p>
            <p eId="para_292"> I travelled to New York where on Friday, 2 December I had a series of business engagements, including individual meetings with existing and potential investors in Ireland. Once again, I used these opportunities to promote Ireland’s attractiveness as a location for foreign direct investment and emphasised our firm commitment to EU membership.</p>
            <p eId="para_293"> I had a series of engagements at Bloomberg, including a meeting with Bloomberg chairman, Peter Grauer, and a number of their client companies, a live broadcast interview and a meeting with the chief executive officer, Mike Bloomberg. Discussions covered a wide range of topics, including Brexit, the future of the EU, the implications of the US election, international taxation, globalisation, the rise of populism and Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_294"> I also attended a Partnership for New York City event where I met and spoke to a group of approximately 30 leading New York business people on broadly similar topics to those covered at the Bloomberg events earlier, including Brexit, the US election, the future of the EU, corporation tax, the investment climate and foreign direct investment opportunities in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_295"> Later that day, I was also glad to participate in the announcement of a strategic partnership between Enterprise Ireland and Northwell Healthcare, one of the leading health care providers on the east coast of America.</p>
            <p eId="para_296">This partnership is expected to result in significant opportunities for Irish companies in the US health care sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_297"> That evening I attended a reception attended by approximately 300 Irish-American political, business and community leaders, including immigration reform bodies, hosted by the Consul General, Barbara Jones, at the Irish Consulate in New York. In my address, I spoke about Ireland’s economic progress, Ireland-US relations, the challenges and opportunities arising from Brexit, the Government’s ongoing commitment to the Northern Ireland peace process and immigration reform. I also spoke about Ireland’s successful programme of 1916 commemorations. I emphasised the Government’s commitment to culture and heritage and was pleased to announce an additional €1 million in funding from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for the Irish Arts Center and $265,000 from the immigrant support programme for the Irish Repertory Theatre. I was also pleased to be able to announce the granting by the US Department of Transportation of a permit to Norwegian Air, which will facilitate new direct flights between Ireland and the USA.</p>
            <p eId="para_298"> As the focus of my trip was engagement with business leaders, I did not have detailed political discussions on immigration reform or the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, during this visit. However, as I previously indicated, I raised immigration reform and our economic and trading interests with both President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Pence during my phone calls with them following the US elections.</p>
            <p eId="para_299"> I believe my visit was successful in further developing the strong links between Ireland and the United States as well as promoting Ireland’s priorities in the context of Brexit and other global developments.</p>

            <p eId="para_301">That was a comprehensive presentation of a comprehensive itinerary, covering industry, immigration issues and the Berkeley tragedy. I welcome the fact the Taoiseach met the families involved in the Berkeley tragedy. They have done much work to effect a change in law in what was an appalling tragedy which destroyed so many young lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_302"> Will the Taoiseach give further clarification on where we are now with the undocumented Irish after the success of President-designate Trump and his perspective on migration generally? Over the past two years, the US President, Barack Obama, liberalised the context for the undocumented, although he did not go the full distance by any means. Nonetheless, people felt a bit freer going around the place. Now, there is more fear and anxiety as a result of what has been said by President-designate Trump.</p>
            <p eId="para_303"> Do we expect a full ruling from the European Commission on Apple? I am hearing rumours it will be out this week. It is important to get some channel of communication on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_304"> Will the Taoiseach give me a report on the ongoing progress with the Irish Arts Center? I was involved in that when Minister for Foreign Affairs some years ago and I would like to see where we are in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_306">I also welcome the Taoiseach's meeting with the Berkeley tragedy families. I commend them on their great courage and commitment in ensuring such an accident will not happen again.</p>
            <p eId="para_307"> When I was in New York recently, I noted there are concerns within Irish America, among the undocumented and with some of the political leadership about the plight of the undocumented. I know the Taoiseach has raised this issue many times, but we should be conscious people are quite frightened by some of the remarks made by President-elect Trump.</p>
            <p eId="para_308"> There are also concerns about the need for the White House to continue its active support for the peace process here. There are issues about the past - we have had a lot of controversy here, as well as in this House - but the deal done two years ago, to which this Government has signed up, has still not been enacted. It is being blocked by the British Government. People in the States who are active on these issues know that. The British Government is also blocking the Bill of Rights. This Government has not brought in a charter of rights which it is obliged to do. The Acht na Gaeilge is still being blocked. These are all issues which the US Administration has quietly in the past been able to encourage. I note Gary Hart is in Ireland today. I commend and thank him for his work. He is meeting the deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness.</p>
            <p eId="para_309"> I welcome the Government’s support for the Irish Arts Center and the Irish Repertory Theatre. These are good investments. I commend the chairperson of the Irish Arts Center, Gerrard Boyle, and particularly the board member, Cel Donaghy, a Carrickmore, County Tyrone man, who has been a great champion of the arts for a long time. We now need to give these people the vote.</p>

            <p eId="para_311">The Taoiseach spoke about his meeting with Mr. Tim Cook of Apple. I understand he was reassured by the Taoiseach that Ireland's tax regime would remain at 12.5% for global corporations, despite incoming US President Trump’s intention of reducing the US corporation tax rate to 15%. I understand Apple indicated to the Taoiseach that if it should have to pay the €13 billion ruled against it by the EU, it would do so from an offshore cash pile of €125 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_312"> Did it occur to the Taoiseach at any time to discuss with Mr. Cook, or some of the other nice people he met, how tax avoidance and tax dodging in this manner hurts the poor across the globe? Did he discuss how it hurts the developing world most harshly, as was seen recently in an Oxfam report which showed the developing world is being deprived by tax avoidance of twice as much as it receives in aid? Should the developing world receive €100 billion in aid to which it is entitled, this could eliminate world hunger twice over, educate 124 million children not in school and fund health care to save the lives of 6 million children. These nice people the Taoiseach met are answerable for these mortal sins.</p>
            <p eId="para_313"> I also remind the Taoiseach that yesterday 541 people lay on hospital trolleys.</p>

            <p eId="para_317">I have a simple question for the Taoiseach. When he met Tim Cook, did he tell him anything about the housing and homelessness crisis in our country? Did he tell him anything about the people who are on hospital trolleys or on hospital waiting lists? Did the Taoiseach tell him anything about the children who go to schools with bad conditions such as prefabs, etc.? Did the Taoiseach tell Tim Cook how the €13 billion plus interest that he owes the people of Ireland could transform the situation for their lives? Did the Taoiseach say any of this or did he reassure him, as the Taoiseach of the sixth worst tax haven in the world, not to worry as we will spend public money to make sure he does not pay us what he owes us?</p>

            <p eId="para_319">I am glad the Taoiseach had the opportunity to meet so many investors into Ireland. The country is not a tax haven. The jobs, especially with the company in question on the north side of Cork city, are important to the thousands of people working in these companies and the families who depend on those jobs. It is correct to be balanced. Ireland is entitled to have foreign direct investment and be competitive in that respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_320"> When does the Taoiseach expect the full decision and detailed elements of it on Apple to be published by the European Commissioner? Will he update us on the work being done on this case by the Revenue Commissioners and their legal advisers? I understand there are extensive teams of legal advisers working on this tax case.</p>
            <p eId="para_321"> I also want to raise an issue in the context of the report from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, in respect of ECOFIN in November.</p>
            <p eId="para_322">The Taoiseach objected to my suggestion that the European People's Party, EPP - the Taoiseach's own party in the European Union - was not really helping Europe to recover. What does the Taoiseach think the EPP is likely to do in regard to the development of the consolidated tax base? Does he agree with prominent Irish economist, Seamus Coffey, who said yesterday that the development of the common consolidated tax base, as proposed by the European Union, constitutes a very significant threat to the Irish corporate tax base?</p>

            <p eId="para_324">Deputy Martin raised the question of Apple. I expect the Commission will publish the ruling before Christmas or very close to Christmas. It will be formally published then and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, informed us of that yesterday.</p>
            <p eId="para_325"> The arts centre in New York is the result of very close relations between Ireland and America which have existed for a long time. The centre will serve to rebuild the reputation, showcase a whole new generation of Irish creative talent and build a long-term US market share. It will expand the reach of Irish culture to new audiences. The budget for the arts centre is $62.75 million for the 11th Avenue facility and $2.6 million for renovation. Pledges have been secured in the amount of $53 million from the state of New York, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade emigrant support programme, foundations and private donors. The Government here has contributed €4.3 million over the past seven years to the arts centre, €3.3 million from the emigrant support programme of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the €1 million announced recently from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. It will be a wonderful opportunity to showcase Ireland right in the centre of New York.</p>
            <p eId="para_326"> The announcement was made in respect of a further extension of the J1 visa programme for graduates. The issue of the J1 in the short term has not been dealt with yet but it seems as if the issue is confined to protecting borders and to those with criminal records who are in the States illegally. What is the definition of a criminal record? We do not know that. Does it mean a very minor issue of a speeding ticket? Irish people in the New York centre for immigrants are very concerned. I spoke to Brian O'Dwyer last week and he said the number of people expressing their concern has increased considerably. We need to look at this carefully. We are working with the ambassador and Consul General on the issue of President-elect Trump and his appointee in this area. </p>

            <p eId="para_333"> Deputy Burton agrees we are not a tax haven. The EPP does not have 15 prime ministers anymore. It has about seven now. It is not a case of the EPP prime ministers making decisions at the European Council. That is a matter we put on the agenda. The Deputy will recall in the first six months of 2013 we allowed it to be discussed and debated at the European Council and it did not get anywhere. From my understanding, there are very serious objections to it now. It is not the EPP. Whatever focus the Deputy has on the EPP at the moment, she can leave aside. It is the European Council that will make a decision. </p>

            <p eId="para_338">I welcomed Prime Minister Muscat of Malta to Government Buildings on Monday 28 November. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Dara Murphy, were also present. The visit to Dublin was part of a series of visits to EU capitals in advance of Malta's first ever EU presidency in January 2017. The meeting was friendly and constructive. We discussed a range of issues including Malta's presidency, its priorities, the migration crisis, Brexit, Turkey, Libya, tax and the future of Europe. </p>
            <p eId="para_339"> Prime Minister Muscat, who was accompanied by his Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for European Affairs, thanked Ireland for our assistance in advance of its presidency. </p>
            <p eId="para_340"> The Maltese presidency will have six priorities. They are migration, security, the Single Market, social inclusion, Europe's neighbourhood and maritime affairs. I confirmed that Ireland would support Malta in its efforts to progress work on the Single Market and digital single market strategies in particular. </p>
            <p eId="para_341"> On the migration crisis, where Malta has particular concerns, Prime Minister Muscat thanked Ireland for the naval vessel we contributed last year as well as our voluntary offer to accept 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers as part of the EU response. We agreed that the EU-Turkey statement had led to a reduction in the numbers of people travelling the Western Balkans route but that other routes, including from Libya, Egypt and Tunisia, are of concern. </p>
            <p eId="para_342"> As I do in all my meetings with European Union counterparts, I outlined and explained Ireland's main concerns arising from Brexit, including our economy and trade, Northern Ireland, the common travel area and the future of the EU. We discussed the complex process ahead including the negotiations on withdrawal and on the future of the EU-UK relationship. </p>
            <p eId="para_343"> On tax, I outlined the Government's initiatives, such as the knowledge development box. I also informed the Prime Minister that Ireland had appealed the Commission's ruling on Apple. There was no discussion of any other company in this context. </p>
            <p eId="para_344"> We agreed to stay in close contact and to continue to work closely together over the coming period. I have had many meetings with Prime Minister Muscat over the last number of years. </p>

            <p eId="para_349">I will be very brief. I am conscious of time because of the overlap of the last question. In terms of the discussions with Prime Minister Muscat, the Syrian situation, which has now worsened, is an unfolding human tragedy that is now becoming indescribable even for people who are there. Malta is in the heart of the migration crisis, although many of the people who are coming across the Mediterranean are actually not from the Syrian crisis. They are coming mainly from the horn of Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. These are real issues we need to address. I am interested to hear the Maltese perspective on the ongoing catastrophe in the Mediterranean. It is conservatively estimated that 4,000 people have died. Anybody who saw the RTE programme "The Crossing" could not but be extraordinarily moved and proud of Óglaigh na hÉireann. I note that Óglaigh na hÉireann won the European of the Year award which the Taoiseach presented on Monday.</p>
            <p eId="para_350"> In the Taoiseach's discussions with Prime Minister Muscat, did the issue of Setanta Insurance arise, which was a Maltese registered insurance company that sold insurance exclusively in this jurisdiction before it collapsed in 2014, leaving thousands of Irish policyholders high and dry? Was the practice of a European Union country being used as a base exclusively for a company in another European Union country discussed with the Prime Minister?</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_351">The impact of the Setanta Insurance Company affair was very severe on many people. It highlighted significant gaps and loopholes in monitoring, compliance, etc. It would seem strange if it were not raised during the meeting or if, in preparation for the meeting, the issue were not identified as one that would merit discussion between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister. The Taoiseach might clarify the position.</p>
            <p eId="para_352"> Can the Taoiseach give any indication on Malta's perspective on Brexit and how it sees it impacting on its economy and trade? Is there a sense of the uniqueness of the Irish situation, particularly that of Northern Ireland and the status of EU citizens living there?</p>

            <p eId="para_353">I am also surprised that Setanta Insurance was not raised. It is interesting that Mr. Muscat, in a recent BBC interview, said the issue of the Border, in the context of Brexit, is of crucial importance. He said:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_354">There will be issues relating to borders, especially the Irish issue, which I think is one of the most politically sensitive issues. I think there is a political willingness from everyone to have it resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_355">The latter points up this leader as a potential ally in terms of getting the North special designated status within the EU. Did the Taoiseach raise the matter in his meeting with Prime Minister Muscat?</p>
            <p eId="para_356"> I want to recognise a person who was in the Gallery a moment ago when we were discussing the US. He is Jack Kilroy, a champion of human rights. He was here with Senator Frances Black. This shows the interconnectedness between us and the US and the need to give these citizens a vote in our presidential elections.</p>

            <p eId="para_359">Would the Taoiseach agree that there should be an immediate amendment to provide that companies must be trading in the country in which they are registered before they are allowed to trade in other European countries?</p>
            <p eId="para_360"> I do not know whether the Taoiseach saw the recent television programme on the Irish Naval Service. It covered the exercise in the Mediterranean Sea in which the Irish Naval Service saved the lives of 15,500 people. We should recognise the wonderful work it is doing.</p>
          </speech>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_361">Yes, I recognise the work of the Irish Naval Service and that is why it was awarded the European of the Year award. It was the first time the award was ever given to an organisation. As Deputy Seán Barrett knows, we have only one Óglaigh na hÉireann, and it has been outstanding in its professionalism, sensitivity and the way it went about its business. The award was presented by the European Movement Ireland. I have often made the point that this is in the Irish because of the thousands of people we lost to the Atlantic in coffin ships off Grosse Île and Ellis Island. It is a remarkable feature of our nation that in 2016 our three vessels, on a rota basis, have saved 15,600 men, women and children from the waters of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
            <p eId="para_362"> I agree with the point on Setanta Insurance. I did not discuss Setanta with Prime Minister Muscat. He came here on a very short visit specifically in preparation for his country's Presidency. Malta is a small country and will take a small agenda to, hopefully, move through. I will take the point the Deputies raised in a different forum.</p>
            <p eId="para_363"> Deputy Brendan Howlin raised the question of sub-Saharan Africa. Prime Minister Muscat is very well acquainted with it and is grateful for the vessel we sent to assist them in the work they are doing. People from Egypt are beginning to cross the Mediterranean, which is also a source of serious concern in addition to the people coming from Mali, the Horn of Africa and Libya. Europe is working with five African countries on compacts. The aim is to work with them to give people an opportunity to have a life, a career and economic opportunities. If the population of Africa doubles over the next 25 years, the explosion in migration could be very serious. Europe, working with countries in their home place, may have a better impact than having to deal with serious numbers of migrants later.</p>
            <p eId="para_364"> I hope the explanation I gave to Prime Minister Muscat and others results in their being fully <i>au fait</i> with the circumstances that apply in Ireland regarding the Border, the peace process, which everyone supports, and what we need for it in the future. I am not sure whether the interview was before or after that. I have spoken to him on a number of occasions about our particular circumstances. As everybody will understand, if people explain to us the situation in Slovenia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic or Estonia, it is difficult to understand all the details unless one sees the graphics and understands the geography and particular situation that applies. He understands Ireland and will be a supporter of us in the time ahead.</p>

Ireland, as we all know, stands to be most affected by the UK's withdrawal from the EU and that issue is discussed regularly in the House. The meeting in Brussels on Thursday evening is likely to focus on the mechanics and timing of the negotiations from the EU perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> In June, the 27 Heads of State and Government agreed that the European Council will provide overall political guidance for the negotiations and that the Commission will lead on the technical discussions. As Deputies will recall from previous discussions in the House, Mr. Michel Barnier, the head of the Commission task force on Brexit, visited Ireland in November. He and his team are very aware of our concerns arising from Brexit, including regarding Northern Ireland, the peace process, the common travel area and our deeply entwined economic and trade links with the UK. There has been good ongoing engagement on these issues at official level.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> I expect tomorrow night’s discussion to touch upon the process whereby the European Council’s guidelines for the negotiations will be agreed once the UK has triggered Article 50. This will allow for an orderly commencement of the negotiations. Our discussions tomorrow are also likely to restate the principles we agreed in June, namely, that there can be no negotiation without notification, that the UK remains a member of the EU with all the responsibilities that implies, and that the Single Market and four fundamental freedoms are indivisible. I do not anticipate a detailed discussion about the future of Europe, otherwise known as the Bratislava process. This will be the focus of discussions at a separate meeting of the 27 in Malta in February, before the process concludes in March to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> The European Council will begin earlier than usual at 12.30 p.m. with a meeting with President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz. There will then be a short update from Slovakia's Prime Minister, Robert Fico, on the implementation of decisions of the European Council. The President of Cyprus is also expected to provide an update on developments in his country's ongoing reunification talks.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> Turning to the agenda, Heads of State and Government will begin by returning to the migration and refugee situation which is still very much a priority for the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The Commission is expected to give an update on progress on a range of EU measures, including relocation and resettlement, the EU-Turkey statement and the partnership frameworks or "migration compacts" with third countries. A discussion is also expected on reform of the common European asylum system. Many of the EU measures are having a positive impact. The number of people attempting to cross the Aegean has reduced substantially since the EU-Turkey statement was agreed in March, and this is to be welcomed. Estimates from the International Organization for Migration show that there were more than 865,000 arrivals during the eight months before the EU-Turkey statement and a little more than 22,800 during the eight months thereafter. However, other routes remain extremely dangerous, and far too many people are still risking their lives attempting to travel to Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> The migration compacts aim to ensure coherence between EU migration policy and its external and development policies. These were discussed at the October European Council. Overall, we welcome the development of the migration compacts and their focus on working even more closely with countries of origin and transit as well as with countries hosting large numbers of displaced people. We support efforts to build on existing progress and policies. The first countries the compacts are being developed with are in Africa, and Ireland is supportive of the intention to make swift progress on the external investment plan in order to boost investments and job creation in these partner countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> Although we are far less exposed to the full force of the migration and refugee crisis because of our geographical location and our non-participation in certain justice and home affairs measures, we continue to contribute to the EU response. As the House knows, the Government decided voluntarily to opt into measures and take in up to 4,000 persons in need of international protection under the resettlement and relocation programmes. There has been a good response to resettlement, that is, taking people from outside the Union. To date, 507 people have arrived in Ireland, mostly from Lebanon, and we are almost on course to meet our target of 520 by the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> On relocation, that is, taking migrants who have already arrived in Greece and Italy, progress has been slow. There have been some positive developments recently and 109 people have now come to Ireland from Greece. The Tánaiste and the Minister, Deputy Zappone, visited Greece this week. Arrangements are being made for more people to start coming here, and it is expected that there will be a further intake before the end of 2016. Thereafter, the plan is to increase the pace and receive up to 1,100 people by September of next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> We have provided €42 million in response to the crisis in Syria since 2011 and we now pledge to bring this to €62 million by the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> Over the course of 2015 and 2016, Irish naval vessels have rescued 15,621 migrants in the Mediterranean. <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i> concluded operations on 5 December. On behalf of every Deputy and the people of Ireland, I commend the exemplary service of our naval personnel and thank them for their courage and professionalism. Consideration of a further deployment in 2017 will take into account a number of factors, including the ongoing situation in the Mediterranean, the overall EU response, the demands on the Defence Forces, overseas commitments and available resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> Regarding security, the European Council will consider the implementation of the EU global strategy, the Commission's Communication on a European Defence Action Plan and EU-NATO co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> These issues are of keen interest to the Irish people. We have a proud tradition, upheld by Governments from all sides of this House over many years, of military neutrality and non-participation in military alliances. This is subject to constitutional provisions and is protected in the treaties of the European Union. All of us intend to preserve this.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> Tomorrow, the EU Heads of State and Government will hear from the Secretary General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, before considering the matter of EU-NATO co-operation. This follows the statement on co-operation agreed in June, which took on board Ireland's specific concerns. Similarly, the EU global strategy reflects some of Ireland's key concerns. It commits the EU to promoting peace, prosperity, democracy and the rule of law. It has a positive focus on the Middle East peace process, disarmament, gender, the UN and the importance of multilateralism more generally. The strategy recognises the need to invest more in conflict resolution and tackle the root causes of instability. This involves using a mix of EU policies coherently to support international peace and economic development and help build state and societal capacity on governance, rule of law and human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> The Commission's Communication on a Defence Action Plan was published at the end of November. It examines how European industry can provide the capabilities required for the EU's peacekeeping and crisis management activities and ensure more effective and responsive common security and defence policy, CSDP, missions. We will consider these proposals very carefully. The EU common security and defence policy is an integral part of the Union's common foreign and security policy. It provides the Union with an operational capacity to undertake missions outside the EU for peacekeeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter. Our approach has been constructive and realistic. We are a strong supporter of initiatives, through the CSDP, which improve the capacity of the Union to contribute to international peace and security, particularly in support of the UN. We support co-operation with international partners where this adds value and contributes to the achievement of these objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> The follow-up to the EU-NATO joint declaration made in Warsaw, the implementation of the EU global strategy and the proposals in the defence action plan have no implications for Ireland's neutrality.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> The European Council will also look at a number of issues under the heading of economic and social development and youth including the European Fund for Strategic Investments; energy union; the Youth Guarantee, the youth employment initiative and European Solidarity Corps; and, most importantly, the Single Market and Digital Single Market.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> The Council will welcome last week's agreement by Finance Ministers to strengthen and extend the European Fund for Strategic Investments, and hopefully negotiations with the European Parliament can now be concluded quickly. While the impact of EFSI in Ireland remains modest at this point, we support strongly the further development of what is a key building block of the investment plan for Europe. The new Dublin office of the EIB, which I opened last Friday, should also provide further complementary support for project development in Ireland, building from the experience gained in tackling investment bottlenecks across Europe. The role of an enhanced EFSI in mobilising a stronger pipeline of SME finance will be very significant for Ireland, including in the context of the unique challenges we face on foot of the UK decision to leave the EU. More generally, we are not yet in Ireland at the vanguard in deploying EIB financial instruments to tackle investment bottlenecks. I want to see us make much better use of the enhanced lending volumes and risk capacity now available to the EIB, including through next year's mid-term review of the capital plan. I expect this to be quite significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> We also have a keen interest in fighting youth unemployment and are supportive of the proposals in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> We welcome the renewed commitment on energy union to promote energy efficiency actively as the most important means of achieving our shared climate and energy goals.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> There will also be consideration of Single Market and Digital Single Market issues. I have spoken many times in this House on the priority we attach to completing this and the advantages for all of us in properly establishing the Digital Single Market. We have been active in generating support for an ambitious approach by the Commission. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation co-signed a letter last month highlighting the need for decisive action on services. I am leading an initiative in respect of the Digital Single Market in advance of this week's meeting and will be joined by 15 member states in my letter to President Tusk reaffirming the importance of maintaining strong political momentum in this regard. This work builds on that of the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, in co-ordinating a core group of digitally advanced countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> I will leave the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, to respond to the debate.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_390">This week's summit has a wide agenda but few substantive decisions to consider. It is more a summit about reflecting on problems than tackling them. Part of this is inevitable because of the state of uncertainty which the European Union will be in until there is some idea about what future relations with the United Kingdom will look like. Beyond this important fact, there is unfortunately also the reality of other issues being allowed to drift because of division and a lack of solidarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> The first item on the agenda is the ongoing migration crisis in the Mediterranean. Monday night's documentary was a powerful reminder that our absolute priority must be the humanitarian duty to help those desperately in need. In "The Crossing" we all saw the magnificent work of members of our Naval Service. We should be immensely proud of them and their continuing the tradition of Óglaigh na hÉireann in representing us all as part of an international community. Having helped more than 15,000 people, their mission is clearly an absolutely essential one which we must continue to support. Every one of the people helped has a personal story of why they would undertake such a dangerous and desperate journey. There is no single cause of this migration and there is no single answer to it. Fundamentally, though, there is a common thread of escaping danger or intractable poverty. Different types of repression, including rising fundamentalism, are bringing different societies beyond crisis point. Europe does not realistically have the capacity or the resources to provide the stability and opportunity which these societies need. However, there is much more it can do. Currently, Syria's development aid is limited and we have no strategy equal to the scale of the challenge. More and more resources are being directed to managing the impact of migration and relatively little to addressing the core causes.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">It is long past time for a more urgent and ambitious strategy to deal with the causes of large-scale migration on the southern and eastern Mediterranean. We cannot realistically have a policy of no control of migration but we can and should have a more generous approach to help those who may believe that leaving their homes is their only option. In north Africa, the current development agreements are small and not fit for purpose. What we need is effectively a Marshall aid plan for north Africa but what we have is little more than a sticking plaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> The situation in respect of Syrian refugees is even more serious because the entire crisis is directly caused by the actions of certain states. We are nowhere near providing refugees with the basic facilities required for camps in the region. Without these, they will continue to seek refuge elsewhere. The people of Syria want to live in their own communities in peace and freedom. They are not what are termed "economic migrants". They are refugees from a cruel and still-escalating conflict. The root of this conflict is a regime that will not recognise the human rights of the Syrian people and a world power which has decided that it must use its extraordinary military muscle to defend non-democratic regimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> ISIS is a barbaric group which has waged genocidal war against Christians and many Muslim groups in the region. It has no legitimacy and defeating the group should be a focus for international co-operation. However, one country has decided that its priority should be to aid the Syrian regime to destroy democratic opposition and to terrorise millions of people into submission. ISIS is not in Aleppo, yet large sections of that city have been blanket bombed with critical civilian infrastructure, such as hospitals, repeatedly and deliberately targeted. It is a sad reflection on current realities that many parties and politicians in different countries are eager to turn a blind eye to this. If they react at all, it is to try to down play specific responsibility and to search for the quickest way to return to the anti-western rhetoric which is their core business.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> We should note Russia's stated intention to withdraw from the International Criminal Court. The reason is to avoid being accountable to the only international body capable of holding people responsible for war crimes. The fact that Ireland is the only country in the world which has written co-operation with the ICC into its constitution is something of which we should be proud and we should be a voice defending the role of the court. Syria is part of the wider crisis in relations with Russia and therefore part of what has to be discussed at this summit. We should be alarmed at the current push by some countries to legitimise what can only be described as constant aggression by Russia.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> Let us be clear about what is going on. For a number of years Russia has seen its interest in undermining public faith in democracy as a system. It has been an active supporter of extreme right and left parties in many European countries. For example, it has close ties to the neo-Nazi Jobbik party in Hungary, the Freedom Party of Austria and the Golden Dawn party in Greece. It has provided an acknowledged loan of €9 million to support the sinister National Front party in France. Nigel Farage has long played a starring role in the Russian state-controlled media. On the far left, many parties are directly linked with Russia, including the communist parties in Sinn Féin’s European Parliament group, while many more politicians are at the least fellow travellers. The coalition of interest between the far right and far left is, as it has always been, directed against the democratic centre. We can see this in the non-stop attempt to avoid criticising Russian actions and claims that this is really the fault of others. The recent campaign to support Mr. Trump by undermining his opponent for president should cause us all to stop for a moment and consider the scale of the threat now being targeted against democracy. I find it incredible that we can hear voices in this House raging angrily against Mr. Trump but remaining silent on the undeniable campaign to assist him.</p>

          <p eId="para_398">If that does not represent hypocrisy and double standards, then I do not know what does. The situation in Ukraine will be discussed tomorrow. The attempt by some to lift sanctions and basically allow Russia to bear no responsibility for its actions must be opposed by Ireland. What clearer signal to a return to the 1930s could there be than to allow a large and aggressive country to get away with annexing territory. At a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, some Deputies made it clear to the Russian ambassador that we are not willing to sit quietly as these actions continue. The chairman, Deputy Brendan Smith, ensured that this was a forum where the lies and disinformation would be challenged. I note the contributions of Deputy Seán Barrett and Senator Ivana Bacik. In contrast, once again, Sinn Féin has shown that it will not defend a country that has been invaded and partitioned by a neighbour. Deputy Crowe said that the European Union and the United States were equally to blame for Russia's actions, something Deputy Adams did not feel the need to repeat on his recent fundraising trip to America. The closest Deputy Crowe could come to challenging Russia was to say that the travesty of a so-called referendum in Crimea was not in line with good democratic norms. It seems that Sinn Féin is now trying to present the situation in Crimea as an act of self-determination rather than the invasion and partition which is was in reality.</p>

          <p eId="para_400">Let us all note that today there are prisoners in Russian jails whose only crime was to fly a Ukrainian flag. The Tarter minority organisations and media have been systematically repressed. There are no political or media freedoms in Crimea. The separate identity of the region is being destroyed. There can be no normalisation or lifting of sanctions while Russia maintains this aggression and the policy of promoting separatism in eastern Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> Separately, it is obvious that we need to dramatically step up procedures for protection democratic processes in Europe. We have been given a warning and we must act. I do not see this as being linked to the scheduled discussion on security and defence at the summit. Co-operation on civil protection and policing is welcome and its expansion is delivering real benefits for all countries. However, there is no compelling reason to change provisions concerning defence and external security. Exiting treaties provide a strong enough basis for action while still respecting the different traditions of a number of member states, including Ireland. The provisions are in place for co-operation based on the principles of solidarity and defence of core democratic values. We do not need another military alliance and we do not need to waste time which could be usefully spent on other more needed reforms to the operations of the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> The discussions on Brexit will be informal and it is not clear that anything substantive will be considered. It appears there will be little more than an update on matters already understood. In recent weeks, Fianna Fáil has set out in some detail our approach to what we believe should be Ireland's policy in these negotiations. It is transparently obvious that we will not and should not try to conclude a side deal with Britain in advance of the wider discussions. We will not join them in this potentially disastrous decision and our priority has to be to ensure the Union of which we are a member can work. In truth, the bulk of our bilateral relations with Britain will have to be defined through the overall negotiations. For a start we must insist that the unique situation of this island, North and South, be reflected in post-Brexit arrangements. We will feel the impact more than any other part of the European Union and this must be addressed. We need to help the industries and communities worst hit and this means we need to secure permission and support for targeted assistance with diversification and market replacement. We must also demand that the particular situation of Northern Ireland be addressed through a special status.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> Post-Brexit Northern Ireland will contain the largest concentration of EU citizens outside of the European Union borders. The right to Irish citizenship, which conveys the right to European Union citizenship, is fundamental to our Constitution and to a serious of international commitments. For the sake of clarity, we will vote against any deal which seeks to alter this right in any way. Northern Ireland residents must retain their right to full EU citizenship and, equally, they must not be forced to choose between Irish and UK citizenship. As the Taoiseach will clearly have some form of discussion with the UK Prime Minister, Mrs. May, tomorrow, he should make a point of raising with her a concern about the unilateral and unacceptable approach to the EU-related provisions of the British-Irish Agreement and Northern Ireland Act. The UK Government has no legitimate right to unilaterally change the importance of EU law to the Northern Ireland settlement. Any amendment must be negotiated and must not conflict with the provisions voted on in free referendums on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> This is a dark and challenging moment for Europe. It faces assertive enemies from outside and opposition from populist movements within. This is not a time for timid action. We need clarity and determination to move forward. We need a spirit of solidarity. We need leaders who understand that we cannot afford to move back to business as usual.</p>

          <p eId="para_408">We will take five minutes each.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> I note that Teachta Martin's fixation with Sinn Féin continues. In discussing the awfulness of the war in Syria, he mentions us in his prayers for the conversion of Russia. We have no truck for Russia or for any of the big powers. We are clearly against aggression of all kinds, unlike Teachta Martin, who seems to be in support of some of the forces engaged in Syria. All of them should cease their violent actions. Through the Taoiseach, we should raise these issues at the European Council meeting. We should be putting these issues on the agenda. The meeting is of key strategic importance because, although it is an informal meeting, it is primarily about the Brexit process.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The only thing that is clear at the moment is that the day is approaching when the British finally get around to making clear what they are going to do. We do not think the Irish Government is properly prepared for these discussions. We hope that a document we launched last week, The Case for the North to Achieve Designated Special Status within the EU, will inform the Government's negotiating position in the EU. I have sent copies of the document to the Taoiseach and other leaders in the Dáil. Essentially, we are arguing for an Irish solution to an English problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> I remind the House that the Scottish First Minister told the Seanad recently that these "unprecedented times require imagination, open minds and fresh thinking". We need to think and act on an all-island basis and in Ireland's interests internationally and nationally. We can be sure that the British Government will be standing up for Britain's national interests. Therefore, the Irish Government needs to be doing exactly the same thing, but in an unprecedented way across the entire island. We cannot let our economy, our rights, our protections and our peace agreements to become collateral damage during the negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> The Government has a habit of getting bad deals in the European Union. That cannot happen again on this issue, which is too vital for the people of this island to be short-changed in respect of it. That is why we are arguing for a collective focus on securing the entire island of Ireland within the EU, in line with the democratically expressed wishes of the people in the North. We talk all the time about the need to get the consent of the people in the North, which is something I agree with. This is an example of the people in the North saying "No" and not giving their consent to leaving the EU. I ask the Taoiseach to bring this message to the Council and to the informal meetings of Heads of State and Government on Thursday evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> The Speaker of the Catalan Parliament has been summoned to appear before the Spanish High Court in Friday, 16 December. She is to be prosecuted for allowing a Parliamentary debate and a vote on Catalan independence. The Spanish state considers this public figure to be guilty of a crime because she facilitated a public debate on an issue of huge importance to Catalan and Spanish citizens. I ask the Taoiseach to raise the prosecution of the speaker of a democratic legislative body for facilitating a debate because it is putting at risk the democratic standards that people everywhere hold dear.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> I join everyone else in commending the amazing efforts of the Defence Forces in rescuing 15,600 refugees. That is the size of a small county town. The members of the Army and the Navy richly deserve the European of the Year award. I say "well done" to Óglaigh na hÉireann.</p>

          <p eId="para_415">Brexit is not the only cause of uncertainty in EU. The Italian people rejected a referendum on constitutional change on 4 December last and the Government of Matteo Renzi subsequently resigned. On the same day, an independent candidate just about beat a far-right candidate in the Austrian presidential election. As Deputy Adams has mentioned, the Spanish authorities are threatening to prosecute the Speaker of the Catalan Parliament for facilitating a debate in that democratic legislature. The EU has responded to the growing anger about its democratic deficit and its economic failures with further federalisation and reductions in member state sovereignty. This can best be seen in the unprecedented attempt to ram the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement through the European Parliament and provisionally apply it before member state parliaments have had the chance to debate the agreement and vote on it. I am conscious that there was no real debate on it in this Chamber. The EU's approach to these issues can also be seen in the move to create a standing European army and to increase military spending among EU member states. This is happening at a time of huge cutbacks in public and social spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> I am conscious that the Council will be meeting against the backdrop of the failure of Europe and the world to stop the bloodshed and the slaughter of innocents in Aleppo. When the Taoiseach speaks at the Council meeting, he has to send a message that conflict cannot be disconnected from migration. It is clear that the two issues are linked. If a particular part of the world or a particular country is being bombed, people will flee from that area to safer areas where no bombing is going on. In this case, people believe safety is to be found in Europe. There is increasing anger among citizens about the failure to do anything to tackle adequately the challenges associated with the migration problem or to step up to the plate to resolve conflicts like that in Syria.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> Sinn Féin firmly opposes the new attempts to introduce a common consolidated corporate tax base because these plans are not the solution. The EU <i>status quo</i> cannot continue. The European institutions need a serious wake-up call. They must take on board the growing disillusionment among voters. Sinn Féin has constantly highlighted the glaring democratic deficit at the heart of the EU. As we know, recent polls have shown that trust in the EU is continuing to fall. At this week's EU Council meeting, the Taoiseach should demand real reform and not just a tinkering around the edges. We need to build a progressive, prosperous and social Europe that respects sovereignty.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> Yesterday was Ibrahim Halawa’s 21st birthday. He spent it in jail. He should have been celebrating this important day with his family and friends, but instead he learned that his trial has been adjourned yet again. This was the 17th postponement of his mass trial to date. Ibrahim Halawa has spent 40 months, or 1,214 days, in prison as Egypt continues to disregard its obligations under Egyptian and international human rights law. His trial has been rescheduled for 17 January 2017. The Taoiseach needs to call President el-Sisi and state that the Irish Government is seeking Ibrahim Halawa's release under Law 140. Rather than writing another letter, the Taoiseach should pick up the phone to speak directly to President el-Sisi. Article 155 of the Egyptian constitution allows President el-Sisi, with the approval of the Egyptian cabinet, to issue pardons to prisoners. President el-Sisi has used Article 155 four times in 2016, resulting in 859 prisoners being released. The most recent pardon focused on 82 young prisoners. The Taoiseach needs to explore this option because what is happening to this young man is unacceptable. I ask the Taoiseach to raise Ibrahim Halawa’s case formally at this week's European Council meeting if the opportunity arises. I expect him to do so informally as well. The plight of this young man needs to be put on the record. We are calling for the release of this citizen of Ireland and Europe. This is an example of something useful that can come out of the meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> I will conclude by stating my concerns about the continued assassinations and intimidation of human rights defenders and community activists in Colombia. While we all welcome the new peace agreement in Colombia, it must be backed up with protections for civil society and political activists. Seventy human rights defenders have been killed in Colombia so far in 2016. This marks an increase on last year's figure. Thirty-one of these murders have happened since the entry into force of bilateral ceasefires on 29 August last. Ireland and the EU have pledged to support the peace process in Colombia. One of the priority issues must be to provide robust protection for all of these activists. I ask the Taoiseach to raise what is happening in Colombia at this week's meeting.</p>

          <p eId="para_420">I hope the Taoiseach will take on board a small number of proposals in advance of this week's European Council meeting. The first couple of proposals relate to Brexit. I was delighted that so many people wanted to attend my party's Brexit forum in Dublin last night. The number of people who wanted to attend was far in excess of the number of seats available in the room. This shows clearly that there is huge public interest in this topic. When we discussed Brexit during Question Time in this House on 9 November last, I asked the Taoiseach to provide a weekly update to Opposition parties on the Government's unfolding preparations.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The Taoiseach confirmed he was happy to do so on that day and, obviously, I was happy to wait a couple of weeks for people to figure out the best way of doing this. I do not think there could or should be a weekly debate about it, given not every week will see movement. Even an e-mail update to Members would suffice and would underscore the urgency we attach to this issue. It would be a small way of making sure that everyone is properly involved in Ireland’s preparations for what is probably the most momentous task we have ahead of us in the coming months and years. I would like the Taoiseach to reconfirm his commitment to this idea and, perhaps beginning in January, that we would start that weekly update.</p>

          <p eId="para_425">I appreciate that. Much of the focus of the Brexit debate to date justifiably has been on the impact on the Border, but I am of the view that it is also time for us to look very carefully at the economic planning required. The CEO of Enterprise Ireland spoke at the event last night and she rightly pointed out that she needs a plan for the worst possible Brexit. While we do not want to contemplate that this might be the reality, we must plan for the worst and, whatever then arises, it is prepared for.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> We know that Brexit might provide opportunities for us and this too must be considered. We also know, however, that some sectors will be particularly vulnerable, in particular where 70%, 80%, 90% or, in one or two cases, 100% of the sectoral export is to the UK. Sectors such as agrifood and tourism are obviously vulnerable. Much of our work will rightly be focused on helping protect employment in these sectors but, in a hard Brexit scenario, we know we will not be able to protect these sectors fully. We need to be planning now for the expansion of tools such as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to help people diversify either in terms of the products they are producing or at least the markets they are targeting. The criteria for that fund were expanded during the crisis and I believe they could be expanded once more to support those who face a loss of employment in the event of a hard Brexit. The Taoiseach might confirm whether he agrees with this approach and whether he will be raising it at a European level.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> More broadly, for all of its flaws, and those in this House could recount many such flaws, the support of the Irish people for the European project remains strong, in my view. However, that should not be taken as agreement with those who argue for more Europe as the solution to the current malaise. Those of us who champion the European Union must also be at the forefront of reforming it. A Europe that drifts further from meeting the expectations of our people cannot hold, as we have seen again and again in election contests and referenda across the Union. I have argued for some time that we need to make greater investment in our societies in order that what we deliver as politicians can begin to match the legitimate expectations of our people. We need to make investments which can be felt by people across Europe, investments that make a noticeable difference to the quality of the lives of our people, such as investments in hospitals and nursing homes, in roads and trains, in schools and sports centres, and in so much more. All of these are, in truth, investments in our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> In my judgment, these policies will help us to meet the challenge of rising populism. Too often over recent years the belief that only populist politicians have answers to public fears has gone unchallenged. We must meet this challenge to democracy by providing people with real and workable solutions. We are too constrained from achieving that objective by some of the strictures of the Stability and Growth Pact and the fiscal rules. In the main, this is because the rules require of our states that we measure fiscal performance but there is no requirement to measure social performance. Why do we have a set of rules that measures our debt-to-GDP ratio but we do not have a requirement to monitor basic poverty levels routinely? Why do we focus on fiscal medium-term objectives but not on the health of our environment or of our people? As we speak, the rules that govern the European Union are forcing governments, including our own, into inactivity. We are constrained from spending money, even money that we ourselves have, at a time when people across this Continent are crying out for government action.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> My party is beginning two pieces of work in this area. Domestically, we have drafted a genuine progress indicators Bill, which we will publish early in the new year and which I hope will have the support of all sides of this House. It will require, as a matter of law, that we publish a national set of indicators each year which would be much broader than simply the size of our economy. By looking in the round at social progress and at the state of our environment, as well as the health of our economy, we can better measure whether Government is serving us well. This is because social progress is what matters to our people. I believe this is an important initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> Even with the best will in the world, however, I accept that Ireland could not achieve real social progress on its own. The European rules that currently prevent additional capital expenditure need to change. Ten days ago I raised this issue with the leaders of social democratic parties across Europe at a Party of European Socialists, PES, leaders meeting. We agreed at that meeting to a sensible process which it is hoped will lead to real change. At my suggestion, a group of social democratic economists and fiscal experts will meet early in 2017 to draft a set of proposals to modify the Stability and Growth Pact, including the fiscal rules. These changes will not undermine fiscal discipline but should add an urgency to investment in our societies and place the monitoring of our social good on an equal footing with the monitoring of the strength of our economies. To prevent Brexit contagion from spreading across our Continent, this is the sort of action we need to take. I would encourage the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to begin a similar process with their Christian Democratic colleagues, and Deputy Martin might do likewise with the liberals in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> On Syria, we are continuing to watch as a human tragedy unfolds before us. A deal, struck too late, that would have allowed the besieged people of Aleppo to escape seems to have been ignored. Throughout yesterday, the bombardment of that benighted city continued. UNICEF reported that “many children, possibly more than 100, unaccompanied or separated from their families, are trapped in a building, under heavy attack in east Aleppo”. It is hard to disagree with the UN spokesperson who described a “complete meltdown of humanity” in the city. The appalling situation in Syria has continued to shock us but, in truth, our shock matters little. As a Union of nations, we have failed the people of Syria. We have failed to adhere to any notion that we have a responsibility to protect them. Faced with a Syrian dictator backed by Russia and Iran, the West has been reduced to pleading that the carnage might stop.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> The US ambassador yesterday said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_433">Are you truly incapable of shame? Is there literally nothing that can shame you? Is there no act of barbarism against civilians, no execution of a child that gets under your skin, that just creeps you out a little bit? Is there nothing you will not lie about or justify?</p>
          <p eId="para_434">The continuing bombardment of Aleppo today may be our answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_437">I wish to cover a couple of areas in my five minutes to contribute. When it comes to Syria, language fails to describe what is happening there. I do not think we have the language that could convey the depth of the suffering, devastation and anguish of Syrian people. In a way, it is a war that has nothing to do with the ordinary people of Syria. The way in which it has developed has left ordinary people behind. Many years ago, I too had the opportunity to visit Damascus, which is a very rich, cultural and diverse city. When we think about the history of Syria, it is considered the cradle of civilisation. Again, there is a richness of culture and diversity. When we see what has happened in Syria, it is as though it has been taken over by politics and a power play between a number of forces backing one side or another, whether it is Shi'ite, Sunni or some other force.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> There are many powers, such Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia, the United States and countries in Europe, that are involved in this civil war. It has come a very long way from that initial very peaceful protest in the name of democracy. It is obvious that there has been no interest in a political solution. A military solution was on the agenda to see who could bomb who out quicker. We think particularly of the trauma endured by children. All the countries involved sit at the United Nations. It raises very serious questions around the efficiency and effectiveness of the UN. Europe is also at the UN. However, it is as though we have now come to accept the unacceptable. I believe that Europe's voice at the UN must be stronger in its relationships with those countries with whom it has business and diplomatic relations. At the very least, there must be a strong voice for the protection of civilians and combatants, for the respecting of the rules of war, for safe passage, and for free and safe access to all areas for UN staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> I acknowledge our Government's opening political dialogue with Cuba. If we have not done so already, Ireland is about to sign the EU-Cuba political dialogue and co-operation agreement. I believe it is positive for both Ireland and Cuba. We have a special relationship with Cuba, its society and its economy. Hopefully, we will have more positive trade relations between the EU and Cuba, including Ireland. EU support is vital in order that the progress made by President Obama and President Raúl Castro, with a major role played by Pope Francis, is not undermined or undone. I believe that the EU's voice was not strong enough on the banking issues of Cuba.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> On the issue of tax, I return to the exchanges from Leaders' Questions today and the Taoiseach's agreement that there would be a space for voices advocating for tax justice at the high-level EU meeting, rather than just the representatives of the <i>status quo</i>. We had a very good Brexit conference and I would like to see something similar. We are all concerned about Ireland's reputation and the good name we had in terms of our untied aid. We are trusted in the developing world. So much of that stems from the work of our missionaries over 100 years. Ireland is a country that countries in Africa and other places want to do business with and, therefore, we have a responsibility to be a leader on tax justice here and at EU level. There is a policy process going on at the moment in Brussels to introduce public country by country reporting. I understand we are not opposed to it in principle, but we are not vocal and strong enough in support of it. We need to be more proactive.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> I share the concerns of the speaker of the parliament of Catalonia, Ms Carme Forcadell, who was summoned to court this Friday for allegedly disobeying and perverting the course of justice by allowing the pro-independence roadmap to be put to a vote last July. This is a serious undermining of democracy. At EU level, I ask that Ireland express concerns over the prosecution of Ms Forcadell.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> The EU and EU countries that have diplomatic relations with countries that are not respectful of human rights or in which there are human rights abuses should use all avenues in their power to address these issues. I refer in particular to the murder on 12 November last of an environmental and human rights defender, Mr. Jeremy Barrios Lima, in Guatemala City. He had worked with Trócaire's partner organisation, CALAS. It is a very dangerous environment in these countries to be a human rights defender and to look after and try to protect the indigenous people and their right to land. Some of these land grabs are being carried out by corporations and multi-nationals who have bases in Europe. Europe could be a stronger voice in promoting human rights.</p>

          <p eId="para_443">I am not sure how many attempts have been made by different elected Members over the years to enshrine neutrality in the Constitution. The Sinn Féin Bill on 24 November was the most recent. Prior to that, a Bill was tabled by Deputy Mick Wallace on 18 December 2014. That Bill was defeated at Second Stage at a time when a RED C poll showed that 78% of the population agreed that Ireland should have a strong policy of neutrality. Both attempts, and all other attempts before that, have failed, primarily because the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil parties, or indeed the Labour Party when its vote counted, did not support any of these Bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> Why do Deputies keep trying? The answer is that these efforts on our part reflect the opinion of the majority of people. They reflect a long and proud tradition of neutrality going back to Wolfe Tone and to the 1916 Rising and Proclamation. If that is what the people want and that is our tradition, then why does each Government continue to vote against any change that would enshrine this concept in our Constitution? Clearly, neutrality is not a concept the Government wishes to see enshrined because leaving the <i>status quo</i> in place provides it and every other Government with much more elasticity with which to define Ireland's neutrality, depending on the needs of the circumstances and on who one's friends are at a given time.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> This elasticity allows each Government to do many things, and I will only mention some of them. Since 2002, it has allowed Shannon Airport, a civilian airport, to be used by more than 2.5 million US troops to go to and from war zones in Iraq, Yemen and Syria. On average, 500 troops per day pass through this civilian airport. They are only the numbers we know about. That figure does not include military aircraft operated directly by the US military. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will not divulge this information. As a result, we are relying on concerned individuals and groups such as Shannonwatch. It is extraordinary that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade tells us that these military aircraft are not involved in military operations when it will not divulge any information about them. On average, military aircraft land in Shannon twice a day. Last month, Shannonwatch photographed six military aircraft in one day. Last year, 600 exemptions were given to military aircraft to land at Shannon and 700 exemptions were given for aircraft to carry weaponry by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport itself paid €2.5 million last year to the Irish Aviation Authority, which was a reimbursement of costs incurred by the authority for aeronautical communications, etc. What are these troops doing, I wonder, if they are not on military operations?</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> The elasticity concept of neutrality also allowed Ireland to join a European Defence Agency in 2004 and to make contributions to a European defence fund. The elasticity allows submarines to dock in waters. In the past month, a foreign submarine, allegedly one from NATO, docked in Horgan's Quay in Cork. There were armed personnel on Horgan's Quay in Cork. What permissions were granted by whom and for what? The elasticity allows exports of dual-use components. I could go on but the message is clear on what is happening with this concept of elasticity. The irony and scandal is that all of these decisions made in our name allowed us no input whatsoever. That is in complete contrast to Article 10 of the much-lauded Lisbon treaty, which states that every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the union and that decisions shall be taken as openly and as closely as possible to the citizen.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> With regard to this upcoming meeting, I do not have much hope, but I do hope that the Minister of State might hear what we are saying and what we represent. We are being beseeched by the people of Ireland to stand up as an independent country with an independent foreign policy to be promoters of peace in the world. The irony is that the policy that we have followed along with Europe has led to a much less safe world. Some 65 million people worldwide are displaced by war and 24 people per minute are forced to flee their homes as a direct result of military conflicts.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">One out of every 113 people globally is now either a refugee, asylum seeker or internally displaced person, and of these, 51% are children.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> This is not what the people of Ireland are asking for. As I have said, they are beseeching us to stand up and be a voice for peace in the world. We have joined a Europe that is going increasingly in a military direction. The European Parliament on 22 November last backed plans to create a defence unit, but not once have we had an input into any of these decisions.</p>

          <p eId="para_450">I welcome the opportunity to speak today. One of the most immediate issues facing the European Union is the result of the recent Italian referendum, coming as it does on the back of the Brexit referendum result. We seem to be stumbling and fumbling along, unsure of ourselves. We have seen heavy-handed attempts by EU leaders, powerful people, to threaten our nearest neighbours. They have questioned what the British have done and urged them to revisit the issue. Only now is the seriousness of the situation gradually sinking in but the potential damage that Brexit may do to us has not fully sunk in yet. It has created a climate of uncertainty and added to the sense that the European project itself could be spinning out of control. The referendum was presented to the Italian people as an effort to reform the workings of Government but the people saw it differently. They interpreted the proposition before them as an attempt to increase government power at the expense of the regions and the rights of the ordinary citizen. Like it or not, that is the way people feel about Europe now. They feel that they are being excluded and left on the margins. There is a huge disconnect with the powers that be. We saw that for ourselves with the financial crisis. What did we get from the EU? Nothing but disdain and being told what we should and should not do. The EU allowed the money to be shovelled in here but took no responsibility for the actions of the European banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> This is a common theme running through much of the so-called debate on Europe at the moment. There is so much mistrust regarding the true agendas of national governments and the direction that Europe is taking that it has changed the political landscape across the Union. We are not immune to this in Ireland and how could we be? We must learn from Brexit. We must learn to find ways to listen to the people and not to dismiss their concerns as mere populism. We can all say that and we have seen that across the globe. If one takes a different view, if one is not on the big merry-go-round of European and US trips, that does not mean one is being a populist and just having a go. Having said that, we must find a way of striking a balance between listening to the people and making difficult but necessary decisions. That is a very delicate and difficult balance to strike but we must try to do so. When people trust their governments, this is more easily achieved. The Italian referendum, the Brexit result and the election of President-elect Donald Trump have shown us that when people do not trust their governments, even good ideas are defeated. When the people lose faith in their governments, then the governments cannot bring the people with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> The Irish Government is going over and back to European summits. What will the Taoiseach be doing about Ibrahim Halawa who marked his 21st birthday in awful conditions in prison in Egypt? What recognition are we getting from the EU for the work we are doing through our missionaries, NGOs and pioneering people? What recognition are we getting for the tremendous but harrowing work being done by our Navy? I saw a documentary on the work of our Navy in the Mediterranean on Monday night last. The risks being taken by our personnel are spectacular. The documentary highlighted the difficulties they experience when trying to rescue migrants at sea. They must try to keep them calm and assure them that they are there to help, such is the level of fear. The migrants are so desperate that they have left their country on boats that do not even have enough fuel to bring them 50 km, not to mention a four-hour trip. The documentary highlighted the false hope and the abuse of trust by those who put them on those makeshift boats.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> I visited a refugee camp myself in Lebanon and know that people will take any risks to get away rather than stay in a situation of hateful persecution. What we are seeing in Syria, with the continual bombardment of Aleppo, is beyond words. No words could even begin to describe the horror of that situation, but Europe has stood idly by. What have we said as an independent country? What attempts have we made to bring this issue to the fore and to ensure respect for the so-called normal rules of war? What is going on in Aleppo is savage.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> There has been very little debate on these issues in this House. I have tried to raise the issue of the Middle East and the wipeout of Christianity and other minority Muslim sects from the region. Anyone who does not conform is just being wiped out. I note that Fianna Fáil has tabled a motion on the Yazidis. While I acknowledge that the Yazidis are being persecuted, so too are Christians. I cannot understand Fianna Fáil's unwillingness to include Christians in its motion. Why the cherry-picking? No human being deserves to be treated in such an obnoxious fashion. The Middle East will be destabilised for generations to come. It is horrific to see what is going on in Aleppo and to consider the arms trade, the way the USA is supporting Saudi Arabia and the Russians are continuing with their bombardment. It is the most awful civil war. I know that ISIS must be tackled but surely not this way, with the slaughter of innocents, of children, house by house and on the streets of Aleppo. The people of Aleppo could not leave. They had no chance because to try to leave would have posed an even greater risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, to the Chamber. I know that she and the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, visited refugee camps in Greece in recent days. Seeing is believing. I was only in a refugee camp once, in Lebanon, but I will never forget the fear and terror in the eyes of children. I will never forget the stories they told. Most were there with nobody only a grandparent, their siblings and parents having been slaughtered or dragged into the conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> We are standing idly by. As a so-called neutral country, we are not even having proper discourse and debate on these issues. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross is the man with responsibility for the munitions passing through Shannon Airport. We need to be questioning much more what is going through that civilian airport. We do not ask enough questions but simply sign letters. I know that the current Minister does not just do that and I compliment him on that. I have spoken to him about issues like this and I know he takes them seriously. The Cabinet needs to take them more seriously too. We need to know the destinations of all the US military planes and what is on board them. I know that Shannon Airport is in the constituency of the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Pat Breen, and we all want to see the airport doing well, but not at any cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> I look forward to hearing from the Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs and Justice and Equality about the situation in the refugee camps. We must thank the NGOs, the peacekeepers and the reporters who risk their lives to report the true horror of what is going on. They are being failed by us when we do not act on that horror, when we do not bat an eyelid at the persecution that is going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> I referred earlier to the wiping out of Christians and other sects.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">Under the dictators people had freedom to practice their religion with impunity. There was some sense of normality in the region but united coalition forces have bombed the hell out of the place and what is there now? Nothing but unadulterated bedlam, war and terror regimes. It is a far more unstable, dangerous and troubling place for future generations than has been the case for decades. I am not condoning dictatorships but people had some sense that they were able to go about their lives, cherish whatever faith they believed in and create some semblance of normality for their children, but now there is unadulterated chaos. I am disappointed we have not had any meaningful debates on that in the House. I am disappointed with Fianna Fáil also regarding its difficulty in including Christians in its forthcoming motion. I do not understand the party's difficulty in that regard.</p>

As the Taoiseach mentioned, I will focus my remarks on the external relations items of the European Council meeting. This is to consist of the consideration of the Dutch Government’s approach to ratification of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, the situation in Syria and also the sanctions against Russia in regard to Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> The EU-Ukraine Association Agreement was finalised in 2014. All EU member states, except the Netherlands, have now ratified the agreement. There was a consultative referendum in the Netherlands last April which opposed Dutch ratification.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> In order to address the concerns raised during the referendum, the Dutch Government is now seeking a decision of the Heads of State or Government of the 28 EU member states meeting as the European Council, which provides legally binding assurances. These assurances include confirmation that the agreement is not the first step to EU membership and clarification of what it does or does not entail. The decision is not seeking to alter the substance of the agreement itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> This agreement is of vital significance and it is therefore important that a solution is found to allow the Netherlands to ratify it. Failure to do so would cast doubt on the credibility of the EU as a stable partner for countries in the eastern neighbourhood. For these reasons, we would wish the EU to be as supportive as possible and we intend to approach the matter in that spirit.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> Ireland, together with its EU partners, remains very concerned at the ever-worsening situation in Syria. We have been shocked and outraged at the appalling scenes of suffering in Aleppo where the excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate use of military force constitutes a clear violation of international law, as outlined in the genuine contributions by speakers this afternoon.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> Our concerns have been directly conveyed in the clearest terms to the Russian authorities, given their role as a key supporter of the Assad regime. It is disheartening to note that however the conflict mutates in the near term, there is likely to be neither improvement nor meaningful resolution in the short term.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> The October European Council held a broad strategic debate on the relationship with Russia in all its aspects. It was agreed that it remains a strategic goal for Ireland and the EU to have a strong stable partnership with Russia into the future. However, we must be frank about the current realities and the situation as it presents itself today.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> There has clearly been a marked deterioration in relations between Russia and the EU over the past number of years. The conflict in Ukraine has come to be the central defining issue, although there are also grave concerns over Russia’s role in the Syrian conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> There has been no major change in policy by Russia or any indications that it is seeking to improve its relationship with the EU. That is regrettable, but it is quite simply the fact and it cannot be ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> EU Foreign Ministers agreed a set of principles in March to guide our relations with Russia and these remain the guiding points for our current relationship. In line with these, Ireland believes there is merit in seeking a selective engagement with Russia on foreign policy issues and specific sectoral areas of interest to the EU. However, we are clear that any resumption of dialogue should be gradual and should be used by the EU to seek a change in Russian behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> As I said, the fragile security situation and the conflict in eastern Ukraine remain of paramount importance. Two years on from the signing of the first Minsk agreements, we are still calling for a stable ceasefire.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> The path for a resolution of the conflict is set out in the Minsk agreements. The EU has been very clear and consistent in linking the economic sanctions imposed in 2014 to the complete implementation of the Minsk accords. The decision to impose such measures on Russia has come with negative consequences. The EU has suffered in terms of trade volumes, but that underlines the seriousness with which the EU regards Russia’s actions in destabilising eastern Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> The sanctions are intended to encourage Russia to use its influence to help ensure the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. Criteria for amending the sanctions are clear and provide the sole basis upon which future decisions and assessments are made.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> We have repeatedly made clear that the EU will never recognise Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and that has to remain an important principle in our approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> Despite these negative elements, the EU still needs to look to its values and to act in accordance with them. For example, it is of great importance that the EU maintains its support for civil society in Russia, which continues to be vulnerable. The shrinking space for independent civil society and the ongoing harassment of human rights defenders, journalists and opponents is deeply troubling.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> As I said, we desire a strong and stable relationship with Russia over the long term and that goal will once again guide our thinking at the European Council discussion this week. However, we do not expect any significant change in the EU’s approach to its relationship with Russia at the present time.</p>

            <p eId="para_481">I am working to introduce a new affordable child care scheme from next September which will provide financial support for parents towards the cost of child care. The new scheme will provide for both universal and targeted subsidies towards the cost of child care. It will replace the existing targeted child care programmes with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme. I want it to provide "wraparound" care for pre-school and school age children.</p>
            <p eId="para_482"> To ensure good governance, the affordable child care scheme will be put on a statutory basis. The necessary primary legislation will encompass clear and detailed rules for the assessment of income and the provision of subsidies, clearly prescribed authority in regard to the sharing of data across public bodies and administrators, comprehensive provisions regarding the powers and obligations of the scheme administrator and high level requirements and associated powers of sanction regarding scheme participation by child care providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_483"> The primary legislation will take account of all necessary amendments to existing legislation. As part of this, the use of the PPS number and data sharing across public bodies and agencies will be supported through legislation and formal data sharing agreements. Officials in my Department are currently drafting the heads of Bill for the scheme, which are at an advanced stage. I intend to bring the heads of Bill to Government for approval early in the new year and thereafter the precise timeframe for the drafting of the legislation and its passage through the Houses will be subject to the usual considerations regarding scheduling and allocation of parliamentary time. My objective is that legislation will be in place in early summer and I look forward to piloting this important scheme through both Houses.</p>

            <p eId="para_484">I acknowledge the persistence and determination of the Minister and her team in bringing forward the affordable child care scheme. However, I am a realistic individual and I note all the Departments the Minister must bring legislation through. The Minister is looking at changing the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 which is to work with the personal public service, PPS, number. When one considers that more than 500,000 parents have not used or signed up to availing of the PPS number, the Minister will have to work with the Department of Social Protection, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. The Minister is looking at bringing through legislation for a proper IT system in order that parents wanting to avail of it can do all this online, and she plans to have all that done by August. I wish the Minister well in her endeavours in delivering that. As I stated at the beginning, I am a realist and I can see many problems.</p>

            <from>Deputy Katherine Zappone<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_485">I thank Deputy Rabbitte. I would be a pragmatic idealist. I recognise that the timeframe for introducing the scheme is ambitious, not least because the legislation, as the Deputy states and as I have indicated, will have to be in place before the scheme can commence. Officials in my Department are working to ensure the heads of the Bill will be brought forward for Government approval in the new year.</p>
            <p eId="para_486"> A key piece of the existing legislation that needs to be examined, and this is what the Deputy refers to, is the Social Welfare Consolidation Act of 2005 because that specifies the bodies that can use PPS numbers and the purpose for which they can be shared. In the process of bringing in the affordable child care legislation, we will look at that Act to determine any necessary amendments.</p>
            <p eId="para_487"> The reason the PPS numbers and data sharing arrangements are so critical is an online IT application system will be developed that will allow the parents to apply for subsidies online by entering these numbers and other details, such as their work and training status. As the Deputy indicates, that takes several Departments to work together. We need to be ambitious.</p>

            <from>Deputy Anne Rabbitte<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_488">Going back to what I said at the beginning, there are 500,000 parents who did not sign up with the Department of Education and Skills by forwarding on the PPS number. People have a reservation about releasing their PPS number because it is private, confidential and personal information. We saw what happened with Irish Water where a U-turn had to be made in 2014 on the release of PPS numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_489"> I accept the Minister is bringing through a system where the parent can do it at home and all online, but surely the governance for the child care provider will involve the parent providing information to the provider to cross-check that the parent has submitted the application in order for the provider to get his or her funding. It will revolve around the PPS number. Would the Minister agree that there will be concerns around the use of the PPS number?</p>

            <p eId="para_490">I am glad Deputy Rabbitte raised this. It is an important consideration. With regard to the rationale for using the PPS number, it is for a particular benefit - that is what is critical here - in order that we can use it to link to the Department of Social Protection and Revenue Commissioners data, thereby allowing a much faster and more user-friendly service for parents, overcoming the need for them to have to submit documentary evidence and reducing administrative burden.</p>
            <p eId="para_491"> The PPS number is already used as an identifier within many schemes, including the current targeted child care subsidisation scheme. The focus here is on us looking to use it to provide a benefit, for that to be more user-friendly and in order that parents ultimately can access what we are offering as a subsidy, and it is easier for the providers as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_492"> On the issue of legal advice on this, the Department's internal legal adviser wrote to us yesterday with high level advice on our heads of the Bill. I understand that, effectively, the social welfare legislation will be amended as necessary to ensure we can use PPS numbers.</p>

            <p eId="para_494">This question follows on from a number of reports on RTE's "This Week" programme largely relating to a document released under freedom of information identifying clear cases of inequity when dealing with child protection cases involving children with disabilities. It highlights issues of resources with Tusla in this regard.</p>

          <speech by="#KatherineZappone" eId="spk_220" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs">

            <p eId="para_495">It is vital to emphasise that the Health Information and Quality Authority has never found, in all of the inspections that it has conducted, an instance where child protection services, when required, were not immediately available. Tusla has reiterated its position that all child protection concerns it receives are screened and assessed in line with Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children and that all such concerns are treated in the same way, regardless of any other challenges a child may or may not face. Tusla has confirmed to me that no child is excluded from accessing child protection services, regardless of his or her situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_496"> Each child presenting to our State services comes with a range of different needs and support requirements. Children in the care of Tusla regularly receive disability services from the HSE, where appropriate. Where a child requires additional supports, for example, for a disability, the best possible care and service is sourced for him or her.</p>
            <p eId="para_497"> The commentary by the HSE, to which Deputy Ó Laoghaire referred, relates to observations on the joint working protocol between the HSE and Tusla. This document, of which disability forms just a part, was agreed upon the establishment of Tusla in January 2014. The comments in question relate to 2014 and matters have moved on since then.</p>
            <p eId="para_498"> Since 2015, Tusla has been actively seeking to establish a new, detailed, disability protocol with the HSE governing children in care and aftercare, and access to disability services. This protocol would also specify how Tusla might be of assistance to HSE cases in relation to supports under Tusla's remit. I am pleased that, in recent days, Tusla and the HSE have agreed a new protocol in principle which will operate to ensure good collaboration between Tusla and the HSE on disability related services for children.</p>

            <p eId="para_499">First, I am conscious that parents of children with disabilities and those with disabilities ultimately find themselves fighting for every right and entitlement that they should be due.</p>
            <p eId="para_500"> There are a number of elements of the Minister's response that require further development, the first of which is that this protocol has recently been agreed. Obviously, up until now, the existing protocols were still in effect. When will that protocol take effect?</p>
            <p eId="para_501"> On the correspondence that existed, one of the quotes was "that service providers whilst following the Children First Guidelines are then unable to access child protection services due to an increase in the threshold level and criteria of the CFA framework as set by the CFA [Child and Family Agency]". It was to do with those guidelines and criteria that existed in that framework. The Minister responded that, "where required", these services were available. It seems to have been an issue that there were children who probably should have been considered to be requiring services that were not evaluated in this regard and were not considered to be required.</p>

            <p eId="para_502">I thank Deputy Ó Laoghaire. I appreciate him asking further questions in this regard. The protocol I identified in terms of recent meetings between Tusla and the HSE is effectively an amendment of a protocol that has already been established. Tusla and the HSE, as I indicated, have been in a process of reaching out to one another to identify new ways to ensure, particularly in disability services because this has to do with the heart of the Deputy's answer, that it is clear who is responsible for what when children who require disability services are in care. Tusla's responsibility is when children are in its care and protection. When children are in Tusla's care and protection, if disability support services are needed to be provided, that is the responsibility of the HSE, but there needs to be an effective protocol developed between the two agencies. I am saying to the Deputy that the two agencies have most recently ensured that in principle they will have a more effective protocol from now on in order that no child who requires those disability services in the context of the care of Tusla does not receive those because of the lack of inter-agency co-operation.</p>

            <p eId="para_503">Before I proceed to my second supplementary, the Minister in her response might clarify whether that protocol takes effect immediately or at some date in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_504"> My second supplementary relates to another timeline that I would be looking for.</p>
            <p eId="para_505">For some time, there has been a debate on Ireland's inability to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD. The convention was signed in March 2007, almost ten years ago, but it still has not been ratified, although it has been ratified by 156 other countries since then. That puts us behind countries with far fewer resources and less capacity, such as Vietnam, Togo, Uganda and many others. The Government, including the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has stated time and again that this is a priority. Can the Minister give a commitment that the Government will ratify that convention? It is vital for children with disabilities.</p>

            <p eId="para_506">I assure the Deputy that the protocols have been improved and amended effectively over the last number of months. In the past couple of weeks there was a disabilities protocol group meeting in which it identified that there will be a standardised operating procedure governing retrospective disclosures and the sharing of information as well as a number of other aspects, particularly how to define lifelong placement agreements as adult placements. These are agreed in principle and they are in effect. It is a matter of writing it up and ensuring it is copperfastened in the original text. The group assures me that this is what is guiding the inter-agency co-operation. I and other members of the Government are absolutely committed to ensuring this Government is able to ratify the convention.</p>

            <p eId="para_508">Being homeless is distressing and stressful for children and adults alike. In the context of the Child Care Act 1991, my Department has policy responsibility for children under 18 years of age who present as "out of home" without their parent or guardian.</p>
            <p eId="para_509"> Children under the age of 16 years who present as homeless without their parent or guardian are taken into care. Children aged 16 years and 17 years may be taken into care or provided with a service under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991, which deals with accommodation for homeless children.</p>
            <p eId="para_510"> Children who are homeless and in emergency accommodation are in the care of their parent or parents. Given the clearly challenging circumstances in which families in emergency accommodation find themselves, I do not believe that residing in emergency accommodation, in and of itself, should be the basis for taking children into care. Where there are no welfare or protection concerns, Tusla’s role is to provide family support where required.</p>
            <p eId="para_511"> Tusla has agreed a joint protocol with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE. This governs child welfare protection matters for children in emergency accommodation. It is fully operational in the DRHE area and it is intended to roll it out across the State. It will be extended to Galway, Limerick and Cork in 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_512"> My Department is working closely with Tusla to provide additional supports for families in emergency accommodation and those at risk of homelessness.</p>
            <p eId="para_513"> All of our family resource centres, FRCs, are working with people who are experiencing homelessness.

            <p eId="para_514">I accept what the Minister says, but this is not about taking children into care. The nub of the question is about children in emergency accommodation and the timeframe for that. The reason I tabled this question today is that recently I tabled the same parliamentary question and the answer I received is the same as what the Minister just said. It stated that the policy responsibility for homelessness in so far as it extends to the Minister's Department relates to children under 18 years of age and any child welfare and protection concerns that might arise in the context of the Child Care Act 1991. My concern is the length of time that children are left in accommodation for the homeless, that is, being moved from one bed and breakfast room to another, over and back across the city and the uncertainty of that. Who is there to protect the child? The Minister said there are no protection issues, but we do not know that because we are not watching. We are not vetting where we are sending families when they are going from one bed and breakfast setting to another. That is where I am seeking the support of Tusla.</p>

In both my written response to the Deputy and my oral response today, I am trying to make it perfectly clear that the statutory responsibility of Tusla is for the care and protection of children who may require it. That does not necessarily mean if they are with their parents in emergency accommodation. The agency's statutory responsibility does not extend to that. At the same time, I agree that it is very important to ensure that they are in emergency accommodation for as little time as possible. In the overall Rebuilding Ireland - an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness response, my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, is trying to ensure that this timeframe reduces. However, while they are in that accommodation Tusla took on the responsibility of working with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive to develop safety and protection policies to be provided for children in emergency accommodation. That has been developed in draft form and it will be rolled out in the new year.</p>

            <p eId="para_516">I refer to my question again. Does the Minister believe that Tusla should have a statutory responsibility of support? Does she agree that responsibility should not lie with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and that Tusla should have an input into the governance around how long children and families are spending in emergency accommodation? There should be joined-up thinking. I applaud what is happening in Dublin and I welcome that it will be rolled out to the other cities. However, we must focus on the children. We should put the child at the centre and join the dots between Tusla, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and local government, because there is a piece missing. That piece relates to how long children are spending going from A to B. Who is watching out for the child attending the general practitioner, the child regularly attending school or the child having continuity with their friends and family? As long as they are in emergency homeless accommodation they are going from A to B to C all of the time.</p>

            <p eId="para_517">I appreciate the Deputy's passion and commitment on this, and it is important we share that. It will enable a quicker resolution to these issues if we work on this together along with our other colleagues. However, I question some of the Deputy's statements. Although Tusla does not have a statutory responsibility <i>per se</i> for the care of children in emergency accommodation because they are with their parents, that does not mean Tusla is not working under my direction to ensure, particularly through the family resource centres although not exclusively through them, that they have the additional supports that are required to ensure their care and protection while they are in emergency accommodation. In that regard Tusla has developed and conducted a mapping exercise that profiles each area and what is available in each of the family resource centres throughout the country. I have information on the family resource centres in Galway that I will be happy to share with the Deputy after this exchange.</p>

            <p eId="para_519">I welcome the Minister back from Greece. From her experience there she will have got a good understanding of the perilous journey and the awful conditions the young people in the Calais camp experienced in their young lives. My question concerns the all-party motion which was agreed more than a month ago in terms of being willing to take 200 unaccompanied minors in this country and also the need to ensure that Tusla is given extra resources to deal with the extra responsibility.</p>

            <p eId="para_520">As the Deputy is aware, there was a recent Dáil motion in respect of unaccompanied children who were previously living in the unofficial camps near Calais and work is ongoing. I am co-ordinating my efforts with the Tánaiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to ensure that Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is in a position to play its part when the children begin to arrive here. I understand that there have been a number of contacts with the French authorities and that they have welcomed our offer of solidarity. I have had productive consultations with Tusla and I am happy with the progress that we are making. My officials have also recently met with volunteers who had worked with children in the unofficial camp in Calais. The volunteers are aware of the steps needed to implement the Dáil motion.</p>
            <p eId="para_521"> It is essential that we have the services in place to receive these children from France and the existing service will need to be expanded to achieve this. Tusla has outlined the necessary steps to increase its capacity to receive unaccompanied minors, and the resources it will need, with the intention of ensuring that the equity of care principle is observed. As it will take time to put all the elements needed in place, it can be expected that the relocation of unaccompanied minors will be on an incremental basis. On my recent visit to Greece, to which Deputy Jan O'Sullivan graciously referred, the range of needs of refugee children, especially those without their parents, was apparent and it is important that we are in a position to meet the needs of this very vulnerable cohort and that our efforts are successful.</p>

            <p eId="para_522">My real concern is that we begin to make progress on the issue. The Minister said it would have to happen on an incremental basis and we all understand that. We do not expect that 200 children will come together but we would like to think that young people would be able to come here as soon as possible. A number of us met with the volunteers to whom the Minister referred and they made it clear to us that the main concern of most of the children is that they want to go to an English speaking country because they speak English and we are in a position to offer that to them. We must be conscious of the vulnerability of those young people and the fact that they could be subject to trafficking. I am not sure whether the Minister knows if the French authorities know where all the children are at this stage or what information has come from the meetings and contacts with the French Government. Now that it is more than a month since the motion was passed, my aim in tabling the question is to ensure we do see progress. The issue is one to which I will return after the Christmas break.</p>

            <p eId="para_523">Just 72 hours ago I was standing in the Eleonas camp in Athens listening to children and families. Like many Deputies who visited the camps, I was deeply moved when talking to children, in particular small children - six and seven year olds - who were as fluent in English as they were in Arabic. Like me, I am sure no Deputy thought the sight of refugee camps on European soil would ever happen again in our lifetime, yet camps, both official and unofficial, now dot every part of the Continent. I mention my visit to Eleonas because the experience has made me more resolute in everything that we do.</p>
            <p eId="para_524"> In terms of children formerly resident in Calais, a memo will go to Government next week. I can confirm that officials under my Department in Tusla are working very hard on proposals and we are looking at a possible doubling in size of the unit in Tusla which deals with separated children seeking asylum. Deputies may be aware that this unit already has approximately 100 lone children who arrive in Ireland referred to it each year. Those are the kind of issues that will be addressed in the decision that will be taken at our final Cabinet meeting of the year.</p>

The project office will co-ordinate work within Tusla's national remit and will work with relevant officials in the Department of Justice and Equality. It is expected that the project office will also co-ordinate Tusla's activities and responsibilities with Departments and agencies on the practical logistics of the care of children and young persons once they have arrived in this jurisdiction and that it will also liaise with NGOs and members of the public seeking to make supports available.</p>

            <p eId="para_530">I will emphasise a few points that were made in the previous reply and then I will come to the protocol. HIQA has never found an instance where child protection services, when required, were not immediately available. Tusla does not discriminate on any grounds, disability or otherwise, and all child protection concerns are assessed in line with Children First. Children have diverse needs which are addressed accordingly and the children in the care of Tusla receive disability services from the HSE, where appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_531"> I referred to the new joint protocol, an amended one, which specifically focuses on disability. It has been agreed in principle. I will outline some aspects of that in a moment. Formal sign-off is expected shortly. Tusla advises that the protocol, the exact wording of which is being finalised, provides a clear escalation process should an issue arise or if there is an unresolved matter around access to appropriate and available resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_532"> In terms of the protocol, the objectives have been to clarify and set out the respective roles, duties and legal requirements of the HSE and the Child and Family Agency in relation to children and young people with a disability or with a mental health issue, and to develop pathways for increased understanding and co-operation between the HSE and the Child and Family Agency. Collaboration and close co-operation are needed between both agencies in order to ensure a consistent approach for the care of children, in particular those with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_533"> In terms of the most recent agreements, I have already indicated some aspects of them to Deputy Ó Laoghaire. In addition, the HSE will define the lifelong placement agreement as adult placements, making the distinction with the Child and Family Agency fostering placements as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_534">As we are all aware, the issue was in the media for many days and it did bring attention to the matter. The CEO of the Children's Ombudsman, Niall Muldoon, used the phrase "extremely concerning" and the manager of the autism support organisation, Shine, Kieran Kennedy, referred to cases in recent months. This is not 2014. I accept we cannot talk about individual cases but we must be aware of what was said by the CEO of the advocacy group, Shine. Parents at home listening to the debate this evening will welcome the new protocol. It identifies that there were issues, lack of communication and a possible lack of understanding.</p>
            <p eId="para_535">Perhaps that is why we needed the new protocol. We need reassurance from the Minister that she is happy with this new protocol, that it will address concerns and that clear pathways will be found to prevent future discoveries</p>

            <p eId="para_536">Clearly, if something has been amended, it was required. I was also distressed to hear some of our mutual colleagues respond in respect of media reports and concerns around inter-agency co-operation. My understanding is that they were reviewing in terms of their response a report that was based on 2014 agreements. As I said in my earlier reply, things have moved on in terms of inter-agency co-operation and ongoing efforts to ensure that children with disabilities receive the reports they require when and if they are in the care of Tusla. We have co-operation and inter-agency protocol. Yes, we need to ensure that there are moneys, particularly within the HSE budget, to provide the appropriate supports for children with disabilities in the care of Tusla.</p>

            <p eId="para_537">The last point I will hone in on is the child protection bar. Is it too high? Is there a clear understanding between the HSE and Tusla as to when one passes from one to the other seamlessly so that if there is a concern, Tusla is in a position to intervene straight away, the goal posts do not keep moving and there is a clear understanding with the HSE that when it needs to make an open disclosure or involve Tusla regarding a child with disabilities, it falls under the remit? There were obviously different positions, procedures and best practices in different facilities but that is where it might have fallen down. Do we have a clear common denominator of practice and governance from one unit to another?</p>

            <p eId="para_538">I believe they exist and that this recent spotlight helps us to ensure in an ongoing way that they exist. I reiterate that from a Tusla perspective over which I can stand in respect of children in the care of Tusla and efforts to ensure those with disabilities receive the supports they require from the HSE that the other dimension to this debate, to which Deputy Ó Laoghaire referred, involves required resources to ensure that those supports are there. It involves resources as well as inter-agency co-operation. I am also being very clear that the supports for children with disabilities come through the HSE budget but we need to ensure that lack of inter-agency co-operation does not stand in the way.</p>

            <p eId="para_542">The new single affordable child-care scheme will make subsidies payable to services that are quality assured. This is in the best interests of children and families. Tusla provides quality assurance for child care services under the statutory registration and inspection regime.</p>
            <p eId="para_543"> In advance of introducing the scheme in September 2017, my Department will carry out further work in conjunction with city and county child care committees and national child care organisations. This will ensure that all child care providers who are eligible to participate in the scheme, including both centre-based providers and childminders, are aware of any steps they need to take in order to participate in the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_544"> Childminders who mind three or fewer pre-school children in the childminder's own home are exempt from the child care regulations and thus are not subject to inspection by Tusla. In order to meet the needs of parents whose preference is to use a childminder, and to build capacity to cater for increased demand in future years, my Department has established a working group chaired by Childminding Ireland. </p>
            <p eId="para_545"> The working group, which includes officials from Tusla, my Department and the city and county child care committees, will make recommendations on reforms for the sector, including proposals relating to quality assurance, whether they be on a voluntary non-statutory basis in the short term or on a mandatory statutory basis in the long term. These will include recommendations relating to childminders who are exempt from registration with Tusla - those minding three or fewer pre-school children or those minding school-age children only. The recommendations received are likely to include proposals to be progressed in the short, medium and long term, including the development of national quality standards for childminders and a proportionate system of quality assurance and regulation.</p>

            <p eId="para_548">Much of what the Minister has said is welcome. Is it envisaged that those childminders who are exempt from Tusla inspection would be entitled to be part of the single affordable child-care scheme? To some extent, the question related to support and advocacy offered by the childminding advisory service and the link between the county child care committees and childminders. Many childminders operate on an informal level and many individuals, largely women, might be fearful about any registration process and fear that they might be penalised for working outside the tax system for a number of years. This needs to be handled sensibly and carefully to bring as many people as possible into a quality, child-centred service. That link, service and support will be essential so I ask the Minister to consider either advancing or re-establishing something along the lines of the childminding advisory service.</p>

            <p eId="para_549">That is a very helpful suggestion that I will certainly consider in respect of the Deputy's last point. My Department and I, along with the county and city child care committees, are very keen to provide support, particularly to childminders, because we are aware that for many parents, this is their preference for the minding of their children and they hope and wish that they could have access to the child care scheme that will be rolled out.</p>
            <p eId="para_550"> There are 219 registered childminders who will be eligible to participate in the single affordable child-care scheme announced in the recent budget. Since the announcement, two more childminders have joined and are in the process of registering with Tusla. Clearly, we have concerns about the lower numbers here. We are aware that the current eligibility criteria rule out a high percentage of childminders who are minding fewer than four children and a lot of work is ongoing in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_552">I confused myself with the Standing Orders and did not think I would get in again. That latter point is vitally important because it is essential that this be a very central part of the single affordable child-care scheme and child care more generally because for many parents who do shift work, childminders will be essential. It offers these parents the flexibility they require. Is it possible for the Minister to give a timeline for when she expects this working group led by Childminding Ireland to produce its report containing these short, medium and long-term recommendations?</p>

            <p eId="para_553">It might be helpful to identify some of the issues that have been uncovered relating to the meetings of the working group that have taken place. The low level of registration is often explained by the fact that most childminders mind fewer than four children and that registration and compliance with the regulations are perceived by the sector to be very complicated. There is definitely a need to simplify the regulatory standards so that they are proportionate and fit the model of care that childminders offer, including providing a home-away-from-home environment for children. The current regulations are more relevant to centre-based centres and disproportionate in respect of childminding services, although current practice is to consider this during the inspections.</p>
            <p eId="para_554">It appears evident, however, that the sector needs its own separate fit-for-purpose regulations and this is emerging in the context of the discussions. The next meeting is scheduled for 20 December and I expect to receive a report from them in May 2017.</p>

            <p eId="para_557">Along with my Government colleagues and all Members of this House, I am committed to supporting children and families who are living in emergency accommodation because they are homeless. We are making progress on the actions in Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness. I wish our progress could be quicker and this is particularly the case as we approach Christmas, which will be stressful and challenging for families living in emergency accommodation. Deputy O’Sullivan’s question covers many different initiatives. I will attempt to answer as much as possible now and I will cover any additional questions in the supplementary answers. The Deputy has specifically asked about the free public transport for children to go to school, after school and community activities. In October, families received five 24 hour family Leap cards. These are valid for use on all Dublin transport systems, allowing for family days out at weekends or during holiday periods.</p>
            <p eId="para_558"> Arrangements are being finalised to provide Leap cards for children who need to use public transport to attend school. We expect these to be available in the new year and ideally as soon as possible after children return to school. There have been some challenges in designing these cards and I am happy to give the Deputy further details if she needs them.</p>
            <p eId="para_559"> In respect of the safety guidance voluntary code, the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, DRHE, developed draft national quality standards for homeless services. Tusla was included in the membership of the advisory group which provided the feedback on the development of these standards. In addition, there is a joint protocol between Tusla and the DRHE governing child welfare and protection matters which is fully operational. It is planned to roll out a similar protocol in Limerick, Cork and Galway in 2017. It will need to be tailored to each area due to the different structures in place.</p>

Tomorrow, I will be announcing details of a new programme to ease the burden of child care costs for homeless families. We have reached agreement on prioritising young people leaving care for the capital assistance scheme. Tusla is meeting tomorrow with a front-line provider to start work on a service level agreement to support pregnant women who are homeless. Research into the food and nutrition needs of families in emergency accommodation will be completed early in the New Year. I am happy to give more details on any of these initiatives to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_562">While I welcome the Leap cards for family outings, it is disappointing that the transport to school has not yet been actually arranged. From the timeframe given to us by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, the cards should have been available by now. Clearly, children must go to school so it is particularly urgent. Perhaps the Minister could explain some of the reasons that it has not happened by this stage. It has been quite a long time since that commitment was given. I ask also that the Minister gives a little more information about progress on the voluntary code of child safety, which is also an urgent element.</p>

            <p eId="para_563">I share Deputy Sullivan's concern about how long the free transport measure is taking. At my request, my officials have spoken with the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, DRHE, to get more information on why it is taking so long to implement the scheme. They are anxious, I understand, to implement it as soon as possible. There are serious practical and logistical issues that must be worked out in conjunction with the National Transport Authority so the scheme can be rolled out fairly and safely. They hope to pilot the scheme from mid to late January for about four weeks and then implement it in full. This is to ensure that all concerns around identity, danger of fraud and misuse, and user friendliness for those eligible can be addressed. I can share a bit more information in that regard, as well as a reply to the Deputy's second question, the next time I take to my feet.</p>

            <p eId="para_564">Will the Minister indicate if the pilot scheme, to be rolled out after the four weeks, is for all the children or is it just for a group of the children? We have school transport for children in rural areas so I do not understand why it is such a difficulty to get this scheme put in place. Presumably we know who the children are and where they go to school.</p>

            <p eId="para_565">It is not about who and where are the children. I will go into a little more detail on some of the issues, as explained to me by the DRHE. With regard to identity and fraud, or misuse of cards, the cards must be used only by those who are eligible and each user must, therefore, be registered and the cards not transferred to someone else. There are some data protection concerns. The DRHE needs consent to have homeless families' details of individual children so as to estimate age, location, likely usage and the distance from hotel accommodation to school. Much of this can be addressed through information contained with consent as when the five Leap cards were issued. The system must also be user friendly. A system for topping up cards, including the amounts, which is normally done at source by card buyers, means that from an administrative point of view a judgment needs to be made. Some 90% of homeless families reside in the Dublin area. This is about helping as many people as possible and as quickly as possible so it will be rolled out through Dublin initially. In the Deputy's area of the mid-west, I understand there are 22 homeless families and I suggest that if children of families need to use public transport to get to school, an application should be made to the community welfare officer. I would be happy to lend my support to that application.</p>

            <p eId="para_568">I thank Deputy Curran. Improving attendance and participation in education is a key priority for me, particularly regarding vulnerable children. The programme for Government, as the Deputy said, commits to publishing a new school completion strategy to further improve school completion rates, especially in disadvantaged areas. My Department will work closely with the Minister for Education and Skills in developing the new strategy. We will prepare it in the context of the Government programme commitment to a new action plan for educational inclusion to secure good educational outcomes for all children, especially those at risk of educational disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_569"> The ongoing review of the DEIS programme, which targets supports to schools and students in the most disadvantaged areas, will inform the development of this strategy. I hope to progress the school completion strategy in the latter half of 2017. In the meantime, Tusla is working on improvements to the governance and operation of the school completion programme. I believe the programme is a vital response in securing improved educational outcomes for those who are at risk of early school leaving. The ESRI's report on the programme in October 2015 pointed to the effectiveness of the service but emphasised the need for organisational reforms. Tusla has been working on these in order to strengthen its operation. For example, an unemployment audit was carried out and its findings are currently under consideration. These improvements will form a valuable backdrop to a new school completion strategy. I want the strategy to recognise possible alternative provisions where students are not suited to mainstream education and we will also need to respond to the needs of children from ethnic and minority groups with low school completion rates, including the Traveller and Roma communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_570">I thank the Minister. I appreciate the fact that she has given a timeframe for the strategy. I encourage her to engage in as broad a consultation process as possible. The school completion programme to date has been successful but it does not mean we can be complacent and that there are no new challenges. It is worth noting that the most recent figures available indicate that about nine out of ten students complete second level education. Unfortunately, particular problems arise in the DEIS schools where one in five students do not complete school. I hope that the focus of the new programme will look specifically at DEIS schools. It is interesting, when one looks at the DEIS schools, that the gap between DEIS and non-DEIS schools in getting to students to junior certificate is only 3%. Some 94% complete their junior certificate in DEIS schools and 97% get to junior certificate in non-DEIS schools. When they get to the leaving certificate, however, there is a 10% gap. The review needs to focus very strongly on that period from junior certificate to leaving certificate. Those students who do transition year are also more likely to complete their schooling compared with those who do not do transition year.</p>

            <p eId="para_571">The Deputy's suggestion that the consultation process should be as wide as possible is helpful. That is something we need to do and that we will do.</p>
            <p eId="para_572"> As I mentioned in my initial response, a number of reviews of the school completion programme were undertaken, many of which would point to some of the issues the Deputy identified. Those reviews are with Tusla and my Department and they will need careful consideration. The funding implications are also critical and need to be examined based on the evidence and the recommendations of the reviews, the differences in percentages, as the Deputy identified, the transition from junior to senior level and the evidence that it is clearly a very good programme that needs to be supported, but that should be done in light of careful consideration of the reviews that have taken place.</p>

            <p eId="para_573">I specifically ask the Minister to ensure we would go a little further with the new programme. It is not sufficient that students complete their schooling at leaving certificate. We need to review where they go after that and how they are equipped to take up work or to go on to third level. That is important. We all know that fewer students going to UCD and the other universities come from disadvantaged areas and DEIS schools than come from more affluent areas. The challenge is for us to address that in conjunction with school completion. The issue is not only the rate of completion but that we raise the standard right through that level to give students equal opportunities. If a child is coming from a DEIS school or a disadvantaged area, their expectations starting out should be equal to a child coming from an advantaged area in terms of access to third level being an opportunity. Unfortunately, that does not always seem to be the case. They get to leaving certificate but do not seem to transition in the same way, and that needs to be the next step of school completion.</p>

            <p eId="para_576">That is a very progressive recommendation or insight. I have spent much time in my constituency, particularly in sections of Tallaght west as we call it, most recently with a group of principals and educational welfare officers or staff who came together around a big table to examine the issues with which they are dealing, much of which are around ensuring their students move successfully from junior to senior level and that this level is completed successfully. I and they would share the Deputy's deep commitment to working together in the communities with all the schools coming together, as has been demonstrated in Killinarden from my recent experience there, not only to ensure the students complete second level successfully but, as part of that process, that they have the ambition to go beyond that level to third level.</p>

            <p eId="para_599">I am in the process of providing observations on the domestic violence Bill, which was recently circulated to Departments by the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality for comment. I welcome the expansion of the existing provisions of domestic violence legislation. The Bill will have legal, operational and potential resource implications for Tusla, which is committed to all measures which protect children from abuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_600"> As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I am acutely aware of the prevalence of domestic violence and its impact on children and young people. The need for updated legislation in the area of domestic violence was highlighted most recently in the Barnardos report entitled, What’s the Harm? - A child centred response to domestic violence, published this month. The report notes that children are often the unseen but common victims of domestic violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_601"> It is crucial that we take all necessary measures to ensure that we have appropriate safeguards in place to protect our children from such abuse. A prevention and early intervention approach, rather than a crisis intervention approach, to child protection is at the core of our efforts.</p>
            <p eId="para_602"> Also, the Children First Act 2015 represents an important addition to the child welfare and protection system, as it will help to ensure that child protection concerns are brought to the attention of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, without delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_603"> The Act, when fully commenced at the end of 2017, will impose a statutory obligation on mandated persons to report concerns of harm over a defined threshold to Tusla without delay, and in a specified format.</p>
            <p eId="para_604"> The Act also places obligations on providers of relevant services to children, including domestic violence shelters, to keep children safe from harm while availing of their services. It will also oblige them to carry out risk assessments and prepare publicly-available child safeguarding statements, which set out the policies and procedures which the organisation has in place to mitigate the risks identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_605"> Tusla has statutory responsibility for the provision of care and protection for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013. I have provided Tusla with additional resources to fulfil this.</p>

            <p eId="para_606">I also commend Barnardos on the work it has done in this area. Unfortunately, in cases of domestic violence, the child often witnesses, even experiences, horrific situations with the very people the child loves and expects to be loved by. The damage to a child in such cases can be serious. We all want to see the legislation introduced as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_607"> The Minister said she expects the legislation to be enacted by the end of 2017. Will she clarify the timelines involved?</p>

            <p eId="para_608">The Children First Act 2015 will be fully commenced by 2017. Like the Deputy, I have spent time over the years in the shelters and centres dealing with domestic abuse for which Tusla is responsible. I am aware of the trauma experienced in such cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_609"> This matter is a high priority for me. Each year, I provide a performance statement to Tusla to identify my priorities. One of these is domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Existing research published by Tusla indicates that only one in ten of those who need access to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services is accessing them. These services have an important role in protecting those subjected to family and intimate violence, as well as providing resources for those impacted by sexual violence, to vindicate their right to health and advance their social inclusion. Tusla takes this role seriously. The decision to establish a national unit for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence was forward looking. It brings together services for forms of violence that are often interlinked and inclusive of, as the Deputy pointed out, the child and the adults.</p>

            <p eId="para_613">This question relates to the identification of various categories of children who might be at risk by virtue of family circumstances, institutional or other care.

            <p eId="para_614">The most vulnerable children are those living with families experiencing difficulties. These include families where parents have drug or alcohol problems, or suffer mental ill-health. Children who live in homes where they are exposed to domestic violence are also at risk. Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, deals immediately with emergency cases, where, for example, a child has been abandoned or is in immediate physical danger or at immediate risk of sexual abuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_615"> The Children First national guidance gives advice for notifying Tusla of situations where abuse is suspected. A range of professionals, including teachers, nurses, early years educators, gardaí and other health professionals who see children regularly, are in a good position to identify children at risk. Where someone has reasonable grounds for suspecting a child is being, or has been, abused, they are expected to immediately contact Tusla. The Children First Act 2015, once it is fully commenced, will place a statutory obligation on key professionals, or mandated persons, to report concerns of harm above a defined threshold to Tusla without delay. It is my intention that these provisions will be commenced by the end of 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_616"> Each referral received by Tusla is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team. Preliminary screening and initial assessments of concerns are undertaken to decide the best course of action for the child and his or her family. Over half of all referrals received by Tusla relate to welfare concerns and its policy is to refer these to the relevant family and community support services. If it seems that the problem relates to abuse of the child, the child protection pathway is followed.</p>
            <p eId="para_617"> At the end of June 2016, a total of 13,983 child welfare concerns and 9,587 child protection concerns had been received by Tusla since the beginning of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_618">I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply. In the absence of the full implementation of the legislation and in light of the fact that some provisions will not be enforced until the end of 2017, is she satisfied that, in the interim, adequate provision is in place to ensure that nobody will fall between the cracks and that situations which may not be in a child’s interests will be capable of being addressed?</p>

            <p eId="para_619">A couple of weeks ago, I chaired the first interdepartmental group whose responsibility it is to ensure and oversee the commencement of the Children First Act in 2017. Many of them had been around that table before with regard to the development and implementation of the Children First guidelines. They are familiar with it from an interdepartmental perspective in terms of the responsibilities they have and the ways in which they move those through their own Departments and out to the various agencies and organisations that are responsible to them and that provide the protection of children. The work is going on and I am satisfied it is the case that we are on a pathway to ensuring all mandated persons are trained and know their responsibility in order to report to Tusla.</p>

            <p eId="para_623">My question relates to a request from a group of survivors from the mother and baby homes because they find it offensive that the word "home" is used to describe something that was an institution. They were hoping there might be some move on removing that word "home" in whatever way that could happen.</p>

          <speech by="#KatherineZappone" eId="spk_288" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Katherine Zappone<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_624">I am aware of the request by the group in question to remove the word "home" from the arrangements for the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes and certain related matters and to replace it with the word "institution". When the term "home" is used to describe institutions such as mother and baby homes, it may not sit easily with some given the general perception and understanding that this word generates in the minds of the majority of people. For this reason, I appreciate the emotional impact of using this word instead of more a generic term such as "institution", which I understand the group may consider more acceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_625"> It is important to emphasise the commission is a statutory entity legally established by Government order. The language used must be viewed in the context of the requirements of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004. The Act is the backdrop for the commission’s work. Its general functions, powers, procedures and protections are laid down in this enabling legislation. If the language used in the order were too vague or did not use the terminology in use at the time these institutions were in being, it could delay or potentially undermine the work of the commission. Changing the commission's name would require an amendment to the Government order and I have no plans to make such an amendment at this time. Making such a change when the commission is more than halfway through its work would risk creating confusion among those who have already contributed to the investigation or who may plan to do so in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_626"> It is my hope that this commission's work will help us all come to a better understanding of how society treated mothers and children in these homes and how attitudes, policy and legislation have changed over the period.</p>

            <p eId="para_627">I appreciate the Minister's answer. I understand the legality of it. Nobody would want the process of the investigation to be slowed in any way because it has been such a long time coming. At least we have the opportunity today to draw attention to the fact that the word "home" has certain connotations. It is a place where one feels safe and belongs. It is a place of laughter and joy and a place where there is a great sense of supportive and loving relationships. These institutions were anything but those safe, supportive places we associate with the word "home". There were mothers and children who did not feel welcome, safe or respected in those places and whose lives were destroyed. For many the trauma still lives today. I appreciate where the Minister is coming from and her empathy and understanding of the situation. Even addressing it today has been a positive engagement.</p>

            <p eId="para_628">I thank the Deputy for drawing attention to this. I share her empathy and commitment. I will say a little bit more about the use of the word "home" because it is important that we put a spotlight on this now. In light of the issues raised by this group, what I have been trying to say is that, by definition, legal instruments are technical in nature and the language used must be precise. I understand the sensitivity of using the word "home" when the social values we normally associate with home may not fully reflect the experiences of former residents in these institutions. Former residents who are in a position to share their experiences with the commission will greatly assist to ensure society has a clear understanding of the reality of life in these institutions. I encourage former residents and others with relevant information to contact the commission in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_629">The naming issue might seem like a small matter but it is important to the group that brought it to our attention. Coming up to Christmas, we are very conscious of home and the various Christmas songs such as "Driving home for Christmas". It is important that we make the point today. I will refer to a group which met the Minister's predecessor, the former Deputy and now Senator James Reilly. They are the mixed race group, some of whom were in these mother and baby homes. Their suffering was even more extreme because they were mixed race. They had additional layers of suffering, abuse, name-calling and undermining when compared to children who were not of mixed race. If there are opportunities when the reports are coming in, we should constantly keep in mind that these were not homes as we understand homes. They were institutions.</p>

Their evidence was very powerful and impactful. I hope some of them were in the position to offer testimony and to bear witness to the commission. It is important and, as the Deputy has said, it demonstrates the different ways in which the experience of being in that home is impacted by the different identities and historical backgrounds that people bring into the context of that institution. I acknowledge their work and advocacy.</p>

            <p eId="para_639">Both the Minister and Deputy Jan O'Sullivan referred to the Barnardos campaign, What's the Harm? It was a very powerful campaign. The following are quotes from the document, "I know it’s my fault when Mammy and Daddy fight.

            <p eId="para_640">The campaign contains some harrowing stories and Barnardos deserves to be commended on highlighting them. In 2015, more than 16,300 incidents of domestic violence against women were disclosed during contacts with Women's Aid direct services. In the same year, 616 incidents of sexual abuse were disclosed to the services, including 212 rapes. As the Minister is aware, children are victims in all this. A €4 million EU fund is available to each member state to raise awareness of domestic violence and the State has not drawn this money down. I ask that the Minister call on her colleagues to avail of the funding and ring-fence it to highlight the plight of children as victims of domestic violence.</p>

            <p eId="para_641">I have reviewed the Barnardos report and its recommendations, many of which we anticipate having in train. For example, one of the recommendations is the ratification of the Istanbul convention. In the 2017 budget, some of the moneys I am providing to Tusla for the unit on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is to provide it with the resources to prepare us for the ratification of the convention. In my direction to Tusla regarding prioritising this matter, we can move forward together in a more progressive manner in terms of our ways of responding to and working out these issues. I will refer the Deputy's identification of a potential fund to my officials and see if there is a possibility of accessing it.</p>

            <p eId="para_652">As the Deputy knows, we launched the access and inclusion model in 2016 and are in the process of rolling it out. There are seven levels of support. During the initial months, we got huge uptake and response to the model. The objective of the programme is to ensure children with any form of disability are able to participate in our free preschool settings and to change the culture in those centres. I launched the scheme several months ago in a centre in Tallaght where it was evident that the culture was already present. This has much to do with the values behind the private as well as community-based providers in the work they do. This is the first level of support and it goes all the way up to the higher levels of support where there are resources that can be applied for to provide direct and more intensive support to the child while he or she is in the provider's care.</p>
            <p eId="para_653"> There were some initial teething problems as are there are with the roll-out of any programme. Very significant resources have been provided for the support of parents, providers and practitioners, particularly in learning, training and providing on-site mentoring. The Deputy is aware of all those levels of support and there are what we hope are sufficient funds - it was a significant amount of money - for its full roll-out in 2017.</p>

            <p eId="para_654">I thank the Minister for her response. Her office and mine have had many communications regarding the access and inclusion model. My question was on levels six and seven of the model, where I have encountered problems. Constituents have brought to my attention the problems children with Down's syndrome have had accessing level six and level seven given that the supports at those levels had not been rolled out yet. The model is a step in the right direction. It should be all-inclusive. I welcomed it completely and I can understand why it would take so long to reach this stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_655"> My concern is that we are nearing Christmas and the child I would have thought about several weeks ago is still awaiting the support. It has not been delivered. We are waiting for another child in the crèche to be assessed and, hopefully, we will receive support for both children under the access and inclusion model. When does the Minister think it will be fully rolled out? Where are we looking at for complete delivery? Have we a timeframe based on which I can assure the parents that in a certain number of days or weeks it will be rolled out?</p>

            <p eId="para_660">I wish to raise issues regarding Garranbane national school, Dungarvan, County Waterford. It is probably best if I just read out a letter I received from the school principal, signed on behalf of the school's board of management, because it best outlines the issues facing the school.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_661"> Dear Mr. Cullinane,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_662"> The Board of Management and the school community of Garranbane National School require your assistance in approaching the Department of Education [and the Minister] on our behalf, to request that they grant full funding for the development of a safe school at Garranbane.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_663"> On the 16th May 2012, under the Prefab Rental Replacement Scheme, Garranbane N.S. received a grant for a standalone extension consisting of 4 x 80m2, 2 x 25m2 and 2 x 16m2 permanent rooms. Since then there has been several setbacks in proceeding with this build.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_664"> Initially Waterford County Council refused planning, this was as a result of objections lodged. An Bord Pleanála finally granted conditional planning permission to the school in 2013. The total cost of the project [...] is proposed to be €1,385,769.16. This greatly exceeds the Department of Education approved funding. The overrun in costs is due solely to the imposition of the conditions as set out by An Bord Pleanála.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_665"> The total funding approved [...] is €718,226.00 [which means the shortfall] is €667,543.16.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_666"> The BOM, staff and parents are very concerned, as in four years there has been no progress on the build and to date we have not received funding. We are situated in a unique hazardous unsuitable site for any school, on the fork of a road on a hillside between the N25 and a narrow local road the site of many traffic collisions. Our school currently presents numerous health and safety issues.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_667"> - In June 2014, the school was informed that there were major exceedances of lead in the water supply, even after a five minutes' flush. As it was the BOM belief that major work was soon to begin on the school, an external temporary drinking water tap was installed on the school grounds and no other structural work was done to the pipes. This single tap provides the only drinkable water on the school grounds for a population of more than 200.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_668"> - Asbestos hazards were found present throughout our school, in a report published in 2003, thus warning signs are posted throughout the school [...]</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_669"> - The main building was built in 1939 containing two classrooms. The enrolment at that time was approximately 100 pupils, our current enrolment is 196 [...] </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_670">- The sewage system that was installed at that time does not function adequately to cope with the increase in enrolment [...]</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_671"> - Several of our prefabs have leaks in the roofs and mould, mildew and mushrooms growing around the corners of ceilings. They are draughty and cold in winter and overheat in summer and yet children are expected to work in these conditions.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_672"> - One of the larger prefabs has several holes in the floor, where the floor has collapsed and which has had to be patched up temporarily to avoid injury.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_673"> - The staffroom catering for 14 adults and visitors is a converted cloakroom, extended in 2004 by the Board of Management.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_674"> - There are no cloakroom facilities in the main building. All coats are kept in small classrooms which makes movement around classrooms limited with such large pupil numbers, causing dampness/mildew, again [...] unsatisfactory for all children but especially those with asthma/chest conditions.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_675"> - Toilet facilities are inadequate and out-dated. In the main building 6 toilets cater for 100 children. Continuous problems with blockages [...]</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_676"> - The school is not accessible by wheelchair.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_677"> - All footpaths, playgrounds and pavements are cracked and broken [...]</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_678"> - The school is situated on a hillside and the forty-two steps up to school have no hand rails presenting a safety issue for all school users especially special needs children.</p>
            <p eId="para_679">The Minister will be able to understand from the letter all the problems with which the school must deal daily. I am sure he would not want it thought that any of them-----</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Richard Bruton)<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_684">I thank Deputy Cullinane for raising this issue. He is absolutely right that this project has had a very troubled history. I have had discussions with his constituency colleague and my ministerial colleague, Deputy John Halligan, about the situation. The school was selected for inclusion in the Department's prefab replacement scheme in 2012, as Deputy Cullinane said. The approval was for four mainstream classrooms and four ancillary spaces to be delivered by way of a stand-alone structure on the site. The commensurate level of funding for a project of this scale was sanctioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_685"> The project was devolved for delivery to the board of management, which appointed a consultant to design and deliver the project. This was therefore a devolved project intended to speed up the process but, as the Deputy knows, the difficulties then ensued. A critical role for the school authority in a devolved building project is to ensure both adherence to the scope of the approved work and the cost control for the approved spend. Failure in either area inevitably leads to delays. External matters outside the board of management's control, such as the need to obtain planning permission and all that this may entail, will also impact the timelines for delivery of the project, which is exactly what happened in this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_686"> While there were issues with adherence to the approved scope of the works, the planning permission process was particularly difficult due to the nature of the site and with traffic management issues on and extraneous to the site. This resulted in at least one request for further information from the local authority to the board of management that the Department is aware of. Overall, this process took much longer than is usual and further difficulties were to ensue in that the planning permission granted was subsequently appealed to an An Bord Pleanála by third parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_687"> An Bord Pleanála eventually granted planning permission but attached onerous planning conditions to a range of issues including site works, traffic management, pick-up and set-down areas, car parking, etc. The school's proposals to deal with these issues were to be agreed with the local authority before the project could proceed. This involved another piece of significant work for the project. For example, another range of surveys were required to be carried out on the site such as geo-technical surveys, the cost of which were met by the Department. Interactions were also necessary with the local authority to develop and agree the proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_688"> When proposals were ultimately agreed with the local authority, the cost estimate for the project almost doubled from the original cost approval. Accordingly, the Department sought details of the proposals in question and spent some time obtaining satisfactory explanations. In the meantime, the school tendered the project, seeking additional funding based on the tenders received. In the absence of satisfactory responses to the cost escalation, the Department was not in a position to approve the funding uplift. That tender process is now out of time under public procurement procedures and is defunct.</p>
            <p eId="para_689"> Having received satisfactory explanations for the cost overrun in more recent times, the Department is now prepared to allow the project to be retendered and it has informed the school of this in writing, with clear instructions on how to properly complete the process and the junctures at which it must interact with the Department throughout the process to ensure that it runs smoothly.</p>
            <p eId="para_690"> The matter is now in the hands of the school. The Department is committed to the delivery of the project and strongly urges the board of management to focus its energies and resources on putting the retendering process in train as quickly as possible so that the project can go to site as early as possible in the new year.</p>
            <p eId="para_691"> In the intervening period, the school may apply for emergency works funding to deal with any access issues it might have at the school, provided this work will not be aborted when the main project is delivered. This is a matter for the board to discuss with its consultant, bearing in mind that the rate and pace of delivery of a large-scale project for the school rests firmly with the board of management.</p>

            <p eId="para_692">I welcome the Minister's reply. I wonder about the timelines involved. I received this letter from the school on 12 December, and it does not mention that the Department got back in contact with the school to let it know that it could re-tender. Maybe this happened after that date. I will refer back to the school to find out, but contact would be welcome. I assume this would still cause a delay, but the question then is the difference between the actual cost and the initial cost. Is the Minister saying that when a school retenders, it can now do so for the actual cost of carrying out the works, which I think is €600,000 more in this case?</p>
            <p eId="para_693">Is that the position? I am seeking clarity on that point.</p>

            <p eId="para_694">I do not have the exact date on which the school was informed, but on 24 November the Department was satisfied that the information on the scope of the works outlined was necessary and it was in a position to re-tender. I am unsure what time elapsed after that until the school was notified.</p>
            <p eId="para_695"> The Department has excluded nothing from the scope of the works being re-tendered for. The scope is the same as for the original works. Obviously, as the tender proceeds, the Department will have to be satisfied with the way in which the tendering process is being conducted and so on, as I outlined in my earlier reply. However, nothing has been deleted from the project that would undermine its value to the school community.</p>

            <p eId="para_696">According to figures from the Irish National Teachers Organisation this morning, only 36 substitute teachers were available nationally on its SubSearch facility today. This compares with an average daily total of 400 in previous years. Today's figures would not cater for the necessary cover for Tallaght, let alone the whole country.</p>
            <p eId="para_697"> The shortage of substitute teachers has been a matter of grave concern to principals throughout the country since the October mid-term break as well as to teachers. Indeed, we now have teachers offering to come in under the weather, as it were, rather than having a class broken up and distributed among the other classes in the school. This poses particular difficulties for teachers in one, two and three-teacher schools. It is especially difficult in smaller towns and cities and rural areas. It is a serious headache for principals.</p>
            <p eId="para_698"> One principal described the situation to me. She said that recently she had three sick colleagues and another was on a pre-arranged course day. All three absent teachers were on certified sick leave. She made more than 20 calls to her own personal list of substitutes but no one was available. She eventually sourced a teacher through the INTO SubSearch facility, but that teacher was on her way to a medical appointment with a sick parent. No substitutes were available through the Irish Primary Principals Network TextaSub facility. This resulted in two of the classes being distributed throughout the school, with one class having 39 children for the day. She also had to use two learning support staff members to cover these classes on the day, resulting in potential disruption to children with special educational needs. That principal set out clearly the difficulties the lack of substitution arrangements or facilities can have for people.</p>
            <p eId="para_699"> The shortage of substitutes is having a serious impact on teaching principals as they are increasingly unable to avail of the principal release days. Such days are vital to them for administrative and leadership planning roles in their schools. This is a consequence of the lack of substitute cover. It is also impacting on the ability of teachers to participate in continuing professional development for the same reason.</p>
            <p eId="para_700"> There is a real danger that the substitute shortage will quickly have an impact on learning outcomes. We are all rather proud of the OECD programme for international student assessment report and the standings published earlier this week. They show that we have improved to become the third-best performing nation in the world in terms of reading. This move was initiated by my now retired colleague, the former Minister for Education and Skills, Ruairí Quinn. Classes of up to 40 children on a regular basis will rapidly undermine this progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_701"> The reality is that the current situation is directly related to the issue of pay equalisation. Teachers are being actively recruited by Middle Eastern countries, even from the teacher education sections of our universities. Teachers from large urban areas are especially concerned at the high cost of living in comparison with their now reduced pay. Like staff in the medical sector, we are now in danger of losing a generation of teachers who have been educated at considerable expense to taxpayers.</p>
            <p eId="para_702"> The Minister urgently needs to consider the establishment of a national and regional supply panel, such as those in operation in other countries. This would give substitute teachers and schools some degree of certainty in respect of their positions. I am keen to hear the response of the Minister.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_703">I am aware that some schools are experiencing difficulty in recruiting adequately qualified substitute teachers. I am committed to examining all possible means of addressing that issue. In overall terms, however, the Department has no evidence of a recent or current shortage of primary teachers. There are many different variables that affect the supply and demand for teachers in our schools, such as the number of new graduates, the number of retirees, Government policy on the pupil-teacher ratio and so on. Deputy Burton is aware of these factors.</p>
            <p eId="para_704"> In 2015, a one-year reduction in the number of newly qualified teachers graduating from the higher education institutions materialised due to the reconfiguration and extension of the programme of initial teacher education from three to four years. This may have contributed to a reduction in the supply of teachers at primary level. A little over 3,500 graduate teachers registered with the Teaching Council last summer. Another important factor to take into account in this area is that the entire thrust of policy under the previous Government, in particular the relevant Ministers at the time, Mr. Quinn and Deputy O'Sullivan, was to ensure that to the greatest extent possible young teachers at the start of their careers, including unemployed teachers, were given priority when it came to recruiting substitute teachers. Obviously, that is putting some pressure on supply. In recent years, with the improving economic environment, we have been able to step up the pace of recruitment of teachers. This September we recruited 2,260 new teachers. Next September we intend to recruit 2,400, more than double the number possible in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_705"> The Department considers it important that the supply of teachers with the required qualifications is adequate to meet demand at primary and post-primary level. The Teaching Council Act gives a specific statutory role to the Teaching Council to advise in that respect. The council has been asked to consider the matter of teaching supply. The council has set up a technical working group. The working group is examining a series of issues. The aims of the working group include developing and piloting a model of teacher supply that would seek to ensure a sufficient supply of teachers to meet demand; formulating advice on teacher supply for consideration by the Teaching Council; considering the analysis of data held by the council and the Department in developing the pilot model of teacher supply; and generating policy recommendations on teacher supply for consideration by the Teaching Council. In parallel with that reform, the relevant education stakeholders were consulted regarding the emerging recommendations during the process. Feedback from this group was considered by the working group in its deliberations and in the development of the final report. I expect the report to be published in due course. The report includes recommendations specific to the supply of teachers. I expect the Department to be in a position to progress consideration of the report in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_706"> I will specifically ask that the issue of substitute supply be examined in that context because of emerging difficulties. We will look at various suggestions that might ease the short-term pressure.</p>
            <p eId="para_707"> The question of whether a panel will be established was put forward. At the moment there is a good network that uses rapid website communication. As the Deputy rightly pointed out, it is not always successful. Whether the Department could improve on that would be an issue that would have to be considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_708">I thank the Minister for his reply. A sense of urgency and an acceptance that this is a problem is required. It is a disturbing issue for school principals and management. It is especially difficult if a number of teachers become sick or if, in the longer term, a number of staff become pregnant and require maternity leave. The INTO has been looking for a national and regional supply panel. Such a facility would have to operate regionally with the use of social media or some other information technology-based contact base. It is possible to have a rapid flow of information to and from school principals to the panel in their area. The problem is especially acute in smaller schools where there is a teaching principal, as opposed to an administrative principal in a larger school where that principal does not have to teach as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">There are real problems in such schools if one or more of the teachers is missing. While it can be exciting for kids for a day or two when two classes are put together, the kind of uncertainty this generates is not great from an educational planning perspective. In fact, it can be a sign of the total absence of planning. I appreciate that the Minister is in the hands of the Teaching Council to some extent. I am disappointed by the slow development of the final report which the Minister has said he expects "to be published in due course". Would it be possible to put a timeframe on this? The Minister is famous for action plans. As we approach Christmas, can we have an action plan that will see regional and supply panels established by the end of January? It is not a difficult principle. I expect the Minister to respond to it positively.</p>

            <p eId="para_710">The Teaching Council is considering the longer-term issue of the future supply of all teachers, including substitute teachers. I accept that the restrictions which have been imposed on the recruitment of retired teachers could be re-examined as a short-term measure. There would have to be an assessment of whether a panel would work. Short-term opportunities tend to arise in this area at short notice. The question of whether any panel can facilitate an instant response will have to be considered. There are good websites that are often very successful, but at times there can be restrictions on local availability due to the nature of the positions on offer. There is a genuine difficulty in this respect. I will have a look at this issue, but I do not want to commit to having a solution when there is no immediate path here. We will assess what can be done. We will look at the various suggestions that have been made, including Deputy Burton's suggestion with regard to the INTO and the suggestions that have been made by management bodies, to see whether we can respond more effectively.</p>

            <p eId="para_711">The serious difficulties that exist on the N24 between Mooncoin and Carrick-on-Suir were highlighted at a meeting in Piltown community centre on Monday night which was attended by 500 local people from the surrounding areas. All of the people who attended the meeting, which was organised by the local priest, Fr. Moore, and a community activist, Robert Duggan, are interested in restoring safety along this stretch of roadway. There were ten white crosses behind the backs of those who addressed the packed audience at the meeting from the main table. Fr. Moore referred to the roadway in question as the "valley of death". When this road was being designed and constructed between 1995 and 2002, when it opened, there were constant difficulties with the National Roads Authority, NRA, as it was at the time, and the engineer on the project. Those who raised matters with regard to the road, including the local radio station, were often challenged legally so that they would stop doing so. This happened to me as a member of the local council at the time. To this day, nobody has officially opened the road. Everyone in this House knows that when money is spent on a road, some politician will cut the tape. I have nothing against that. Even though this road was funded through the NRA, it is the road that nobody wanted.</p>
            <p eId="para_712"> Every effort to get the NRA, and now Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to look at the road has failed. Money was allocated for an overpass on this stretch of road in 2012. Everyone has been demanding such an overpass since the road was originally designed, but those responsible have still not given in and provided it, despite many deaths and numerous accidents. Most of the accidents on this stretch of road are recorded by the local gardaí, but others are not even reported. This notorious piece of road, where two roads go into one, is the worst piece of engineering one will ever see. The firm line of wire going down the centre of the road is a danger to motorcyclists and pedestrians, as we heard the other night. Local people and others who want to travel in a certain direction on the road have to travel in the opposite direction so that they can turn back. It is unbelievable that such a road was funded and constructed by the NRA. If the NRA had taken account of the issues it ignored at that time, we would have a different, safer road now. It was only when a local farmer, Donal Norris, drove his cattle down this road that the NRA was forced to provide a safe underpass. He should not have had to encounter such difficulties as he sought to achieve his rights. It was absolutely shocking that he was treated in such a way by a State agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_713"> We are looking to the future now. We are asking for a complete redesign of the roadway in question. The redesign must take account of every single turn off the roadway and every single safety issue that has been raised with regard to it. We are asking for funding to be made available immediately in order that overpasses can be provided and the necessary work can be done.</p>

            <p eId="para_715">I thank Deputy McGuinness for raising this important Topical Issue matter. As he knows, I will meet Deputies from the area in question tomorrow. This is a matter that concerns them all. I know the Deputy has raised it on their behalf today. Before I refer to the scripted reply, I think it is reasonable for me to say that the Deputy has made a fairly compelling case. I intend to tell the Deputies at tomorrow's meeting that I am planning to ask Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to respond to them and to report to me on this road purely in terms of safety. I think that is the case Deputy McGuinness has made. I hear many pleas for roads projects on Topical Issue matters, but it is unusual for me to hear such a compelling case from a safety perspective. If the statistics mentioned by the Deputy are right, and they may well be, I think this should be looked at. There is no adequate answer when there are road deaths, or when there is a lack of road safety. Perhaps the road is not as bad as the Deputy has suggested, but if it is that bad, he deserves to get a serious and considered response.</p>
            <p eId="para_716"> As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I am responsible for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme. The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for TII under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. The assessment and prioritisation of individual projects are matters for TII in the first instance, within its capital budget, in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act 1993. Therefore, decisions relating to the N24 are operational matters for TII. As I have said, I will ask TII for a direct response to what the Deputy has had to say. The capital plan that was published in September 2015 outlined the Government's proposed transport investment priorities to 2022. The transport element of the plan was framed by the conclusions reached in my Department’s strategic investment framework for land transport. This report highlighted the importance of maintaining and renewing transport infrastructure and making targeted investments to address particular bottlenecks and critical safety issues. The capital plan provides €6 billion for investment in the roads network in the period to 2022, with €4.4 billion earmarked for the maintenance and strengthening of the existing extensive network throughout the country and €1.6 billion earmarked for new projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_717"> Allowing for the commitments relating to public private partnership projects, the balance available for new projects within the available capital envelope is limited. As Minister, I have to work within the annual allocations set out in the plan. In this context, the capital plan provides for a gradual build-up in capital funding from the current relatively low base towards the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works. It will take some years under the capital plan to restore steady-state funding levels for land transport. There will have to continue to be a focus on the maintenance and renewal of infrastructure. There will be a significant ramp-up in funding from 2020. This will facilitate the construction of the road improvement projects included in the plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_718"> While available funding is not sufficient to address all the demands for improvement schemes, including schemes such as the upgrade of the N24, by the end of the plan period, I expect that capital funding for the road network will be back up to the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works in the future. On the possibility of additional funding within the plan period, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform indicated in his budget speech that he is bringing forward the capital plan review. There is a strong case for additional funding for the transport sector, which I will make robustly.</p>

            <p eId="para_720">Again, the reason for raising this issue is not because it has just arisen. This is an issue that has gone on since 1995, right through the course of the design and building of the road in question. It is so dangerous that, as I said, 500 people attended the meeting that was held. I am asking the Minister whether he will come and examine that stretch of roadway. In a contribution made earlier by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, in respect of a parliamentary question, she said that she indicates her priorities to Tusla. I am asking the Minister, Deputy Ross, in the context of his priorities, which are safety on our roads and representation for local communities, whether he will agree to say to Transport Infrastructure Ireland that he wants the funds allocated to this project.</p>
            <p eId="para_721"> Before he does that, will he come to visit the stretch of roadway involved so he can see for himself the plight of the local community and the desperate need for the road to be redesigned? It is not good enough to have an analysis or a report. We know what has happened. The Minister should listen to the local community and respond to it by ensuring that safety is restored by investment in the road. These are local people who use the road every day going to school or to work in Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir, as well as others who use it by way of connection along the route.</p>
            <p eId="para_722"> The money was there for an overpass and it was emphasised at the meeting to which I refer that had that money been spent when it was allocated in 2012, it would have relieved some of the issues. Two overpasses are needed. A new, modern, safe approach to the design of that road would eliminate the issues confronting this local community and people in the surrounding areas once and for all.</p>

            <p eId="para_723">I am aware that there was a recent accident at Tower Hill junction between Piltown and Fiddown. This junction was the subject of an accident improvement project a number of years ago and the safety section of Transport Infrastructure Ireland is, as the Deputy knows, reviewing the junction in conjunction with the county council to see if further improvements can be implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_724"> We do need answers, if what the Deputy says is correct. Safety is obviously a top priority and it comes above improvements in the roads. It is imperative that we address this matter. I take the Deputy's point. I hope he will accept that I will certainly ensure that Transport Infrastructure Ireland reports to me as soon as possible on what he has said about safety, because that is something which has to go to the top of the pile before road improvements.</p>
            <p eId="para_725"> As to whether I will come down to Kilkenny and have a look, I have known the Deputy for a very long time and this is the first occasion on which he has ever invited me down to Kilkenny, which is-----</p>

            <p eId="para_731">I thank the Chair for selecting this very important matter for discussion. I am disappointed that the senior Minister is not here but I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne.</p>
            <p eId="para_732"> In mid-November, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on health, Deputy Kelleher, made two impassioned speeches in this House following a meeting with members of the Scoliosis Advocacy Network who are campaigning very actively on behalf of their children and other children. Deputy Kelleher read a number of case studies into the record of the House and I want to update the Minister of State on one of them. Mary, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, was diagnosed at age ten in May 2013 with a 40° spinal curve at Mullingar General Hospital. She was referred to Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin for urgent review by a specialist. She was obliged to wait 11 months before she could see a consultant. During this 11-month wait, Mary's curve deteriorated from 40° to 90°. At that point, she required urgent surgery to halt the progress of her spinal curve. In fact, she required two significantly invasive surgeries and would need to have some of her ribs removed. This was due to the long wait and the deterioration in her condition. She finally made it to theatre 17 months after her diagnosis for her first surgery and her curve was well over 100° at that point. Unfortunately, Mary now finds herself back on a waiting list for surgery to correct a failed fusion and there is no date in sight for this procedure.</p>
            <p eId="para_733"> Last week the Kilkenny scoliosis advocacy group wrote to update me on Mary's case and explained the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_734">The pin which had become dislodged months ago has now moved and become septic. This child should not have been left wait months and months for this surgery. The fact is that the only way our children can access surgery is when they are in fact in a health crisis. This is shameful and of course we will be highlighting it with Minister Simon Harris. Before I left Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin with my son after his surgery, I was told if a rod breaks or dislodges its ok. Don't present to Our Lady's Children's Hospital but go to a GP. This advice is totally unacceptable but indicative of the service our children are receiving. There has been a normalisation and acceptance of poor care and after care by teams involved in our children's care.</p>
            <p eId="para_735"> I am not going to stand in the House today and play politics with this issue but I have promised these women face to face that I will continue to raise these issues on their behalf. I understand the Minister has visited many hospitals around the country since taking over a very difficult brief, and that he is taking on his Ministry with determination and vigour, which is encouraging. However, these women are acutely aware of the current situation facing those on scoliosis waiting lists and this is a very damning assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_736"> I acknowledge that commitments have been made for new theatres in Crumlin but the crux of the issue is that the longer we wait for policies to be implemented, the more children will be subjected to severe, long-term and, in some cases, irreparable damage while they wait. July 2017 has been stated as a timeline for the recruitment of additional consultants and for various policies to be implemented but we must be able to speed up this process. I have also heard statements about the difficulties surrounding recruitment but we must implement a more imaginative approach to attracting staff, particularly theatre nurses, on a short-term basis for these specific cases. We could recruit paediatric theatre nurses and additional consultants for several months to ensure extra capacity in the theatres in Crumlin to address this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_737"> I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's thoughts on this potential strategy and I would like to ask her what progress has been made in reducing waiting times since we raised these issues one month ago.</p>

            <p eId="para_738">I thank Deputy Aylward for raising this matter. I am pleased to take this opportunity to update the House on scoliosis services. Long waiting times for scoliosis surgery are not acceptable, and the Department is working closely with the Health Service Executive, HSE, to address services pressures, particularly in Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin, which is the largest provider of scoliosis surgery for children and young people.</p>
            <p eId="para_739"> Additional funding of €1.042 million was allocated under the 2015 service plan to increase capacity at Crumlin, and further resources of €0.987 million were allocated under the 2016 service plan for orthopaedics and trauma to address service needs in Crumlin. The HSE is actively working with the hospital to advance the development of orthopaedic services, including spinal surgery services, which will have a positive effect on access for scoliosis patients. All patients on the waiting list are clinically triaged by a consultant as to their acuity and surgeries are carried out in order of clinical priority and waiting time, in order to provide an equitable service.</p>
            <p eId="para_740"> The number of consultant orthopaedic surgeons at Crumlin has increased by 1.5 whole time equivalents. The construction of a new orthopaedic theatre in Crumlin has been completed. This new facility will provide capacity for additional scoliosis activity in 2017. However, the use of this theatre is dependent on the recruitment of additional theatre nurses. While the hospital continues to successfully recruit nursing staff, balancing this with attrition rates, maternity leave and sick leave continues to present a challenge. The Children's Hospital Group is exhausting every recruitment and retention avenue available to it, including international recruitment, and is proactively working on nurse recruitment to support the opening of the new theatre.</p>
            <p eId="para_741"> In order to improve access in the short term, the HSE winter initiative 2016-17 includes €2 million provided specifically for surgery for scoliosis patients. To date under this initiative, 54 patients have been treated, have received appointments for treatment or been removed from the waiting list through clinical validation. This includes nine additional patients who have had their surgery at Crumlin and eight who have been given treatment dates. In addition, 23 patients have had surgery, or are scheduled for surgery, at Blackrock Clinic. Crumlin is continuing to work through a capacity plan to schedule patients that do not meet the age and clinical criteria for surgery in another hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_742"> In an effort to address inpatient and outpatient spinal orthopaedic waiting lists at Tallaght hospital, an additional half-time consultant was appointed in late 2014. In 2015, some €1 million was provided by the HSE to fund 100 degenerate spinal surgeries at Tallaght. An additional consultant is due to also start work at the hospital in July 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_743"> The Department will continue to work with the HSE and the relevant hospitals to ensure improvements in access to spinal surgery. The Children's Hospital Group is engaging with the scoliosis advocacy groups on developing a partnership approach to the design and planning of services for children with scoliosis. This provides an opportunity for them to work with hospitals and consultants in the design and planning of paediatric scoliosis services.</p>

            <p eId="para_744">I thank the Minister of State for her response and I hope she will appreciate that I am not trying to be political in any way, shape or form on this particular issue but we must do everything we can in the coming weeks and months to shorten these waiting lists. These children and their families are enduring too much pain and suffering as a result of the current waiting times and I urge the Minister of State and top officials in the Department to approach this issue with all of their ability and innovative thinking.</p>
            <p eId="para_745"> We have to get creative. This is life-changing surgery and access to the surgery is the crux of this issue. We must get the theatres adequately staffed to increase the capacity and reduce the waiting times. The longer we leave these children, the worse they get. They start off with a 10o or 20o degree of curve. If they are treated at that stage, it will save money on major surgery later on. More money should be put into early diagnosis and treatment for these children before the situation becomes critical. In Mary's case, she was left for 12 months and her curve went from 40o to 100o degrees before the surgery was carried out. If that child had been seen when the curve was at 40o, it would have saved a lot of money for the State and a lot of pain for the child. Many children are coming into the system and there is a waiting list, although I do not have the figure here. I got it from the advocacy group. I ask the Minister of State to do everything she can to take these children in early and have them seen to early so that the curves in their spines will not get too serious before they are treated. </p>

            <p eId="para_746">Speaking personally, as a mother and a grandmother, no child should be left waiting for surgery for such a long time. Unfortunately, as the Deputy knows, in the past matters were not as fluid as we would have liked them to be, but funding is now beginning to build up again and the Minister is doing his utmost to ensure that staff are provided. The HSE has tried to recruit people, especially in specialties around paediatric orthopaedic services and theatre nurses. We are trying to face this challenge together. I am delighted that the Minister has engaged with the parents' advocacy group. I will relay the Deputy's wealth of understanding of this serious situation to him. Like any parent, I do not want to see any child suffer.</p>
            <p eId="para_747"> I hope we will be able to address this early in the new year. It is not that people have not tried but that the staff has not been there to facilitate the opening of the new theatre in Crumlin. As somebody who lives quite close to the hospital, I know the wonderful work done there on a daily basis for young and older children.</p>

        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_340">
          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_752">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> At a recent Easter Rising commemoration ceremony in National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, suggested that this centenary year has led to a new cultural revival in Ireland, stating that it is a "revival that demands that we put arts and culture at the centre of public policy, in a way that, frankly, we have failed to do until now". The same Taoiseach, together with the Ministers, Deputies Humphreys and Donohoe, only last week launched a cultural Ireland initiative, a plan focused upon and emphasising the importance of arts, culture and music for the next five years, with an emphasis on children learning music from the age of five onwards notable in its objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> The Taoiseach reminded us in that keynote address at NUIG that many of those who sacrificed their lives to establish our political freedom were writers, poets and musicians. They were artists who were motivated as much by cultural concerns as anything else. If the Taoiseach is correct, and I believe he is dead right in this matter, then, to date, we politicians have let down the artistic community of Ireland in a big way, and none more so than the Irish musical community that we are representing today with this Bill. Why? It is because in the Ireland of 2016, 100 years after musicians like Eamonn Ceannt made the ultimate sacrifice and died for the country's cultural independence, Irish music, of all genres, is no longer deemed worthy to be played on Irish radio during daylight hours. I am here to urge the representatives of all parties to help me bring back Irish music from night-time to prime time on our airwaves from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. If we are serious about protecting our musical culture rather than paying lip-service, the only way it can be achieved is through legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> A common concern among the politicians who attended the musical community’s lobbying day for a music quota in this building at the end of September was that the amendment Bill that I am seeking to introduce might contravene EU competition law. However, this is not so. The EU, believe it or not, sanctioned an Irish music quota as far back as the 1990s, soon after Mr. Niall Stokes took over the chair of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI. That was at a time when, according to Mr. Stokes, "very little Irish music was being played on Irish radio and in particular on the big independent stations". He succeeded in winning the support of the board of the BAI for the introduction of a 30% Irish music quota. However, when the independent Irish radio sector got wind of Mr. Stokes's initiative, it made a complaint to the European Commission that the measure was anti-competitive. It is hard to believe that a body of Irish broadcasters would mount a campaign against their fellow citizens working in music, but it is on record that this is what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> In a hard-hitting article published in <i>Hot Press</i> magazine and covering an Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI, conference that took place in 2008, Mr. Stokes outlined how he and the chief executive of the BAI, Mr. Michael O’Keeffe, who still holds that position, engaged in detailed negotiations with Brussels and prevailed on the basis of a cultural exception. Mr. Stokes wrote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_757">It took some persuasion, but it was accepted eventually by the EC that music was an essential part of Ireland’s culture and its national resource - and therefore that it was valid to put measures in place to protect it. And we agreed a definition with the EC of what constituted Irish music.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">The acceptance by the EU of the wording that Niall Stokes, Michael O’Keeffe and EU officials hammered out for what constitutes Irish music back then demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that the EU is not opposed to the principle that Ireland is entitled to introduce legislation to protect our musical culture. Though there is no clear reason given in Mr. Stokes's <i>Hot Press</i> piece of 2008 for why the amendment was not implemented. The remainder of his article offers stark clues as to who may have been responsible for ensuring that the introduction of an Irish music quota back in the 1990s did not take place. Referring to a <i>Hot Press</i>-run Irish music seminar that took place in the RDS in October 2007, Mr. Stokes described a shocking moment when the then head of Today FM, Mr. Willie O’Reilly, pointed an accusatory finger at Niall and criticised him for seeking to introduce a 30% quota for home-grown music on Irish radio, suggesting that a far more reasonable position had been advanced by Mr. Dave Pennefather of Universal Music, who had asked that 5% of air time be devoted to Irish music. The staggeringly low value that the then head of the Irish division of one of the world’s largest international record companies put on Irish music, and the endorsement of it by the leading independent Irish radio sector boss, may explain why a little further on in the same article, Mr. Stokes wrote, "In the early 1990s, the big urban commercial radio stations were playing as little as 3% Irish music". Mr. Stokes’s condemnation of this figure is blistering, "It amounted to nothing short of a scandalous disregard for Irish music".</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> If a one-time chairman of the board of the BAI can be outraged to this extent by the manipulating ways of the independent Irish radio sector in collusion with multinational interests, and be outwitted by them, then surely this is a clear indication that nothing short of legislative change in this area has to be implemented in order to enshrine the principle in law. lf the House does not believe that things are as bad as they are for Irish music of all the genres - including rock, pop, indie pop and everything else - then it should take what Mr. Louis Walsh, the Svengali of Irish popular music, had to say recently when he observed that it is a scandal that one of the Dublin stations to be most recently granted a licence plays no Irish music at all. The bottom line for commercial enterprises such as independent radio stations and the multinational powers that feed and shape them is monetary profit, but they cannot be allowed to run roughshod over a nation’s culture in the pursuit of high ratings and advertising revenue. That is where the Government comes in. As elected representatives, it is our duty to protect and nourish the creative spirit of our citizens. As the Taoiseach has rightly admitted, "we have utterly failed them in this regard". Even if the French had not shown us the way, and we all know what they have done, we Irish are operating at a complete disadvantage compared with all our European counterparts because radio audiences throughout Europe still have an appetite to hear a high percentage of their music in their mother tongues. This automatically translates into air time and placement on playlists for their musical communities. The most recent statistics for Ireland show that that a mere three Irish acts registered in the top 50 songs played on Irish radio in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> Let us look at the Canadian system. It is one of the best regimes for promoting and supporting indigenous artists' music and recordings. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, CRTC, requirements deriving from the Broadcasting Act of Canada mean that radio and television broadcasters must air a certain percentage of content that was at least partly written, produced, presented or otherwise contributed to by a person from Canada. The percentage of air time devoted to Canadian music increased from 25% to 30% in the 1980s and to 35% in 1998. They use the MAPL system to define and identify Canadian content. Some exemptions apply in genres with a limited number of recordings, for example, jazz. We could do the same thing here. We could have a quota. If we got to 30%, we would be absolutely thrilled, but we are not getting to that. The percentages in Canada must be met between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. rather than during off-peak hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> MAPL is an acronym for the criteria involved: "M" stands for music that must be composed entirely by a Canadian; "A" stands for artist, and the music or lyrics must be performed principally by a Canadian; "P" stands for performance, and the musical selection must consist of a performance that was recorded wholly in Canada, performed wholly in Canada or broadcast live in Canada; and "L" stands for lyrics that are written entirely by a Canadian. There are special cases in which a musical selection may qualify and they are set. The final criteria was added in 1991 to accommodate Bryan Adams's album, "Waking Up the Neighbours", which unusually did not meet the Canadian content, CanCon, standard, despite every track being co-written and performed by a Canadian artist. Adams had recorded the album mainly in England. Although some recording work was done in Canada, no track on the album qualified under the MAPL criteria. Adams also collaborated on the writing of the album with British record producer, Mr. Robert John Lange, with both being credited as co-writers of words and music of every cut on the album. As a result, no song on the album featured either music or lyrics written entirely by a Canadian. Therefore, none of the songs on the album qualified under the MAPL criteria. All of this meant that no track on the album qualified under what were the existing CanCon rules. Had Adams and Lange simply agreed to credit one party with 100% of the music and the other with 100% of the lyrics, all of their collaborations would have counted under the CanCon rules. However, the Canadians got over that and devised a solution. That is the last time what I have outlined happened. The system in question could be introduced in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> A nation is surely defined by its culture. It is difficult to fathom why we Irish have allowed one of our greatest cultural assets, our music and song, to be effectively banished from our prime-time radio airwaves in recent decades. It happened gradually and that is why we did not notice it, but happen it did. That is why the Irish music community has come here to support the introduction of legislation that would underpin an Irish music quota for commercial, State-owned or State-backed Irish radio. RTÉ is involved in this as well. It would bring Irish music of all genres back to our airwaves.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> Let us look back to the 1960s and 1970s. We are acutely aware of the music and artists that were promulgated during those halcyon days, with a plethora of sponsored programmes including those of Val Joyce, Brendan Balfe, Harry Thuillier, The Waltons and the Top 10 Show. All of that was on our national radio. Why do we not bring back those sponsored programmes to RTÉ Radio 1? They were daily promoting and supporting the latest artists that produced Irish records of all genres, including Joe Dolan and the Drifters, Brendan Bowyer, the Dixies, The Freshmen, Big Tom, Foster and Allen, Margo, Seán Ó Sé, Fiddler's Green and many hundreds more. Their song and music was heard in every home throughout the State. Just one incident comes to mind. My late mother listened assiduously to these programmes throughout the day as she did her housework. She learned the words of one song. I remember it well. It was called "Gentle Mother". At her knee, we learnt the words of that song. That goes to show how radio can influence and disseminate music and song.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> We appreciate the great value that mainstream popular music and culture has worldwide. We realise the great bonding effect that popular music and culture has had among nations throughout the world. We are strongly of the view that the legislative enactment of an Irish music quota will enhance rather than diminish our contribution to the vitality and purity of worldwide culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> During the course of this campaign, I have been extremely lucky to make contact with hundreds of musical artists, composers and managers, many of whom were people to whom I would have listened or about whom I would have read. I include in that Steve and Joe Wall of The Stunning, an iconic rock band of some fame. A few minutes listening to them was instructive and educational. It demonstrates that our focus is on all genres and types of music.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">There were various campaigns over the years to promote Irish musicians and their music but it all fell on deaf ears, apart from some great disc jockeys and shows that were committed to playing Irish music, mostly after 7 p.m. The situation has worsened. Steve Wall's words echo precisely what hundreds of other artists, many of them in the Gallery tonight, in all genres of music have relayed to me and confirmed as fact. People have told me of their experiences. I am reflecting what fellow musicians have told me, young and old, established or trying to get into the business, about how difficult it is to get out of the traps. Weasel words, half truths or downright lies should not be used to shield us from the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> One radio station told a member of an indie pop band that I know very well that his band would be excluded by my Bill but nothing could be further from the truth. His father rang me and was very upset but nothing could be further from the truth. That just goes to show what has been said about this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> Steve Wall said that between The Stunning and The Walls, he has spent thousands of euro making records in this country. T. R. Dallas said that one would not see change from €15,000 by the time one has paid the studio, sound engineers, musicians, graphic designers, pressing plants and printers. Once a recording is made, artists usually hire the services of a public relations company to present the single to radio stations. It is at this point that artists need guts of steel. After all the money that is spent on recording and public relations, the PR company prepares and aggregates a weekly update showing the response from radio stations. </p>
          <p eId="para_769"> We must explain to those running radio stations that Irish musicians are spending their hard-earned money in this country and not just on all of the services listed above. They also incur considerable expenses when they go on tour. They must pay for van hire and fuel, hire a crew, pay their wages and provide food and accommodation. T.R. Dallas said that he would usually pay five or six people when he goes on tour. When the Michael English dance band goes on tour, 15 people are involved. That is 15 wage packets and 15 people with jobs. Air play is the key to putting bums on seats and enabling music venues to open on Wednesday or Thursday nights, employing additional staff. Air play creates jobs. Steve Wall explained this to one radio station executive who had never considered it before but the station still did not play his single. </p>
          <p eId="para_770"> Steve Wall also acknowledged that the late 1980s into the 1990s was a great time for Irish music, mainly thanks to 2FM which played copious amounts of Irish music. Indeed, 2FM was the only show in town and Irish artists were all over the airwaves. They were also all over television during that time. We must acknowledge the efforts of Niall Stokes and the compelling case he makes. However, his calls have fallen on deaf ears which is why we are here tonight. Some Irish artists are afraid to speak out for fear of burning bridges. These are the facts emanating from the mouths of Irish musicians who, by any standards, have been successful in their chosen genres. It should be acknowledged that many musicians are here tonight and many more have supported the campaign for the implementation of this legislation, including Phil Coulter, Johnny Sheahan, Mick Foster, Tony Allen, Tom Allen, Peter Mooney, Danny Mc Carthy, Johnny Duhan, Frank Kilbride, Bernard Newman, Ollie Kennedy and a host of others. They have stated that their careers are nearly behind them but they are here tonight so that young musicians will have a future. They want to see the development of the next U2, Phil Lynnott, Christy Moore, Paul Brady or the Dubliners. I see that Deputy Ciaran Cannon, another good musician, is also in the Gallery. Phil Coulter said that if he wrote "The Town I Loved So Well" or "Scorn Not His Simplicity", Paul Brady wrote "The Island" or Johnny Duhan wrote "The Voyage" today, they would not get out of the traps. </p>
          <p eId="para_771"> Deputies are going to vote against this legislation tonight and by doing so they will ensure that the next generation of Irish musicians will not get out of the traps. I do not want to hear their mealy mouthed weasel words, suggesting that the legislation is regressive. Why not let the Bill go forward to Committee Stage to be sorted out? They are afraid because a few radio stations contacted them. Let us be honest about it and tell the truth. </p>
          <p eId="para_772"> There is a particular onus on RTE, as our national broadcaster, to ensure that Irish music and artists are promoted, particularly as it is in receipt of millions of euro from the television licence fee. RTE must be included in the legislation. I will acknowledge that in the past 12 months, Ryan Tubridy has given a number of acts good exposure on "The Late Late Show". Of course, he is a quick learner. When the tribute to Big Tom was broadcast, the programme had an audience of 1 million. Likewise, 1 million people watched the All Ireland Fleadh Cheoil on television. The fleadh was held in the beautiful town of Ennis and attracted over 300,000 people. Clearly, there is an audience for these acts and events when they are televised or broadcast. RTE will be included in this legislative amendment, notwithstanding what those who are against it would say. I have a copy of the Broadcasting Act 2009 in front of me and I know the section that is relevant. If my Bill needs an amendment to ensure that RTE is included, then I will amend it. </p>
          <p eId="para_773"> I am not claiming that the Bill is foolproof or perfect. I accept that agreeing a definition of Irish music presents a challenge but that challenge could be met in committee. This Bill should be referred to committee but cowardice prevails and bureaucrats are winning the day. That issue and others could be addressed by the collective wisdom of all our legislators. The people in the Gallery this evening are very disappointed. I am of the view that the Minister would like to support this Bill but he has been stymied. To say that I am disappointed is an understatement. However, my disappointment pales into insignificance when compared to the level of disappointment among musicians and artists at the attitude that has been displayed by the Government and by Fianna Fáil. If Fianna Fáil Deputies look at the Gallery tonight, they will see a number of their own loyal supporters, top class musicians who are shocked. They cannot believe that Fianna Fáil will not support this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> I acknowledge that some of the regional radio stations are working hard and playing a pivotal role in the promotion of Irish music. Indeed, I have no doubt that for every hour of music they play, at least 20 to 25 minute is devoted to Irish acts. As Tom Allen said to me, out of every ten records, they should play three or four that are Irish. I must pay credit to Tommy Marren, Paul Claffey and Gerry Lennon from Midwest Radio, Albert Fitzgerald, Will Faulkner, Joe Cooney and Paddy Duffy from Midlands Radio and Joe Finnegan, Frank Kilbride and Martin Donohoe of Shannonside Northern Sound. I am of the view that the implementation of a quota would present no difficulty for those radio stations. I spoke to some of the aforementioned presenters who wrote letters to various Deputies. </p>
          <p eId="para_775"> There are also excellent broadcasters in our national radio station, including Fiachna Ó Braonáin from the Hot House Flowers, who has an encyclopaedic knowledge of music, and John Creedon, but their shows are on too late at night. The music must be played between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. or between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. That is what is done in every other country but we are too cowardly. It is a shame. The prime time hours between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. is the right time to broadcast programmes that boost Irish artists across all of the genres. </p>
          <p eId="para_776"> Many independent radio stations contacted me about the fact that RTE is not included in the Bill. In my view, RTE is clearly caught by the legislation which only amends the principal Act of 2009 and section 114, subsection 2(a) is instructive in this regard. That said, I am prepared to amend the Bill so as to put the issue beyond doubt. </p>
          <p eId="para_777"> The disappointment among musicians is palpable. These people are going out and creating employment. At least 15 wage packets are generated by the likes of Nathan Carter, Michael English, Foster and Allen and others. It is a big industry. Stephen Travers, a former member of the Miami Showband, told me that there are 8,000 to 10,000 jobs involved here. Do Deputies have any concept of what is involved? Bands like the Miami Showband burst onto the scene because we had a radio station promoting them in the 1960s and the 1970s. There was "Spotlight" magazine and all sorts of avenues for promotion which I recall very well. We must give Irish musicians a chance again. I urge the Minister to allow the Bill to go forward to Committee Stage. We can deal with any issues that arise there. The Minister can bring forward amendments, get the advice of the Attorney General or of senior counsel if he likes. Deputy James Browne is an eminent barrister and he knows this can be done. I am surprised that he is here tonight to argue against it because he knows it is possible. He comes from a county with a great musical and cultural tradition and that is what this Bill is about. </p>
          <p eId="para_778"> These musicians will be in demand. When Deputies want to organise a charity event, the very first port of call are these Irish musicians and they respond. If a place has gone on fire or a building needs to be restored, they are there. When there are Christmas parties for the elderly in hospital, they are there. They are not looking for any money. They do it because they love it. They do it for the love of the music.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> I appeal to the House to allow the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage. Let us work on it together. I am not omnipotent and do not have any divine right, to be straight. The Minister, Deputy Naughten, comes from a great area and Brendan Shine, who is next door to the Minister's own bailiwick, is behind this legislation. If the Minister looks at the back of <i>SHIP</i> magazine he will see who is supporting this Bill. There are 10,000 people affected by this.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The Minister should give them a chance.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> Every independent radio station gets a licence and the aspiration is that it would play 30% of Irish music. How many of them play the required 30% of Irish music? How is that measured? The 30% could be played at 3 o'clock in the morning. We all know it is a joke. We should correct the anomalies and amend the legislation to make sure it is better legislation. I propose the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_800">I withdraw that comment, and I apologise for it. There were meetings with the then Minister, Alex White, on this in the past and the issue consistently has been to try to come up with a satisfactory and workable definition.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> The Deputy is proposing the introduction of a 40% quota for Irish music to be played by Irish radio stations. The definition in the Bill is extremely vague and I do not believe it would assist the Irish music industry if introduced; rather, because of its vagueness, I believe it is likely to exclude a range of types of music written by Irish musicians. It would also be unworkable from a practical regulatory point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> The wording refers to musical composition that relates to some distinguishing element of the culture of the island of Ireland. Who is to decide what those distinguishing elements are to be? For example, will it encompass electronica music such as techno, ambient or downtempo? Furthermore, in a multi-cultural society such as we have now, how should we treat music written or enjoyed by those Irish citizens of African, eastern European or South American heritage?</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> I fully recognise the efforts that Deputy Penrose has made in attempting to come up with a useful definition. For instance, he has tried to avoid the pitfall of setting a definition based on nationality or residence which would be in breach of EU law on the grounds that it would discriminate against other European artists. The introduction of a quota along these lines was attempted previously by Niall Stokes, as referenced by Deputy Penrose, and was rejected by the European Commission. The definition was then replaced by one that was so vague as to make it unworkable. That is the same situation that would arise if Deputy Penrose’s Bill was enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> The current system, where stations volunteer Irish music commitments in their programme policy statements, was introduced to avoid this problem. This system works well, and while I believe there is room for improvement, I do not believe Deputy Penrose’s proposal would lead to any improvement. RTE is the biggest supporter of Irish music and artists in Ireland. Irish artists and musicians receive significant support across radio, television, orchestra and online platforms. A number of shows on both TV and radio are dedicated to the air play of Irish music. In the case of commercial radio stations, they already have a 30% Irish music quota as part of their licence agreement with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI. Many of these stations play over and above that particular percentage. Editorial independence is essential to ensure diversity and the imposition of a quota representing a certain type of music is not workable. Independent radio stations are reliant on commercial revenue and their business plans are guided by audience levels. Stations broadcast what their audiences wish to hear and if they did not, audiences would switch to other stations resulting in decreased listenership and thus reducing revenues and potential job losses.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> The quota in France is frequently raised in this debate. It should be noted that this quota requires air play of music in the French language. A similar quota for Ireland would require that the music played was in the Irish language. That would be too restrictive and contrary to the purpose of Deputy Penrose's Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_807">A quota system was also introduced in South Africa in July of this year. Difficulties have arisen with the implementation of this quota. The Johannesburg based station Metro FM, for example, has lost over 3 million listeners since the introduction of a quota as its play lists have changed significantly. This is a serious loss of revenue and not a situation I would like to see in Ireland when stations are already having to compete with Internet radio and online streaming.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> It is my view that the best approach to be followed on this issue is one that takes account of all the relevant stakeholders, where we can have direct engagement with the radio sector with a view to establishing a mutually acceptable treatment of Irish music. That approach is likely to produce a far more successful and sustainable position on this issue, rather than seeking the imposition of an artificial quota.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> At my request, the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment is currently carrying out a broad review of the funding of public service broadcasting in Ireland, including a public consultation and engagement with relevant stakeholders. One suggestion that has arisen from the committee’s discussions has been the creation of a forum on broadcasting, and I have confirmed to the committee my support for this proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> This is an important issue which requires careful consideration. It affects both the Irish music industry and the Irish radio industry. That is the reason I oppose the Bill and suggest that the issue be discussed in the proposed forum, which would be a more appropriate course of action rather than seeking a legislative solution that would have the opposite outcome to what the Deputy is seeking to achieve. I accept the principle of what Deputy Penrose is saying. I have said that to him privately. I have told him that the major challenge has been the definition. I agree with Deputy Penrose that we should use the collective wisdom of our legislators. That is why I suggest to him that he should allow the committee, through the proposed forum on broadcasting, to come forward with recommendations that deal practically with the issues he has raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> I accept that we need to look at this and I am prepared to work with Deputy Penrose and the committee to see how we can progress this issue in a real and practical manner. The difficulty, as I have said to Deputy Penrose privately and publicly, is the issue of the definition. This issue was examined over many years by a number of Ministers. Deputy Penrose is aware of the difficulties in coming up with a definition. If someone can come up with one that is workable, I am prepared to consider it but let the collective wisdom of the legislators be used. It should be discussed via the forum on broadcasting to see if we should go down the legislative route or if there is another mechanism through the licensing of the broadcasters that we can use to achieve the same goal regarding it. For that reason, I cannot accept the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_813">I am sharing time with Deputy Butler; another colleague may join us.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> I thank Deputy Penrose for introducing this legislation to the House. I acknowledge the presence in the Chamber of representatives of both sides of the debate, which is welcome. It is a pleasant change to have such interest in a Bill being debated in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> I regret to say that Fianna Fáil will not be supporting this Bill on this occasion and I will outline a number of concerns and reasons that is so. Of course, we are and always have been 100% supportive of local and indigenous production of music and culture, but we feel the quota system is unworkable. Quotas of any kind are an imperfect mechanism. Quotas are inappropriate, particularly in this space.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> It is worth noting at the outset that quotas of 25% to 30%, depending on the station and the contracts awarded, are already in effect. The proposal to increase this to 40% seems a bridge too far, and I will outline a number of reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> I am not convinced that quotas have worked internationally. The Deputy made reference to international quotas. France is the most often cited example. South Africa also introduced quotas. Canada, maybe for similar reasons, experimented with a quota system as well. The motivation in those cases was more a language motivation than a cultural motivation, and that may be at the heart of this Bill. That may be where the dichotomy occurs, if there is a misunderstanding between the sides of the House on this issue. If this is a language Bill, let us call it a language Bill and let us take it as such and deal with it separately. At present, it appears to be a cultural Bill involving a cultural quota, and as the Minister stated, it is difficult to define how that might come about.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> The experience internationally has not been exclusively positive. If we look at Canada, the city of Montreal was riven apart. Digressing a little, in 1976, Montreal was a fine city and it hosted the Olympic Games. A decade later, the city was in tatters. Most of its economy had migrated to other parts of the state. A lot of this was due to language laws and faction fighting within. Of course, its quota laws pertained to language barriers rather than quotas. In France and in Canada, I understand these are language quotas as opposed to a cultural music quota. In fact, in France, they reversed the legislation. The legislature in France reversed it, back down to 30% from what it had been. At one stage, there was a notable boycott when radio stations boycotted the quota that was in place and got away with doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> On the point about forced cultural consumption, there is an ongoing debate about the Irish language and how we teach it and educate, and why after 80 years of compulsory Irish, we do not have a fluent Irish speaking population. Perhaps it is because it is forced. Perhaps forced quotas are not the way forward for any aspect of education or cultural promotion. Forced culture is unwelcome and the recipient often regurgitates it. As has been proven, it is not the way to go about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> In terms of the language, we have mentioned the EU difficulties. The Minister touched on that. I am also aware that my colleagues, the former MEPs, Deputy Gallagher and Mr. Liam Aylward, and Mr. Brian Crowley MEP, submitted a parliamentary question in the European Parliament which found that the quota would be difficult to satisfy European legislation. I appreciate the Deputy has made attempts to address that in this Bill but I am not quite sure it is there yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> Another difficulty I and my partner see with the Bill is the difficulty in defining what the definition means. I referenced it again while the Deputy was speaking. I listened carefully to a number of the points the Deputy made but I am not quite sure what the "distinguishing element of the culture of the island of Ireland" means. We can all guess what it means but as an eminent barrister, the Deputy will know a court might not always agree on something as nebulous as that. If an Irish artist was to perform opera, would that satisfy the definition?</p>

        <speech by="#JamesLawless" eId="spk_379">
          <from>Deputy James Lawless<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_838">I understand there are slots reserved later in the schedule for the speakers if they wish to come in.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> It is not clear. The legislation does not appear to be crystal clear. It appears to be open to debate. The fact that we are even arguing it in this debate alone highlights that.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> Looking again to the French experience, Daft Punk, an internationally successful eminent French outfit, could not get played on the French airwaves because of the quota legislation that was in place. It was not a French language outfit and, therefore, it could not qualify. That also highlights the difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> How do we quantify this? I do not know how we quantify it. I can imagine how we quantify it but I am not sure how a court would interpret that. In legislation, we have to be a little clearer in how we do that. Meaning no disrespect, I appreciate the intent, but as it is currently formulated I cannot see how that would work.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> We have to consider it is unduly restrictive of the Irish independent radio sector. We are unique in this country in that, unlike, say, France and other European states, we are English language speaking. It is our vernacular, although not our first language, and that means we are automatically catapulted onto the same stage as the United States, the United Kingdom and many other English-speaking content producers. That makes it infinitesimally more difficult for our content producers to produce on the English-language media than anywhere else. That is already a challenge, and a challenge that RTE, as a public service broadcaster, has to grapple with, but also that independent radio stations have to grapple with.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> We are in a digital age. I do not see how the legislation, as I understand it, could apply to the likes of Spotify, Internet radio, digital radio, digital streaming, consumption via the web, consumption via television and consumption via multiple media. It appears to focus on one particular sector of output and, without commenting on the merits or otherwise of that, it seems unfair and disproportionate to concentrate on one sector at the expense of others.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> Of course, it is a marketplace. There is competition and if we are to restrict and place artificial inhibitions on one sector in a free market and allow the others run amok, that is not a recipe for success. In that scenario, I would worry for the future of those independent radio stations which provide employment and an important public service remit in their news coverage and other aspects.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> The commercial viability has to be questioned as well in terms of the radio stations themselves. For the most part, the ones we are talking about here are local. They know their audience. I was in my own local radio station, KFM, this morning and reviewed the schedule. There are already multiple Irish language and Irish music programmes on the schedule - "Irish Music Scene", "Ceol agus Caint", "K Country" - but those broadcasters know their market audience and they meet that demand. In a cultural expression, as much as anything else, the listeners hear what they want to hear. If the station feels that the listeners are demanding more of a certain type of content, they will provide that. The market finds its own level and the music market finds its own level in that regard. If there was a clamour for increased music of a certain type, that probably would be reflected already in the schedules because these stations need market share to succeed. My own local station, KFM, is on 49% radio share at present. As it is, it is doing fairly okay and it meets the 30% compliance requirement that is already in place from the BAI. I am not sure why we need to interfere and go beyond that.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> Something else we need to consider is an open point the Deputy and the Minister have queried. My understand is RTE is not included in this legislation. The Deputy suggested that if that is so, an amendment may correct that. Certainly, as it is currently constituted, I do not see that RTE is included. I have been informed that RTE is not covered in this legislation. That would seem the elephant in the room. If the largest, State broadcaster, with the resources of the licence fee-----</p>

          <p eId="para_849"> The Deputy alluded to this when he was introducing the Bill. I refer to Fiddler's Green and Irish language and Irish music productions of note that were on RTE radio and perhaps RTE television. If RTE is exempt, that is a moot point.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>

          <from>Deputy James Lawless<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_851">I do not think it applies.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> The way forward, rather than enforcing quotas on a certain sector of the output, is to promote stations such as TG4 and Raidió na Gaeltachta. There is no reason RTE could not introduce a new digital radio channel, if it wished to do so, with 100% music with an Irish, what is the expression, "cultural identity". I do not know whether that has been explored.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> Ultimately, this comes back to choice and freedom, the choice that listeners make and the choice that a station makes to present. Enforcing quantity as a measure rather than quality will always be a difficult one to balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> The other point that has been made to me is the question of how this Bill provides a guarantee. The intention, which is extremely admirable and with which no one could quibble, is to promote new music sources, new media and indigenous artists coming through. This is noble and something we all would wish to support. There is no guarantee that under the legislation, as constituted, one could not put a U2, The Dubliners or Planxty song on repeat for 40% of the airtime and let it run. That would satisfy it. We might hear more of the same artists rather than hearing new artists coming through. If the noble intention I referred to is the intention, let us address that in other ways as there are other ways we can do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> This has been raised already. My understanding, as per the Minister, was that this was introduced, although not into the House. I accept Deputy Penrose's clarification on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">There were attempts to introduce this in the previous Dáil when the Labour Party was in Government, but it did not get the Minister's approval at the time for some of the reasons we are now identifying as concerns. That is a precedent we look to when something was attempted in the past. The representative body, IASCA, the Irish Association of Songwriters, Composers &amp; Authors, appears to be working with the local radio stations at present and with the industry. I and many Deputies have received multiple representations from the independent radio stations and their representative bodies as well as from industry agencies, groups and lobby groups. The Deputy suggests that they do not mean what they say, but I do not understand that. I can only accept what is in writing before me. If I receive an e-mail or a letter, I accept it in good faith and at face value. I received multiple letters, e-mails and representations along those lines. Again, I must accept them <i>prima facie</i>. They say they are against the legislation for many reasons, including that they consider it unworkable, impractical and because such legislation has not succeeded elsewhere. If it is a language matter, we should look at it in a separate context.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> I am a member of the communications committee and I have not seen this on the committee's agenda since I was elected to the House. Perhaps that is the appropriate forum for the Bill. The artists, agencies and different representative groups could be brought before the committee, and I am sure the Minister would join us for that session, and the debate could proceed. Perhaps the Bill could be reintroduced with RTE included and the vagueness around the cultural definition addressed. Let us take some time to refine it by bringing it to the committee. A discussion could be held there before introducing it again in the House. At that point, it might go forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> My party supports the general intent of the Bill, but as currently drafted I cannot see how it could work in practice. The immediate negative impact on the independent radio sector appears to be too great a price to pay.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryButler" eId="spk_384">
          <from>Deputy Mary Butler<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T18:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_859">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, and I do not doubt Deputy Penrose's passion on this subject. Even though I, personally and as a member of Fianna Fáil, do not favour 40% quotas, it does not mean I do not support Irish music, whether it is listening to the High Kings in the car when driving to Dublin, listening to Christy Moore on the way back down to Waterford or spending the last 15 years of my life going to Irish feiseanna with my daughter and listening to Irish music all day long at such events. I do not accept that just because I do not support the 40% quota it means I do not support and love Irish music and culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> The Bill provides that sound broadcasting contracts are awarded to applicants on the condition that 40% of the transmission time for music be used for musical compositions that relate to "some distinguishing element of the culture of the island of Ireland". Fianna Fáil very much supports a viable broadcasting sector that reflects the interests of the people and offers quality content for its audiences, but it opposes this Bill on the grounds that it is impractical and will not serve Irish cultural producers or consumers well. While Fianna Fáil supports Irish cultural production, a quota is not the appropriate means to do so. Instead, we must open dialogue and seek engagement with a broad array of interest groups to find a better solution that will not dampen Irish broadcasting.</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> Yesterday and today, I spoke to the managing director of Waterford Local Radio, WLR FM, a radio station in Waterford that has a huge listenership. He explained that Waterford Local Radio reaches 33% adherence to the contractual obligation as monitored-----</p>

        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_385">

        <speech by="#MaryButler" eId="spk_386">
          <from>Deputy Mary Butler<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T18:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_863">-----on a regular basis by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, and that breaches of licence for a lack of Irish music broadcasting are a rare occurrence. In addition to the 33% daily output, WLR FM also broadcasts three separate Irish music programmes that air on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. An Irish music feature promoting new Irish music is broadcast daily from Monday to Thursday on WLR FM. These radio stations are not opposed to Irish music. They have a strong public service remit and included in that is the promotion of Irish music of all genres. It is one that independent radio stations are keen to fulfil.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> I also spoke to Gabrielle Cummins who is the managing director of Beat FM, which appeals to an audience of people between 15 and 35 years of age. The station believes that this is a critical time for recruiting and retaining young listeners. Ms Cummins said that the challenge is difficult and she believes that enforced quotas as high as the 40% proposed by the Labour Party would drive young ears even more quickly to streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music. I have a 19 year old and 23 year old at home and I see how often they have headphones on to listen to Spotify and Apple Music. Irish artists have a much better chance of decent exposure on Irish radio than on Spotify or Apple Music playlists because they get decent rotations on air. If the legislation is passed, the end result could create a worse situation for Irish music artists if fewer young people are listening to radio.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> I also note that the proposed legislation only appears to cover independent radio and will not impact on RTE. That is undemocratic. The public service broadcaster should be to the fore in championing new Irish music, yet no quotas exist for its stations. The Bill is an aggressive measure both for our cultural production and the broadcasting sector which play a very important role in Ireland. Undoubtedly, the arrival of Internet-based music streaming services and radio presents a significant challenge. I do not doubt the Deputy's passion in introducing this Bill but I believe it is a step too far. The radio stations are adhering to their quotas of between 20% and 30%, depending on where one lives.</p>

          <p eId="para_868">I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on the Bill. I do not doubt the sincerity of my constituency colleague who introduced it. The Visitors Gallery is full of fine artists and musicians who represent this country internationally with great pride. They have done great work for Irish music over many years.

          <p eId="para_870">We cannot forget the Park House Hotel with Frank Kilbride. Many local venues in my area are packed to the rafters when promoting Irish music, country music and the indigenous music industry. This is an industry and it needs support.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> I do not claim to know the context of this Bill, to be honest. However, the information we are being given is that it is not the best way forward. It is not only Fianna Fáil saying it. This Bill is not something Deputy Penrose thought of in the past week or eight months. He was promoting it even when his party was in Government and had the opportunity, with an overall majority, to pass it. It did not happen in that five-year period and it appears it will not happen this evening. What we must do now is examine how we can support this industry into the future. The new chair of the RTE authority should be invited to appear before the Oireachtas joint committee to answer why RTE is not playing Irish artists on its various shows. Foster and Allen have their own show on Sky. I listen to it regularly. They get far more play time on BBC or Sky than on our national broadcaster. That is simply not fair or good enough. We must ensure we find some method to support these artists into the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_872">I have been a Member of the House for many years but I find myself in a very difficult situation tonight. I indicated to the musicians who were invited to the audio-visual room by Deputy Penrose that I supported the principle of this legislation. I cannot understand why we cannot support the principle. If there are difficulties with quotas and whether the quota should be 40% or 25%, that can be teased out at a later stage. The principle of this Bill is that we are espousing our own. We should promote our music and culture. I received no approach from local radio but I have been told that pressure is being applied and we are tying its hands. If all of those radio stations were playing 30% Irish music content, there would be no need for this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">I do not want to be a hypocrite about this. Deputy Penrose and others will know that I have been a loyal party member and if the greater membership of the party takes a decision, I must abide by it, but this one certainly goes against the grain for me.</p>

          <p eId="para_880">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I have read and considered it and we have had some discussion around it. There is no doubt that there are problems faced by those involved in the music industry in Ireland in accessing the airwaves. Ireland is recognised worldwide for its rich cultural heritage and our extremely talented musicians and composers are central to this. Unfortunately, those involved in the Irish music industry are struggling to make ends meet due to the lack of radio airplay on some stations. It is extremely difficult for Irish music to compete with the multinational culture and music companies. We are sandwiched between the music that comes out of Britain and the United States, some of which is very good, and dominated by that music and the global media and all that goes with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> The reality is that the broad spectrum of Irish music in Ireland is given very little consideration on radio and, in some cases, gets only 10% of airplay. Ireland is bursting with talent, and in this economic climate, we surely need to be tapping into this great creativity, encouraging and nurturing our musicians, songwriters and performers. Ireland’s music industry supports 11,500 jobs nationwide and is worth close to €500 million annually to the economy, which is an important factor. We need to provide real investment into that creative industry. A proper percentage of airplay is crucial for Irish music to develop and maintain a strong industry and further growth in that sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_882"> Many countries in the European Union and outside it have been able to introduce national music quotas of up to 40%, but there are problems with that. We have seen recommendations from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland on a minimum quota for Irish culture. Sinn Féin supports Irish culture and art being promoted in Ireland and across the world. We want to see more artists being able to make a living for themselves in this country. My party colleague, Liadh Ní Riada MEP, comes from a family with a very rich tradition and involvement in the music industry. Her late father was Seán Ó Riada. She corresponded with the previous Minister with responsibility for communications, Alex White, asking that Irish music and culture be given greater support by Government. Our party believes that the promotion of the Irish language in broadcasting is essential to the language as a whole. In the North we have been supporting an Irish language broadcast fund that supports the production of excellent television, radio and online broadcasts. In this State, TG4 has achieved tremendous success in producing Irish language content, drama and documentaries with very limited funding, and that has been important in it reaching young people in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_883"> However, while Sinn Féin supports advancing this Bill to Committee Stage, it requires further scrutiny. We see some pitfalls in it. I would not be as dismissive as some previous speakers of it. The Bill needs to be developed. For example, what constitutes “musical compositions that relate to some distinguishing element of the culture ... of the island of Ireland”? That is a broad definition and further work needs to be done on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> Our party wants to see all different forms and diversity of the music of Ireland being supported. There are many examples of international musicians who have based themselves or have come to live in Ireland and who have made successful careers for themselves by performing locally and signing with Irish record labels, and in doing so they have undoubtedly contributed to the music culture of the island. Would these artists be supported or discriminated against under this Bill? There needs to be tied up. There are also examples of international acts which are based abroad whose Irish heritage is a prominent element of their music. Would those artists benefit from this legislation or would it work the other way? We do not want an outcome that is too purist or exclusive in that we have to leave people with a choice but we also want to give Irish music maximum support. We believe this Bill should be supported to progress to the next Stage but we want assurances that it will be based on fairness and diversity. The definitions and quotas need to be further examined and developed.</p>

          <p eId="para_886">I thank Deputy Stanley for giving me a few minutes of his time. My side of the House has adequately put the case during the debate. I was in my office meeting a deputation from my part of the country which had an issue, but I was following on the monitor Deputy Penrose's passionate contribution and, boy, does he put every effort into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_887"> As Deputy Penrose and the Minister, Deputy Naughten, know, I worked in this business for 20 years and promoted Irish music. I want to remind people in the Gallery because some of them might not realise this that I did more than anybody in this House to promote Irish music and song. Many of those in the Gallery know I played their records and they did not have to ring me to ask me to do so. I played their records because I have a belief in this business. I know more than most that this business is under pressure. We may not agree with this Bill but this side of the House has done more for Irish music than those on any other side of this House. We brought in local radio and local radio throughout this country has given a new platform to Irish country music, traditional music and, indeed, to new Irish rock bands. Stations like Shannonside and Northern Sound, for which I used to work, cater for all that type of music, and up to almost 40% of their coverage deals with different strands of Irish music. Stations like Midwest Radio, LMFM and Midlands Radio 3 have all done Trojan work for this business.</p>
          <p eId="para_888"> With due respect to Deputy Penrose, the problem with this Bill is that it will not deal with the national issue, and that is where the problem lies with national stations. I can show the Deputy a number of letters I have on my desk from the bosses of radio stations saying that this Bill is not workable and that they do not want it. I do not believe that going down the road of quotas works in any walk of life. It has failed in other areas and it will fail in this area. I know the Deputy is passionate about this and that he wants to do the right thing but I must remind him that a Bill was brought forward by the Labour Party when his party was in government in 2014 and the Deputy's then Labour Party Minister, Alex White, would not support it. Am I correct in that?</p>

          <p eId="para_901">I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill which I welcome. We were treated to a feast of music from incredible artists, young and old, in the audio-visual room a month or six weeks ago. The O'Neill sisters from Kerry, if my memory serves me right, and Phil Coulter were there, which shows the talent from one age to next that we have in this country and that has been nurtured along. That is a great asset.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">No matter where we are, it might be at a wedding and we might have too many pints on us, the final thing the Irish will do at night is to get together and sing the songs of which we are proud. Tonight, I heard that this one and the other one did all the work to ensure that the Irish music business has survived. Mothers and fathers around Ireland who brought their youngsters to learn guitar, the fiddle or whatever, are the ones who kept music alive in this country, as did those who went to the different dance halls to hear bands perform live long before those bands ever played hotels. I recall that 3,000 people would attend The Sound of Music in Glenamaddy, County Galway and many also went to The Beaten Path in Claremorris, County Mayo.</p>
          <p eId="para_903"> MidWest Radio, Shannonside Northern Sound, Galway Bay FM and Highland Radio are successful radio stations because they have played this music and brought forward these kinds of musicians. We have to face up to it that we have a problem with the large stations because it might not be cool to play some Irish music. It might not be cool in certain parts of the country or in a big city to play it.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> This music also generates much money throughout the country. For example, a band playing at an event will involve, say, people on the door and inside the bar working. Thousands of people are employed around the country and the talent these young people have is incredible. It is like a young footballer. A young lad or girl who wants to play football will be brought for training on a Saturday morning or afternoon to learn how to kick. As time goes on, he or she gets better and plays for the local club. If he or she is good, he or she will get the opportunity to play for his or her county. There are parts of this country where youngsters have learned various instruments or have amazing voices or have written great songs, but, unfortunately, after spending €10,000 on recording their music in a studio, they are not given the opportunity they deserve to have it played on the airwaves.</p>
          <p eId="para_905"> We should be proud of these people. They have gone to foreign lands, as was the case with Foster and Allen many years ago. I remember them appearing on "Top of the Pops" and representing Ireland. As legislators, this is what we should ensure. Do we want all the money going out to Robbie Williams or whoever is on the radio because the music is cooler? Do we want to keep that money in our own country in order to help our own youngsters, to create more jobs and, above all, to preserve our Irishness? Are we ashamed of driving forward with our Irishness?</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> Deputy Willie Penrose introduced a Bill when I was not long in the Dáil to help people in mortgage trouble to go bankrupt. I commended him on that at the time. I also commend him on the Bill before the House. No one is saying that it is perfect. Earlier, a Deputy claimed that some radio stations play 30% of Irish music. We can agree on an amendment to show the youngsters coming up in rock, pop, traditional or country music, what we mean. When I was a youngster, we danced to Joe Dolan. Then, it was not cool to do that and we listened to Shakin' Stevens and all the others. Now the wheel has turned and everyone is listening to Joe Dolan again. When there is a charity event for a young child or a community, who is the first to do a voluntary gig? It is not the artist in England but an artist in Ireland who will perform at such a gig to raise funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_907"> This is what we should appreciate. This is our Irishness and what we should be proud of. We should not be ashamed to stand up for musicians both here and abroad. If one is playing Irish music, I do not care if one is from America, so long as it is Irish music one is playing and one has Irish roots. We need to give these youngsters a chance. They have spent a lot of money and have never got the opportunity. One would stand in the snow to listen to the Doyle sisters who sang in the AV room recently. Unfortunately, they are not getting the opportunity to be heard everywhere they deserve to be heard. If one does not get the opportunities, then it is a harder road. They may get a break, they may not. Hopefully, they will. We are not talking about the local radio stations. In fairness, every local radio station in the west and other parts of the country is playing the percentage of Irish music which Deputy Willie Penrose is seeking in this Bill. It is the big guns - in circumstances where it might not be fashionable to do it - that are not doing so. They should be whipped into line the same as the rest.</p>

          <p eId="para_912">I support this Bill, which seeks to introduce a quota for Irish music to be played on the Irish airwaves. It is disappointing, however, that it will not be supported by the Government. The Bill seeks to introduce a quota by making it a condition for the awarding of all sound and broadcasting contracts to include at least 45% of the time allocated to music content in programmes for music that relates to "some distinguished element of the culture of the island of Ireland".</p>
          <p eId="para_913"> Radio maintains a consistent presence in our society. Up to 86% of adults, almost 3 million people, listen to radio on the average weekday in Ireland. While TV and print media ratings are falling ahead of increased online broadcasting trends, maintaining a music quota for radio will have the greatest impact in exposing the listening population to music content that relates to a cultural aspect of Ireland. In saying that, I do not believe we need to restrict quotas only to music which has a cultural element. It could be read to assume that only music deemed culturally relevant to the island of Ireland will be played. What about Irish singers who might write and produce original pop songs here in Ireland or an African national living here who has written, produced and performed music in Ireland but who cannot get air time? Upholding a quota for culturally specific Irish music may not do anything to develop and grow the music industry in itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_914"> Alongside any quota system being introduced, a strategy should also be introduced to develop a home-grown music industry. This year, the Taoiseach launched Creative Ireland as the Government's legacy programme for Ireland 2016, a five-year whole-of-Government initiative from 2017 to 2022, which aims to improve access to cultural and creative activity in every county. While this is welcome, little is contained in the programme to enhance prospects for the music industry, which means we are still without a fully functioning music strategy. According to the Irish Music Rights Organisation which deals with licensing rights for Irish musicians, Ireland's music industry supports 11,500 jobs nationwide and is worth close to €500 million annually to the economy. Clearly, there is potential to develop this further. Like many other industries, the music sector has been impacted in recent years both as a result of austerity cuts and on foot of technological advances as people increasingly download music for free. More than that, it is also the fact that this Government lacks a clear and coherent strategy to support the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_915"> During the economic recovery process as we seek to create more employment, increase tourism and develop sustainable sectors, now is the time to develop a real plan for Irish music, involving all stakeholders including the Government, industry representative bodies, musicians and songwriters themselves, among others. This is crucial if we are to optimise the economic and social return of the music sector. This should coincide with any quota system that could be introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> I want to dispute the age-old notion that we cannot possibly introduce a quota system as it may contravene EU competition law. Niall Stokes, former chair of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, previously sought a music quota for Ireland in the 1990s, which the EU sanctioned. In 1994, France secured a 40% quota for songs played in French.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">While this law primarily dealt with preserving the spoken language of French as it was felt English was homogenising the music industry, we need to be clear about our own intentions. Is it about the preservation of language, our cultural heritage or the preservation of our music industry in general? Both are intrinsically linked because music recorded and written in Ireland is also part of our cultural heritage and should be preserved and given the airtime it deserves.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_918">I am delighted to warmly congratulate Deputy Willie Penrose on bringing forward this important Bill. The Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2016 will insert section 65A into the Broadcasting Act 2009 and provide for a quota of at least 40% to be allocated to Irish music or musical compositions that relate to some distinguishing element of the culture of our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_919"> When one looks at Irish music down through the decades, one sees a phenomenal pantheon of achievement by our music artists. We could spend the rest of tonight up to midnight reading out the names of great men and women who have contributed to the artistic life and culture of our country. Some of them are U2, the Script, Phil Coulter, Paul Brady, Van Morrison, Joe Dolan, Dickie Rock, Sinéad O'Connor, Hozier, Walking on Cars, Snow Patrol, Niall Horan, Thin Lizzy, Enya, Damien Rice, Glen Hansard, the Pogues, the great Christy Moore, Aslan, Nathan Carter, George Murphy, Paddy Casey and the great Damien Dempsey from my constituency. They represent a tiny fragment of the men and women who have done so much for our artistic life. To protect and develop it, particularly as a result of the new challenges we face in the digital age, it is critical that our 34 stations give that amount of airtime to Irish music.</p>
          <p eId="para_920"> I meant to mention a great man from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's party, the former Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú, and the work of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann which down through the decades has done a phenomenal amount to teach instruments to our children. I am thinking also of the great O'Dwyer family of the Beara Peninsula, some of my own relations and the great tradition they and so many thousands of Irish families represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_921"> When one thinks of our great musical heritage, one must consider that other large English-speaking countries relentlessly push their own music. Our smaller EU partners and many other states in Latin America, Africa and Asia deliberately insist on good play time on the radio and television networks for their musicians. South Africa insists on 90% and I believe we should move in the same direction. If one thinks about great national musical traditions around the world, for example, the great musicians of Mali, Cuba or Jamaica, it is incontrovertible that major airplay on local stations has played a huge role in building up these traditions and encouraging and supporting these artists.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> There is also huge issue with the power of IT companies like Apple, Google, YouTube and Spotify in the downloading and streaming of music. The ultimate benefits which accrue for composers and musicians is something this House will have to look at in the years to come and the fact that musicians often get such small returns for brilliant composition and playing. Down the years there have also been huge issues with the protection of copyright and royalties for Irish composers, especially in traditional music. I agree with the approach Deputy Penrose and the Labour Party have taken in this regard and by bringing such a group of our great musicians into Dáil Éireann tonight to publicise the Bill. It is a small but necessary step to cherish our musical heritage and to foster a love of Irish music for generations to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_923"> Deputy Pringle mentioned the new creative policy the Government has launched. It will need resources. In my constituency, and possibly in the Minister's, huge efforts are being made by great community activists like Finola Young to ensure every child in every school will have a musical instrument and that they will all be musically literate by the time they get to adulthood. We should have a total emphasis on our music and pushing it first and last in all genres in which our musicians are so brilliant.</p>

          <p eId="para_924">Is mór an trua é go bhfuil daoine ar nós na n-iar-Sheanadóirí, Labhrás Ó Murchú, Paschal Mooney agus Donie Cassidy, imithe as Pháirtí Parlaiminte Fhianna Fáil. It would be a different story if they were here. It is a pity the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, because of the Whip system, is not allowed to support his good friends and the culture which he and I love and pay for. We have a new censor here in Dáil Éireann tonight. Deputy Lawless is the new censor for music in Ireland and what we can do.</p>
          <p eId="para_925"> I am disappointed, to say the least, that the party of which my father was a founding member and of which I was a member of all my life cannot support something as noble as this. I salute Deputy Penrose and his colleagues on bringing this forward. I would not ask why they did not do it in the past five years. They did not do it and that is fine. They are doing it now and it is needed. We should be proud of our Irish culture and our heritage. We should play it and support it. We might not get it from the national broadcasting services but we get it from our local radio stations. I salute Tipp FM radio and Tipperary Mid West Radio and all the good people there and the work they do, including the Tony Brooke show and many others.</p>
          <p eId="para_926"> I commend Paschal Mooney - God be with him - and his country music shows that we all listen to. He is still alive thank God. Fianna Fáil might have a different parliamentary party. Was this discussed at the parliamentary party? If it was, I do not know what Fianna Fáil is thinking about. Where is the culture, heritage, dúchas, faith and passion? Tá sé imithe. It is like, "Cad a dhéanfaimid feasta gan adhmad?" It looks like it is, "Cad a dhéanfaimid feasta gan Fianna Fáil?" now. We will have different things again tomorrow. It is like Kieran Hanrahan and "Céilí House" - around the house and mind the dresser. Fianna Fáil members go around all the houses, yet they mind no one. They mind themselves as far as I can see.</p>
          <p eId="para_927"> I support this Bill. I welcome all the good people to the Public Gallery. I love Irish heritage - the music, song and dance. I am an all-Ireland champion set dancer. I cannot dance tonight here because there is no one to play the tune. B'fhéidir go mbeidh rince againn tar éis an oíche seo in áit eile.</p>
          <p eId="para_928"> We were told what happens in the US and the UK. I say to hell with the US and the UK. There is too much influence from those places coming in here. We need our culture, identity and heritage. I salute groups such as Clannad, Bachelors in Trouble, the Morrisseys and the former Senator Donie Cassidy. They composed a song, "Arise and Follow Charlie". If he was here I do not know what he would do with the Fianna Fáil Deputies. He would throw them all out in the yard somewhere. That is what happened in those times but now we are here and we are left with this. It is good legislation. It may not be perfect but it can be amended.</p>
          <p eId="para_929"> I was delighted to meet Deputy Penrose at the Fleadh Cheoil in Ennis with his young kids ag rince set agus ag rince fóirne. Bhí mo chlann ann freisin. I commend the work of former Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú who was ardstiúrthóir of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann agus a bhean chéile, Una, and the sterling work they have done for decades in the cultural centre in Tipperary, Brú Ború and elsewhere. They promoted our culture and heritage nakedly and unashamedly and supported young students who came out of college after studying art when nobody else would do it and when it was not popular to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_930"> I danced to Big Tom at the carnival in Scotstown and I enjoyed it. I am not ashamed of it. They might say I am a Neanderthal or a caveman. That is not so long ago. Our culture is what we have to hold dearly and celebrate. I love listening to the Bachelors in Trouble. I wish them well and like their satire. It is very important. I like Deputy Penrose's good friend, Johnny Mac from Tipperary. They get together in the cornfields and make videos down in Maryville house in the plush, green Golden Vale of Tipperary.</p>
          <p eId="para_931"> If we do not support our own, we support nothing. I support Deputy Penrose. I do not know the Government's opinion on the Bill. I have not heard yet from the Minister. He is interested and has young kids himself. I will mention the Clancy Brothers, Stephen Donnelly in Clonmel and Paddy O'Brien. Rinne na fir sin an-obair thar na blianta ar fud an domhain. They danced all over the world. They brought Ireland and its culture to the people of the world. Afterwards there was U2 and all the other bands that are doing so well. We had all the rumpus last year about bringing your man into Croke Park and asking if he would come.</p>
          <p eId="para_932"> Anywhere in any town or village, we will get young people to dance, we will get a man to play a tune on the fiddle, ar an bhfeadóg nó rud éigin mar sin agus beidh an-chraic againn. That is our culture. That is what purists abroad want to see. They want us to have it here played on our radio. They do not want to listen to other stuff. When they come to Ireland and go into a hotel, pub or go into get their hair cut, they want the Irish music and culture played and listened to. They do not just want stuff coming from abroad. That is good as well and we cannot close our mind to it but we have to get back to our roots. I do not know where the Deputies' roots are gone but, by God, they are short green shoots. They need to get some 10-10-20 or some kind of fertiliser to see if they can stimulate them again. They have lost their way in a lot of cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_933"> I heard Deputy Murphy - I know the work he does on his radio station - lecturing people across the way. None of us can be proud. We all make mistakes but we all have an onus to cherish our culture, heritage, faith and dúchas and to support it and young groups like Caladh Nua from Ballymacarbry who won national awards last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">They are a great group of young people from Contae Thiobraid Árann, Cluain Meala agus Baile Mhac Cairbre i gContae Phort Láirge. The talent oozes from them. They love it. They do not cost a bob to anyone but their parents. We are not charging anybody for this. It is not like Uisce Éireann, which Deputy Lawless mentioned. We have enough of talking about Irish Water. Let us talk about what is good for us, what we enjoy and what we love. Let us celebrate our culture and heritage. We should be allowed to do so. A quota of 40% is not too much. Let us compel our radio stations to play more and to be proud of it, not all the foreign influences we have and the diatribe that comes on some of the stations some of the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_935"> The group is called Caladh Nua. It is a lovely new group. People should go out and get their CD and listen to it. Those who do buy it will be dancing around the Christmas table with the turkey in their hands and they might spill the cranberry sauce if they are not careful. The music is stimulating and invigorating. It is what we are. It is what we come from. It is where we came from, what we are proud of and what we want to have. I do not want any party in this House seeking to do down Deputy Willie Penrose or anybody else. Goodness knows, we are downtrodden enough since the recession and everything the troika says we cannot do. This is something we can do, we are able to do and we want to do. Let us do it. Let us celebrate what we are and our culture. We should bring back the likes of former Senators Labhrás Ó Murchú and Donie Cassidy to give people, particularly those who oppose the Bill, pep talks on what can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_936"> This is good legislation. Deputy Penrose is not infallible. He has a legal background and I have admired many of the Bills he has brought forward. I admired him when he stood up for his local barracks and his people and gave up his super junior Cabinet post. He is not a man for himself but a man of the people and a man of culture. I will not say that he is a man of history, given that he is still with us, but he will leave behind a proud legacy. Let us all consider the Bill and embrace it. The Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten is part of the rural group of Independents and I hope he will support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_937"> The House will be sitting tomorrow. As I said during the debate on post offices, we should use our culture, music, dance, literature, history and arts, or we will lose them. It is a case of "Use it or lose it". We have lost a great deal. Thanks are due to all the good people in the Public Gallery, their families and supporters for all the employment they give driving vans to bring the people who provide background music to the hotels and marquees. Use it or lose it. Go n-éirí an t-ádh leis an mBille.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T19:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_938">I very much welcome the debate and commend Deputy Willie Penrose on raising the issue and allowing us to consider it. The music we listen to is important. When I leave the Chamber, the first thing I will do on my way home is put on my earphones and listen to John Creedon's radio show. I love it. It is the highlight of my day. I leave it to him as to whether he plays ska for the first half-hour or hour or whether he plays the Sultans of Ping non-stop. I trust him, and I love this quality in my day. It is important to me. If he is not on, or some similar show is not airing, I spend a lot of time jumping between stations trying to find something I like.</p>
          <p eId="para_939"> We are all influenced, particularly by the experiences of our younger years. I am a child of the 1970s, when we seemed to get it right. The musician Martin Hayes said something happened in Irish traditional music in the early 1970s that was truly spectacular. I could name endless bands such as the Bothy Band, Skara Brae and Planxty that were incredibly innovative, creative and popular, not just here but all over the world. We were the leaders and originators in world music on foot of the spark and creativity of that time. Although I am less tuned into it, it was probably the same in terms of show bands and country music. I am old enough to remember going around the country and seeing big crowds outside show band halls. It was a hugely popular and successful musical culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_940"> I was at home in punk. I am a child of punk and, at that time, for whatever combination of reasons, Ireland was an amazingly vibrant centre. We were right up to speed with punk just as much as London or Manchester, and we were proud. It did not seem like it was Irish. We were proud because they were local people but also because it was beyond being Irish. It was just contemporary and global. People all over the world were listening to Stiff Little Fingers or whichever of the plethora of bands that took off at that time. Perhaps it was because we were cut off. People did not travel to Ireland, given that they did not see it as safe. We did not have a huge amount of choice or radio stations. Perhaps, because we had so many young people, the culture was ripe for musical development.</p>
          <p eId="para_941"> We need to try to recreate that and build Irish music back up. It is still there. There is still talent and an incredible variety of different musical genres. The underlying capability and creative instinct is still there. However, two things have happened in the interim that changed the nature of how music is heard and how the music business works. The first of these was the development of all those radio stations. It is worth debating how we regulate them in terms of quality and diversity and how we get those in the industry to promote Irish music while giving them the freedom to retain their audiences and make their judgements in terms of how they play it. I am nervous about overly restricting them.</p>
          <p eId="para_942"> Last week, some member of the Tory Party stated that every British radio station should finish each night with "God Save the Queen". Somebody responded with John Lydon's version of "God Save the Queen" from the Sex Pistols. I slightly fear that we will just box ourselves in. What the Minister said about definitions is true. John Lydon is as Irish as anyone. I will go up to the former Frankie Kennedy Winter School, Scoil Gheimhridh Ghaoth Dobhair in Donegal every year. Over the years I have seen all sorts of bands there. Are the Rankin Family Irish or Canadian? Is Caper Ceilidh Scottish or Irish? We could go on forever debating where we put the line. There are difficulties around it. However, it is worthwhile to consider how we do it regarding our regulation of radio.</p>
          <p eId="para_943"> The bigger change which has really affected the commercial viability of Irish music and the ability for people to earn a living and develop a career is the digital revolution that is altering so many things in our lives. Five or six years ago, I was on a platform with Paul Brady, one of my greatest musical heroes, and Niall Stokes who stated that it was killing them and was not working for the industry. The latter is true. The development of the Internet and social media and the flow of advertising to social media companies rather than local Irish media companies, and the fact that content can be copied, downloaded or stolen - whatever words we use - and that musicians are not getting paid, is one of the fundamental problems underlying the concern that has people sitting in the Public Gallery today.</p>
          <p eId="para_944"> I commend Deputy Penrose. I have listened very keenly to the different arguments in the debate. It is a very valid debate which needs to be deepened, widened and continued. I listened to what the Minister suggested regarding the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, of which I am proud to be a member, and the suggestion that we consider establishing a public forum to consider how we manage the digital revolution to protect our media industries which have been crippled by the digital revolution or are under threat. We can talk about regulating radio stations but if they are not there in three years' time due to the fact that 80% of advertising revenue is going to social media companies, it is a threat to Irish music and all the good stations and DJs that Deputy Penrose mentioned. If they are not on the air in three years' time, no percentage we determine would have an effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_945"> The Minister is suggesting a public forum as a course of action. I would be happy to support that. It will be difficult to do it given that we are looking at the question not just of how we protect media providers in this changing digital landscape but also content creators. However, it is valid. Why not be ambitious and think big? We may have to give it more time and broaden the involvement so that Deputy Penrose, other individuals and the industry could come along to have the debate and make their views clear. We cannot stop the tide of technology. Young Irish musicians are using it and can use it in a variety of ways. We can try to shape it and ensure we protect or develop a strong cultural industry here.</p>
          <p eId="para_946"> It needs to go back to those roots in the 1970s of being free spirited, anarchic and not overly controlled. Nobody completely regulated for happened in traditional Irish music in the early 1970s. It happened as a result of a number of people in their 20s getting together and expressing themselves. While we have a role in trying to protect and develop, we must be careful not to be so expressive in terms of how we regulate it that we do not stifle the creative environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">We need to be good with digital industries. We need to get our music out on digital platforms. We need to share it with the whole world and have it played on our radio stations. I agree with the Minister that we should use this forum as a means to consider the Bill in more detail. It is not intended to stop the debate. The debate needs to be deepened and lengthened. I commend the Labour Party on starting it.</p>

          <p eId="para_948">I rise to support my colleague, Deputy Penrose, on his Bill, which is very important. It is one of a number of Bills which the Labour Party will introduce in the House in the coming months to support local indigenous industries. The music industry is an incredibly important industry in all corners of Ireland. Irish music punches way above its weight. We need to support this industry which employs thousands of people. I welcome all those who are in the Gallery to support the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_949"> I think everyone in the House received a letter from the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland. I praise these radio stations, as Deputy Fitzmaurice and others did before me. They provide an absolutely essential service to all our communities. In the case of my county, Tipp FM and Tipp Mid West do a brilliant job. Tipp FM meets the Irish music quota. Fran Curry, Billy O'Shea and the rest of the team of Tipp FM make sure they support Irish music. As part of this legislation, we need to ensure the big boys as well as the small boys deliver on what is required of them. The Bill will guarantee this and ensure Irish music is not played in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner, as is the case at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_950"> I must say this straight. I find it incredible that this Fine Gael-led Government - sorry, the Minister present is gene pool Fine Gael - and Fianna Fáil are not supporting the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_981">Radio stations are obliged to fulfil the 25% to 30% quotas. I therefore ask the Minister the following on the record of the House, and I will send in the request as a written question if I must. Will he, through the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, or whatever, write to every single station and ask them to guarantee in writing that they will adhere to the quota of 30%, or 25% in some cases? He should at least refer back to me and tell me he will do this or get somebody else to do it. We need to ensure that all stations fulfil the quota, the big boys as well as the smaller independent stations. The latter do a fantastic job. They are not the real issue in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_982"> We have a letter from Pat Egan regarding an artist called Donna Taggart and her song "Jealous of the Angels", which has received more than 60 million hits on Facebook, topped the US Billboard chart and gone to No. 1 in Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Last month, Warner Music International signed Donna Taggart with a worldwide record contract, yet in Ireland, her own country, like so many local acts, she is deemed not good enough to be on Irish radio. I have never heard this artist on Irish radio. I do not know whether anyone else has.</p>

          <p eId="para_984">My point is that the success of this artist and her not being played on Irish radio demonstrate the need for the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_985"> To quote another statistic, 90% of the royalties IMRO collects from Irish broadcasters goes to foreign artists. Is this not bonkers? We are not supporting our own. The industry supports tens of thousands of jobs, not only in production, but also in event management, PR and a range of other disciplines which all hang off the industry. These disciplines are found in all parts of Ireland, as the Minister knows, so the Bill will help support these jobs, maintain them and create more jobs in rural areas. Surely, we should support this industry. We all know what is happening to it. Spotify and other online media are disintermediating musicians. It is hard for them to get royalties and an income in the normal way because they are being disintermediated by technology. That is the reality. We therefore need ways to promote artists through the traditional medium of the radio station.</p>
          <p eId="para_986"> The Musicians Union of Ireland supports the Bill. A significant number of artists have written about it. The Shamrock and Harp Irish Playlist, SHIP, a who's who of Irish music, is promoting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_987"> I come from a little village called Portroe, part of which is a little place called Garrykennedy. Garrykennedy is very famous for Irish music and musicians. People such as Paddy O'Brien and, more recently, Gerry O'Connor, the world's best banjo player, come from the area. I have never heard Gerry O'Connor played on Irish radio, and he is from the same village as me and is the best in the world at what he does.</p>

          <p eId="para_989">I have never heard him played in a prime time slot on a national radio station. Does Deputy Murphy hear me? There is something wrong about that. We were asked about the definition of Irish music in the Bill. "Musical compositions that relate to some distinguishing element of the culture of the [people of the] island of Ireland" shall meet the definition of Irish music, as per the Bill. Something around this can surely be worked out on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_990"> I have also heard this yarn about European legislation. European legislation actually provides for such a measure. I will not read the legislation into the record as I do not have the time. As we know, similar measures have been introduced across a range of countries and jurisdictions in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_991"> Regarding the definition of Irish music in the Bill, Deputy Lawless asked, strangely, whether it would affect one genre of music over another. It would affect anyone who produces Irish music, whether in jazz, traditional music, rock music, whether it is The Riptide Movement, Kodaline, The Coronas, The Blizzards or whoever else. It would promote all of them and provide for thousands of jobs. We need to support the industry as much as we can. I am chairman of a music festival in Roscrea, County Tipperary, which is headlined by The Stunning, a group referred to in the House previously. This measure will support all the new bands coming through. How many of them will be able to survive into the future? They certainly will not be able to get the exposure and get out there as much as needs be if the Bill is not passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_992"> I grinned somewhat when I saw the Creative Ireland programme being launched recently by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. It is something I support. The man who will be driving it, John Concannon, is a genius as far as I am concerned. He was the man behind the Wild Atlantic Way, The Gathering and he oversaw the 2016 programme. It is ironic that in the same week of that launch this Government cannot support what is absolutely a no-brainer when it comes to a Bill to promote Irish music. It is incredible.</p>
          <p eId="para_993"> I implore the Minister and Fianna Fáil in particular to support this Bill and to allow it to go to Committee Stage. It is no great thing to ask. I appeal to them to allow it to go to Committee. We all know that is the right thing to do. We all know that the industry is 100% behind this and that thousands of jobs are dependent on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_995">I welcome the discussion of the Bill. It has raised an emotive debate. We have heard a number of speakers and views. No one here wants to impede Irish music or Irish-produced music. The question is and the crux of the Bill is around the definition.</p>
          <p eId="para_996"> Obviously, technology has changed music - that is a no-brainer - during the past ten or 15 years in the sense of the way music is consumed. Now, it works across digital platforms. As Deputy Kelly noted, the advent of Spotify, Myspace and such platforms has led to the flattening of music and has eroded the power of record companies. Now, the artists are dealing directly with radio stations and the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_997"> I studied for a master’s degree in music technology in the University of Limerick in 2008. I discovered one major thing when I came out. There were seven disc jockeys - I was one of them – seven composers and seven electronic engineers on the course. However, there was no real educational push on the commercial side of music. That is something we need to work on to help artists. By their nature, artists focus on their art. It is a question of the commercial side. At the end of the day, artists have to pay bills, earn money, raise children, try to put food on the table and try to make a living out of it. More education is needed to allow them to compete with the broader market. The flattening of the industry has given them a broader market but it has increased the completion as well. It is a chicken and egg situation. It is a question of giving them the wherewithal. Many people in music have diversified into digital marketing. They work in the area because it helps them to deliver their art.</p>
          <p eId="para_998"> I imagine Deputy Penrose probably came up with the definition in good faith.</p>

          <p eId="para_1003">Genres such as techno were mentioned. Many Irish producers are working on techno and hip-hop. These types of music are played by many Irish artists on radio stations. I know this because I listen to these genres.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004"> As part of my master's degree I teased out the distinction between producer, DJ and composer and where the boundaries blur when it comes to composition and playing music. How do we define what is Irish? Is it the anchor, the person actually delivering the music? Is it the composer? Is it the producer? Where does the music change? Technology and genres are moving so fast. It is extremely difficult to nail them down. I agree with the view of Deputy Eamon Ryan to the effect that in an environment where culture and creativity is allowed to flourish, we come up with brilliance. Riverdance first appeared 20 years ago. It reinvented Irish dancing. Irish dancing was probably on its knees in the popular way or as far as my age group was concerned. Then, when Riverdance came along, things changed completely. It was born out of brilliance and creativity. We are not trying to take away from Irish artists.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005"> Deputy Penrose has ratcheted this question up the political ladder and raised the profile of the discussion. The discussion is necessary. It has been cathartic. Everyone is giving their views and talking about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006"> Music scenes come and go. Technology is driving things. What used to happen in the 1980s and 1990s is not happening today. Grunge came and went. The new romantics came and went. Punk came and went. Music scenes move on. Yet, our Irish music and culture continues to survive. It is the one thing that keeps pushing through all the challenges. It comes through all the challenges. It goes through its dips and troughs but it always comes through. It is inherent in us.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007"> I welcome the debate but I do not believe that coercing stations into playing a specific amount is going to work. We do not want to erode the platform in place already that gives bands the chance. We need to help these bands and educate them more on the commercial side. We need to help them to beat the competition.</p>

          <p eId="para_1008">Cuirim fáilte roimh an díospóireacht seo. Molaim an Teachta Penrose as ucht an Bhille seo a chur os ár gcomhair. Tá sé ráite ag mo chomhghleacaí, an Aire, an Teachta Naughten, go bhfuil fadhbanna ag baint leis an mBille seo. Aontaím leis an Aire go bhfuil fadhb leis an gcuóta de 40%, mar shampla. I welcome this debate. It is an interesting debate and one that has raised some genuine passions. Clearly, it is an issue of interest to all Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009"> Under the Broadcasting Act 2009, public service broadcasters must ensure their service reflects the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of Ireland. RTE and TG4 have published detailed commitments on an annual basis setting out how they plan to meet these obligations across the range of services they provide. The practical implementation of these commitments is of significant benefit to Irish artists and musicians across all those services, not only on radio.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010"> The majority of commercial stations already have a 30% quota in their broadcasting licence. Many of these stations play over and above this percentage. The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, has confirmed to me that he will write to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to seek confirmation of adherence by broadcasters to this quota, as per the request of Deputy Kelly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011"> It is important to recognise that broadcasters are important stakeholders in this debate as well. It is also important to note the right of broadcasters to determine the type of programming and content they wish to broadcast, subject to meeting relevant licensing and legislative obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012"> As the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has outlined, the introduction of specific quotas is not always the solution. It could possibly lead to a position of strict adherence to the minimum by those upon whom they are imposed. We have already heard about the difficulties this has created in France and South Africa.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013"> The main problem with the approach proposed by Deputy Penrose is that, despite all the efforts over the years, it has not been possible to come up with a satisfactory and workable definition of Irish music. The definition provided by Deputy Penrose is decidedly vague and I do not believe that it could be introduced as it stands. The current arrangement, whereby applicants for commercial radio licences are invited to volunteer Irish music commitments for inclusion in the programme policy statements of the station, has been found to be the most efficient solution. As these commitments are voluntary, they can include commitments based on nationality and residence and have not created any issues at European level. These commitments form part of the individual licence of each broadcaster and are monitored by the BAI on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014"> While the promotion of works by Irish artists is to be encouraged, this is not something into which public service or commercial radio stations wish to be forced. The best way to increase airplay of Irish music is for the music industry to engage with radio stations and for the parties to work together. A quota, if introduced, could or would have a negative effect. It could result in more repetitive Irish music being played, negative impacts on radio station revenues and potential resultant job losses. This can be explored in the forum to which the Minister referred earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015"> The proposed legislative approach is inflexible and could have the opposite effect of the stated intention of Deputy Penrose to promote the Irish music industry. I believe the issue would be best considered by the proposed joint Oireachtas committee broadcasting forum to which the Minister, Deputy Naughten, referred earlier. This would give all stakeholders, musicians, broadcasters and policy-makers an opportunity to consider how best to promote Irish music in such a manner that benefits all. Therefore, I urge Deputies not to support the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill. Moreover, I encourage Members to engage with the broadcasting forum on this important issue in due course.</p>

          <p eId="para_1017"> In many ways the debate is a reflection of our culture. Some of us have two left feet or do not have a note in our heads.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">We come from families that are steeped in music where those who have talent play music and those who can write compose music. It is part of what culture is in Ireland. When this Dáil first met, we heard about the new possibilities offered by new politics. I am disappointed, therefore, to hear the Minister, Deputy Naughten, shutting ideas down. I am sure he does not mean to be snide, but I do not think it becomes him, as someone who was bristling with vision, to narrow this down as he has done.</p>

          <p eId="para_1023">I did not disturb the Minister. For a long time during an earlier Dáil, I shared an office and subsequently a corridor with the former Deputy and current President, Michael D. Higgins. Nobody is saying that the Labour Party in government is perfect, but when we went into government in the 1990s we created the first ever culture Ministry in this country with the total backing of my colleague, Deputy Penrose. That is how far it goes back. People said that TG4 was in some way a figment of the Labour Party. I remind the House that Dessie O'Malley said that Michael D. Higgins would "go mad" as a Minister in government. Michael D. Higgins brought forward a vision of an engaged and active Irish culture with massive participation from every community around the country. We need to be clear that this is about our culture. Unless we can hear and play our own music and thereby help our artists and writers to get a stream of income from that music, we will not have the richness, depth and participation that has been a part of the vision in this House over the decades since we first created a Ministry for communications and culture. I remind the Minister, Deputy Naughten, that he should be very honoured to inherit part of that responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024"> I want to take issue with a specific paragraph in the Minister's speech. He said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1025"> The wording refers to musical composition that relates to some distinguishing element of the culture of the island of Ireland. Who is to decide what those distinguishing elements are to be? For example, will it encompass electronica music such as techno, ambient or downtempo? Furthermore, in a multi-cultural society such as we have now, how should we treat music written or enjoyed by those Irish citizens of African, eastern European or South American heritage?</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">For God's sake, what civil servant wrote that stuff? I suggest that whoever wrote that is creating a problem in Irish society where there is none. Has the Minister ever heard of Phil Lynott or Thin Lizzy? Has he ever walked to the top of Grafton Street to see the statue? If he stood beside it, he might feel like doing a little bit of air guitar as the Taoiseach once did. Has the Minister ever heard of Ruth Negga, who is an Irish-Ethiopian? We were delighted to learn recently that she is potentially about to receive an award in America for her cultural achievements and acting skills. What about Paul McGrath? For heaven's sake, we need to move on from an outdated and jaded image of Ireland that is not inclusive of all the different strands that go back to the Tuatha Dé Danann and make us what we are. We are an inclusive culture. I do not attribute the Minister's remarks to him personally. The language used in his speech is not the language I would associate with him. Somebody wrote it for him. When one becomes a Minister - Deputy Penrose and I have been there - it can go to one's head. One can be over-impressed by people who put words in one's hands that one is then required to parrot here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027"> I would like to get to the essence of this issue by referring to a line of the speech given by the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne. He said that the commitments to Irish playlists "form part of the individual licence of each broadcaster and are monitored by the BAI on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance". I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to speak with their own voices and in their own language. I do not know what kind of globalised American English this is, but it is certainly not Irish English as it is spoken in this country. It is disingenuous to make the suggestion we heard from the Minister of State. The essence of Deputy Penrose's Bill is that Irish music should have playlist opportunities in peak times. He is flexible on the issue of peak times. Perhaps this could apply from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. or from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The Deputy has had a look at what happens in other jurisdictions and at how this is operable. I hear people like Liam Ó Maonlaí and Fiachna Ó Braonáin on RTE late at night and early in the morning. A former Member of this House, Pat Rabbitte, used to say that late-night politics programmes were for insomniacs and others. I am sure everybody involved in politics listens to the radio late at night and early in the morning as we sort out our thoughts. Deputy Penrose wants serious playtime at peak times.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028"> I dislike the idea that we cannot allow a small Bill like this to go forward for further debate so that it can be pulled apart and put back together again in improved form. It seems to be contrary to new politics, which involves Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Independents facing off against each other and essentially agreeing. The objective of this legislation is for this House to make a statement about Irish culture at this time. It is important to make a commitment to that. I remind the House that musicians and artists are working to make a living and need to have a mechanism to earn that living.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029"> Deputy Neville rightly pointed to all the changes that have happened in music distribution in terms of social media and other media. We are all aware of that. We need to put our minds together to find a means of supporting people in the music industry in Ireland. Deputy Butler suggested that this Bill "is an aggressive measure".</p>

          <p eId="para_1031">What is regressive or indeed aggressive about the notion that Irish music and culture, in the broadest sense, should be reflected in the music that is played on our radio stations? As speakers from all sides of the House have pointed out, many stations already do this. RTE television gives a lot of attention to music, but there is certainly not enough Irish music on RTE daytime radio.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032"> The Minister, Deputy Naughten, made a slightly snide comment when he spoke about the French quota, which has existed for a long period of time. He mentioned that the quota used in France "requires air play of music in the French language" - I remind him that it relates to the arts in general - and suggested that a similar quota here would cause problems in an English-speaking country. I really do not understand that one. I go to an Irish music festival in France every year for a couple of days. It is popular among people coming from the Willie Clancy festival. Deputies may be aware that the Willie Clancy week in Clare is called the "wet Willie" and the week in France is called the sunshine one or the warm one. The finest Irish musicians are feted every year when they go to the Dordogne, Lorient and other places. Our music is part of the draw for the French tourists whom we all welcome. If we do not ensure our children have opportunities at school and in their homes to experience Irish music by hearing it on the radio, we are at serious risk of diminishing the amazing cultural heritage we have inherited.</p>

          <from>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Paschal Donohoe)<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T20:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1046">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_1047"> Deputies will be aware that this is a somewhat technical Bill so my comments will, inevitably, be technical in nature. However, I am sure they will spur a broader debate on budgetary policy, in which I will happily engage, both in this House and outside it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048"> I want to start by explaining that the Bill is an essential element of financial housekeeping that must be concluded by the Dáil this year. It has two primary purposes. First, the Bill is necessary to authorise in law all of the expenditure that has been undertaken in 2016 on the basis of the Estimates that have already been voted on by the Dáil during the year. The amounts included in the Bill all relate to amounts included in the Revised Estimates for 2016 of €44.2 billion in aggregate, voted on by the Dáil in April and July this year, as well as the Supplementary Estimates of €400 million agreed by the Dáil last week. These Estimates were subject to consideration by the relevant select committee, or on the floor of the House, before being agreed by the Dáil. These Estimates provided capital funding for necessary repair work to transport infrastructure arising from flood damage at the start of the year, expenditure arising on school building works and additional funding for the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. In addition, the Supplementary Estimates reflected the element of the Christmas bonus to long-term social welfare recipients funded from the Social Protection Vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049"> Taking into account expenditure of the Social Insurance Fund and the National Training Fund, gross voted expenditure is forecast to total €56.1 billion in 2016, in line with the estimate set out in the expenditure report for 2017, published on budget day in October. This represents a 2.75% increase on the 2015 out-turn. The expenditure report outlines that gross voted expenditure is to increase by just over 3% in 2017. Given the need for the continuation of a responsible approach to fiscal and expenditure policy, these increases are both prudent and sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050"> The second purpose of the Bill is to provide a legal basis for spending to continue into 2017. The passage of the Bill allows continued funding, in the period before the Dáil votes on the 2017 Estimates, of social welfare payments from the Social Protection Vote, Exchequer pay and pensions and other voted expenditure. Additionally, under the rolling multi-annual capital envelopes introduced in budget 2004, Departments may carry over, from the current year to the following year, unspent capital up to a maximum of 10% of voted capital. This is designed to improve effectiveness and efficiency. It recognises the difficulties inherent in the planning process and the profiling of capital expenditure. This facility allows for a portion of unspent moneys, which have been lost to the capital programmes and projects concerned under the annual system of allocating capital, to be made available for spending on programme priorities in the following year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051"> The Act determines definitively the capital amounts which may be carried over to the following year. In the Bill we are discussing, the aggregate amount of proposed capital carryover is just under €76.5 million, which represents less than 2% of the total Exchequer capital programme of €4.2 billion for 2016. In 2015 an amount of just under €112 million in capital expenditure savings was carried over into the following year. The amount of €4.2 billion allocated to capital expenditure in 2016 represents an increase of over 10% on gross voted capital expenditure in 2015. The expenditure report for 2017 sets out a capital expenditure amount of €4.5 billion for 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052"> The proposed amounts in unspent capital to be carried over by Vote are set out in Schedule 2 of the Bill. The 2017 Revised Estimates volume, to be presented to the House and circulated to Deputies tomorrow, will set out detailed financial and key performance information for Departments and offices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053"> Deputies will also be aware that certain Exchequer pay and pensions and social welfare payments, in particular child benefit, are due for payment by electronic funds transfer on 3 January 2017. With the banking system closed on 2 January 2017, funding will need to be in place in departmental bank accounts by 30 December 2016 to meet those liabilities on a timely basis. In addition, An Post needs to be pre-funded before the end of 2016 in respect of these child benefit payments due in the first week of next year in order to convert electronic funds transfer payments from the Department of Social Protection into real cash and physically transfer it to its network of post offices throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054"> These Exchequer pay and pension and social welfare payments will form part of the supply services for 2017 and, consequently, the funds to cover these costs will be included in amounts disbursed from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General's supply account as part of the 2017 supply issues. These costs will come under moneys voted by the Dáil in 2017 in respect of which the usual processes and mechanisms for voted moneys in that year will apply. However, as the funds need to be available in the Paymaster General's supply account before the end of the year in order to facilitate timely payment, section 3 of the Appropriation Bill includes a specific provision to allow for an advance from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General's supply account. Any amounts advanced to the supply account would then be repaid to the Central Fund in January. The Bill provides that the amounts so advanced shall not exceed €200 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055"> I hope this gives Deputies a flavour of the contents of this Bill which is, as I have explained, a technical one but one which is vital to the prudent management of the public finances. I remarked at the outset that the Bill is an essential element of housekeeping which those of us in Dáil Éireann are required to undertake.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">The passing of the Bill will authorise in law all of the expenditure undertaken in 2016 on the basis of the Estimates voted in by the Dáil during that year; ensures that payments funded from voted expenditure in 2016, such as jobseeker's allowance, disability allowance, non-contributory State pension, nurses' pay, teachers' pay and any other pay and pensions funded from voted money can continue to be funded in 2017 in the period before the Dáil approves the Estimates of that year. It meets the technicalities of the Bill as I have described them and as I have told the House the passage of this Bill takes place after the approval of additional Estimates by the House last week and provides the underpinning to allow the State on behalf of the Oireachtas to make available social welfare payments and income supports to families and citizens across the country in the early part of next year. </p>

        <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_489">
          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T20:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1057">I thank the Minister. We will be supporting the Bill. There is not exactly a rapt Dáil Chamber here, which is extraordinary given that we are approving the expenditure of so much money. It is important to reflect that this Bill is the end of a process in terms of the scrutiny of the Supplementary Estimates by committees in recent weeks, and the important consideration that was given in the course of the Social Welfare Bill 2016 to the payments the Minister has mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058"> In advance of next year's planned expenditure review, I take this opportunity to speak about expenditure generally. The Minister referred to the need to make the Government expenditure process more robust. There have been annual Supplementary Estimates for the Department of Health, something that we will no longer be able to do from next year yet the health service has gone beyond creaking at the seams. The seams are broken, as we can see in the pressure on accident and emergency departments, despite that continued injection of money. I hope the process next year will involve a review of how we determine expenditure ceilings for each Department to make them more accurate, relevant and accountable and make those in charge of them more accountable. Is it worthwhile having a discussion and maybe bringing in penalties where expenditure ceilings are breached? If the process is robust and they are discussed and scrutinised enough there needs to be a consequence when they are breached, otherwise the process is undermined. I understand and know, having been through the process and through the most recent budget process, that calculating expenditure ceilings is exceptionally challenging in many Departments. I include the Departments of Health and Social Protection, which we are discussing this evening. This evening we also have an allocation for flood defences. It is very difficult at times to anticipate expenditure. We need, however, to take our responsibilities as fiscal monitors more seriously and be far more responsible about expenditure ceilings. </p>
          <p eId="para_1059"> The idea behind the multi-annual expenditure ceiling was to move away from the past where the expenditure was set on a short-term year to year basis. This system offered very little control over Government expenditure and as a result when the crisis hit it seemed much more difficult to regain control of the country’s finances. Multi-annual expenditure ceilings were introduced to ensure that Governments would think in a more long-term and strategic way about budgeting, to provide relevant Departments and their Ministers with a clearer picture of the resources available to them over several years rather than just one. In short, they were brought in to provide control of Government finances but also to allow short, medium and long-term planning for Government programmes. The current framework requires Government to set expenditure ceilings over a three-year period. It sets upper limits for each Department based on an expenditure benchmark. The system, however, is flawed and does not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060"> In a recent report the Fiscal Advisory Council was explicit that the current system of expenditure ceilings is not working. In many of the budgets since 2011 the actual out-turn of expenditure has been greater than was budgeted. The council says that for 2018 and 2019 currently planned expenditure already exceeds the ceilings and therefore upward revisions to ceilings are likely to be required. That suggests the ceilings were either too low or expenditure is getting more difficult to control. We have to have a discussion and make choices about that. In many ways the Fiscal Advisory Council operates in a space where it does not have to consider the complexities of that process. We had a discussion with it at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight yesterday where it accepted that it operates in an environment very different from ours. We need, however, to have fiscal and expenditure discipline because that is one of the lessons that should surely have been learned in recent years. We need to have a sense that medium and long-term plans are properly funded in advance and the funding is there to allow those plans to come to fruition and make the impact that we all hope they will make. We are also realistic enough to know that things happen. This time last year, for example, nobody would have anticipated the impact of Brexit on our country's finances over the next three years. Events are often outside our control but that does not take away from the fact that we need a far more robust process and discussion about expenditure ceilings. </p>
          <p eId="para_1061"> I hope we will reach a point where revisions are rare and with the new fiscal rules we have to get to that point because if one Department breaches expenditure ceilings another will have to pay for them. That means a cut in services or plans for another Department. That sets the context for the next six months. It will be a busy year for the Minister in respect of the expenditure review, the capital plan review, public service pay talks, all in the first six months. On the night that is in it we wish him a good break before what lies ahead. Let us learn the lessons of the past few years and not have a situation arise where a Minister has to cut the life out of programmes because of fiscal rectitude. We owe it as legislators to take the lessons of the crash on board in so many areas, be they housing or services, but in respect of expenditure and controlling expenditure we need to get real. </p>

          <p eId="para_1062">I thank Deputy Calleary for his very helpful and constructive contribution. As he has outlined, and as I said, while this is a technical Bill the total expenditure and funding to be made is €44.2 billion, an extraordinary amount of money. I hope the relative lack of debate in the Chamber this evening reflects a consensus on expenditure. If, however, such a consensus has been reached I expect it to change rapidly in the new year.</p>

          <p eId="para_1064">I will indeed. I look forward to putting my side of the case in respect of the use of taxpayers' resources in 2017 and working and debating with colleagues in the House and where possible reaching agreement with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065"> Some critics argue that there has been a huge increase in Government expenditure not planned for or adequately funded. As we move into next year the rate of increase in total expenditure for 2017 will be less than the rate of growth of our entire economy. We are doing that because of the focus on eliminating our deficit so that if the global economy does move into more turbulent waters in the coming weeks, months and years the impact of that on the fortunes of citizens will be reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">That is why we are being so careful in terms of the additional expenditure allocated for next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067"> On the broad point Deputy Calleary made about multi-annual expenditure ceilings I, as one would expect, am committed to finding ways in which they can work better, while acknowledging that they do a lot of good work at the moment. I would like to give an example of that good work, while also pointing to the limitations of that approach that I will have to grapple with in 2017. An example of their good work is that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, is going to embark on a very significant and much needed reform of the quality and costs of the child care sector. The Minister and her Department have an approximate indication of the funding that will be available to them in 2018 and 2019. Of course, that is going to change when the Estimates negotiations for next year take place. However, at least there is some indication of what spending trends could look like in the coming years to provide some more certainty around policy choices that could be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068"> The expenditure ceilings also have limitations. As Deputy Calleary acknowledged, their first limitation is dealing with the unexpected. If the Government had not made an additional €100 million available to deal with flooded roads and ruined bridges earlier on in the year, we would have justifiably been criticised for not doing so when the damage of that flooding became apparent. While there has been some criticism of the additional funding that was supplied to the Department of Health across 2016, I am sure that the criticism of policy failures or difficulties in the latter half of this year would have been greater if that funding had not been made available to the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069"> There are also limitations relating to policy changes that governments may make. Ministers change and governments change. I believe it is absolutely essential to the vitality of our democratic institutions that if a Minister changes or a Government comes in with a new outlook, they have the flexibility to reflect their own policy views or the views of those who elected them. If we reach a point at which such latitude is not available to governments, whatever benefits that may be gained by fiscal rectitude will be quickly dispersed by the further undermining of supports that people have stemming from how governments function and spend taxpayers' money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070"> I will conclude on that point. In this job, I never know when I am going to have the opportunity to address the House next, but if I do not have that opportunity before the end of the year, I want to wish Deputy Calleary, Deputy Munster and all of the Deputies that I have worked with across 2016 and their families a happy Christmas and a peaceful new year. I thank all of the staff and the Ceann Comhairle for all of their work across the year. I will certainly be taking Deputy Calleary's advice and I will be having a break. I offer that advice to everybody else here tonight.</p>

          <p eId="para_1078">No, that is alright. I thank the Ceann Comhairle.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079"> As I had only just begun my response to these amendments when we ran out of time yesterday, I would like to begin by again thanking both Deputies Troy and Munster for tabling these amendments to extend the list of drugs listed in the Bill. I am fully sympathetic with their intent and I do believe the list will grow in the future. I would like to explain why this is not the time to do it and why, when they are looked at closely, both amendments would unintentionally undermine rather than extend the law on drug-driving. The same attitude applies to virtually all of the amendments on Report Stage, that is, that nearly all of them are aspirations I share.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">However, there are difficulties with the drafting and there would be, quite understandably, unintended consequences if we were to accept them in their entirety. I am learning on the job myself that road traffic legislation is extremely complicated and very difficult to get right. If there are any drafting problems, this can give rise to unintended consequences which we cannot accept and obviously cannot allow into law. That said, I am happy to work with those Deputies who have tabled amendments which we cannot accept for those reasons. I am happy to push them further and include their provisions in future road traffic Bills. There are almost always road traffic Bills pending or being drafted by officials in my Department. </p>
          <p eId="para_1081"> I will now remind the House of what the law already says on drug-driving. It is an offence under the Road Traffic Act 2010 to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence of any intoxicant to such an extent as to be incapable of controlling the vehicle. The law covers legal and illegal drugs. If gardaí find a person driving while intoxicated, a specimen will be taken for testing by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS. The bureau tests for 42 different drugs. This covers the whole range of drugs likely to be found and to cause intoxication in drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082"> The law as it stands also has quite a different offence in it, namely, driving while over the limit for alcohol. In this case, the prosecution needs to prove only that a driver was over the legal limit, not that he or she was actually impaired. This Bill is putting three drugs, cannabis, cocaine and heroin on the same basis as alcohol by setting legal limits for drivers for these drugs. It will be an offence to be driving while over this limit without any need to prove impairment. This is a major step forward in Irish law. It will still be an offence to be impaired due to any other drug and as I said, the bureau's wide-ranging tests will identify all likely drugs. </p>
          <p eId="para_1083"> I have selected three drugs, cannabis, cocaine and heroin, based on the best scientific advice. I am not sure why Deputy Troy believes that my proposals are based on 16 year old evidence. They are based on detailed discussions with the MBRS during 2015 and further ongoing discussions with the bureau since then. The bureau's advice is clear. Setting specific levels for drugs is extremely difficult and inevitably the evidence base for drug-driving internationally lags far behind what is available for dealing with alcohol. The bureau is clear that it is possible to set scientifically reliable levels for these three drugs now but not for others. It is not that we do not want to include other drugs. We do and we will, as and when the scientific basis for doing so exists. The time is not yet right and the evidence basis is not yet there to extend the list today. </p>
          <p eId="para_1084"> I also believe that accepting either of the proposed amendments could have a damaging effect on drug-driving law. To take Deputy Munster's proposal first, it would replace the list of drugs and levels agreed with the bureau with a new list. The proposed list would double the level of cannabis recommended by the bureau and would remove cannabis acid from the Bill. This is a by-product of cannabis which is often traceable when the original drug is not. The effect of taking it out would be to make it easier, not harder, to get away with driving after taking a serious quantity of cannabis. The other drugs in Deputy Munster's list also present a few problems. For example, the proposed limit for flunitrazepam is set at 300g/L but I understand that it is possible to be seriously impaired well below that level. This presents a risk that persons charged under the existing offence of being under the influence of an intoxicant could argue in their defence that they were under the legal limit. </p>
          <p eId="para_1085"> Deputy Troy is proposing to amend the Schedule of drugs in the Bill by introducing a link to Part 1 of Schedule 6 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. This would bring all of the drugs in that Schedule into the new presence only offence being created in the Bill. There are several reasons this could cause serious problems. First, the Misuse of Drugs Act is focused on the dangers posed by drugs while road traffic legislation is about road safety. Many of the drugs listed in the Misuse of Drugs Act may be addictive and damaging to human health but are not necessarily of relevance to safe driving. This would create confusion between drug enforcement law and road traffic law and would require the Garda traffic bureau to spend time dealing with drugs which have no relevance to traffic. I have said that it is important to proceed on the basis of sound scientific evidence. When it comes to the drugs in the Misuse of Drugs Act we do not have, in many cases, the scientific evidence base to tie them to road safety dangers, much less to contemplate setting appropriate limits for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086"> The proposal to allow me, as Minister, to set levels for these drugs in regulations is not likely to be constitutional. Members may remember the Bederev judgment. In that case, it was found that the practice of allowing the Minister for Justice and Equality to add drugs to the list of illegal substances by way of regulation was unconstitutional. Only the Oireachtas can create an offence. It cannot be done in regulations. As Deputy Troy's amendment stands, it asks the Minister to set levels for drugs and being over those levels would be an offence. A Minister cannot do that, constitutionally, which is precisely why we are setting levels for each drug in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087"> Deputy Troy's suggestions are fine. I do not have much of a problem with them, with many of the other suggestions for the Bill or with the list but the point is that the Minister cannot make such regulations. To do so would mean that the Bill would be open to constitutional challenge. We do not want the Bill to be open to such a challenge. That is the problem with some of the amendments. We do not want any part of this Bill to be subject to legal challenge. It would be very detrimental to the entire Bill and could delay it for a very long time. </p>
          <p eId="para_1088"> I am happy that we are taking the right approach at this stage with a limited number of illicit drugs being included in our new presence only offence. Setting drug levels is complicated and requires careful scientific review. Expanding the list of drugs and limits is not something we would want to rush into at this time. The drugs covered by the new law will be kept under review and once the new system has bedded down we will consider, with the MBRS, whether to expand it based on the operational experience gained and any further advances within the scientific community with regard to setting appropriate threshold levels for other substances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089"> Deputy Munster asked on Committee Stage for an assurance that the list would be expanded within a year. If we are to rely on scientific evidence, which we should, then it is not possible to guarantee when the scientific evidence will have advanced to the point where we can add more drugs to the list. However, I can promise that when the evidence is there, we will definitively act on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1090">The beauty of being on that side of the House is that one has an army of officials to help one to draft legislation, unlike those of us on this side of the House. We put forward amendments in good faith in the hope that we were improving the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091"> I seek some clarification from the Minister because my understanding is that when this Bill was originally brought before the last Dáil, when I was not in my current role and the Minister was not in his, a more comprehensive list of illegal drugs was included. If that is the case, why are we now curtailing the list of drugs for which a person can be tested at the side of the road? </p>
          <p eId="para_1092"> My amendment states that the Minister will, "upon commencement of this Act, in conjunction with the Garda Commissioner, make regulations specifying the minimum Levels (units in whole blood) in respect of each drug specified at reference number 6 in column 1 of the Schedule." Does that not give the Minister an opportunity to accept the amendment and to work on it at a later stage, in conjunction with the Garda Commissioner and bring forward a statutory instrument outlining and specifying the drugs? The Minister is correct that the types of drugs people are taking are continuously evolving and what we are doing in this legislation is far too restrictive in that context.</p>

          <p eId="para_1093">I thank the Deputy who is right. I do have a certain advantage in that I have officials beside me to brief me, but it is necessary, particularly in areas which are so complicated, to have people advise me on issues, although not on policy, on which I am at one with the Deputy on this issue. We are all together on policy. They advise me on the consequences of something which has been drafted in good faith but which, in effect, is open to legal challenge, unconstitutional or will have unintended consequences. Unfortunately, that is the case in this instance. I do not think there was a more comprehensive list available. I am advised that when the original Bill was introduced, there was not one. Like the Deputy, I would like to see a more comprehensive list and hope he will accept my assurances that, in time, there will be, but I cannot accept an amendment which asks me to do something which it has already been decided is unconstitutional. I know that he will understand this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094"> To be clear, the Garda will be able to test for 95% of drugs found in drivers. They include the majority of drugs included in Deputy Imelda Munster's list. I point out to the Deputy that in the United Kingdom the police only test for two drugs, namely, cannabis and cocaine. We will be testing for these two drugs, plus all of the opiate drugs and the different benzodiazepines set out in the Deputy's list and which Deputy Robert Troy aspires to include in the Bill. This is possibly the most important part of the Bill because it is its nexus.</p>

          <p eId="para_1095">I will accept what the Minister has said because he has the legal advice available to him. My one concern is that while he might have the best will in the world in terms of amending the Bill at a later stage, he might have a difficulty in securing time on the floor of the House because if we do not pass the Bill by 10 p.m., I understand it will be the new year before we will be able to come back to conclude it. The purpose in having the legislation go through on Report and Final Stages is that we will have had an opportunity to make amendments to improve it. That is what we are doing. I accept that perhaps it is not being done in the most appropriate manner in this regard, but the reason we have tabled amendments is to try to improve the legislation. I will take the Minister's ruling that he cannot accept this amendment because it would be unconstitutional, but I hope he will approach subsequent amendments we table in a more open manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_1157">I move amendment No. 4:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1158">In page 18, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1159">
            <b>“Amendment of section 2 of Road Traffic Act 2004</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1160"><b>22. </b>The Road Traffic Act 2004, is amended in section 2, by the insertion of the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1161">“ ‘housing estate’ means an area consisting of a self-contained group of dwellings with a single or multiple entry points for mechanically propelled vehicles;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1162">‘residential road’ means a road, whether public or private, within an area defined as a housing estate.”.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163">Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 primarily deal with the matter of road safety, particularly for children and pedestrians in residential areas, including housing estates. Concerns raised were addressed through the Jake's Legacy campaign and also in Jake's law, but the main concern, as we are all aware, is speeding in residential areas which is a daily problem and not being addressed. While serious issues arise regarding local authorities providing funding to implement road safety measures, including ramps, chicanes and signage, what also needs to be looked at is the better design of residential estates to try to curb speeding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164"> On Committee Stage it was mentioned that local authorities had no powers to implement speed limits in housing estates that had not been taken in charge. There are thousands of such estates. This poses a real problem for their residents. I note that the Minister makes provision in the Bill for a 20 km/h speed limit, which is to be welcomed. However, will he commit to making a progress report or providing statistics in a year's time in the context of the requests to have a 20 km/h speed limit in residential areas and also for the compliance rate of local authorities? That would allow us gauge the success of the measure or determine if we needed to strengthen it. Local authorities use every excuse about having to combine many by-laws and so on. This causes delays, but where requests are made to have a 20 km/h speed limit through local authorities, I hope they will implement it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1165">I support amendments Nos. 4 and 5 and express the wish that we can get through the legislation by 10 p.m. because when I spoke on Second Stage, I welcomed the Bill which I described as a positive measure in promoting road safety. I also said it was a missed opportunity, particularly in the context of Jake's law, to impose a mandatory 20 km/h speed limit in housing estates. I had hoped the Minister might see his way to bring forward an amendment in that regard, but he has stuck with the provision included in the Bill which provides an option for local authorities. I do not believe, however, that they have shown their ability to implement a 20 km/h or even a 30 km/h speed limit. Not only is a 20 km/h speed limit needed, but we also need better road engineering and design, including in private housing estates, to ensure the safety of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166"> I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of members of the PARC organisation which has been campaigning since 2006 on the issue of road safety and which has been very successful in that regard. On an annual basis it has updated the booklet, Finding Your Way, which is hugely beneficial to families and those who have been involved in road traffic accidents.</p>

          <p eId="para_1167">I echo the comments made by Deputy Seamus Healy on finishing the Bill tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168">It is so important to get the key elements of this Bill on the Statute Book as an additional armoury for the Garda Síochána and the RSA. I hope the Minister will continue to work for a consolidated traffic law to bring together the key elements of law. He stated this is a difficult area and perhaps it needs to be simplified and codified better so that no citizen, garda, member of the RSA or anybody else would be in any doubt as to what are the provisions of the traffic law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169"> I support strongly Deputy Munster's amendments Nos. 4 and 5. Approximately 18 years ago, I proposed, at Dublin City Council, that we would have something similar to the home zones which the Netherlands and some of our other European neighbours have, where on going into an estate, the speed limit reduces to what in those days was 25 mph or approximately 30 km/h. The roll-out so far, recently, by Dublin City Council, of the speed limit of 30 km/h or 50 km/h between the canals, is valuable. Every driver should know precisely what the speed limit is and it should be clear on every road on which one travels. That is the work of the local authorities. Also, in a previous traffic Bill, I helped to insert a 40 km/h limit - the old 25 mph limit. Local authorities should not be afraid of using that and I support those amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170"> With Deputy Healy, I warmly welcome the members of the Promoting Awareness Responsibility and Care, PARC, road safety campaigning group which is in the Gallery, in particular, Ms Susan Gray, Ms Ann Fogarty, Mr. Noel Clancy, Ms Fiona Clancy, Mr. Declan Clancy, Mr. Alec Lee, Mr. David Walsh, Ms Louise Doyle, Mr. John Fleming and Mr. James Regan who have campaigned so hard for so many of the measures that are coming forward in this Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Shane Ross<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T21:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1172">Obviously, I share the House's wish to get this important Bill finished. Every day that it is delayed there is the potential for loss of life but I do not want to make it bad legislation by rushing it through. We have debated quite a lot of this previously but there are important issues here, particularly in this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173"> Deputy Munster's request is reasonable. I will certainly ask for a report on this after one year, if this amendment is withdrawn or if the Bill goes through in its present form. It is fair enough that we should look at how it is working and whether the options are being exercised by the local authorities on 20 km/h. I would certainly be happy to do that. I am not sure what sort of report would do. I might ask the Road Safety Authority or someone to do it. I will talk to Deputy Munster about it afterwards, if she likes. We will find an independent body to have a look and report to us on how it is working.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174"> I also welcome those long-time crusaders in the Gallery who crusaded for road safety for so long and their interest in this Bill. We all agree that speeding is one of the main causes of death and serious injury on our roads. Tackling speeding means setting appropriate speed limits for all areas, enforcing those limits and, above all, getting the message across to all drivers of the risk they pose to themselves and others by speeding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175"> Deputy Munster is proposing to make a speed limit of 20 km/h mandatory in housing estates. What I have proposed in the Bill is different, as Deputy Munster acknowledges. The Bill gives local authorities the option of imposing a 20 km/h speed limit where they believe it is appropriate. I appreciate the motivation behind Deputy Munster's amendment - we are on the same page - but I do not agree that her amendment is the way to go forward at present. I certainly will look at it and report back within a year. There are several reasons for this. First, we have what I think is a sound principle in law, as it currently operates, that local authorities decide what is the appropriate speed for a given road in their area. These roads can vary enormously, with visibility, straightness and other factors which affect the question of what is a safe speed. While the law sets blanket limits for motorways on the main national routes, this is because all of these roads are built to defined standards. The variety of roads covered by local authorities means that each road needs to be looked at in its own terms and the law has always rightly conferred this task on the local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176"> Deputy Munster may argue that she is applying this specifically to housing estates. This brings me to the first of a number of additional reasons I believe that it would be a mistake to put the amendment the Deputy has proposed into law. Definitions in law are notoriously difficult to make precise, particularly in road traffic law. The definition of "housing estate" in Deputy Munster's proposed amendment is problematic. As proposed, a "housing estate" is defined as "an area consisting of a self-contained group of dwellings with a single or multiple entry points for mechanically propelled vehicles". This would definitely not work. It could mean both an apartment complex or Dublin's North Circular Road.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177"> Next we come to the question of where the Deputy proposes to make the amendment. Section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 deals with special speed limits. These are precisely the kind of optional speed limits on which local authorities can decide to which I referred earlier. At present, the default speed limit for roads under local authority jurisdiction is 50 km/h, with authorities allowed, by section 9, to apply special speed limits of 40 km/h or 30 km/h. My proposal, as stated in the Bill, is to add the option of a 20 km/h limit. I note in passing that Deputy Munster's amendment would keep the 30 km/h limit but drop the option of a 40 km/h limit. In any case, Deputy Munster's amendment, if accepted, would include a mandatory 20 km/h limit as one of the optional limits in section 9. This would, obviously inadvertently, be confusing if not contradictory. We would have legislation that would state that among the options for a local authority was a mandatory one. I need hardly point out that this would make the operation of section 9 completely impossible since it would become contradictory. The net effect would be that local authorities, quite unintentionally, would not be able to use section 9 and all roads in their areas would have to be left at the default speed limit of 50 km/h.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178"> Finally, one key issue which was highlighted by the Jake's Legacy campaign which the amendment does not address is the question of what happens where developments have not yet been taken in charge by the local authorities, and Deputy Munster referred to this. This is a matter currently being examined by my Department in consultation with the Attorney General's office and I look forward to it being properly addressed when that process is concluded.</p>

          <from>Deputy Imelda Munster<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T21:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1179">I will not press the amendment on the basis that the Minister has included the 20 km/h speed limit but it needs to be enacted and there is an onus on every local authority that has requests for the 20 km/h speed limit in housing estates and residential areas to implement it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180"> It is not only speed signage that needs to go up in estates. In fairness, this is where the Department is lacking in funding of local authorities for road safety measures. A sign itself is not enough. We need resources for the traffic corps to ensure that those who speed are caught and punished for it. We also need funding to provide ramps, chicanes and other such safety measures within residential areas. The fact the Minister has included the 20 km/h speed limit and that local authorities can now implement it certainly is progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181"> I recognise that defining a housing estate could be problematic. The Minister gave the example of there being no clarity around five houses on a dual carriageway.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182"> Certainly, the fact that it is there is a significant step forward for the campaigners. The onus is on the Minister to ensure that when requests are made, the local authorities need to implement those or it will come straight back.</p>

          <p eId="para_1185">I move amendment No. 6:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1186">In page 24, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1187">
            <b>“Regulation of Rickshaws</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1188"><b>31. </b>The Taxi Regulation Act 2013, is amended in section 20, by the insertion of the following subsection:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1189">“(5) (a) The Authority may make regulations, to be known as nonmotorised passenger transport regulations, in relation to the operation of non-motorised passenger transporters in towns and cities.</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1190">(b) ‘non-motorised passenger transporters’ means hackney carriage or rickshaw propelled by pedal cycle, pedal tricycle, horse, pedestrian or other such non-motorised means.”.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">This amendment relates to rickshaws. Currently, there is no legislation covering rickshaws. The rickshaw operators are essentially classed as cyclists, yet they carry passengers and work on a commercial basis. Consider that for a moment. Taxi drivers and bus drivers are taxed, insured, licensed and regulated, but the rickshaw operators both carry passengers and work on a commercial basis in the absence of legislation or regulation. They are not obliged to be registered. The authorities have no idea how many rickshaws are operating as there is no register. It is a massive road safety issue in so far as the operator has no insurance or insurance for the passengers they carry. If there is an accident involving a rickshaw and passengers are seriously injured, the rickshaw operator has no insurance to cover whatever damage is caused. There is huge risk for the passengers, as well as other road safety issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192"> In fairness, I raised this matter with the Minister early last July and he said he was examining the introduction of legislation. He also said the NTA was getting legal advice on it. I do not know whether the Minister or the NTA is dragging their heels on the matter but it appears to be taking a long time, given that huge problems are caused by rickshaws. There were reports recently in some local media, although I do not know to what extent they are accurate, that some rickshaw operators were dealing in drugs and using the rickshaws as a means of getting drugs across the city. What would put that idea into their heads? It is the absence of legislation. Every day they get on their rickshaws and operate from one end of the city to the other carrying passengers, knowing that nobody is taking a blind bit of notice of them and certainly not the authorities or regulators. If it is the case that they are involved in drug dealing and are using the rickshaws to get drugs across the city, it is because they have had a free hand. They are allowed to operate at will as there is no legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193"> I am sure the Minister will vote against the amendment, but its inclusion in the Bill would allow the NTA to regulate. I cannot see a reason for the Minister opposing it when its acceptance would provide an opportunity to the NTA to regulate rickshaws.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RobertTroy" eId="spk_515">
          <from>Deputy Robert Troy<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T21:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1194">I have tabled an amendment in this regard. I also tabled it on Committee Stage. At present, no agency or public body has the authority to regulate rickshaws. The NTA, which regulates small public service vehicles such as taxis or hackneys, cannot regulate rickshaws because a public service vehicle is defined as a vehicle that is mechanically propelled. Likewise, Dublin City Council and other councils do not have the authority to regulate or license rickshaws because they are not pedal-powered vehicles. I understand there are three types of rickshaw - some are pedal powered, some are operated by a throttle and some are operated by a combination of pedal and battery. In 2013, Dublin City Council made draft by-laws to try to introduce regulation for rickshaws. Obviously it did so because it was aware of the difficulty they present in the capital city. Rickshaw operators have now moved out to other large urban areas as well. However, the draft by-laws were withdrawn on legal advice, because the great majority of rickshaws are neither pedal nor mechanically powered but battery assisted. This means that under the current legislative definitions they are not small public service vehicles, which are defined as mechanically propelled vehicles. Hence, the NTA is not authorised to regulate them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195"> Our proposed amendments alter the definition of small public service vehicles to include battery powered, pedal powered and non-mechanically powered vehicles. This creates a new category of public service vehicle called "public service rickshaws". It includes all rickshaws, mechanically powered, manually powered and cycled. This closes the legal lacuna and means the NTA will be the authorised body for regulating rickshaws across the country. The amendments also oblige the NTA to make certain regulations in respect of rickshaws. The amendments afford the Minister the opportunity to work with the NTA on bringing forward comprehensive regulations to deal with this matter. They do not tie the Minister's hands in terms of specifying what those regulations should be, but give him the opportunity, if he accepts them, to work with the NTA on introducing regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196"> As my colleague said earlier, there is no regulation at present. An increasing number of people are using rickshaws as a means of getting from A to B. No character check is carried out on the people who are carrying passengers in the rickshaws. They might be convicted of rape or murder, or be the most unsavoury characters. I am not saying the majority are. In fact, I am sure the majority are genuine, decent, ordinary, hard working people who are just trying to earn a livelihood. However, there is no character reference so people getting into these rickshaws have no confidence in the person operating it. We would not allow that in the case of taxis or buses, so I see no reason to allow it in the case of rickshaws. There are also no inspections carried out on the roadworthiness of the vehicle. A person could be getting into a vehicle that is extremely dangerous. Again, that would not be permitted with a taxi, so why allow it with this type of public service vehicle? In fact, taxi drivers are put through a rigorous process to ensure their vehicle is roadworthy. Rickshaw operators are competing with taxi drivers each day, particularly for short hop-on, hop-off fares around the capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197"> Rickshaws have no insurance. God forbid, if anybody was involved in an accident in one, and left paralysed or, worse, killed, there is no insurance. This Bill is an opportunity. When it was brought before the committee a number of weeks ago I was on Newstalk to discuss why we had tabled this amendment. I was surprised at the number of people who contacted me afterwards. They were genuine people. One person told me that he could not get a job so he had used his savings as he saw operating a rickshaw as an opportunity to make a few bob. I said: "More luck to you". I outlined what we were trying to do and he told me we were right. "We need to be regulated", he said, "because if we are regulated it puts us on a better footing".</p>
          <p eId="para_1198"> Nobody has anything to fear with this. It is a sensible, logical proposal. Like the case made by my colleague, Deputy Munster, I hope the Minister will accept it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1200">I will brief. We are all used to rickshaws being brought out when there is a big gig, an all-Ireland final, a rugby international or late at night in the city.

          <p eId="para_1201">On a similar note, I wrote to the Minister on this issue last summer and I got a reply. This issue has been highlighted by people who have had bad experiences travelling in rickshaws. We know from other jurisdictions of the outrageous charges being demanded of people by the drivers of rickshaws. Rickshaws are not only a Dublin phenomenon, their use is spreading to other areas. Other colleagues have spoken about the lack of health and safety regulations that apply to this means of transport. Anybody can put a cart together and go out and seek business and he or she can charge anything he or she wants. There are no safety implications. Rickshaw drivers are renowned for travelling in pedestrian only areas. There is a lack of enforcement of regulations on their use. The local authorities are at a loss to know what to do about them. They are looking to us to give leadership on this. That needs to be done. There is anecdotal evidence of people having being injured and involved in crashes when being transported by rickshaws. The drivers have no insurance and no liability. That is very unfair when other transport users pay insurance and ensure their cars are roadworthy. </p>
          <p eId="para_1202"> The use of rickshaws is an increasing phenomenon. Regardless of the drivers' backgrounds, and others have spoken about the danger posed by these individuals, people do not know who they are getting in beside when they travel by rickshaw. They do not know their background. At least there is some regulation of taxi drivers and other transport providers. This issue needs to be addressed. The Minister may say that this issue cannot be dealt with in this legislation but, if not, when will he address it? Clearly, it needs to be addressed.</p>

          <from>Deputy Shane Ross<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T21:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1203">I thank the Deputies for their contributions. I think Deputy Munster used the phrase "if I was not opposed to it". I am not opposed to anything the Deputies have said here. I will accept an amendment later but there are very good reasons this amendment cannot be accepted, although that is regrettable. I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Crowe and by others.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204"> This is a pretty lawless activity and it is not acceptable. I and I am sure others have been subject to this and have seen unregulated vehicles of this sort. It is totally unfair. I regard it as a matter of great urgency. I will tell the Deputies why these amendments are inappropriate and they will probably understand the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205"> I note that both proposals address this matter through amendments to the Taxi Regulation Act. That is the right place to deal with the matter and it is where I propose to deal with it as soon as possible, but it therefore falls outside the scope of the Road Traffic Bill as set out in the Long Title to the Bill. It is in the wrong place to deal with it. This does not mean that I am not accepting responsibility for it, I am, but it is not the right Bill in which to regulate rickshaws.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206"> I am not citing this as a technical way to get out of the issue, because it is my responsibility, but I agree it has to be dealt with. However, I also believe it is important when we come to writing matters into law that we to proceed carefully and correctly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207"> The National Transport Authority, NTA, to which the Deputies have referred, is currently working on a proposed policy and potential framework for the future regulation of rickshaws which it has advised will be submitted to my Department by the end of January next, in just over a month's time. My Department and I will urgently consider the proposals when received with a view to obtaining Government approval to draft the heads of a Bill in the context of the Government's legislative programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1208"> While amendments Nos. 6 and 16 are to the Taxi Regulation Act, Deputy Troy's amendment No. 15 is not. Deputy Troy is proposing to amend the existing definition of a public service vehicle in the Road Traffic Acts and add a definition of "rickshaw". This is quite a sensible suggestion but changing the definition of a term set out in law can have, as we have already seen, many unforeseen consequences and I would be very concerned about the risk of changing such a well established definition as that of a public service vehicle. It would have many knock-on effects. The existing provisions relating to intoxicated driving, in particular with respect to public service vehicle drivers, would be impacted by such a change in the definition and there would be negative implications for these provisions. The definition of a rickshaw proposed around what a rickshaw is not is too wide to be of any meaningful effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209"> I cannot give a definitive timeframe for the introduction of new legislation - it would be dishonest of me to say it will happen in March, May or June but I recognise it is a matter of urgency - until I receive and examine the proposals from the National Transport Authority, which should be within six weeks. I have stressed to the NTA the importance and urgency of submitting its proposals and it has given a timeframe in the early part of the first quarter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210"> I appeal to the Deputies to withdraw their proposals at this point to allow the NTA to develop a comprehensive response and to introduce legislation under the right Act to regulate rickshaws.</p>

          <p eId="para_1213">I do not know whether it was a slip of the tongue or it was genuine but the Minister said initially that the NTA was going to bring forward proposals by the end of January and then he said it would be in the first quarter of 2017. He will then try to get Cabinet approval on the heads of a Bill and try to get space in what will be a tightly sought after space in the new year in terms of getting legislation through. I do not believe we can wait. This Bill was pretty much ready in the first quarter of 2016 and here we are in the dying hours of this Dáil term debating it in the hope that we can get it through before we adjourn. I accept the Minister's bona fides. I put my amendment forward in order that this proposal would be able to go through under this legislation, which in turn would enable the Minister to work with the NTA to bring forward regulations quite quickly. If a rickshaw is not a public service vehicle, then what is? The person who cycles or powers it is carrying members of the public. The public are using these vehicles and are paying to do so. That is a pubic service vehicle. The Minister said that this would have consequences in terms of drink driving. I do not believe that people in control of two or three passengers to the rear of them, whether it be on a bicycle powered by a battery, a motor or a pedal should be under the influence of alcohol in the same way as I do not believe a passenger in the back of a car or bus should be under the influence of alcohol.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214"> This amendment was framed in a manner to enable us to progress this issue. It has been on the agenda too long. In 2013 Dublin City County brought forward by-laws. We are still talking about it and are not giving the authority to the NTA to bring forward regulations. We should move ahead with this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1215">I understand what Deputy Robert Troy is getting at. I am not, however, inclined to agree with him because of the unintended consequences of this and because it is in the wrong Bill. I am somewhat surprised it is in the Bill at all and it was permitted. However, it is there because two of these particular amendments come under the Taxi Regulation Act. The issue will not be resolved just by amending the definition for small public service vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216"> The policy being developed by the National Transport Authority, NTA, will include consideration of several key elements. These include the vehicle standards applicable, the body responsible for testing the vehicles, the licensing of the vehicle for hire for reward, the licensing of the driver and associated suitability criteria, the fare structure, the appropriate vehicle markings to show it is licensed, the enforcement of the requirements and associated penalties. The draft policy will be submitted to the Department - I apologise if I made a mistake earlier - by the end of January for consideration and approval, following which any amending legal provisions will be identified and including, in future, primary legislation which would be a Bill to amend the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217"> If the proposers will agree to amend this, I will certainly bring the results of the NTA report to the House immediately when I get them.</p>

          <p eId="para_1331">I move amendment No. 7:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1332">In page 24, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1333">“<b>31</b>. The Minister shall instruct all motor insurance companies to write to all present and future learner drivers stating that driving unaccompanied by a specified qualified driver and/or without displaying L plates invalidates the terms and conditions of their insurance policy and that any payment made to a third party in the event of a collision may be recouped from the learner driver and/or the main policy holder.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334">Amendments Nos. 7 and 12 attempt to deal with issues that have arisen with regard to drivers on learner permits and the serious level of deaths and casualties which have occurred involving unaccompanied learner drivers. Last year, some 3,200 drivers on learner permits were caught with no qualified driver present. To the end of October 2016, a very large number of penalty points - 10,000 - were applied to learner and novice drivers, which included 6,148 applied to drivers for driving unaccompanied. In amendment No. 7 I was trying to suggest a formula whereby the mere act of driving unaccompanied or without displaying L plates would invalidate the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. A key issue that would arise here is that many drivers on learner permits are named drivers on their parents insurance policies. </p>
          <p eId="para_1335"> What I have asked the Minister to pursue in this regard will be very difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336">Had we been heading for finishing the Bill tonight, I was proposing to ask the Minister for a view on it and then to withdraw it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337"> In amendment No. 12, I proposed to amend section 36 of the principal Act by inserting the section to provide that a driver with a learner permit, without an accompanied specified qualified driver should be deemed in law to be driving without valid motor insurance. The person could, therefore, be arrested by the Garda Síochána and charged with the offence of driving without insurance and the vehicle could be seized on the spot. The Garda Síochána has alerted us to the fact that there is no power to seize the vehicle in this case and that a driver on a learner permit caught in this situation ends up laughing at the garda and driving away unaccompanied. There seems to be a grave lacuna in the law. My Sinn Féin colleagues have tried to address it in other ways. This is one aspect of the issue we could have approached. It is a very serious issue, given that 87 unaccompanied learner drivers died between 2007 and 2012. A distinguished visitor to the Gallery, Mr. Noel Clancy, lost his wife and daughter, who were fatally injured by an unaccompanied learner driver this time last year. It was a colossal tragedy for the Clancy family at this family time of the year. The Minister needs to examine it very seriously and address it. In two amendments, I tried to give one way forward by giving additional powers to the Garda Síochána. There definitely seems to be a lacuna in the law in this regard and I urge the Minister to accept amendment No. 12.</p>

          <p eId="para_1338">The amendment was debated on Committee Stage and I will not go through the case I made. It was driven by a response to the Clancy tragedy this time last year in Cork. Mr. Noel Clancy called on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to implement legislation to the effect that allowing one's car to be driven by an unaccompanied learner driver would be an offence on the part of the car owner. My amendment seeks to address the issue and to be helpful to the Minister. Members of the Clancy family are in the Gallery along with the PARC Road Safety Group and I welcome them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Imelda Munster<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T21:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1339">The proposal brings responsibility to bear on the owner of a vehicle driven by an unaccompanied learner driver which is involved in an accident, not merely the driver. It would put the onus on the car owner to ensure the vehicle is not being driven illegally by a learner driver. Learner drivers operate vehicles unaccompanied. The hope with the amendment is that the owners of the vehicles involved will be liable, thereby reducing the number of unaccompanied learner drivers on the roads.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_528">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh<recordedTime time="2016-12-14T21:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1340">Deputy Tommy Broughan has done a service by proposing the amendments. In the main, young drivers, when learning, understand there is a serious consequence to driving unaccompanied. There is also an onus on us to ensure that when people want to apply for a test, a test is available promptly and that there is a proper insurance regime. Deputy Broughan also addressed the question of the liabilities with insurance. It is important that unaccompanied learner drivers understand they are not insured in any way and that, given that they are breaking the law, they are not covered by insurance, although the victim, if there is a victim, would be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341"> They must also understand that the car, whether their own or their parents', can be seized. Presumably, a fine or a recovery scheme would have to be put in place to ensure the State was not suffering the expense of seizing cars. In the past, when a car was seized and the owner went to recover it from the Garda station, or wherever it was stored, there would have been a payment of sorts to the Garda, which was forced to confiscate the vehicle.</p>
          <p eId="para_1342"> Far too often, I have been driving around the country and seen people with L plates driving on a motorway. One presumes it is perhaps the father driving, not the son or daughter who also has access to the car. However, on looking through the window one quickly notices that it is probably an unaccompanied learner driver. If I can see this on a motorway, I presume the gardaí can also see it. Not enough is done. Of late, there has been a major campaign to try to encourage learners to drive accompanied.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343"> Progress has been made in recent years in terms of insurance products. If they reduced the price, it would be good. Some insurance products specifically tell people that if they exceed a certain speed, which is monitored by a GPS, their insurance premiums will increase substantially. Other policies are based on speed inhibitors. These will work in tandem with a fully licensed driver. While the licensed drivers cannot do everything, they may be able to steer people or explain where they are making mistakes in their driving. Without this, people will take chances and drive. One of the keys is to ensure that many of those who are driving and who want access to driving tests as quickly as possible have this access. Otherwise, people will chance their arm. At least, Deputy Tommy Broughan is ensuring they understand the full consequences if they do chance their arms.</p>

          <p eId="para_1344">I support what my colleagues have said. I will be interested to hear the Minister's rationale for rejecting the amendment. It is a very worthwhile amendment. Unfortunately, there is a family in the Gallery who require this, having suffered an unimaginable tragedy, a fatality because of the lack of such an amendment. As I said at the outset, the reason we have Committee and Report Stages is so we can bring forward amendments to improve and enhance the quality of Bills. The Bill is about improving and enhancing road safety and the amendment would go a long way in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_1345">I will accept an amendment on the issue. I do not know why the Deputies assume I would not. Deputies Brendan Ryan and Imelda Munster proposed amendments to make it an offence for the owner of a vehicle to allow the vehicle to be driven by an unaccompanied learner. Deputy Tommy Broughan has also proposed measures regarding insurance and unaccompanied learners. It raises a very important issue and the law is very clear. A learner permit is a permit permitting somebody to drive without a licence for the purpose of learning. It is not to be treated as a licence, nor do we want to go back to the old culture whereby some people were happy to remain learners for decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346"> Since 2010, a range of measures has been introduced as part of a graduated driver licence system including developments such as mandatory lessons for learners, lower alcohol limits for learner and novice drivers and lower penalty point thresholds. We need people to understand driving is not a right. Taking charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle puts a person in a position of responsibility for his or her own safety, that of any passengers and that of other road users they encounter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1347">This is why we expect people who are still learners to have an accompanying qualified driver.</p>

          <p eId="para_1351">Unfortunately, there is a real and continuing problem of learners who persist in driving unaccompanied. The question of the responsibility of car owners who knowingly allow learners to drive their cars was raised recently by the family of Geraldine and Louise Clancy, who were tragically killed in an incident for which an unaccompanied learner driver was found responsible. I have given some thought to this and I agree that there ought to be a legal responsibility for owners in such cases. Learners who drive unaccompanied are committing an offence, and it is very reasonable that people who knowingly facilitate this offence share responsibility for it. On consideration, I believe amendment No. 11, in the name of Deputy Munster - I acknowledge that Deputy Ryan tabled a similar amendment - is preferable in that it reflects the language used in existing road traffic legislation and is therefore less likely to be challenged.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352"> I will continue this discussion at a later date.</p>
