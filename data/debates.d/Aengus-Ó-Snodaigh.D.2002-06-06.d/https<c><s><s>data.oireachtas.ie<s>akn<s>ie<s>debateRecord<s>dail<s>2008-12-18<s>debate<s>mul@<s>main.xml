It is smart and contemptuous treatment of this House. After our calling for debates on the recapitalisation programme for the banks, agreement was reached on the holding of a short debate on the matter in the House today, yet at the same time, the Government decided to launch in Dublin Castle its framework for economic recovery — Building Ireland's Smart Economy.  This business should be set aside.  These two issues are interdependent.  There cannot be a banking system unless there is an economy that works, and <i>vice versa</i>.  The Tánaiste should know this better than most.  It is contemptuous treatment of the House that the Government should go to Dublin Castle today after briefing the social partners at 12 noon——</p>

If a major national announcement is to be made in Dublin Castle today, it should be made in the House.  All major announcements of national significance are made in the House.  This is where the Budget Statement is made and where the major statements on Northern Ireland have been made during the years.  The only things engaged on in Dublin Castle are public relations stunts.  The documents launched there are not ones for the recovery of the country but of Fianna Fáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">If it is a major national statement and made in Dublin Castle, I will be asking the Ceann Comhairle to have the Committee on Procedure and Privileges examine its appropriateness.  It is not acceptable that the Government makes announcements there on the economy, for example.  This has been built up as something tantamount to a Budget Statement.  If it is of that significance, it should be announced in the House where it would be subject to examination and scrutiny and those proposing it could defend it.  However, if it is announced in Dublin Castle, it is being done for the cameras, PR and spin and cannot be taken seriously.</p>

That is critically important.  We have to remind the Government that in the first instance it is accountable to the Dáil and the people, of whom we are its representatives.  In the crisis we are facing all Deputies have a collective responsibility to address the issues that need to be addressed, to seek together a formula to find a way out of the current recession, yet there is neither consultation nor accountability.  Opposition voices will not even have the opportunity to respond to what will be proposed by the Government this afternoon because it will not be put on the floor of the House.  That is a real problem.  We had the example last evening, despite the fact that the Labour Party and Sinn Féin had made very constructive proposals to address two of the most glaring needs in Irish society — social housing and homelessness——</p>

That is an example of the terrible gulf in the relationship between the Government and other elected voices in the House.  We are called on time and again by the Taoiseach to act in the collective national interest, yet there is no consultation or respect.

          <p eId="para_188">It is not agreed.  I made the point yesterday that people who are lucky enough to have a job get a week's holidays at Christmas.  In his statement yesterday, the Taoiseach announced the Government would be back in business on 7 January, as would the Dáil committees.  There is no reason the Dáil itself should not also meet on 7 January.  Therefore, I propose that Members should reject the date of 27 January.  At a time of national crisis, when 10,000 people in the private sector are losing their jobs every month, it is perverse and outrageous that the Government can propose that the Dáil will not reconvene until 27 January.</p>

          <p eId="para_191">I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, to delete "27 January" and replace it with "7 January", and that we return to deal with the amendment to the legislation on the use or otherwise of money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and get on with business.  The Minister for Finance faces a series of challenges encountered by none of his predecessors and in that sense, Fine Gael Members will stand by their country and economy.  However, this House must be seen to be putting its shoulder to wheel in the interests of the people and the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_195">I support Deputy Kenny's proposal that the House should resume on 7 January.  There is no justification for it to adjourn until 27 January.  As I noted yesterday, the long recesses in January go back to a time when the budget was announced at the end of January.  The argument was that the Government needed time to prepare the budget.  However, this no longer applies.</p>

          <p eId="para_197">A range of things are happening.  For example, the Government is only providing 65 minutes today to debate the issue of bank recapitalisation.  Although the document on the economic recovery programme will be published this afternoon, the House will not have an opportunity to debate it until 27 January.  Moreover, the severe cuts in the health service about which Members have heard could have a huge impact on front line services.  Yesterday, Members learned that CIE and Bus Éireann intend to reduce their fleets and driver numbers, which will have a great impact on public transport.  Moreover, the Government must make a decision sometime between now and the resumption of the House on its response to the Ryanair bid to buy the shares in Aer Lingus.  The House should have an opportunity to debate this matter before the Government makes a decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">In addition, a raft of legislation has not been published.  For example, on 20 November the Tánaiste informed me in the House that legislation on the levy for health insurance would be published and dealt with.  However, it has not appeared nor has it been dealt with.  There is business to be done and those who are deeply concerned about what is happening to the economy, their livelihoods, incomes, jobs and businesses will be scandalised that the Government intends to close down the Dáil until 27 January.  Whatever justification for so doing may have existed in the past, no such justification exists this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_481">For the purpose of clarity, I refer to a comment made by the Tánaiste before the Ceann Comhairle called the vote.  He came out of the traps very quickly and, like a good barman, he did not want to catch anybody's eye.  The Tánaiste stated that, if necessary, the House could be recalled to deal with the recapitalisation issue.  This will be necessary because the principal Act will have to be amended to allow the use of moneys from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to recapitalise the banks.  That was the point I wanted to make and the Ceann Comhairle would have saved himself some time if he had allowed me to make it.</p>

I thank in particular my parliamentary colleagues for their co-operation during the year and their commitment to the democratic process.

I thank the Clerk of the Dáil and his staff and the staff of my office for their smooth and efficient running of the House and their unfailing courtesy and professional commitment throughout the year.  I wish the Members who have generously acted as Acting Chairpersons during the year a very happy Christmas; Members of the House and the democratic process owe them deep gratitude.

He advised me by way of a parliamentary question that he had the report and the question of the contribution of the 1% to the National Pensions Reserve Fund is a matter which the Government is still thinking about.  Any change in this would require legislation.  If I understood her correctly, the Tánaiste herself said that it was likely that the Dáil would be recalled early after Christmas to effect legislation on the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the recapitalisation of the banks.

When a committee is not unanimous it will be my intention in the forthcoming session to take all these agreements and debate them in the plenary session, as well as in committee.

That package of reforms, which was agreed by the Fianna Fáil-led Government last summer, has been referred to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  No pressure was put on the matter, however, because there was a new regime which was busy and had other things on its mind.  It is a limited but important package that has been agreed by all sides of the House under the chairmanship of the Ceann Comhairle.

        <heading>Recapitalisation of Credit Institutions: Statements. </heading>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_176">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_573">Last weekend, the Government announced that it is prepared to support, alongside existing shareholders and private investors, a recapitalisation programme of up to €10 billion for credit institutions in Ireland.  I want to set out the reasons for this announcement.  At the outset, I want to make clear that this is a measured response to the dynamics of international capital markets, where expectations with regard to capital levels have altered in recent weeks.  This has taken place in the context of an international financial crisis, which led to numerous state interventions in national banking systems across the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">International financial markets have yet to normalise and the international financial system remains in a very fragile position.  It is generally accepted that the fallout from the financial market difficulties is proving to be more acute and prolonged than anyone calculated at the outset.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">The difficulties that began in August 2007 deepened significantly through September of this year with a succession of threatened collapses and rescues of financial institutions across the developed world.  A pervasive uncertainty about credit risk emerged such that the market for interbank lending became extremely challenging.  Matters worsened considerably when the big US investment banks came under stress, and across Europe the failure of the 158-year-old Lehman Brothers was a tipping point for the recent unprecedented turn of events.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">Following this, the wholesale markets began to avoid all but the most minimal risks and this led to a drying-up of short-term lending.  Despite liquidity injections to lower borrowing costs, the fear of further bank failures continued to deter interbank lending and led corporations, funds and banks to hoard cash.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Against this background and on the advice of the Central Bank, the Government acted with purpose and determination to guarantee the liabilities of credit institutions so that they could access funding in interbank lending markets.  The prompt and decisive action on the part of the Government to guarantee all the deposits and certain debts was taken to allow the banks the support they needed to maintain their normal liquidity position in interbank lending and debt markets.  The unequivocal advice to the Government from the Governor of the Central Bank was that this move was essential to allow banks to continue their normal ordinary business of providing credit in this country — what I have described as the lifeblood of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">Following the initial announcement on 30 September, the Government brought the necessary legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas to approve, first, the Banks (Financial Support) Act 2008 and, subsequently, the scheme to implement the Act.  The Government's guarantee has been very successful.  Irish banks have continued to do their business and all of our people and businesses have been able to deposit with financial institutions in confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">As with every country in Europe, Ireland has moved to ensure the security and stability of its banking system.  For banks everywhere, liquidity — that is, the cash that comes in the form of deposits and interbank moneys — provides the funds that they then lend on.  The guarantee has ensured that the banks can obtain that liquidity.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">Since the guarantee scheme was introduced, my Department, the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank have been in ongoing discussions with the institutions concerned surrounding their obligations under the scheme.  In addition, I have personally met with the chairpersons and CEOs of the institutions on a number of occasions.  During these discussions I have asked the banks to examine options to attract or raise private capital to underpin their long-term sustainability and support their lending to the economy.  These discussions have been productive and informative.  This process of consultation, involving as it did close contact with the relevant institutions, provided a context for the Government's announcement of 14 December of support for a recapitalisation programme for Irish banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">As I have said, banks need deposits and wholesale borrowings in order to have money to lend to the economy.  The guarantee has enabled them to maintain this liquidity in very adverse circumstances.  Capital is what allows the banks to take on the risk associated with lending into the economy, because capital provides a buffer against losses if they occur; less capital means less ability to lend.  Even where a bank has plenty of liquidity, if it does not have capital it cannot afford to lend, and it will not be able to persuade others to lend to it.  So recapitalisation will help to boost the ability of banks to lend and will place them on a more secure footing to contribute to our economy over the longer term.  Moreover, it should also protect their ability to borrow money for their operations in the future, since higher capital levels reassure interbank lenders about the overall security of the banks they are lending to.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">Recently, international capital market expectations in regard to capital levels in the banking sector have altered.  Although Irish banks are capitalised above minimum European regulatory requirements, high loan impairments, whether already acknowledged or anticipated in the next few years, mean that the markets now expect that banks should have a higher level of quality capital.  This expectation was reinforced when the United Kingdom carried out the recapitalisation scheme targeting this higher level.  Other European countries have followed suit.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">Significant falls in the share prices of Irish banks in recent times point to the capital market's belief that the Irish banks are undercapitalised.  The Government's plan to recapitalise is intended to stabilise the Irish financial system and secure its funding base.  Moreover, the Government's plan will enable banks to increase lending into the economy.  Currently, the incentive is for banks to hoard capital to meet market expectations on capital levels.  Reducing this incentive by injecting capital will facilitate lending to the real economy.  Since the announcement of the guarantee scheme, many other countries have introduced state guarantees and recapitalisation programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">In Ireland, we have been able to monitor the actions taken by others and develop our own recapitalisation programme.  Through this recapitalisation programme, the Government, working with the banks, intends to address the capital levels of the Irish institutions which have been the focus of capital markets in recent weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">As the House will be aware, the programme that the Government has announced envisages recapitalisation for banks in Ireland of up to €10 billion.  This programme will include appropriate terms and conditions, and capital will be provided through the National Pensions Reserve Fund or otherwise.  Accordingly, legislation to amend the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 will be brought before the Houses early in the next session.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">The Government's detailed statement of 14 December sets out the main principles that would guide its approach to the recapitalisation of the banking system in Ireland.  Important issues, such as the mechanisms through which the State could invest, the options available to the State for investment in the banking system and the maximum size of the fund, were all dealt with in the statement.  It made explicit that the detailed guidance set out in the European Commission communication on recapitalisation on key issues, such as pricing, would be a central element of the Government's approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">The nature of the State's investment may be by way of preference or ordinary shares and the State may, where appropriate, participate on an underwriting basis.  I will now engage further with the banks themselves — indeed, I have engaged with them already since the announcement — with a view to specific proposals being brought forward by them in early January.  Any capital investment will then need to be approved by shareholders and the Financial Regulator as appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">I have met in recent weeks with a number of banks and investment businesses regarding their proposals for investment in Irish banks.  Any serious propositions were referred to the institutions themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">Some existing shareholders have expressed an interest in subscribing for new capital.  The Government has indicated that it intends to support the recapitalisation of banks alongside private investors and that, in principle, existing shareholders will be expected to have the right to subscribe for new capital on the same terms as the Government.  Any role for private investors will reduce the need for State investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">State investment will not be forthcoming without conditions.  A key principle in the operation of such a fund will be to secure the interests of the taxpayers through an appropriate return on and appropriate terms for the investment.  The relevant financial institutions have been asked to submit detailed proposals on how they might avail of the recapitalisation programme announced by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">The Government guarantee scheme sets out strict terms and conditions for covered institutions in terms of commercial conduct, control and oversight on remuneration and bonuses, requirements to establish appropriate funding structures, compliance with the regulator's targets on assets and liabilities if necessary and drawing up the restructuring of management plans.  Any capital support will build on the measures contained in the guarantee scheme, including those to secure an adequate return and to safeguard the interest of taxpayers.  In addition, the Government may require compliance with such further transparency and commercial conduct requirements as it sees fit.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">In the period after the guarantee, the State commissioned an extensive report, conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, into the asset quality of the covered institutions.  On receipt of that report in November, I immediately arranged meetings with the relevant credit institutions to raise issues in the report and matters that also arose in the context of the business plans submitted to me by the covered institutions.  That dialogue process has been ongoing and intensive.  Deputies will appreciate that, as I am in a negotiating position with the banking sector on these issues, I am not in a position to give further detail to the House.  However, I am most anxious to ensure that the negotiations are brought to a conclusion as swiftly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">Concerning the availability of capital for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, the Government is committed to ensuring that funds are available to sound businesses to support their commercial activity.  I have asked the institutions covered by the bank guarantee scheme to consider the contribution that they should make to the economy through appropriate credit initiatives for SMEs and otherwise.  On foot of this request, several institutions have announced comprehensive SME support packages.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">I have also met Mr. Plutarchos Sakellaris, vice-president of the European Investment Bank which announced that it was providing additional funding through its lending facility for SMEs in the European Union.  Mr. Sakellaris confirmed that the bank has been in discussion with a number of Irish financial institutions about participating in this facility and that the investment bank hopes that agreements to provide such loan facilities can be finalised as soon as possible.  I have urged Irish banks to utilise the facility to the maximum extent possible with a view to making the additional funding available to SMEs as soon as possible.  I note that a number of banks have announced their intention to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">I wish to refer to the action taken at a European level and to outline how our proposals accord with European Commission guidance and action taken in other member states.  Any investment of capital by the State in any bank will be undertaken in line with best practice in the EU and elsewhere and consistent with EU state-aid rules, in particular the recent Commission communication on recapitalisation.  These guidelines address how member states can recapitalise banks in the current financial crisis to facilitate adequate levels of lending to the rest of the economy and to stabilise markets without unduly distorting competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">Ireland has been participating in this work at EU level in the past year to enhance financial stability arrangements and the ability of authorities to respond to serious disturbances in financial markets.  The programme of actions involves reviewing, along with the EU's international partners, how to improve the transparency of complex financial instruments, valuation standards, the prudential framework, risk management and supervision and market functioning, including the role of rating agencies.  Ireland will continue to help to progress this agenda so that the EU, working closely with its international partners, can bring about a far-reaching reform of the international financial system, underpinned by principles of transparency and integrity.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">Deputies would profit from examining an interesting interview conducted in today's <i>Financial Times</i> with the deputy governor of the Bank of England.  He pointed out that monetary policy must be directed towards getting credit flowing to every component of the economic chain.  He made the point that an obsession with capital ratios would not necessarily be the most successful way to do so and expressed doubts about whether the degree of capitalisation decided upon by the United Kingdom’s Government some weeks ago is adequate to ensure that type of credit flow in the real economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">I mention this because I have noticed in public commentary some impatience that capitalisation has not proceeded at a faster pace.  We should be careful about how we get involved.  For this reason, I have insisted that the onus was on the banks in the first instance to capitalise themselves, as they are private institutions.  In an earlier debate, Deputy Rabbitte may have mentioned the possible use of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  I agree that it can be applied where there is a prospect of an upswing for the taxpayers in an investment in a particular financial institution, which was made clear in the Government's statement last weekend.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">We have done a great deal of work since the guarantee was given.  The detailed examination of the asset quality within the banking sector and the submission of the detailed business plans have enabled my officials and I to have a far more informed view of the state of the Irish banking sector.  Together with the structured dialogue, this was the context that led to the Government's announcement last Sunday, which will be implemented in a short timeframe.</p>

          <p eId="para_602">I agree with the Minister that we must be careful about this issue.  Equally, it is a matter in which the Dáil must exercise careful scrutiny of what is occurring, but that position is inconsistent with the Government's decision to dismiss the Dáil for six weeks in the midst of this delicate and important business.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">When the guarantee was offered on 30 September, I happily offered the support of the Fine Gael Party.  The scheme was necessary and bought time for the Government to develop a strategy.  In the intervening period, I have not seen the emergence of that strategy.  Rather, I have seen 35,000 jobs lost, credit dry up, as evidenced by the Central Bank's statistics, and regard for Irish banks shrink more quickly after the guarantee than previously.  Last Sunday was a positive move forward, in that the Government dropped its untenable position of viewing recapitalisation as a last resort.  No other state regarded government involvement in recapitalisation in that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">That said, I still cannot see a strategy emerging.  We are expected to believe that the Government is working to some master plan, but the document produced was full of undecided options and demanded no new conditions, which would have given a sense that the Government was driving the process in a particular direction.  The Government seems to be looking for someone else to come up with the answers and ideas as to how we can get out of this hole.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">The Government's prevarication has become a part of the confidence problem, not its solution.  It is not setting an agenda to which banks must respond.  It is waiting for them.  They were given ten days in which to revert with a plan, but we have heard nothing about how the Government rejected some parts of the plan and improved it.  They were given another ten days to produce a remedy for small businesses.  All that the Minister can do is tell the House that they announced things, most of which are regarded by the small business sector as PR operations.  The sector informed Members that 54% of its members are being refused loans, but the Government is sitting back and telling us that those few announcements are somehow dealing with the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The banks were given seven days to respond to the issue of mergers and consolidations, which the Government seemed to indicate would be necessary.  Those seven days passed, but there were no mergers or consolidations and the issue disappeared from the agenda.  I do not know where the proposal lies now.  The Government is now giving them 20 days in which to revert with a proposal for recapitalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">We need a Government that sets the standards and tells every bank which new capital ratios are required of them, not just the banks seeking State support for recapitalisation.  We want to know what requirements the Government will set on banks in terms of their behaviour, how they will manage their toxic loan books and the manner in which they will deal with the drying up of credit for small business.  We need a Government that is clear and confident concerning the terms on which it will offer taxpayers' support.  We have not been provided with information in that regard.  We taxpayers are in this up to our necks.  We have guaranteed liabilities of €400 billion and we need to know that the Minister, as our representative, is operating on the basis of a credible strategy that will extricate us from the position in which we find ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">Time is not on our side.  I accept that the Government must be careful but it has had two and a half months to examine the details of what is involved.  The Minister must dictate what is going to happen and lay down the conditions under which private equity will be provided.  How will the Minister protect the taxpayer when there is private equity involvement?  What conditions will he impose with regard to the behaviour of banks after recapitalisation occurs?</p>
          <p eId="para_609">At present, banks are reducing their loan to deposit ratios.  They have indicated that they intend to solve their problems by raising further deposits.  However, everyone knows that they cannot all do so.  As a result, they are squeezing down credit.  The banks pretend that this is not happening but the statistics prove otherwise.  Due to the fact that they are not facing up to difficulties relating to properties on their loan books, they are using up the scarce money that is available in order to roll-over loans.  Where credit is being issued, it is going to the property sector.  Loans to that sector are non-performing in nature and are soaking up any ability to deal with this crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">The banks have axed overdraft limits.  Last month's returns show that such limits were cut by 25%.  I refer here to unused overdrafts that provide businesses that are under pressure with some wriggle room.  The Minister did not indicate how businesses are supposed to access overdraft facilities.  He is correct to state that capitalisation is not a magic bullet.  Will he indicate, however, the ammunition he possesses to allow him to formulate a strategy to deal with this matter?  We are all aware of the problems and we expect a response in respect of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">People are looking on in horror at what is happening.  The Minister stated that the banks are meeting the regulatory requirements relating to capital ratios.  The truth is that the market values their capital ratios not at 5% or 6% but rather, in the best case scenario, at 1%.  In the worst case scenario, the market valuation is probably less than 0.25%.  That is where matters stand.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">History tells us that allowing the banks to deal with this problem on their own will not result in the best outcome for either the country or the taxpayer.  There are perverse incentives for banks to take a punt on and increase their exposure to bad loans in the hope that something positive might happen.  When banks are short of capital, their behaviour changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">One can already see that much of the discussion with regard to shunning new capital is designed to save the position of those within the existing management structures of the banks and avoid the possibility that shareholder interests might coalesce and demand change.  That is what is occurring rather than a strong, authoritative response to the crisis in the banking sector.  The banks are managing down their loan books rather than trying to protect credit lines for decent businesses.  I am concerned that the banks will persist with the policies on bad loans and ration the credit available to good businesses, thereby forcing them to the wall.  Those in charge of the banks are more interested in saving their own skins rather than trying to achieve that for which we put our money at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">I welcome the fact that the Minister has moved away from the position of last resort.  However, he continues to state that the Government is awaiting the proposals which the banks are due to make.</p>

          <p eId="para_619">The cost of the State's borrowing has already risen by 1.5%, which will add almost €1 billion to our total debt next year.  Taxpayers are, therefore, being screwed in respect of the cost of this borrowing.  It is obvious that we, as taxpayers, will be obliged to offer commitments in respect of liabilities created by the banks beyond 2010.  The Minister's announcement last week did not instil the confidence he hoped it would.  I accept that this pre-emptive move bought time at a point at which the markets were extremely concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">The Minister must begin to answer some of the difficult questions.  How does he intend to manage joint funding involving private investors?  There is a real concern that the Government, the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland lack both the skill and ideas necessary to deal with this matter effectively.  Ideas such as those to which I refer have not been articulated and people are dubious as to whether the Government has a clear strategy that will allow it to negotiate with the wolves and emerge with a credible package that will protect taxpayers.  The Minister has not outlined the framework within which he proposes to manage the difficult negotiations to which I refer and emerge with a deal.</p>

          <p eId="para_622">There are different views on that matter.  One of the most respected commentators in this area, Patrick Honohan, has made it clear that the Government ought to articulate the conditions on which a deal of this sort should be done.  He also stated that, rather than what the Minister is doing, we would be better protected if public pronouncements were made in order that everyone might know the rules of the game.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">The Minister must outline his vision with regard to what form the repaired banking system will take.  He must also indicate how the State is going to repair that system.  It appears the Government is being dragged along reluctantly, requesting people to react to particular proposals and then resting on its oars while awaiting further developments.  Such an approach is not good enough in the current climate.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_624">I concur with everything Deputy Bruton said.  Everyone accepts that a recapitalisation of the banks must take place.  However, such a recapitalisation must occur in the context of the facts as they exist. We understand that PricewaterhouseCoopers is due to present its report to Government by 20 December.  However, we have not been provided with any details in respect of this report.  The purpose of the PwC report is to investigate the position regarding bad debts within the banking sector, which forms the nub of the problem in respect of the loan books of the financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">It is not merely a case of recapitalising the banks.  We must be informed as to how much money will be required in this regard and the Minister must indicate whether this will be the first, the first of many or the only round of recapitalisation.  Members of the public are of the view that the banks are dictating the pace in respect of recapitalisation.  Representatives of the two main banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, came before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service earlier in the week.  If the share prices of client companies of these and other financial institutions had fallen by 95%, those institutions would seek that CEOs and boards of directors of such companies be removed and EGMs would be held.  However, this has not happened in the banking sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">Members of the public have a great distrust of the banks.  They want the Government to show leadership but are of the view that it has not done so.  We have been informed that tier 1 capital ratio levels are not sufficient to meet market requirements.  However, AIB has publicly stated that it will not be seeking any recapitalisation funds from the Government.  There is a contradiction in this regard.  As a result, the Government must take a leadership role.  The Minister indicated that the banks have put forward plans in respect of providing funds to the business sector.  That may well be the case.  AIB has agreed to guarantee an aggregate of €3 billion in overdraft facilities to its customers, but it is withdrawing such facilities on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">Bank charges and interest rates in this country are significantly higher than the EU average.  However, the banks will not answer questions in respect of this matter.  The Government must insist the banks provide details on how they will guarantee the flow of funds when recapitalisation takes place.  There is every likelihood the banks will take the funds and use them to soak up bad debts.  Will funds flow to the small business sector and will the Minister obtain a guarantee in respect of house repossessions?  The Government must take care of Ireland Inc. and its citizens.  That is its role and is what it should be but is not doing.  The banks are acting as though there have been no changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">I am concerned, in terms of private investors coming in, that the Minister will sell out our financial sovereignty.  The concern is that the Government will have no input into this and that investors will strip the cupboards bare and make a killing.  Side by side, Ireland Inc. will literally fail in terms of the flow of funds.  The Government should take up the suggestion made by the Small Firms Association at a meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  It is important that round-table discussions on this measure, involving the banks, the small business sector and Government take place and that this measure is adopted by Government and made a precondition in terms of recapitalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">The Government is acting in a form epitomised by procrastination.  This does not instil confidence and shows a lack of leadership.  The Government needs to take the lead with the banks.  As of now, the banks are leading the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_632">This debate takes place just as the Central Statistics Office has announced that GNP for the third quarter has fallen by 4.9%.  This is, unfortunately, not recession but depression territory for the tens of thousands of people whose jobs are at stake and for the hundreds and thousands of businesses which may be forced to close next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">The Minister in his short comments, most of which have been published before, evaded the issue.  The purpose of this debate is to allow the Minister to set out and give to the House a sense of how he is approaching this problem.  The Labour Party is asking that the Minister protect the national interest over and beyond the many invested interests that are lurking in respect of all of these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">The banks' senior executives and boards have strong vested interests in terms of the protection of their reputations, jobs and wealth given most of them are major investors.  The Minister has not identified or addressed the strategic national interest.  An issue arises also in respect of whether there needs to be an Irish banking industry which is significantly dominated by Irish interests, although it may include foreign investment, as is currently the case.  The fact that the Minister is unwilling to take questions indicates that he has not yet made up his mind as to what he will do.  However, I know the Minister has made up his mind and that he is choosing not to tell us what he proposes to do.  He informed us of three options in terms of how the State might express its interest in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">I know the banks are playing hard ball.  I know also that when the Minister came up with the Farmleigh formula of inviting in people such as the Mallabraca consortium, J.C. Flowers &amp; Co. and Carlisle Investments——</p>

          <p eId="para_637">These foreign venture capitalists who lie behind some of the recapitalisation proposals, if allowed to take control of significant sectors of the Irish banking industry, pose an extreme danger.  I can understand that the Minister is in some difficulty but this is a Parliament and he should not have refused to answer questions on this matter if, as he suggests, he has a plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">Perhaps the most striking aspect of the banking crisis has been the complete lack of accountability at the highest levels.  It beggars belief that the same CEOs and board chairmen are in place almost three months after the Government threw them a safety blanket guarantee.  We were then first movers, for which the Minister claimed advantage and acclaim.  However, the Government's first-mover status and advantage has long been eroded by its pussy-footing around and entertainment of any and all-comers.  It has sent out the wrong signals.  It has sent out signals that it is dithering rather than acting with due consideration, diligence and speed.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">We are now considering injecting billions of euro into these banks.  The Minister referred earlier to the Labour Party request at the time of the debate on banking that the Government deal with the adequacy of the banks' capital.  He poopooed that proposal on that occasion because he said it was liquidity and not recapitalisation of the banks that was at issue.  The reason the Labour Party focused on recapitalisation is that the banks' core problem is the unknown levels of bad debts on their balance sheets.  This unknown level of bad and potential bad debts is what is poisoning the banking system in this country.  It is when these bad debts come to be written-off that the level of capital impairment will go way below that to which the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England referred.  The Bank of England recognised way back that bad debt impairment in the UK banking system needed to be addressed.  It is what caused the complete destruction of the Icelandic system.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">Let us be clear on what it is the Labour Party is talking about in terms of recapitalisation.  Recapitalisation arises because banks here have built up unsustainable levels of bad debts largely related to the property construction boom.  There is no evidence, as yet, that they have addressed this issue in a manner that is convincing to the capital markets or bankers in other banks not affected by this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">There has been a gross failure of oversight.  I am baffled that the Financial Regulator continues to insist all is well in Irish banking and that all capital adequacy ratios have been met.  It appears all regulations have been complied with and all the boxes have been ticked.  This comes from the cat's milk school of auditing, namely, checking if the €100 one spent on the cat's milk is accounted for while all enterprises are in peril of sinking.  As I said before, this is akin to saying that the State rooms in the <i>Titanic</i> are in perfect order, clean and refurbished while the ship is going down.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The regulator, from what the Minister said, is insisting that Irish banks are adequately capitalised.  However, as I stated earlier, the arbiters in the markets, who do not get everything right but nonetheless play an extremely important role in this, are saying that is not the case.  The Minister showed through budget 2009 that he can be tough on pensioners and school children.  When does he propose to get tough on bankers and people in the regulatory system who failed to do their job properly?</p>
          <p eId="para_643">I wish now to raise an important issue which I raised privately with the Minister.  We have had no explanation or discussion in this House in respect of what happened with the Financial Regulator and the Quinn Insurance Group and company.  We know that the largest fine in the history of Irish regulation was levied and that the regulator acknowledged that the moneys of an insurance company to the tune of more than €200 million were used to assist in some way unidentified people in purchasing positions, via contracts, or shares in one of the banks most related to the construction industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">We are told by the regulator that the insurance company is fine subject to the chairman standing down despite it being levied with the largest fine in the history of Irish regulation.  On the other hand we are told the bank in which the share positions or the options through which CFDs were taken is fine also.  That is a gravely worrying series of events in related financial institutions, which are regulated by the same regulator.  No explanation has been forthcoming, except to say that the disciplinary approach that was taken is a private agreement.  That is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">We, in the Labour Party, favour the Swedish model where the State seeks to have an equity investment in the banks, and that investment is available for sale when the bank shares recover and taxpayers can recover their money.  We are afraid the Minister is opting still for the Japanese model, where bad banks were nursed along and allowed to limp along by the state by not recognising the level of loan write-offs they had to have.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">I understand that the PwC report may have suggested levels of loan write-offs of approximately 2% a year for up to three years or five years.  The Minister did not publish that report either, so we do not know what we are talking about, but we can guess it must be at least 2% a year for three years.  That is a total of 6%.  The banks are doing nothing like that.  They are basically picking approximately half of that figure because they can deal with that by not paying dividends and through a variety of other devices.  In the meantime they will starve the economy and businesses, large and small, of credit in order to assist that.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">There is a law in economics called Gresham's law where the bad money drives out the good.  Are we having an Irish version of Gresham's law where a number of bad banks that are hopelessly compromised by their level of bad debt, especially in respect of the construction industry, are going to drive out the good banks, which with reorganisation are capable of constituting a strong, competitive banking force with State equity?  If the Minister is compromising his approach in order to hold up bad banks then he is not serving the national interest.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_648">Listening to Deputy Bruton and Deputy Burton I am bound to say I have some sympathy for the Minister for Finance.  Of all the Ministers in the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern's second Government he is least responsible for getting us into the terrible mess we are in now.  He has taken the worst hospital pass in modern politics from his predecessor.  Whereas he was a good Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am bound to say that when it comes to economics he has proved to be a slow learner.  However, the middle of a crisis is no place for on-the-job training.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">The Minister misjudged the downturn.  He got it wrong on the pay deal.  He got it wrong on the budget.  He bet the country on the banks and that has not solved anything.  The Minister is back where he was on 29 September except that this time the banks have him over a barrel because of the guarantee.  He did what he did on 29 September because the Government argued then that if one bank went down it could cause difficulty for other banks.  That same bank is again in danger, despite the guarantee.  We have not heard from the Minister whether it is his intention to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank.  If he does, what are the implications for where that bank interacts with the Bank of Ireland?  Does the Minister intend to use Anglo Irish Bank as a vehicle to strip out some of the toxic loans in some of the other banks or does he intend to reorganise along the lines Deputy Burton, I and the Labour Party favour, which is the way the Swedish Government did it?</p>
          <p eId="para_650">The problem is that in the meanwhile the real economy is suffering.  Small companies are hurting, people are losing their jobs and, in some cases, their homes.  The banks are stalling, share prices are sliding and credit is tightening.  There can be no economic stability, not to mention economic recovery without a functioning banking system.  The Minister is correct to say that on day one I referred to the likelihood of capitalisation being necessary from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, but I said that would be the case because the core problem, as Deputy Burton indicated, is the quality of some of the big loans on the loan books of the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Whereas we may not have a full-blown credit freeze, small companies are fearful of what the first quarter of 2009 will bring.  All the while the Minister is locked in a never-ending embrace with the banks reminiscent of that scene in "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" where each is afraid to let go of the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The two Brians boasted of how speedily, decisively and instantaneously they reacted on 29 September when they got a telephone call at close of business from the two big banks and that a guarantee was in place by midnight.  Meanwhile, Mr. Seán Fitzpatrick slept soundly, disturbed only by the closing scenes of the play he had attended that evening.  I did not believe a word of that then and I do not believe a word of it now, but if the Minister could react so speedily then what has he been doing for the past 11 weeks?  It is this drift, uncertainty and prevarication that is doing so much damage to the morale of our people and to the confidence of the business sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">There have been press releases to the effect that we do not need an economic plan because we have one, called the national development plan.  Then we are told we will get an economic plan.  Another press release indicated the banks did not require capitalisation but then we heard we are going to set up a recapitalisation fund.  The Minister for Finance told the Dáil he would raise the issue of pay with the unions but the Taoiseach said no, he is not.  Sunday night's announcement from the war room in the Cabinet office, on examination, amounted to no more than an invitation to the banks to "Come up and see me some time".  The banks will write to the Minister over Christmas and we will work out something.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">Following the debate, we still do not know what is the shape of the fund, what it will comprise, which bank will get what, we do not know what will be the terms and conditions.  We need to know whether the Minister is going the route of Irish fund managers' investment with the National Pensions Reserve Fund or whether he will go outside the State to some of the private equity consortia.  We have not had any indication.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">I accept the Minister is constrained by what he can say but he is not constrained in terms of what he can do.  It is 11 weeks since 29 September.  Business is hurting.  Jobs are being lost.  Credit is beginning to freeze up and we still do not have the shape of a solution.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_656">It is now 80 days since the Minister for Finance announced his bank guarantee scheme in the House.  Even though he then promised he was not "protecting the interests of the banks" but was instead "safeguarding the economy and everyone who lived and worked in this country" there has been an air of inevitability about recapitalising Irish banks.  Over the past two months we have seen one state after another launch a recapitalisation scheme to save their deteriorating economic circumstances, while the Government dithered.  Worse still, there is no good news for struggling mortgage holders today as home repossession rates soar, and neither for SMEs, the backbone of our economy, which are shedding workers daily.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">The warning signs were there long before September and yet again the Government did nothing.  Earlier this year Permanent TSB became the first of a series of banks to withdraw 100% mortgages and cut the maximum percentage of the cost of a house they were willing to lend for to 80% of the property value.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">The reason for withdrawing the 100% mortgage was that the bank wanted to have "a more prudent lending policy" — somewhat late, I suggest.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">In July Bank of Ireland, BoI, and Irish Life and Permanent, ILP, began to cut back on commercial lending and in the case of Irish Life and Permanent, an early July slump in share prices saw it lose a quarter of its value in a week.  Newspaper reports at the time said ILP had driven its lending business not through growing deposits but by borrowing from other banks and lending that money to home buyers in the buy to let market.  The <i>Daily</i>
                        <i>Telegraph</i> reported in the first week of July that Bank of Ireland told British customers it would take on no new commercial lending for three months.  In the same week BoI disclosed that it was unable to predict future profits because of the slowdown and the problems being faced in loan repayments by some of its business customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">The Irish Wind Energy Association reported in late June that wind farm operators were finding it difficult to finance new projects as banks were only willing to fund 70% to 75% of the construction costs compared to over 80% before the credit crisis and the smaller wind farm operators were being hit hardest.  Faced with all these realities of a growing crisis the Government did exactly in July what it is doing today — it went on holidays.  Given the amount of time that has elapsed, one would have thought the Government would be in a position to provide details of a clear and comprehensive recapitalisation project that would boost confidence in our financial institutions and inject much needed credit into our economy.  What we got in last Sunday's announcement, however, was a vague statement that inspired little confidence in the Government's ability to deal with one of the greatest economic challenges to face us in a lifetime.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Rather than a decisive plan of action, the latest Government announcement has been described as an "approach to recapitalisation", with broad parameters that have left us in the dark as to what exactly it all means.  The Government has reiterated that the interests of the taxpayer are paramount.  Based on certain signals it has made, however, I remain far from convinced that this is the case.

          <p eId="para_663">The Minister has said on many occasions that he would welcome and listen to them, talk and meet with them.  He said that here.  It is on the record of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">The involvement of those corporate raiders in the Irish banking sector has been described by even the most right wing economists as one of the worst things that the Government could do, yet even today we do not even have names of those private equity interests but it is pretty clear that the sharks smell easy prey and are circling ever closer.  If the Government proceeds with inclusion of private equity investors, it will have used the guarantee, paid by Irish taxpayers, to subsidise a tiny number of investors making quick profits at the expense of our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">It is hard to see why we are not facing another Eircom debacle of five owners in seven years, with an ever increasing debt burden, large dividends for shareholders and a failure to invest adequately in the customer network.  These vulture investors are only interested in high profits in very short periods and if they are successful in getting a controlling stake over any of our major banking institutions, we will be in a perilous situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Any involvement of private investors threatens the public interest as we will not be in a position to restructure the banking sector in a way that is necessary to secure our economic future.  Again there is nothing in the Government's statement that suggests a radical overhaul of the banking business model which created the type of irresponsible and reckless lending behaviour that has brought our economy tumbling down.  The culture of banking is going to have to change forever to ensure stability and if this is not addressed the banks may well go on acting irresponsibly and recklessly.  Key to this is the replacement of those senior executives in certain banking institutions who have misled us as to the true nature of their debt problems and encouraged the type of behaviour which has contributed to the credit crunch.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">The banks should not get a single penny from recapitalisation until there are wholesale changes in their senior management and those who are accountable for the mess that we are now in should be sacked, without any type of golden handshake, before they even commence their applications to be recapitalised.  While this seems to be recognised as imperative by almost everyone, the Government's failure to achieve either of these demands at the time of the guarantee leads me to believe that very little will change with recapitalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">One of the most disappointing aspects to the Government's approach is its refusal to use the leverage of recapitalisation to protect the people who are paying for it.  We have all heard this week that 13,391 mortgage accounts were three months or longer in arrears by June 2008.  This was an increase of 11,252 from December 2006.  The number of repossession orders being heard in the High Court is increasing at an alarming rate while there may a substantial number of voluntary repossessions that will never be heard about.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">My party has been calling for a moratorium for the duration of the guarantee scheme for those who fall into financial difficulty.  The Government missed the boat at the launch of the guarantee scheme to make this happen.  However, there is another opportunity with recapitalisation to help the hundreds of thousands of families whose homes are now threatened.  Another crucial measure which must be taken is to open up credit streams for the SME sector.  When the banking officials visited the finance committee last Tuesday, I was disappointed, but not surprised, at their failure to appreciate how serious things have become for this sector.  A couple of weeks ago an ISME survey showed that half of its members were being refused credit.  These were not unknown companies, but well established businesses which have long established relationships with their banks.  The result is that a large number of SMEs are now in serous financial difficulties, which has massive employment implications.  Yesterday it was reported that almost half of all firms in the small and medium sector experienced a fall in employee numbers in the last three months.  While all of this is happening the banks are continuing to sit back.  The sector has moved at a snail-like pace in dealing with the credit crisis, negotiations are still ongoing with the EIB in relation to its small operational fund while the banks have done really nothing to capitalise themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">If we are really to place the public interest at the core of recapitalisation the issues of mortgage repayments and credit for our SMEs must be core conditions.  There is no guarantee that the banks will lend out the funds as opposed to sitting on them.  This was a problem that the US Roosevelt Administration faced when it stepped in to recapitalise the banks in 1933.  For this reason, the Government will have to ensure that the State becomes a major shareholder in our banking institutions to get credit going again.  This will have to be done through part or full nationalisation of our banking sector, with the Government retaining ownership of one of the major financial institutions to protect our national interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">It is clear to even the most right wing of economists, who have suddenly decided that the State must intervene in our economy, that the public interest can only be prioritised if the State plays a leading role in our financial sector.  There was a time when we had the solution to this problem in Ireland, known as the State banking sector.  For business and industry we had the Industrial Credit Corporation, for farm business there was the Agricultural Credit Corporation and for insurance there was the State owned Irish Life.  The Post Office had a savings bank, and building societies were only allowed to lend to prospective home owners, not into the buy-to-let market which now accounts for 36% of the housing market in Ireland.  None of this was the glitzy banking sector of today.  It was boring and solid, but it worked and it was trusted by the public, unlike the banks today.  None of these banks ever made a loss, the profits were not enormous but business was done, money was lent, houses were built and some businesses grew.  The model and scale was very limited but the principle was well-established.  This cannot be done through any involvement of foreign private equity and my party will oppose any recapitalisation plans that support this.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">Finally, I should mention an initiative I spoke about on last night's Private Members' business.  The recapitalisation scheme may provide a golden opportunity to tackle the impending housing crisis.  While speaking to an Oireachtas committee on 14 October last, Mr. Patrick Neary, CEO of the Irish Financial Service Regulatory Authority, told us that speculative lending to the construction and property sectors in the country amounted to €39.1 billion and that he anticipated "losses on property-related loans" and that "increased provisions and write-offs will be necessary".  Mr. Neary also revealed that a PwC audit of the six largest Irish banks had found that €15 billion of property lending was secured on the properties alone.  Can we learn anything from the Swedish experience in the early 1990s, where a similar case of ill-advised commercial lending in a property boom led to a collapse in its banking system?</p>
          <p eId="para_673">As part of the Swedish bailout, the Swedish Government forced banks to write down losses and sell off the distressed assets.  In the Irish case, some of the assets in question are the land banks amassed by speculators, the unfinished housing estates and commercial retail ventures that should be sold off as bad debts.  The Swedish Government formed a new agency to supervise institutions that needed recapitalisation and another that sold off the assets, mainly property, that the banks held as collateral.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">In Ireland, we have a unique opportunity to return control of the planning process and commercial development to local government, by breaking up the property cartels that have been holding Dublin and many other towns ransom to their own development strategy, wilfully thwarting local council development plans.  As property prices fall and these assets are sold, local government could have a unique route to dealing with the growing housing crisis, and taxpayers can be given a better return for their investment in the banks, rather than allow cash-strapped developers sit on their assets now only to make more profits in decades to come.</p>

          <p eId="para_675">Deputy Bruton made a fair point when he asked what was the vision for the banking sector.  If we strip away the political charges made by the Opposition speakers and consider what they want for the banking sector, it is what we all want.  It is what the people want, that the banks will serve borrowers and small and medium sized enterprises in an honest way and ensure that those in default on their home loans are treated in a reputable and respectable way.  These are core objectives of both the Government and Opposition parties and are not an issue in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">However, with regard to the political charges made and, in particular, to the suggestion there has been a delay in dealing with this matter by the Government, I wish to point out that I have spent night and day, since budget time, working on this issue.

          <p eId="para_682">The question of private equity, which is an important subject, was mentioned by a number of speakers in the debate.  Banks are approached all the time by private equity investors and they draw their own conclusions about them.  Were private equity to be involved in the recapitalisation now under way, it would have to act in terms in accordance with the public interest and the fundamental importance of retaining a viable, sustainable banking sector here in Ireland for the long term.  There is no question about that.  With regard to credit for small and medium sized businesses, I thank Deputies for their views.  They are the same as that of Government and have been fully factored into the negotiations.</p>

There are already detailed arrangements in place for inspection of registers of elections.

          <p eId="para_716">This amendment is grouped with Labour Party amendment No. 4 and has been introduced in response to the amendment tabled by Deputy Tuffy on Committee Stage and re-entered in modified form for Report Stage.  It relates to the filling of casual vacancies in the European Parliament.  The Deputy proposed that political parties would be able to nominate replacement candidates where the replacement list was exhausted, or those remaining on the list were unable, for whatever reason, to take up the position.  The Minister was not inclined to accept the amendment on Committee Stage because of the existing provision for the Dáil to resolve the matter should it ever arise.  Also, it is undesirable to have political parties selecting candidates without the electorate first having an opportunity to see who might represent them in Europe.  The focus should be on parties and non-party candidates operating and making best use of the current arrangements for nominating replacements.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">However, the Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he would reflect further on the matter.  Currently, a registered political party may nominate such a number of replacement candidates in each constituency that does not exceed by more than four the number of candidates of that party nominated for the constituency.  Therefore, if three candidates stand for a party, there can be seven names on the replacement list.  If there are four candidates, there can be eight replacements etc.  I am satisfied the number of replacements already provided for is sufficient for the circumstances likely to arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">However, in view of the concerns expressed by Deputies on the opposite side of the House, and taking account of the fact that candidates themselves may, and often are, included as replacements, the Government amendment proposes to increase the limit from four to six for registered political parties.  In future, if three candidates are standing for a party nine names are permitted on the replacement list, if four candidates are standing, ten are permitted etc.  This is more than a sufficient number for any scenario likely to arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">The amendment also proposes to increase the number, from three to four, of replacement candidates that a non-party candidate may nominate.  This is contained in the proposed new paragraph <i>(a)</i> of section 13 and it adequately addresses concerns about people not being available to fill seats, while at the same time maintaining the important link with voter preferences expressed at election time.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">In the circumstances, and in a spirit of compromise, I ask the House to accept the Government amendment.  I ask that Deputy Tuffy consider withdrawing the Labour Party amendment.</p>

                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_724">In page 20, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_725">"15.—It shall be a function of each local authority to prepare and make available to the public without charge accurate and up to date maps of the local electoral areas within the functional area of the authority.".</p>
          <p eId="para_726">This concerns a simple day to day aspect of the efficient management of elections and local elections, both for those who engage in the electoral process and for the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">I am not sure of the situation in the Minister of State's constituency, but in my own area of Cork South-Central and in others around the country there appear to be two clear difficulties.  One is that the local franchise office may, or may not, have a map of the constituency available to people.  If they do, that map is probably several years out of date and does not take into account the build in recent housing estates.  The estate I live in is not on the electoral map, for instance.  There are tracts of land in Cork city and in its suburban areas that are not on the map.  Moving further out of Cork city, the county franchise office has no street map or town map for the town of Carrigaline.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">The amendment tabled by the Labour Party calls for a common sense requirement to facilitate the efficient operation of elections.  Just as the franchise office is required to maintain, update and provide as accurate a register as it can, another part of its duties is to provide accurate maps and other details.  The local authority should be responsible for making such maps available just as they make available copies of the register.  This should be a day to day operational function of the local authorities.  It is with the intent of having good sense and good practice that I put forward this amendment.  I ask the Minister to accept it on the basis that it is an improvement on the existing scheme.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_729">This was discussed on Committee Stage, as Deputy Lynch is aware.  Maps of local electoral areas, as recommended by the Boundary Commission, are available in its published reports.  These reports are on my Department's websites at <i>www.environ.ie </i>and are freely available for viewing.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">While maps are important and easy to use they are for illustrative purposes only and have no legal basis with regard to the composition of local electoral areas.  The legal basis for local electoral areas is the different ministerial orders which contain detailed technical descriptions of the areas concerned.  However, maps of local electoral areas are of benefit to candidates and I agree with the Deputy on this.  They are also of benefit to political parties and to the public in general.  The Minister has indicated he intends to write to local authorities requesting them to produce and make available maps of the local electoral areas relevant to their councils' functional areas.  I hope the House will agree this is the appropriate way forward.  In this circumstances, and in the light of what I have said, I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.</p>

          <p eId="para_732">One could write about this matter to local authorities until the cows come home because, in the absence of legislation, there is no directive or direction.  The Minister is correct when he states there is no legislative function.  The amendment in question proposes to put a legislative function in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">It is also about accuracy.  If people walk into their franchise office or local post office they can look at their estate and see where their vote is in a local electoral area.  Often boundaries in local electoral areas run down the middle of a road.  An accurate map would help people find out who are their candidates and what local electoral area they are in.  I  would have no difficulty withdrawing the amendment if the Minister were to examine the issue as he did with the earlier Labour Party amendment.  There is not much expectation to be drawn from writing to local authorities on the matter.</p>

          <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_734">I agree with the Labour Party amendment.  It is a common sense proposal.  Candidates who wish to run in elections should at least be able to see their areas in map form and this should be available through the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">I have a question about Ordnance Survey Ireland in general.  I purchased an Ordnance Survey map of my constituency only to find that not all roads, particularly newer ones, were on the map.  It was impossible to discover all the roads without walking them and getting to know them in that way.  How often are Ordnance Survey maps updated?  Can this be done on a more regular basis?  As a minimum, the Minister of State should ensure that maps are available for candidates.  That would be a good initiative.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_736">Local authorities are responsible for the planning, organisation and holding of local elections in their areas.  They are best placed to produce such maps, given their range of local responsibilities.  It should be left to local authorities to decide on the arrangements for making them available and whether to charge for them.  The production of maps is not appropriate for inclusion in legislation, particularly if the maps under discussion do not have any legal standing.  This is an administrative matter for the local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">With regard to Deputy Flanagan's point, the Minister is in contact with local authorities, and with managers in particular, to discuss these issues.  In respect of Dáil constituencies, previous Ministers have circulated to Deputies and Senators maps following constituency revision.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, is continuing this practice and has arranged with the Ordnance Survey Ireland to produce maps of each constituency provided for in the Bill.  These maps will be circulated to Deputies and Senators and will assist them to familiarise themselves, if they need to, with changes to individual constituencies.  There is no legal basis for maps on their own.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">I referred to other matters earlier.  I hope this amendment will be withdrawn and that we can agree on what the Minister proposes.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_745">I want to again put on the record the concerns of people in my constituency and our neighbouring constituency, formerly Limerick East.  We do not welcome the Bill.  We were advised there would be minimal change when the commission was given its instruction yet we have seen our two constituencies butchered, to put it mildly.  Limerick is losing a seat in that it had eight seats but now has just seven.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">People are quite engaged and upset about this issue.  We do not understand the logic as to why places in the west such as Abbeyfeale, Athea, Monagea, Templeglantine, Tournafulla, Mountcollins and Glin were essentially moved to Kerry North, with a transfer of over 13,000 votes into Kerry North.  Political activists of all parties, the general public and those who supported people like myself, Deputy Noonan and our colleagues in both constituencies do not understand why this has happened when it was not flagged or expected and was not logical when it did happen.  We received more than 17,000 votes from the former Limerick East into the new constituency of Limerick, where I live.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">I do not welcome the Bill.  I am very happy to represent the new areas of Doon, Cappamore, Oola, Pallasgreen, Caherconlish, Boheroe, Hospital, Murroe and Drumkeen.  However, what has happened is unacceptable.  We in Limerick believe this was politically motivated to ensure Kerry would hold its six-seat representation and Limerick would lose one seat.</p>

        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_234">
          <from>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_748">The Labour Party still has problems with the way the drawing up of constituencies is dealt with.  One of the particular issues we raised concerned the undesirability of three-seat constituencies.  While this has not been taken on board, as Deputy Neville said, it remains an issue whether it is sustainable to have three-seat constituencies.  When the Ceann Comhairle sits in a three-seat constituency, for example, only two other Members can be elected, which limits the operation of democracy in that constituency.  Obviously, the more seats in a constituency, the more likely the smaller parties will get to be represented and people who use their vote will have an opportunity to actually elect someone.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for making an amendment on the issue of how European candidates should be dealt with, although this was not exactly as we proposed.  We welcome that the Minister engaged in discussion on Committee Stage and took on board the Labour Party view.</p>

        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_235">
          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_750">There was no logical reason for the constituencies to be redrawn in Limerick, which has lost one seat, other than the desire to retain two three-seaters in Kerry.  Logic would have dictated that Kerry should have gone from two three-seaters to one five-seater but that has not happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">The area I was elected to represent, Limerick East, took in the city and a portion of east county Limerick, including areas already referred to such as Murroe, Cappamore, Doon, Pallasgreen, Oola and Templebraiden, which have now all transferred to Limerick West.  This huge new constituency, which is called Limerick County, stretches as far as Glin.  The people of Limerick East were represented by Deputies from the area for decades but they now feel disconnected.  They still come to local Deputies with constituency queries and I will certainly continue to represent them at all times.  It needs to be put on record that the people of east Limerick feel disenfranchised.  What has happened would not have happened except for reasons which are unknown but which clearly indicate that some people wanted two three-seaters in Kerry when it should have been one five-seater.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">It is a sad day for Limerick in terms of losing a Dáil representative overall, with eight seats being reduced to seven between the two constituencies.  However, I will continue to represent the people who elected me.</p>

        <speech by="#CiaranLynch" eId="spk_236">
          <from>Deputy Ciarán Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_753">At the beginning of this debate, the whole area of how the drafting process works and the formation of electoral commissions was questioned.  One of the issues we need to consider in future, and Limerick is a case in point, is that when the commission brings its report before us, it is a <i>fait accompli</i>.  The Labour Party argues that there needs to be a draft process whereby the commission publishes a draft, public consultation follows on that draft, which remains with the commission, and the commission then forwards it to the Minister, who moves it into legislation.  What we are doing at present is drafting at the legislative stage, which is not the way we should operate.  There should be a particular period in which drafting is completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">While I am not suggesting this is a miscellaneous electoral Bill, there was an expectation that before the Dáil concluded its business for the Christmas recess, a general if not a specific indication would have been given with regard to spending in next year's local elections.  I envisaged that this Bill would have been a platform on which we could have achieved that measure.  While the Minister does not need to indicate the specific amount, he might have indicated a general amount or guideline as to what that expenditure would be.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">Most political parties are in the process of developing, or in some cases are up and running with, their plans for next year's local elections.  However, they cannot budget because they do not know the specifics with regard to poster size, what posters can be used and so on.  I do not know if it is a question of the Minister, Deputy Gormley's, indecisiveness, whether there are complexities involved or whether this will be rolled out before 4 June, when I understand the local elections are to take place.  In the absence of providing us with any specifics in the Bill, I call on the Minister to indicate what the general sum of expenditure will be for the local elections.  The Minister is on record as stating that spending limits will be in place for next year's local elections.  It behoves him and he has a democratic duty to provide us with information on the operation of democratic structures in the State.  It is not something that should remain on his desk.  There is a democratic obligation on the Minister to provide us with that sum as we approach next year's local elections.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Michael P. Kitt, to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and urge him to take action in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_756">The Bill puts in place key measures to facilitate Dáil, European and local elections.  It also makes significant and worthwhile improvements to the processes of constituency commissions.  Some people may be disappointed by the decisions as Deputies Neville, O'Donnell and Ciarán Lynch have remarked.  However, there has been broad welcome in the House for the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">I thank Deputy Tuffy for her comments, but if we were to rule out three-seat constituencies, except in exceptional circumstances, it would be very restrictive and unworkable.  Let us consider County Donegal, for example, and the difficulties in that county of trying to deal with six seats.  The matter of spending limits will be addressed on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  I do not have the figures, because the amendment has yet to be approved by the Government.  However, it will be addressed next year in the Seanad.  I thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their contributions to the debate on the Bill.  I also thank the staff of the House for the expeditious manner with which they dealt with the Bill.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
          <p eId="para_763">I am pleased to present the Spent Convictions Bill 2007 to the House as a Government supported Bill.  I am especially pleased for the opportunity since I introduced it as a Private Members' Bill in October last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">The core message in the Bill concerns the need to facilitate the rehabilitation of convicted persons and to do so in a way that not only benefits the individuals concerned, but that takes account of the wider interests of society, especially the protection of vulnerable persons.  In particular, the Bill will facilitate rehabilitation through the reintegration of convicted persons into the workforce, and will allow them to build new careers.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">I have held an interest in this area for some time.  Previously, I introduced the Rehabilitation of Offenders Bill in March 2007, but it fell in the normal way following the general election in 2007.  The Bill takes account of the very valuable and insightful report from the Law Reform Commission published in July 2007.  In producing its proposals for reform, the Commission undertook a very wide-ranging examination of the issues involved, including a very useful review of arrangements in other jurisdictions.  As a result, the report is comprehensive.  Its conclusions are well argued and take full account of Irish conditions.  I am satisfied, therefore, that we can have confidence in the proposals for reform contained in the report.  It was this belief that led me to introduce the Bill.  The Law Reform Commission consulted very widely in preparing the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">The Bill began as a Private Members' Bill.  As a private Member, I did not have access to the advisory and drafting services of the office of the Attorney General.  However, since it has been adopted by the Government, the necessary legal and drafting expertise has been available.  The Bill is being examined and this will probably result in some amendments during later the stages.  The amendments will clarify and expand some of the Bill's provisions.  I will, in so far as possible, identify in my remarks today those matters that may require amendment, but the primary objective of the Bill, that is, the achievement of rehabilitation through employment, remains intact.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">Based on its preliminary assessment of the Bill, I confirm that the office of the Attorney General is of the view that there is no constitutional bar to its enactment.  The central point of the Bill is to provide to persons having a conviction for a minor offence the opportunity of not disclosing that conviction when seeking employment.  There are several limitations and exclusions where disclosure will always be required, the most notable relating to employment where there is access to children.  However, the fundamental point is that the Bill recognises that the most effective means of rehabilitation is through gainful employment.  Employment restores the person's self esteem, it enhances his or her status among family, friends and the wider community and, as has been shown many times, it reduces very considerably the likelihood of re-offending.  Securing employment is, clearly, a very effective way of achieving the reintegration of convicted persons into society.  The Bill, therefore, addresses a significant gap in our present arrangements.  At present we have no means of regarding a conviction as "spent", apart from the limited regime for non-disclosure available to minors under section 258 of the Children Act 2001.  This Bill provides us, therefore, with the means to put a structured system in place for not disclosing convictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">I accept that, in general, people should be allowed to move on with their lives after completing their term of imprisonment or the payment of the fine.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">Unfortunately, experience demonstrates that the possibility of securing employment is greatly reduced once a prospective employer becomes aware of the existence of a criminal record and in the absence of any general statutory non-disclosure arrangement, the prospective employee often is obliged, when asked, to reveal the information recorded on the Garda criminal records.  The effect of the current situation is that the person who was over 18 when the offence was committed must carry with him or her the consequences of even a minor offence long after the debt to society has been repaid.  Most Members will agree that this situation offends their view of what is proportionate, fair and reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">Although I agree the present arrangements should be altered, I also am anxious that a proper balance should be maintained between the interests of society generally on one hand and, on the other, the need to allow those who are prepared to rebuild their lives a reasonable opportunity to do so.  In arriving at an appropriate balance, it is necessary to pay particular attention to the protection of vulnerable people.  I will re-examine the definition of vulnerable persons in section 5(2) of the Bill to expand it to include persons who are vulnerable by virtue of their age and physical impairments, as well as intellectual impairment.  While I am satisfied there should be disclosure of past convictions when seeking employment that entails access to any of those groups, it also must be said that disclosure of a conviction does not mean the offer of employment has to be or will be withdrawn.  It does mean, however, that the employer can make a more informed decision in each such case.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">There are other instances where disclosure of previous convictions also seems appropriate.  For instance, in criminal proceedings, a court is entitled to be informed of previous convictions before sentence is passed for the offence being tried.  In this way, the court is in possession of all the relevant facts and consequently can impose a sentence that is appropriate to the offender.  It also means the court can properly distinguish between repeat and one-off offenders, which is how it should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">I now wish to turn to the provisions of the Bill.  The effect of a conviction being regarded as "spent" is set out is section 4.  Where a conviction is "spent", the person will be treated as a person who has not committed, been charged with, prosecuted for, convicted of or sentenced for the offence in question.  However, I must add the Bill does not entail any deletion of the criminal records held by the Garda Síochána.  The record will continue to exist and the Bill will merely specify circumstances in which the details of that record are or are not to be disclosed.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">The Bill will apply only in cases where a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding six months or a fine or other penalty has been imposed.  The Law Reform Commission gave detailed consideration to the sentence threshold and concluded, based on Irish sentencing policy and practice, that a six-month threshold was appropriate in our circumstances.  While I find the commission's argument to be persuasive, I am open to consideration of a slightly different threshold.  The Bill refers to "prohibitions" and "disqualifications" when referring to other penalties.  It is likely that I will seek to amend those terms to give them more precise meaning.  I also will clarify, by way of an amendment, that the arrangements in this Bill apply only in the case of those who were 18 years or over when the offence was committed.  In other words, this Bill will not affect the operation of section 258 of the Children Act 2001.  I also intend to make clear that the Bill will apply equally to persons who were convicted prior to and after its enactment.  In the case of those who were convicted prior to the Bill's enactment, they may benefit from its terms if they satisfy them.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">The possibility of non-disclosure only will arise after seven years has passed without a further conviction when a sentence of imprisonment had been imposed or after five years in other cases.  It might be argued that such periods are too long and that the best hope of rehabilitation arises where the offender secures employment very shortly after completion of his or her sentence.  Undoubtedly there is merit in that view but a balance must be found between the needs of the offender and the need to protect society.  One must therefore be satisfied that sufficient time has passed before society can feel assured that the offender has demonstrated his or her willingness to embrace society in a positive way.  I am aware the Law Reform Commission's report examined this issue carefully and recommended the periods now proposed.  Moreover, it noted that a conviction-free period of ten years is required in New Zealand.  However, I am considering whether the conviction-free period required when a non-custodial sentence was imposed should be reduced slightly to, for example, four years.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">The question of whether the specified period must be free of all convictions, even those of a very minor type, is also being considered.  While there may be scope for some flexibility on this point on grounds of proportionality, lest there be any misunderstanding, the scope for movement probably is limited.  It may be possible, for example, to make a concession where the penalty for the subsequent offence is a fine.  However, I consider that such a concession should be allowed once only.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">The Bill sets out a number of "exclusions" in terms both of offences and certain employments.  In the case of offences, convictions for sexual offences always must be disclosed.  Similarly, convictions for offences reserved for trial by the Central Criminal Court always must be disclosed.  These offences include rape and serious sexual assaults, as well as murder.  I will re-examine the manner in which the Bill expresses this provision as it may benefit from more explicit definition.  For instance, all indictable offences are, strictly speaking, triable by the Central Criminal Court, since the Constitution provides that the High Court, or, in its criminal role, the Central Criminal Court, is a court of full and original jurisdiction.  Therefore, on a strict reading of the Constitution, almost all cases are triable by the Central Criminal Court and could, therefore, be regarded as "excluded" cases for the purposes of this Bill.  As that is not the Bill's intention, I will have the matter clarified.  It has also been drawn to my attention that, for example, certain offences under the Competition Act 2002 are reserved for trial in the Central Criminal Court.  I will examine that aspect to ensure the Bill refers only to those offences that are of particular relevance and importance.  I also wish to take account of the fact that while certain offences are reserved for trial in the Central Criminal Court, some, such as murder, also may be tried in the Special Criminal Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">As regards "excluded" employments, the Bill provides it should always be necessary to declare convictions when seeking employment in specified areas of employment.  Section 5(2) of the Bill contains a list of such areas.  Although I accept the principle that certain areas of employment should be excluded from the terms of the Bill, I will examine that list to ensure all the areas listed are appropriate and, equally, that none has been left out that should be included.  In this regard, I accept the suggestion that there is a strong case for including non-paid voluntary work in certain sectors, as well as areas of employment that come within the remit of, for example, the Private Security Authority or the Taxi Regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">Apart from the "excluded" employments, the Bill requires the disclosure of all convictions in certain other specified instances.  I already have mentioned that previous convictions are to be disclosed at the sentencing stage in criminal proceedings.  Section 6 sets out other circumstances in which disclosure may be required, including court proceedings relating to adoption and guardianship of children, as well as cases in which a court considers disclosure is necessary to ensure justice is done.  While the details of section 6 seem reasonable and acceptable in the main,  I will consider other areas, such as the requirements that a person who has been arrested and detained in respect of a criminal investigation should not be entitled to avail of the non-disclosure provisions.  Persons making applications under the immigration laws also should be expected to disclose past convictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">The Bill proposes that the entitlement not to disclose a conviction should be automatic once the conditions relating to excluded offences and employments, the sentence thresholds and the conviction-free period had been observed.  The case for such an approach is well argued by the Law Reform Commission and I agree with its proposal, as reflected in the Bill.  Automatic application of the arrangements is preferable to one that is more demanding of time and resources.  An application system, especially one that would entail applications to a court, would also present the real risk of drawing attention all over again to a conviction that the person hoped was behind him or her, thus defeating the purpose of the Bill.  The automatic system now proposed avoids such shortcomings.  It may be worth noting that the provisions about which I have been speaking regarding thresholds, excluded offences and employments, as well as the automatic application of the arrangements, are mirrored in the arrangements already in place under section 258 of the Children Act.  Apart from the duration of the conviction-free period the offender is required to observe, a high level of consistency in approach as between adults and children will be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">Some Members may remark on the absence from the Bill of any sanction for non-compliance.  In general, the sanction lies in the consequences of being found out, which may, for example, result in the loss of employment.  However, I realise that further assurance is needed, especially in respect of employment in certain sensitive posts.  I therefore remind Deputies that the Bill does not entail a wiping out of criminal records, which will continue to exist and will be available to, for example, the vetting authorities.  I already have mentioned that in the case of certain employments, convictions must be disclosed.  In cases in which vetting arises and disclosure is required but the person fails to disclose a conviction, the existence of the conviction will be highlighted in the vetting process.  This happens already under the current vetting arrangements and underlines the necessity of having such arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">Employment vetting has been ongoing in Ireland for several years.  Members will be aware its purpose is to ensure that employers, especially those in sensitive areas of activity, are in possession of all the relevant information about potential employees.  It is important to understand that the vetting authorities are not the arbiters of whether a person gets, or holds on to, a job.  Their function is to provide the employer or other specified body, such as the Health Service Executive, with all relevant information on convictions, as well as such additional information as may be permitted to be released.  It then is a matter for the employer to come to a decision on whether to proceed with the offer of employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">An expert group reported in 2004 on the current arrangements operated by the Garda in co-operation with other agencies such as the Health Service Executive.  The group's report recommended that the vetting system should be put on a statutory footing and that it should address the question of soft information as well as hard information.  Meanwhile, as Members are aware, a joint committee has been considering children's rights and it recently recommended the introduction of legislation to put on a statutory footing the vetting arrangements.  This recommendation will be pursued as a matter of urgency in the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">In respect of vetting, I wish to add that I am examining whether it is necessary to provide in this Bill that the responsibility of the Garda vetting unit will be to provide information on convictions on the basis permitted by this Bill, bearing in mind that the vetting unit has full access to the criminal records.  I do not want a situation to develop whereby requests are made to the vetting unit that are designed to elicit information about a prospective employee which that prospective employee is entitled to withhold under this Bill.  Such a scenario would undermine the whole basis for the regime being established by this Bill and would be a wasteful abuse of the time and resources of the unit.  I stress that any amendment along the lines I have mentioned will not result in information being withheld where it must be made available, for example, on employment where there is access to children.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">Before I conclude, I want to add a few remarks about the Bill's provisions in so far as they are relevant to our anti-discrimination laws and to foreign travel requirements.  In its report on spent convictions, the Law Reform Commission looked at the question of including a person's criminal history among the grounds on which discrimination should be prohibited under our equality legislation.  The commission decided not to make recommendations on the issue, as it raised matters such as access to services, accommodation and insurance that it felt were outside the scope of its brief.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, tells me that he will, in due course, be carrying out a review of the Equality Act and the issue can be looked at in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">Finally, the existence of a conviction can also impact adversely on a person's freedom to travel.  Within the EU, there is, as we are aware, very substantial and unrestricted travel entitlements for all but the most exceptional cases.  The presence of a conviction, certainly a minor one, will therefore generally not present any restriction on internal EU travel.  However, as regards travel outside the EU, entry requirements are a matter for the host state.  This Bill applies only within this jurisdiction; it has no function in any entry requirements set down by other states on the granting of holiday visas, work permits or any other entry requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">I again acknowledge and thank the Law Reform Commission for its report.  It has given us an opportunity to address an important issue, which can bring real benefit to the individuals concerned and to society as a whole.  I also thank Mr. Michael Tuite BL who assisted me in the preparation of the Bill in the previous Dáil.  I am happy to commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_244">
          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_787">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, for presenting this short but, nevertheless, important piece of legislation which has the broad support of the Fine Gael Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">In July 2007, the Law Reform Commission published the report on spent convictions which included a draft Bill in the document.  At that time, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, welcomed the proposals contained in the report to expunge after seven years the criminal records of those convicted of minor offences.  In October 2007, the draft Bill from the Law Reform Commission was published verbatim in a Private Members' Bill in the name of the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.  Other than a key difference on the length of eligible sentence, and, indeed, the ordering of the sections, the Bill is almost identical to the one published by the Law Reform Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">In a survey of over 20 jurisdictions undertaken by the British Home Office in 2002, it emerged that of those jurisdictions only Ireland and Slovenia had no scheme in place in respect of adult offenders.  The Law Reform Commission also highlighted the fact that Ireland is in a small minority at European and international levels in so far as it is one of the few states that does not have some form of arrangement in respect of spent convictions.  This Bill will go some way towards addressing that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">The Bill includes a category of rehabilitated persons who will not have to divulge information about a conviction that is considered to have been spent or disposed of in some respect.  Excluded sentences which will not qualify under the Bill include sentences imposed relating to sexual offences or sentences which involve a term of imprisonment exceeding six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">This Bill will only include crimes for which people have been sentenced, including suspended sentencing, of six months or less.  The Minister of State stated that there were a number of specific exclusions, and I agree with him, particularly on the disclosure of sexual offences.  He spoke of the disclosure of persons coming into this country, particularly those who wish to take up residence in this country.  It brings to mind the issue of the absence of an EU-wide sex offenders register, which is a matter to which this House has adverted on numerous occasions in the past and yet progress on which has been particularly slow.  I would ask, perhaps in the context of progress of advancing this legislation, that the Minister of State and his Government colleagues might avail of the opportunity to impress upon EU colleagues, and this jurisdiction, the need to promote and bring into being an EU-wide offenders register, particularly in the areas of sexual offences and having regard to the increased social mobility of recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">The scheme in this Bill applies to persons not serving an excluded sentence and who have remained conviction free for the appropriate period of rehabilitation.  I suppose it is true to say that the Bill will be aimed primarily at once-off offenders who had convictions for minor, no-violent offences, such as road traffic offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">I note that the rehabilitation period will be seven years in respect of a custodial sentence for a term not exceeding six months, and five years for non-custodial sentences.  Excluded employment, which is not covered by the Bill, will include those who work with children or those working with the intellectually disabled; those in health care work; those in the legal profession; all who work in the civil and public sectors; and some in financial related employment under the regulation of the Financial Regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">We will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to deal in considerable detail with the Bill.  However, section 4 states that the general effect of a spent conviction is to ensure that a rehabilitated person will be treated for all purposes in law as a person who has not committed or been charged with or prosecuted for or convicted of or sentenced for the offence or offences which were the subject of that conviction.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">An eminent barrister, Ms Caroline O'Connor BL, summed up what we are at in an article I read recently.  She stated that the reality is that persons convicted of minor offences, and who receive fines and a criminal recorded, are often unaware that they have a criminal record for life, that a criminal record, however minor, can have adverse consequences in respect of, among other things, visas, employment, insurance, entry to professions and a vicious spiral may develop in that the ex-offenders are often unable to obtain a legitimate source of income and may resort to a life or crime or obtaining a livelihood by illegal means.  This obviously leads to the possibility of further charges being brought, further convictions being recorded and perhaps even a spell of imprisonment.  That is why I welcome the Minister of State's initiative and the manner in which he introduced the Bill from the backbenches.  It is pleasing for him, as well as for the House, that he, as a Minister of State, is taking Second Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">There are persons, many of whom are in long-term employment, who have deep-seated worries and fears that they did not disclose a conviction because they might not necessarily have been asked to do so, and they fear that if their employer was to find out that their past involved a conviction, they might face summary dismissal from their employment.  The fear is that people might suffer economically and that they would also suffer the social stigma of carrying a conviction for a longer period of time than might have been envisaged, having regard to the circumstances of that conviction.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">There are, however, a number of concerns which, in the course of dealing with the small print of the legislation, we will have an opportunity of processing and examining.  The rehabilitation period of seven years for custodial and non-custodial sentences of six months or less is excessive.  While the Law Reform Commission recommended this timeframe, I would say that a period of two or three years would be more reasonable and fair in the circumstances.  This is a matter we might look at.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">As I already mentioned, the Bill is aimed at once-off offenders and offenders who have convictions for minor and, more importantly, non-violent offences.  These offences include road traffic offences, minor thefts, minor criminal damage or non-payment of fines, offences that hurt properties and pockets, but not necessarily people.  It is entirely appropriate that people who commit such offences should have a genuine opportunity to overcome their past by having their sentences expunged in circumstances where they do not re-offend.  However, two issues arise in regard to the way this is approached.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">The Bill suggests that the period to elapse before a conviction can be expunged should be five years where a non-custodial sentence is imposed and seven years in the case of a prison sentence.  I do not criticise the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, for this measure but I believe the Law Reform Commission exercised a greater degree of caution than what might be considered reasonable in recommending these overly long periods of time.  The practical effect would be that a person who received a four-month custodial sentence for the non-payment of a fine would have to wait a full 84 months before he or she could cleanly move on in circumstances where he or she has not re-offended.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">Why are we using prison for minor and non-violent offences in the first place and why, in particular, are we imprisoning fine defaulters?  We should take a more reasonable approach because the routine use of custodial sentences for default is somewhat outdated and sentencing policy needs to be brought into the 21st century.  I regret the fact that yet another Dáil session is ending without the introduction of the long-awaited fines Bill.  The Fines Bill 2004 was withdrawn last year for reasons that have not been fully explained.  By enshrining in legislation a provision for the payment of fines in instalments, we would contribute to ending the expensive and fruitless practice of sending people to jail for defaulting on relatively small sums of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">I suggest that a more useful approach to the issue would be to review and reduce the use of short-term custodial penalties.  I would like the Law Reform Commission to produce a report on this if it has not already done so.  The rationale for such an approach is clear in terms of the cost and the revolving door syndrome.  It costs €91,000 to keep one prisoner in jail for one year and Ireland has some of the highest recidivism rates internationally, with 27.4% of released prisoners serving a new prison sentence within one year and habitual criminality rates rising to 49.2% after four years.  In light of these startling figures, one would have thought that alternative means of addressing the issue would be considered.  The current practice is ineffective, a waste of resources and brings more people into the criminal justice system than necessary.  These people could serve a sentence that is of value to society by way, for example, of community service rather than imposing yet another cost on the State.  Of those committed to prison in 2007, 85.7% were as a result of non-violent misdemeanours such as offences against property, public order offences, drug and road traffic offences and other such administrative offences.  It is illogical to punish a violent murderer and an individual who failed to insure a car in the same manner, with the punishment varying only in duration.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">Our penal system operates on the basis of a series of statistical contradictions.  In 1999, Ireland had the second lowest number of recorded crimes among EU states but by 2007 we were ranked as one of Europe's hotspots for crime in an EU survey.  Our imprisonment rate per recorded crime is higher than other European countries but 85.7% of prisoners in 2007 were serving sentences for non-violent offences.  Even as I speak, however, serious criminals are avoiding prison.  The legislation on bail needs to be further tightened and a farcical situation has arisen in respect of bench warrants, tens of thousands of which remain outstanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">Despite these failings, a record number of people are being held in prison.  Figures released this week show that, with 4,042 people held in prison, we have for the first time exceeded the 4,000 mark.  Prisoners are sleeping in the reception area of Mountjoy Prison and the governor will almost be required to put a "no vacancy" sign on the doors.  Similar conditions can be experienced in other prisons throughout the State.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has proposed additional places for Portlaoise, Castlerea and Wheatfield prisons.  One wonders why, on the one hand, serious criminals do not appear to be serving full sentences while, on the other, people are being given short custodial terms for road traffic and other non-violent offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">Prisons in Ireland are enormously expensive but offer little or no deterrent.  Rather than developing a proper sentence management programme for each prisoner, cutbacks are being imposed on prisons' rehabilitative functions in regard to training and employment preparation.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">I welcome the initiatives that have been made on restorative justice and commend Judge Mary Martin in that regard.  However, I wonder what effect budgetary constraints will have on the implementation of the recommendations of the interim report on restorative justice.  I am also concerned about the lack of tiered funding for the probation and welfare service.  It is essential that the appropriate level of resources is directed at the service, with particular reference to the concept of restorative justice.  Statistical data indicate that the latter has a good record for participation and due process.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">The spent convictions project group, which comprises representatives from the Northside Community Law Centre, the Ballymun Community Law Centre, the Ballymun Local Drugs Task Force, Business in the Community and the human rights committee of the Law Society is also of the view that the scheme proposed by the Law Reform Commission is overly restrictive and limited and will make no significant impact on the rehabilitation of offenders or the reduction of recidivism rates.  I may propose on Committee Stage a broader scheme which would be open to all offenders.  Although this proposal could prove controversial, it nonetheless deserves detailed examination.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">Fine Gael supports the introduction of this Bill and we pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, for introducing it.  However, we are strongly of the opinion that the period of rehabilitation is too long and should be reduced.  The Minister should take the opportunity to look at the short sentences being given to offenders by the courts and served within the prison system.  Such people may be punished by alternative means and we can consider such arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">I am also concerned about data protection and the manner in which, for example, job applications could be open to question for would-be applicants.  Voluntary requests may be forced on potential employers on the one hand or potential employees on the other.  How would such a provision of information, through the vetting unit or otherwise, sit in terms of data protection and has advice or guidance been sought from the Data Protection Commissioner on the manner of possibly compulsory disclosure or the nature of such a request?</p>
          <p eId="para_809">For example, a question from a would-be employer might require access to Garda records with regard to past convictions.  An example would be a query as to whether an applicant has availed of the provisions of the spent convictions legislation, if and when it is enshrined in law.  That would defeat the purpose of the legislation and give rise to a serious issue for a person who may otherwise wish to avail of the provisions of the legislation.  I look forward to further debate on this matter on Committee Stage.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_812">My colleagues dealing with previous legislation are clearly wearied after a very long session and as a result we are now dealing with the Spent Convictions Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">The Bill started life as a Private Members' Bill and I welcome its principle and commend the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, for bringing the Bill forward.  It is somewhat surprising that it has taken until the last days of 2008 to address this issue.  The British Home Office did a survey some time ago of 21 different jurisdictions and, from my memory, only Ireland and Slovenia did not have some form of legislation dealing with the issue of spent convictions.  The United Kingdom Rehabilitation of Offenders Act goes back to the mid 1970s — I believe it was 1974 — and it has taken us a long time to bring forward a relatively simple and straightforward measure that has considerable potential in the rehabilitation of young offenders in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">In his statement, the Minister of State indicated the central point of the Bill is to provide to persons having a conviction for a minor offence the opportunity of not disclosing that conviction when seeking employment.  Any of us with knowledge of people convicted of minor offences know the route back to employment is difficult.  It is very well to speak theoretically about rehabilitation and re-integration to society but the way to readjust to normal society is through employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">We should be honest about the fact that a conviction, albeit for a minor offence of the kind anticipated by the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, in this Bill weighs heavily on the minds of many prospective employers.  They would not proceed to the stage of employment if a young person that might otherwise be suitable has a conviction on record.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">For that reason I am concerned about the exclusion of the public service from the provisions.  I apologise to the Minister of State as I was not in the House to hear his rationale in this respect but I have difficulty understanding the exclusion of the Civil Service.  I know the Law Reform Commission went along with the exclusion but the logic seems to be that it is fine for us to require private sector employers to take this risk of employing somebody with a record but in the State sector, it is not to be considered under any circumstances.  I do not know if this is logical.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">In his statement the Minister of State went on to indicate that there are several limitations and exclusions where disclosure will always be required.  He instances as the most notable of those cases where there is access to children.  We must consider the area of limitations and exclusions on Committee Stage.  In certain sensitive positions there must be exclusions, but I wonder if the provisions must be as wide as the Minister provides for in his Bill.  The exclusion of the Civil Service seems to be a major issue before we get down to discussing the nature of certain offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">Deputy Charles Flanagan referred to the group that came into existence — it may have been formed as a result of the Minister of State's Private Members' Bill or the Law Reform Commission report — that has done a good deal of work with this issue.  It comprises people at the coalface and with direct experience, including lawyers.  These include the Coolock law centre.  The group has direct experience, especially with young people and of the phenomenon we are addressing here.  It has put together quite a significant submission.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">I do not know if the Minister of State has met representatives of the group or if he has had the opportunity to study the submission, but I recommend it to him.  On Committee Stage we must tease out some of the issues raised by the group, including the exclusionary clauses.  For example, it states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_820">Further safeguards would be introduced by the provision for exclusion from the scheme in respect of sensitive posts, positions or professions so that applicants would be required to disclose all previous convictions when applying for such positions.  The group would recommend exclusions along similar lines to those proposed by the Law Reform Commission, including, for example, those working with vulnerable members of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">So they accept that in certain sensitive cases exclusions are desirable, but we must be very careful.  Having brought forward a piece of legislation that was introduced as a Private Members' Bill and has now been adopted by the Government, we are not likely to revisit this issue easily, having left it for so long.  The Penal Reform Trust, the Law Society and the combination of organisations in the project group to which Deputy Charles Flanagan referred, have direct experience so they should be heard.  I hope that the Minister will engage with them directly.  The Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights ought to hear from them directly also because the legislation is now on Second Stage.  We owe them that much.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">It is sad to see young males, in particular, who cross the line and end up with a criminal conviction, even though it may be for a minor offence.  It is sad to see the implications of that early transgression for their future livelihoods and careers.  The measure proposed by the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, will expunge that record for some of these young people.  However, we could easily settle for a somewhat more radical and inclusive measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">I was struck by the project group tackling sexual offences head on.  As I entered the Chamber, I heard the Minister of State make some reference to that.  The group acknowledges that the question of sex offenders is likely to prove controversial.  It went on to contend that sex offenders would be entitled to avail of the scheme, stating:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_824">. . . there would appear to be an innate prejudice against sex offenders, no doubt attributable to the heinous nature of their crimes, which leads to an assumption that they are predisposed to offend and are incapable of rehabilitation.  This view, however, is not supported by research in this area.  A recent UCD study found that sex offenders are less likely to reoffend than most other groups.  It must be borne in mind that under the proposed scheme, sex offenders will have to establish before a central authority that they have been rehabilitated and this should go towards reassuring the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">Quite honestly, I do not know enough about that issue to draw conclusions on it today.  I would like to hear evidence on that aspect, however, which has been raised by people who have given some thought to this.  Is there not already a provision in the Children Act for expunging criminal convictions for minor offenders?</p>

          <p eId="para_827">What does that say for the principle in terms of adults?  Do we exclude adults in all cases in this particular category?  Am I right in saying there does not appear to be any differentiation in the Bill between suspended sentences and jail sentences?  As far as I can see from a quick reading of the Bill, both are regarded as custodial.  If that is right, there ought to be a differentiation.  That raises the question referred to by Deputy Charles Flanagan about the duration of the period for which someone must be conviction free.  Seven and five years' duration seems a very long time indeed.  The Law Reform Commission took a fairly conservative position on this matter.  I really wonder whether seven and five-year periods are warranted.  That is something we will have an opportunity to deal with on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">The fundamental question is why so many young people end up in custodial care for comparatively minor offences.  It is a complex issue which we have been debating in other contexts during this parliamentary session, but we seem to have decided to provide more and more prison places rather than addressing questions of rehabilitation and reintegration into society.  Some prison accommodation is badly in need of upgrading or replacement.  However, the Thornton Hall venture is a massive prison project whose intention, clearly, is that custodial sentences are in prospect for non-violent and relatively minor offences.  On the other scale of the criminal justice system, many normally liberal people would say that sentencing policy for far more serious and violent crime is inadequate in terms of the prison sentences meted out.  Surely the thrust of our approach ought to be to keep people who are only guilty of minor infractions out of the custodial system.  That question is at the very basis of what we are discussing here.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">I hope that those who have gone to the trouble of doing some detailed research and who have taken time out to point up what they see as some of the weaknesses in the Bill before us, will be given an audience before we go into committee.  On Committee Stage, we will have the opportunity to address in more detail some of the points that have arisen in the context of the Bill.  I unreservedly welcome the principle of the Bill.  It has taken a long time for us to get this far, but the legislation will be welcomed by tens of thousands of parents around the country whose young fellow, for whatever reason and at a young age, found himself in circumstances where unwittingly he now carries a criminal conviction.  For the purposes of future careers, including employment applications, such convictions will be considered spent after a reasonable period.  We may have to consider what a reasonable period or timeframe is because not all offences are the same.  A six-month sentence threshold seems reasonable, but if one goes beyond that one may have difficulties.  However, the significant variations within that rubric of six months should be reflected in the timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">I look forward to the opportunity to tease out some of these issues on Committee Stage.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, on his effort and on managing to use his position, in a seat I once occupied, to set to one side the claims of his ministerial colleagues and secure time on the floor of the House to introduce this Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_831">Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCathaoir as ucht an deis seo a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an mBille um Chiontuithe Spíonta 2007, atá an-tábhachtach.  Nuair a d'fhoilsigh an tAire an reachtaíocht seo anuraidh, ghabh mé comhghairdeas leis.  Dúirt mé ag an am cé gur aontaigh mé leis an mBille, ba chóir dó dul i bhfad níos faide.  Labhróidh mé mar gheall ar na fadhbanna atá agam leis an reachtaíocht níos déanaí.  I dtús báire, díreoidh mé ar ghnéithe maithe an Bhille, atá thar am teacht os comhair na Dála.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">This Bill provides for a non-disclosure regime whereby certain convictions would be considered spent rather than expunged and would not need to be disclosed to a prospective employer after a set period of conviction-free living, defined in the Bill as a rehabilitation period.  The provision only applies to minor convictions involving a sentence not exceeding six months' imprisonment.  Where a custodial sentence is involved, the conviction-free period must be seven years.  In the case of a conviction that did not result in a prison order, the period is set at five years.  A range of offences and employment types are expressly excluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">I welcome the Bill, which represents the first time outside the Children Act that the State has recognised that a minor conviction should not hang over a person for the rest of his or her life.  People make mistakes.  Many of those who will be covered by the Bill made one mistake and suffered the consequences, namely, the courts and the judge's sentence.  However, the conviction hangs over them for the rest of their lives.  Not only do their choice of jobs become limited, but they are also limited in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">I hope the Bill is the start of an understanding whereby, if a court finds against someone, the sentence handed down should not incur another sentence thereafter.  The Dáil has taken the position that certain sentences must stand forever and be placed on a record of sorts, such as the sex offenders' and drug dealers' registers.  I am not suggesting that there should be major changes made to either of those.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">The primary objective of a justice policy must be to reduce crime, but it must also prevent re-offending.  While the first purpose of handing down a prison sentence is to punish someone for wrongdoing, the second is to try to rehabilitate the individual.  I hope the Bill adds incentives to prevent someone from re-offending.  Too often, individuals go to prison on a small sentence, fall in with a bad crowd and stay with it when they get out.  There does not seem to be an incentive.  In their eyes, they have been labelled for life.  I hope the Bill will reduce this consequence or explain that, if someone goes to prison on a small sentence or is handed down a non-custodial sentence, the label could be removed if he or she subsequently lives a crime-free lifestyle for a period of seven years or five years, respectively.  This will ensure that people who have a desire to acquire gainful employment or some other position will understand that they have a duty to themselves and society to remain crime free.  In so doing, they will benefit under the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">Unwarranted barriers to employment and discrimination must be proactively removed.  A range of barriers serve to inhibit the rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-prisoners in particular.  The fields in which discrimination operates to exclude those with a prior conviction include employment, accommodation, travel and adoption, depending on the sentence.  The judge in a number of cases in the 1980s was mindful of the circumstances of those before him and tried to encourage them to leave the State.  Instead of giving a sentence, he gave them the Probation Act in case they ever wanted to go to America.  It was a blatant hint.  The judge gave people the opportunity to emigrate to America because if they had a conviction on record, they would not have been able to do so.  Here we are again giving people an opportunity if they have committed a one-off mistake, such as being in the wrong place at the wrong time, fuelled by drink or so on.  If they are genuinely remorseful, they will understand the terms set out in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">People with a conviction are discriminated against.  The extent of the discrimination should not be either overestimated or underestimated, but a recent study found that 48% of employers would not employ someone with a criminal record.  These barriers serve to exacerbate Ireland's high recidivism rate.  If so many employers will not employ someone with a criminal record, irrespective of the nature of that record, the people to be addressed by the Bill will be excluded from a number of areas of employment.  The Bill is welcome in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">However, as a first step the Bill is small in scope and late.  Britain has had a spent conviction regime since the 1970s, but we are still waiting for one.  I hope the Bill will progress quickly so that we can catch up with other regimes.  In February, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, indicated that the Bill would be introduced in a matter of weeks, but it was not to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">I hope the Bill will pass Second Stage quickly, but we must spend a bit of time on Committee Stage, as Deputy Rabbitte stated, to determine whether we can improve it without labouring the point.  It must stand the test of time without being overly restrictive concerning those who have been convicted.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">A more complex and proportionate regime than that contained in the Bill should be introduced.  A scheme could be introduced whereby the duration of the rehabilitation period required would, depending on the length of sentence attached to the past conviction, vary.  The current position is that the rehabilitation period in respect of a six-month sentence is seven years.  Might it be possible to consider applying a ten-year rehabilitation period in respect of sentences of less than two years' duration?</p>
          <p eId="para_841">Quite a number of individuals, particularly young people, serve sentences of more than six months.  In that context, we should consider ways to encourage them to stay away from the characters they meet in prison and those who led them to be in prison in the first instance, and to avoid the type of activity that led to their incarceration.  Knowing that their mistakes would be considered a thing of the past after ten years might provide such encouragement.  It might then be possible to deal with sentences of more than two years' duration but the rehabilitation period relating thereto would obviously be much longer.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">A further age-related tier, linked to the length of the rehabilitation period required, could be introduced in order that account might be taken of the age of those between, for example, 18 and 20 and 20 and 25.  Under the overly cautious terms of the Bill, an 18 year old who commits a once-off minor offence may, as a result of the seven-year rehabilitation period, have a conviction hanging over him or her until he or she reaches 27 years of age because the rehabilitation period can commence up to two years after an offence is committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">The rehabilitation period will only commence following incarceration.  However, there are those who are arrested and subsequently convicted who do not avail of bail because they know they have been caught bang to rights and are willing to serve the first six to 12 months of a sentence because they have an idea of what will be the eventual duration of that sentence.  These individuals will not benefit because the first 12 months detention before a trial takes place will not be taken into account.  Perhaps time served prior to conviction in respect of the offence committed might be taken into account as part of the rehabilitation period.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">Facing employment-related discrimination during the crucial years between conviction and the end of the rehabilitation period can be difficult, particularly for young people who may be trying to lay the foundations of a career.  There can be lifelong consequences if these individuals are prevented from embarking on a set course of employment for seven years.  I accept that such consequences result from the offence committed in the first instance.  However, I am of the view that we should consider introducing a shorter rehabilitation period of perhaps five years in respect of those between the ages of 18 and 20.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">We can tease this matter out further before Committee Stage, examine how similar regimes have worked in other countries and try to establish whether those regimes were tweaked in order to incorporate proposals such as that which I have put forward.  We should also try to establish whether a shorter rehabilitation for younger people assists in reducing the rate of recidivism among them.  The recidivism rate among young people in Ireland is one of the highest in Europe.  I am not suggesting that we reward people for offences they have committed, I am concerned with ensuring that they do not reoffend and that they are given the opportunity to become upstanding members of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">The provisions relating to excluded areas of employment in the Bill are too broad.  It is crucial that work involving substantial access to children or vulnerable adults should be afforded special protection.  No one denies that.  However, because of the nature of this exemption from a spent conviction regime, I am of the view that the offence committed should have some relevance.  For example, if a person is convicted of committing malicious damage or some similar crime, will he or she be excluded — for the remainder of his or her life or for the duration of the period in question — from accessing the opportunity to become a carer?</p>
          <p eId="para_847">Are there offences which, if committed, should exclude people from working as teachers, special needs assistants, carers, youth workers, etc?  Some of the individuals in question are often best placed to understand the young people with whom they would like to work because they understand the pitfalls of life better than those who have not been exposed to the justice system.  We must be careful that we do not continue the type of exclusion that exists in many instances at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">The available evidence suggests that the blanket exclusion relating to all posts in health care and the Civil Service and certain legal and financial-related posts is not justified.  I accept that there may be certain offences which might exclude a person from taking up a position in the area of finance.  For example, very few banks would employ someone who had committed a robbery.  However, if the person in question were convicted of a public order offence, should he or she be excluded from occupying financial-related or legal posts?  Having gone before the courts and been sentenced, he or she would probably have a better understanding of the legal system than many of those employed in the legal profession at present.  Perhaps employing a few more former convicted felons in this profession might shake up the legal system and bring an air of reality to it.  Where the nature of a past conviction is not relevant following a rehabilitation period, employers or others should not be presented with the unwarranted opportunity to discriminate.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">A range of issues is not addressed in the Bill.  The Minister of State must either produce separate legislation or incorporate new provisions in the Bill to address the situation relating to former political prisoners.  The British-Irish Agreement was concluded ten years ago, but former political prisoners are still subject to grave discrimination in respect of many areas ranging from employment to adoption.  I recently communicated with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of someone who was prevented from becoming a carer because the vetting process announced his former conviction to all and sundry and the HSE took a dim view of the situation.  Even though the Minister stated that the conviction did not, in itself, bar it from employing the person, the HSE used it as such.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">The Spent Convictions Bill does not go far enough in respect of the people to whom I refer.  In light of what is contained in the British-Irish Agreement, the expunging of these records would send out a signal that Ireland has put the past behind us and moved on.  The Government must tackle this issue head on.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">A former Republican prisoner was annoyed when he and his partner were denied the opportunity to adopt a child based on a conviction which was more than 20 years old.  There has been dramatic changes in our society and political make-up during the past 20 years.  This person has served his prison time, which is sentence enough, and is now regarded by all and sundry as an upstanding citizen.  The political nature of the conflict in Ireland must be recognised and this recognition must be extended to political ex-prisoners against whom discrimination must end.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">As I stated, while this Bill may not be the appropriate legislation to address this issue, it nevertheless deals with related matters.  I believe the Bill provides us with an opportunity to address that issue, for which I will argue on Committee Stage.  In addition, prior to Committee Stage I will try to formulate an amendment which the Government may be able to take on board.  Sinn Féin is not alone in arguing this point.  The Human Rights Commission has proposed that equality legislation be extended to include the status of ex-prisoners as a prohibitive ground in terms of discrimination.  This would also include political prisoners.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">I welcome the Bill which, if passed as it stands, will be a welcome step.  My desire is to have a better Bill, one that is extended to cover the issues I mentioned.  Given the significant cost to the State of incarceration, anything we can do to prevent recidivism and further incarceration of people who have already served a sentence will augur well.  By this I mean that we must put in place a proper rehabilitative scheme within the prison system which provides education and training to those wishing to better themselves during the period of their detention, thus benefiting the State thereafter.  Unless this is followed up with a regime which permits such people to obtain full employment and to once again become full members of society who are not discriminated against owing to their past records, to the degree they have been to date, that will be money badly spent.  This Bill will, it is hoped, save the State money and benefit society as a whole.  If the Government takes on board the suggestions I have made, society will benefit and more ex-prisoners will be able to play a better and more productive role in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">If this Bill is to contribute in a significant way to a long-term reduction in crime, it will require extensive amendment.  I made some suggestions in this regard earlier and will make others in the future.  The Minister would do well to reconsider prior to Committee Stage the proposals from the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  While I could quote chapter and verse in that regard, I do not agree 100% with all that is contained in its submission.  It is good that we are having this debate given the current climate outside the prison system.  Crime, and in particular violent crime, is on the rise.  This is associated with drug taking and drug dealing which is at an all time high.  Our society is becoming more violent.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">While we send out the message that we will be tough on those who commit crime, we must also send out the message that those people caught up in a once-off situation, who make a mistake and who are genuinely remorseful after an incident, will be given the opportunity to rehabilitate.  As I said earlier, this is, at the end of the day, the role of our justice system.  We must permit people following completion of a prison sentence imposed by a court to once again become a full member of society.  A person against whom society discriminates is not a full member of society.  There are offenders who, given their nature and the likelihood of re-offending, in particular sex offenders, must be monitored and tracked to ensure they do not have an opportunity to re-offend.  Many people are sentenced to prison for relatively short periods and relatively minor offences.  There is no incentive, other than the goodwill of society or the threat of a greater sentence, for them not to re-offend.  Often people who have been in their view harshly sentenced have a desire to get back at society.  We must ensure that under the new regime there is, as stated by the Irish Penal Reform Trust, sufficient flexibility of proportionality in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">It is hoped that through our discussions on Committee Stage we will succeed in ensuring that the Bill, when passed, will be something of which we can all be proud.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_251">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
          <p eId="para_857">I thank Deputies for their contributions and for their welcome for the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">The intention is that the Bill will be used by judges, probation officers and those working with ex-offenders, including prison officers.  Judges when considering what sentence to hand down to a person must have regard to the need to punish an individual, the need to deter others, the need to protect society and to rehabilitate.  The Bill is a useful measure which will allow a judge to advise an offender on conviction and sentence that there exists a facility through which he or she can restore himself or herself to society.  Equally, it will be a useful measure for those working with offenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">In general, detention is a last resort in sentencing under our criminal justice system.  The Probation Act is widely used by judges and the youth diversion programme is widely used by the Garda Síochána.  Also, more emphasis is now being placed on restorative justice.  This means that those in custody are<b> </b>not put there lightly.  We do not like to detain people and will use this measure only as a means of last resort.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">The number of people captured by the Bill, in terms of the six month period set down, is substantial.  More than 60% of sentences are on average for six months or less, thus meaning the provision will capture a large category of people.  This does not mean that we will give up on the other 40% in terms of rehabilitation, but that this measure will be available to those offenders who have short custodial sentences.  There is no doubt but that the recidivism rate in Ireland is high.  This Bill does not represent a magic wand which will end this, but it will provide assistance to those people working with ex-offenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">On Deputy Rabbitte's point, I have met with the Law Society which has its own committee on this issue.  I have also spoken with representatives of the Irish Penal Reform Trust and businesses in the community who work closely with ex-offenders. They have given me some useful advice on this matter.  On the employment situation, I must point out that although certain employments are excluded, this does not mean a person cannot obtain a job in them.  That door is not closed to them.  They must, however, disclose any conviction to a prospective employer, including in the public service, Civil Service and all other categories.  Such people may still seek work but must, if asked, disclose any previous convictions.  That is the only change that will be introduced.  However, I will examine the question of the public service and whether we can narrow it down into a more targeted approach so that we can try to ensure individuals can access non-sensitive jobs in the public service and Civil Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">I will not change the situation regarding sex offenders.  Deputy Rabbitte made the point that they may be less likely to reoffend.  That is perhaps true but the consequences of them reoffending are so great as to not permit me to ask any employer to take a risk on non-disclosure in those circumstances.  In regard to suspended sentences, it is only the custodial part of a sentence that is considered in respect to the six months that is referred to in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">Regarding adoption, most adoptions currently are inter-country adoptions.  Therefore, they are based on agreements with other countries and it would be asking a lot to expect other countries to have agreements with us concerning adoptions by ex-offenders.  It may be a step too far.  That said, I look forward to the Committee Stage debate on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">Deputy Charlie Flanagan's remark that the rehabilitation period is too long was echoed by others.  The thinking behind it is that the Children Act specifies a period of three years and the Law Reform Commission recommended at least double that in respect of adults.  However, we will listen to the debate that takes place on those rehabilitation periods to see whether there is a justification for shortening them.  There is no question of lengthening them.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">The major objective of the Bill is to facilitate the rehabilitation of offenders.  That is a worthy objective that benefits not only the individual concerned, but also society at large.  It is in the interests of society generally that we break the cycle of crime.  There are many ways of doing that but securing steady, gainful employment has been shown to be among the most effective and useful.  The aim of the Bill is to reduce the barriers to the re-entry into the workforce of a person who has a conviction for a minor offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">It is important to be clear about the precise manner in which the Bill approaches the matter of past convictions.  The Bill does not entail a deletion or removal of the details of the conviction from the criminal records.  Instead, it sets out the circumstances in which such details need not be disclosed.  The Law Reform Commission summarised the position very well.  Its report debates the balance between the individual and wider society.  The individual will feel he has served his punishment and should be allowed to rebuild his life.  He will be concerned that his privacy is breached each time he has to reveal an old conviction.  However, society, on the other hand, has a proper interest in maintaining a permanent record of criminal convictions, in order to ensure reliable vetting for sensitive employment posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">Following that debate, the commission has presented us with a proposal which I and the Government think is reasonable and acceptable and which finds the right balance between the interests involved.  The proposal respects the needs of wider society while also moving a considerable distance to meet the legitimate concerns of minor offenders.  It achieves that by permitting non-disclosure while placing reasonable limits on the circumstances where that may arise.  The commission suggests that the limits are justified by reference to the nature of some convictions as well as the requirements attaching to certain types of employment.  We all know of certain employments where information about past convictions is always a relevant consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">Many public service and Civil Service posts entail the job holder acting in a position of trust in regard to public funds or information that is confidential or sensitive and which must not be revealed either because it is personal or it would not be in the public interest to do so.  It is important that the public retains trust and confidence in those to whom they entrust such information or who disburse the public's money.  It is, therefore, important that people in public service and Civil Service posts are known and are seen to be above suspicion.  Ensuring they have no criminal convictions is an important means of providing the assurance that the public requires.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">There are also certain offences that must always be disclosed.  Particular offences are selected by reference not just to the offence itself, but also by reference to the employment situations.  It would never be acceptable, for example, that a person with even a minor conviction for a sexual offence would be allowed to work with children or vulnerable adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">The Law Reform Commission's proposals and the Bill build on the regime already in place under the Children Act 2001.  Although the regime for children is somewhat broader in terms of, for example, the offences that need not be disclosed, it nevertheless represents the same general approach that is found in the Bill.  The difference in treatment can be explained and accepted on the basis of age and the need to avoid branding persons on the basis of their childhood activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">I am aware that it will be necessary to amend the Bill in several respects and, in the course of my opening remarks, I have already identified several matters requiring amendment.  It may take a little while to finalise the amendments.  Nevertheless, I have no hesitation in saying that the overall approach being set out in the Bill is a good one that will benefit many thousands of people.  The amendments will not alter the overall approach but will help clarify aspects of the Bill.  For today's purposes, I am happy to wholeheartedly recommend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <b>Deputy Charles Flanagan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         the action he proposes to take in the context of the recent murder of a law-abiding citizen in inner city Dublin and the evidence from this murder that a serious societal problem exists whereby anti-social behaviour is rife in certain areas and is capable of escalating into serious violence and even murder, the easy availability of dangerous offensive weapons and the failure of legislative measures aimed at tackling anti-social behaviour measures to date.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_876">The House had the opportunity last week to express its abhorrence at the killing of Mr. O'Kane.  A person has been charged in connection with this killing and the Garda investigations are continuing.  Consequently, I am greatly constrained in what I can say about the specific incident.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">The criminal use of firearms is very serious and is tackled by An Garda Síochána with appropriate strategies.  Tackling public order issues is also a priority for both the Garda and the Government.  This is evidenced by the resources we have committed to front line policing, which I am determined will continue to have top priority.  A focus of Operation Anvil has been removing illegal weapons from circulation.  To date, more than 2,200 firearms have been seized since its inception in 2005.  As the House is aware, I have also made proposals for dealing with the easy availability of weapons through tackling the issue of licensed handguns.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">Since 2002, when the Garda introduced Operation Encounter specifically to target anti-social behaviour, almost 520,000 public order offences have been detected.  Strong provisions are now in place to combat anti-social behaviour and the abuse of alcohol, which is the root cause of much criminal and anti-social behaviour.  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 enacted provisions to combat anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 gives further significant powers to the Garda to tackle binge drinking and the availability of alcohol to under age people.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">I recognise that dealing with public disorder is an issue on which co-operation between the Garda and the local community is vital.  That is why I am proceeding with the roll-out nationwide of the joint policing committees, following a successful pilot phase.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">I attach great importance to tackling crime by juveniles in a focused and comprehensive way.  The Irish Youth Justice Service was established within my Department to develop an integrated response to youth offending within the framework of the Children Act 2001.  However, none of these measures can substitute for the primary moral and legal responsibility on parents where the behaviour of their children is concerned.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_255">
            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
            <p eId="para_881">The Minister began his reply by stating there was an opportunity in the House last week to debate the increase in the number of murders and the indiscriminate use of guns on our streets.  Regrettably since that occasion, only one week ago, there have been three further murders in the State, bringing the total number of murders this year to 47, some 20 of which can be categorised as so-called gangland killings.  What steps is the Minister taking to deal with this increased pattern of UK-style gun and gangland culture in our cities?  Youths seem to have free and easy access to guns, vicious and deadly knives, and swords.  Communities are being terrorised and people are living in fear and anxiety.  What steps are being taken by the Minister?</p>
            <p eId="para_882">The Minister has given the same reply today as last week.  There does not appear to be any sense of urgency on the part of the Minister, nor does there appear to be any sense of leadership.  Has the Minister noted the recent comments of the former Police Commissioner of the City of Boston, Ms Kathleen O'Toole, who currently performs an admirable role as Chief Inspector of the Garda Inspectorate?  She suggested relentless policing is important to ensure gangsters, gangland criminals and youths who are prepared to kill are apprehended prior to killing.  Has the Minister examined the model in Boston, whereby a crime hot spot is targeted and youths in that area are dealt with by community police prior to committing offences?</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_883">The debate on this matter took place last week and I will not discuss the issue of Garda resources.  It must be accepted that, especially on the streets of Dublin, there are significant levels of policing.  Most Deputies, especially those from outside Dublin, recognise that there are substantial numbers of gardaí on the streets.  At present, there are some 14,200 and this figure will rise to 14,900 by the end of next year.  There is also the programme of civilianisation, involving approximately 2,500 people working in stations as civilians which enables gardaí to work on the streets instead of in the office.</p>
            <p eId="para_884">I welcome the comments made by Ms Kathleen O'Toole, which I read extensively.  Thankfully, the Garda Inspectorate has been a great catalyst for change within the Garda since its inception.  I recognise her comments and I understand from discussions with Garda management that the force targets hot spots of anti-social behaviour where young people congregate and that it is focussed on cases where young people commit crimes on public transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">Let us consider the significant figures related to community policing.  There are some 690 dedicated community gardaí and there are youth diversion projects in place in more than 100 areas throughout the country.  Let us consider the response in the probation service and remember the ASBO legislation and the substantial commitment to its implementation, which is ongoing.  Substantial efforts have taken place in this area.  A significant feature in tackling anti-social behaviour and juvenile crime is the work of the Garda with local communities and parents and this work is ongoing.</p>

            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
            <p eId="para_886">I refer to one aspect of the Minister's reply.  Anti-social behaviour orders were introduced by legislation in 2006.  Why are they not working?  How many ASBOs have been sought and how many have been granted?  The numbers are very small.  Why is this measure not working in the manner claimed by the Minister's predecessor?</p>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_887">As I previously stated to the Deputy, anyone who says the legislation is not working is not considering the facts.  Substantial numbers of anti-social behaviour warnings have been issued to adults.  To the best of my recollection, approximately 900 such warnings have been issued since the inception of the legislation in early 2007, some 600 of which have been issued to children.</p>

            <p eId="para_889">I am coming to that.  I understand 12 good behaviour contracts and six ABSOs have been sought by the Garda, including some for adults and some for children.  It is entirely a matter for the Garda and it is not my role to direct the force.  The Garda must use the legislation in place.  Anyone who says it is not working is misrepresenting the situation.</p>

        <b>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         the position regarding contacts he has had with the Equality Authority regarding difficulties they will face as a result of his decision to cut its budget by 42% for 2009; the reason he did not accept the suggestion put forward by the board of the authority for alternative cuts that would have resulted in savings of 32%; his views on the resignation of a person (details supplied) as chief executive and his view that the budget cut imposed by his Department had rendered the authority unviable; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [47438/08]

          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_270" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_900">At the outset I wish to state the Government's absolute commitment to the principles of equality and the elimination of discrimination as enunciated in much equality legislation passed by the Oireachtas.  I commend the work of the Equality Authority and I state my commitment to ensuring a secure and viable future for the Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">The Government and its predecessors promoted the legislation which earmarked €47 million for the Equality Authority since 1997, increasing from an initial budget of €378,000 and rising to €5.9 million in 2007.  The Government and its predecessors increased the number of staff in the Equality Authority to 53 in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_902">We will continue to earmark substantial taxpayer resources to the Equality Authority to allow it to carry out its core functions as per the legislation.  Naturally, when the national finances permit, we will also ensure that the budget of the Equality Authority is appropriately increased.</p>
            <p eId="para_903">I am requesting all agencies which fall under the remit of my Department, including the Equality Authority, to engage in coming months with the expenditure review group which will take an independent analysis of the position relating to their budgets, efficiencies and the capacity to fulfil their core functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">I accept that 2009 will be a difficult year for all public bodies, including the Equality Authority and other agencies in the justice area.  However, I am satisfied there is sufficient funding for the authority to enable it to discharge its core functions.  I welcome the statement this week from the board of the authority declaring its commitment and determination to continue to work effectively and independently for the elimination of discrimination and the promotion of equality in our society.</p>

          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_271">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_905">Is it not hypocritical in the extreme of the Minister to trot out some mealy-mouthed platitudes in the House about his commitment to equality, when he has driven out the chief executive from the Equality Authority and has effectively broken up the agency?  Is it not the case that the Equality Authority cannot possibly discharge its functions under the strictures now on it?  What is the point of reiterating that this Government has done this, that or the other?  The agency has only been in existence for approximately ten years and Fianna Fáil has been in government throughout that time.  The Minister could take any agency and multiply its funding by ten years' budgets to give the impression of enormous largesse and support.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">Is the Minister proud of the fact that he has driven out the chief executive, a man who has won commendations on all sides in respect of his performance and the independent and courageous manner in which he discharged his duties with integrity?  Is the Minister satisfied that the agency has effectively been undermined because it cannot and will not be able to discharge its functions in the future?</p>

            <p eId="para_907">The ethos of my political party on its formation was to bring equality into a highly divided and class-ridden society.  I take pride in the fact that all of the equality legislation that has been passed by this House has been introduced by Fianna Fáil-led Governments, of which neither Deputy Rabbitte nor his party, the so-called Labour Party, the party of the people, was a member.</p>

            <p eId="para_909">As for the specific issue of the Equality Authority, Members on all sides, particularly those in the Opposition, have been constantly raising the valid issue of spending on public relations and consultancies.  It will do no harm to refer to the 2007 report, which Deputy Rabbitte should have read before coming into the House, on the Equality Authority.  In 2007, it spent €220,000 on public relations and €100,000 on consultants.  A total of €614,000 was spent on the European Year of Equal Opportunities, half of which came from European funding and half from its own budget, giving a net expenditure of €300,000.  It also spent €350,000 on an anti-racist week and €230,000 on a national campaign against ageism, the expenditure on which was criticised by the Opposition in this House.  It spent €184,000 on publications and, in effect, €440,000 on rent of premises in Dublin.  However, it could make savings by going down and spending only €120,000 on rental accommodation in Roscrea, where 15 employees of the Equality Authority already reside.  When Members on the other side of the House raise the issue of consultancies and expenditure, it is valid to go through such expenditure to ascertain where there can be savings.</p>

Is it not the task of the Equality Authority to deal with issues such as racism?  If excessive rental costs for the headquarters have been incurred, who approved them?  Why did someone in the Minister's Government not do something about it over the past 11 years?</p>
            <p eId="para_918">Can the Minister assure the House that the forcing out of Mr. Niall Crowley has nothing to do with the Equality Authority's referral to the Garda Síochána of an allegation that the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, while head of the Prison Service, had breached the Employment Equality Acts?  If the Minister is so interested in saving money, is it not the case that the board members of this organisation used to serve free gratis for years until the appointment of the new board by the Minister, the members of which now are paid a fee of €10,000 each?  Can the Minister answer these questions?</p>

As for the Equality Authority, I validly listed out areas in which I believe savings can be effected because we are now in a different situation.  When I was dealing with the Estimates a number of months ago, I made the point I was trying to make in my earlier response.  As I stated during my last Question Time, I told my officials that my number one priority in my Department was tackling crime.

            <p eId="para_1003">The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the table.  It is the case that there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months, during which time the total number in custody has increased by approximately 280.  There are a number of reasons for this increase.  With the extra resources provided by this Government, the Garda Síochána has been increasingly successful in prosecuting criminals and additional court sittings have resulted in higher committal rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">The number in custody has risen by 8% and the total number of persons in custody and on temporary release has increased by 15.5%.  The provision of an additional 1,300 prison places in recent years has largely addressed the issue of overcrowding, which had been a chronic problem for the prison system.  It is my view that the continuation of the current capital programme is necessary if overcrowding is not to become a problem in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">It has to be acknowledged that the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the courts.  Figures from the past 12 years reveal that the numbers in custody have increased by 65% and the numbers on temporary release have decreased by 34%.  More recently the number of committals to our prisons in 2007 was 9,711, of which 6,455 were under sentence.  The average daily prison population in custody in 2007 was 3,321.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">It is quite clear that we are currently operating in excess of our bed capacity in some of our prisons.  In the short to medium term this issue will be addressed by the provision of 400 prison places by summer 2009 in a new remand block due to be completed in early 2009 in Castlerea Prison which will accommodate approximately 100 prisoners, a new block in Portlaoise Prison due to open in the coming months which will accommodate approximately 150 prisoners and a new block in Wheatfield Prison accommodating 150 prisoners which is due to be completed in summer 2009.  Most recently, over 30 additional places have been made available at the open centre at Shelton Abbey and a further 40 places have been developed at the open centre at Loughan House.  It should also be borne in mind that our prisons have contingency plans in place whereby they can accommodate numbers above their ideal working capacities.  These new developments will serve the prison service until the opening of the new prison complex at Thornton Hall.  This prison is designed to accommodate 1,408 prisoners based on single cell occupancy in a range of prison facilities.  For operational flexibility reasons, the design has the capacity to accommodate up to 2,200 prisoners in a multiple occupancy arrangement.  This flexibility will future proof the development in capacity terms for the next 50 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007">The Irish Prison Service capital programme will also ensure the elimination of the unacceptable practice of slopping out and will effectively complete the modernisation of the prison estate.  The prison estate will be comparable to best international practice in terms of accommodation, facilities and services for the rehabilitation and reintegration of prisoners into society.  The Government and the Irish Prison Service have anticipated the demand for prison spaces and have acted accordingly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1056">It is regrettable the Minister refuses to accept the fact that the prison system is undergoing a crisis.  The criminal justice system is being undermined by dint of the hundreds of offenders who are committed to prison by the courts to serve lengthy sentences only to be released after a short period.  How does the Minister propose to deal with this issue?</p>
            <p eId="para_1057">Does he accept the findings of a recent interim report of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention which found that prisoners were sleeping in the reception area of Mountjoy Prison, on dirty and soiled mattresses and on cell floors, in some cases without mattresses?  The inspector pointed out that violence among prisoners was beginning to reflect gang related conflicts outside of prison and, in an understatement, noted that overcrowding has become excessive.  However, the Minister claims there is no problem.</p>

            <p eId="para_1058">I do not claim there is no problem.  I told the Deputy that we are at capacity and that we have developed 1,300 new places in the past ten years in order to address the issue.  That compares favourably with Fine Gael's record in Government.  When Nora Owen was Minister for Justice, she cancelled the prison building programme.  We restarted the programme in 1997 and have since then developed 1,300 new places.  We will open a further 400 places between now and the summer.  That is the short-term solution, whereas the answer in the long term will be Thornton prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059">The figure for temporary release is in the region of 10% to 11%, which compares favourably with the figures for 1994 at 22.2%, 1995 at 20%, 1996 at 17.9%, and 1997 at 19.2%.  I accept that problems exist in Mountjoy and the Dochas Centre.  We are opening 400 new places in Castlerea, Portlaoise and Wheatfield prisons.  I recently visited Cloverhill and Wheatfield prisons and found the conditions there to greatly exceed a comparable prison that I visited in Italy.  When we finish this programme in mid-summer, we will have renewed 40% of the prison estate, thus ensuring our facilities are among the best in the world.</p>

            <p eId="para_1061">The aim for Thornton Hall was to sign the contract in early 2009 but in light the current economic difficulties, the current bidder and I anticipate all the other bidders are experiencing problems with the credit crunch.  I understand that negotiations are ongoing and efforts will be resumed in the new year to obtain the finance required at a reasonable rate.  We want the project to proceed.  As it is a public private partnership, the taxpayer will not pay a cent until the project is completed and ready for takeover.  It is a 25 year project but in the short term we are putting in place 400 additional places between now and the summer.</p>

            <p eId="para_1063">Given the enormous transaction level in the District Court, it is inevitable that at any given time a significant number of bench warrants will be awaiting execution.  It should be borne in mind that the vast majority of the outstanding bench warrants relate to unpaid fines for minor infractions of the law rather than convictions arising from violent crime.  In addition, the Garda Síochána gives priority to the execution of warrants against those it believes to be involved in serious crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1064">I have discussed this matter with the Garda Commissioner and he has assured me that the Garda authorities are committed to strengthening the warrant enforcement process.  He has discussed the execution of warrants with each regional assistant commissioner and a range of measures aimed at reducing the number of warrants on hand have been identified and are being implemented.  These measures include the assignment of additional gardaí to this function and the appointment of inspectors with responsibility for execution of outstanding warrants.  The position is being closely monitored by senior Garda management and consideration will also be given at an organisational level to further measures as necessary to address the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1065">I am informed by the Garda authorities that as a result of special measures taken in the Dublin metropolitan region, there has been an increase of 17% in the number of warrants executed between January and August this year compared to the same period last year.  I am further informed that 36,972 bench warrants are recorded and remain to be enforced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1066">I intend to seek Government approval for a fines Bill which will provide for the payment of fines by instalment and an improved means of assessing the capacity of a person to pay a fine.  As many warrants relate to financial penalties, these proposals should result in a smaller number of warrants being issued and thereby reduce pressure on the system.  I am also considering other legislative measures in this area.  The warrant system will continue to be monitored, particularly with a view to making whatever changes may be necessary to improve its operation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1067">This a most serious problem and it is getting worse.  The Minister did not refer to the August initiative, which I understand was specifically designed to deal with the backlog of warrants.  He stated that 36,970 bench warrants are currently outstanding.  Given that the figure for May was 33,000, the August initiative was a complete failure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1068">Does he accept that a number of serious criminals continue to engage in their activities even while bench warrants have been issued for them?  Where is the system failing and why is the matter not being addressed adequately?</p>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_1069">During the August blitz carried out by the Garda in the Dublin metropolitan region, 808 bench warrants, 549 penal warrants and 55 distress warrants were executed.  To a certain extent we are the victims of our own success in that the Garda has been more successful in bringing prosecutions and the courts more efficient in dealing with their business.  As the Deputy will know from his practice, many warrants are not executable for various reasons.  People who are subject to bench warrants often try to evade their issuance.  Clearly that entails much Garda time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1070">As such a high proportion of the approximately 36,000 bench warrants relate to financial penalties, we will introduce the new fines Bill in the early new year and a pilot project is already in place which has proved very successful in getting an outside agency to deal with the collection of fines.  All of those aspects will dramatically reduce the level of bench warrants.</p>

How can the Minister stand over the unedifying spectacle in Limerick, where a well-known leading gang member has turned himself into the Garda station for his own protection although a bench warrant has not been executed.  How can the Minister stand over the case of another famous and tragic murder, that of Donna Cleary, where the person responsible had two bench warrants?  Surely it is possible to distinguish between the criminal on the one hand and the civil on the other.  Can the Minister not do so?</p>

            <p eId="para_1074">As I stated in my original reply, the Garda prioritises bench warrants relating to the arrest of people for serious and general crime.  As a result of resource constrictions, they do not tend to concentrate on financial warrants, or distress warrants, as can be seen from the August figures.  Some 55 in that case were distress warrants relating to the collection of goods and chattels.  The vast majority of the bench warrants concentrated on deal with serious crime.</p>

         the number of sex offenders serving prison sentences; the number of prisoners in each prison who are participating in rehabilitation programmes; and the number of places available for sex offenders on rehabilitation programmes in prison. 
        [47437/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_378" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_1076">On 15 December 2008, there were 302 persons in custody serving sentences for sexual offences.  Three main forms of direct therapeutic intervention for sex offenders currently operate within the Irish prison system.  The group programmes are an intensive version, which have been in operation since 1994 and are currently under review.  Individual counselling is available from the Irish Prison Service's psychology service and from the Probation Service, and one-to-one interventions are provided by visiting psychiatrists who provide support to prisoners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">The intensive programme has catered for eight offenders at a time, taking 11 months to complete.  Although delivered in Arbour Hill Prison, it has been available to sex offenders in other prisons.  A total of 136 sex offenders have completed the sex offender programme to date since 1994, with the most recent group completing the programme in July 2008.  There have been difficulties in finding sufficient suitable and properly motivated prisoners to participate in this programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">One-to-one counselling is a critical method of working with offenders on their sexual offending.  In response to such counselling, many offenders who initially might deny responsibility for their crime or deny any need for treatment are motivated towards some process of change.  As of 16 December this year, 76 sex offenders have engaged in one-to-one counselling and other interventions with the psychology service.  The Probation Service also engages with prisoners on a one-to-one basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">The question of rehabilitation for sex offenders in custody is not straightforward.  Supports within the community on release can be equally vital to ensuring that sex offenders do not re-offend.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">As I mentioned, the number of suitably motivated offenders applying for participation on the group programme has declined significantly in recent years and this has been a matter of increasing concern.  Therefore, in an attempt to engage more sex offenders in appropriate interventions, the Irish Prison Service has initiated a review, and a programme incorporating new enhanced models will be introduced in January 2009.  This will allow for interventions with a significantly greater number of offenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081">As a further measure, today I wish to inform the House of a major new process to develop further national policies for the management of sex offenders.  I have a particular interest in electronic monitoring and expect to receive a report from my Department in the near future on the general question of electronic monitoring and what procurement options are open to us.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">I have also asked my officials to examine the introduction of a statutory scheme of GPS electronic monitoring of sex offenders during the first six months of their release.  If such monitoring is technically and economically viable, and if constitutional considerations do not prevent a statutory scheme, I would envisage it could operate on the basis of an application to a court immediately prior to release of an offender.  This GPS monitoring would allow any disturbing pattern to be identified at an early stage and provide objective evidence of same in the case of any Garda application to court for a sex offender order.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">This proposal will form part of a major report on the management of sex offenders which my Department will issue for public consultation after Christmas.</p>

            <p eId="para_1084">I welcome the Minister's proposal in respect of the electronic monitoring and wish him well in that regard.  I look forward to following progress in that area.  Does the Minister accept that where treatment has been provided and a course has been undertaken, the results are such that there is a public safety issue?  It is important that every effort is made to encourage prisoners to avail of the treatment.  Using the excuse that the matter is under review, as the Minister has said, has been ongoing for too long.  It is really avoiding the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">Did I hear the Minister correctly when he stated the sex offender management policy will be published in January?</p>

            <p eId="para_1090">I give credit to the Irish Prison Service for looking at a different model.  It is anticipated that under the new model, which will come into place irrespective of the tagging issue in January 2009, there will be three different types of treatment and approximately 64 prisoners per year will be dealt with.  That is a much better outturn for the significant expenditure in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1091">It behoves us all in the House to put in place the latest available treatment and monitoring.  I was in Oslo recently and took time to speak to the country's justice minister about what they are doing with a similar population.  They are initiating tagging of offenders, although it must be said they are not sex offenders.  I am considering the issue of tagging generally and if it is feasible and there are resources, we will put out a tender in the new year.</p>

         the action being taken to prevent the trafficking of foreign women for sexual purposes; the estimated number of women trafficked in this way in 2007 and to date in 2008; the number of trafficked women who have availed of the 60 day recovery and reflection period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_1093">Legislative, administrative and operational measures have been put in place to prevent trafficking in persons for both sexual and labour exploitation purposes.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, with penalties of up to life imprisonment, has been operational since 7 June 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">An anti-human trafficking unit was set up in my Department earlier this year to co-ordinate the level of Government response to this issue.  An interdepartmental high level group will submit a national action plan to me in 2009 which will map out a strategy to prevent and tackle trafficking in human beings for the coming years.  Awareness campaigns and training programmes in relation to trafficking are under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">The Garda National Immigration Bureau maintains border controls and liaison with organisations which represent exploited foreign nationals.  Liaison at an international level between the Garda Síochána and the international law enforcement community and international organisations also forms part of the approach taken by An Garda Síochána to human trafficking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1096">It is difficult to provide an accurate estimate of the scale of human trafficking for sexual exploitation in Ireland, as it is in many other countries, given the underground nature of the activity, the different definitions of trafficking and that data from different organisations is fragmented.  A data collection strategy which aims at collating data on trafficking in human beings from a variety of organisations is currently being developed in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">One person has been identified by the Garda authorities as a suspected victim of trafficking since the commencement of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act in June 2008.  An application for a 60 day recovery and reflection period for the suspected victim has been granted.  As suspected victims are identified they will be referred to my Department for a grant of permission to lawfully remain in the State for the 60 day period of recovery and reflection.  The administrative framework for recovery and reflection periods will be put on a statutory basis following the enactment of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_1098">Is it not the case that this phenomenon of human trafficking affects this jurisdiction more than was contemplated until very recently and the legislation put in place is deemed by organisations at the coalface to be inadequate?  Is the Minister prepared, even at this stage, to amend the immigration Bill to specify the services available to suspected victims of trafficking?  Do I understand from the Minister's reply that there has been only one case where the 60-day permit was granted?  Does he acknowledge that this is the area focused on by organisations like Ruhama?  Such organisations have indicated that women who were believed to have been working recently in the sex industry in this country, and who may have been trafficked here, tend to be immediately relocated to their country of origin.  The organisations point out that in those circumstances women require the benefit of a reflection period, as well as the support and services that this country can provide.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_1099">It is fair to say that our legislation on human trafficking is probably the most advanced and modern, as it was only passed in June this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1100">As the Deputy will know, when the Immigration Bill was originally published it provided for a 45-day period for recovery and reflection.  At the exhortation of the Deputy and others in Opposition, and because of my own feelings on the matter, I agreed it should be a longer period of 60 days.  That compares favourably with a number of other EU countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101">As regards what resources and responses are available to people who are subject to human trafficking, an anti-trafficking unit was established in my Department on foot of the legislation.  The unit works with State agencies, including the Garda Síochána and the HSE, as well as Ruhama and other groups.  I attended one of the regular meetings to witness the co-operation that is going on between all concerned.  This ensures that when somebody is the subject of trafficking they are dealt with immediately by an holistic response across the system.</p>

            <p eId="para_1103">Does the Minister really accept that there has only been one case concerning the trafficking of foreign women for sexual purposes?  Having heard this debate and from listening to my contacts, there seem to be more underground cases of this nature.  In addition to a national response, an international response is required to deal with human trafficking, particularly for sexual exploitation.  The Minister should ensure this is provided.  Is there a negative attitude within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law reform to such cases, as well as to the broader issue of immigration?</p>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_1104">There certainly is not a negative attitude as far as the Department is concerned.  We sponsored the Bill to put in place the most modern legislative response and we now have to establish the structures.  To be fair, there is a separate, dedicated unit in my Department which is fully staffed by very committed people.  Information at my disposal from the Garda Síochána indicates that a sizeable proportion of those suspected of being subject to trafficking are trafficked for labour rather than sex purposes.  That is not to say that sex trafficking is not going on.  Ruhama has recently referred 13 people to the Garda Síochána, one of whom has been given a 60-day period.  Three of them went home voluntarily and had airline tickets on them.  At the end of the day, they are adults and cannot be detained against their will.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">I totally disagree with the Deputy's point about people not being sympathetic.  I know for a fact that the Garda Síochána conducts significant training to ensure that every garda is fully trained, particularly concerning the legislative requirements of the recent Act.  That training is being carried out by the International Organisation for Migration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106">Together with the Garda Commissioner, I recently launched the new blindfold awareness campaign.  My Department has provided significant funding to Ruhama to allow it to run advertising in recent times.  This area is evolving and we are learning from the experience.  A number of cases were dealt with under the previous immigration legislation.  Following the enactment of the new legislation in June, I recall the Garda Commissioner stating two or three months ago that the gardaí are investigating approximately 17 cases.  Quite a number of those cases related to one instance in which people were suspected of being trafficked for labour purposes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1108">As the Deputy will be aware, I have previously set out for the House the terms of reference of the cross-party committee, which I propose setting up in order to reflect on and review the report "Regulating Gaming in Ireland".  I have gone on record to say that the informal committee represents the best opportunity for identifying options for consideration by Government on the many complex inter-related issues in this area.  It offers the best guarantee that the interests of all elements in our society are taken into account from the beginning in an area of important public policy.  The Deputy will also be aware of the involvement envisaged for members of his party in that committee, including that of chairperson.</p>
            <p eId="para_1109">I wrote to the Leaders of Fine Gael and Labour on 2 and 3 October 2008, respectively, to confirm proposals for the formation of the committee.  The Leader of Fine Gael responded on 3 October saying that he wished to discuss the matter with his party colleagues and that he would be in touch with me again once he had completed those deliberations.  Deputy Kenny wrote to me again on 1 December 2008 to state that his party is willing to participate in the cross-party committee provided that the terms of reference for the committee specifically exclude the issue of the installation of fixed-odds betting terminals, FOBTs, in betting shops.</p>
            <p eId="para_1110">Likewise, the leader of the Labour Party on 23 October 2008 reaffirmed his party's unwillingness to participate in the cross-party committee unless FOBTs are excluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_1111">I will now carefully consider whether there is anything to be gained from establishing a committee which is forced to exclude from its consideration a controversial component of the modern gambling environment.  I share the misgivings of the Deputies opposite about FOBTs, but I do not believe we can solve any problems associated with them by simply ignoring their existence.  We must face up to the challenges and threats, as well as the opportunities, inherent in new technologies and evolving social habits, and not bury our heads in the sand and hope they go away.  I will reflect on the responses of the party leaders and will shortly decide on a course of action.</p>

            <p eId="para_1113">The Government has not made any decision on FOBTs, nor has it had any discussions on them.  The Government noted the report entitled "Regulating Gaming in Ireland".  It was previously suggested before my time as Minister that there would be a cross-party committee to deal with this, chaired by a member of Fine Gael.  People then decided that they would discuss this matter, while omitting various issues they did not like.  We cannot put our heads in the sand, however, and think these things will go away.  There is a valid reason for us to examine all these issues on a cross-party basis.  If we cannot do so, then my Department will have to proceed with the legislation concerning aspects of this report.  I do not envisage us legislating in favour of FOBTs, but against them, if anything, from what I know.  It would be wrong, however, to put our heads in the sand and not discuss all these new technologies.  We should discus them with a view to preventing the harm involved and ensuring that they are not prevalent in our society.</p>

            <p eId="para_1114">Were some bookmakers not given the nod by the present Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Finance, for the introduction of FOBTs on the basis that they would make up the tax shortfall for the racing industry?  It was acknowledged within the Government that one could not do something as anti-social at that, however, so the Government suggested an all-party committee and tried to get a Member of the Opposition to chair it.  Is the Minister taking us for fools on this side of the House?  The one thing that is noticeable about him is that he is always on the side of the angels.  Even when the ruse was to legalise FOBTs, the Minister was always careful to say he agreed with Deputies on this side of the House and that he was also against FOBTs.  If he is against their introduction, what is the problem and why will he not introduce legislation?  He should stop talking about it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1115">The casino sector needs regulatory legislation badly.  The casino report dealt with 100,000 matters.  The Minister is now saying that, because we do not go along with him concerning FOBTs, he will not set up an all-party committee even though the great number of issues had nothing to do with FOBTs.  It is time to put the charade to bed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1146">It is the Government's intention to ratify the UN convention as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary requirements under the convention are being met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147">The interdepartmental committee established by my Department to advise on and monitor the legislative and administrative actions required to enable the State to ratify the convention has developed a work programme that is being actively addressed by Departments.  The Disability Act 2005, underpinned by the national disability strategy, meets a considerable portion of the convention's requirements.  In so far as my Department is concerned, the mental capacity Bill, which is in the course of being drafted by Parliamentary Counsel, forms an important part of what is required to facilitate ratification of the convention.  Work on what is involved by way of implementation of the various other provisions in the convention, which are extensive, continues in the relevant Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1148">The Government's decision on the matter of ratification of the convention will be made in due course, as it must, on the basis of being fully satisfied that all requirements are met in each Department.</p>

Given the fact that the convention was signed in March 2007 and came into force in May 2008, will the Minister of State outline to the House what is required, apart from the mental capacity Bill, or send a note to that effect?  What is the position on the optional protocol attached to the convention?  Some 80 countries have signed it and 26 have ratified it, but we have not signed it.  What are the obstacles to our signing?</p>
            <p eId="para_1150">Now or by way of note, will the Minister of State outline what other departmental changes must be made to allow the convention to go ahead?  Does the Minister of State agree that we should view the convention as a human rights issue as opposed to a legal one?</p>

            <p eId="para_1152">To clarify and as indicated in my earlier response, the convention will be ratified as quickly as possible, consistent with the need to ensure that all of the requirements under the convention are met.

            <p eId="para_1163">The Deputy will be aware that my proposals, in the form of heads of a civil partnership Bill, were published on 24 June 2008 following the approval of the Government.  Formal drafting of the Bill by Parliamentary Counsel is now well advanced and I can confirm, in line with the indication in the Government legislation programme, as announced on 23 September 2008, that the Bill is expected to be published in early 2009.  It is well recognised that the Bill is detailed and complex and is being drafted to ensure the constitutional protection of the institution of marriage is fully protected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1164">I will now provide a summary of the scope of the Bill.  First, it will provide for registration of civil partnerships by same-sex couples, together with a range of rights and duties consequent on registration, including in respect of succession, pensions, shared home, tenancy rights, maintenance from partner and protection from domestic violence.  Only same-sex couples may register as civil partners.  Second, the Bill will establish a cohabitants' redress scheme for unmarried opposite-sex and unregistered same-sex cohabitants giving protection to an economically dependent qualified cohabitant at the end of a long-term relationship.  Under the scheme, a qualified cohabitant is someone who has been living with another person in an intimate relationship for three years or more, or where the couple are the parents of a child, for two years or more.</p>
            <p eId="para_1165">The redress scheme will allow a vulnerable economically dependent partner, at the end of a relationship, whether by break-up or bereavement, to apply to court for certain reliefs, including for provision from the estate of a deceased partner, or for maintenance or pension or property adjustment orders.  The Bill will provide also for recognition of cohabitant agreements, thereby enabling cohabitants to regulate their joint financial and property affairs.  Cohabitants who make a cohabitant agreement may opt out of the redress scheme.</p>

However, such representatives have met officials from my Department to discuss various issues relating to the legislation.  The fact that we published the heads of the Bill on the Internet means we are encouraging members of the public and interest groups to make representations.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
            <p eId="para_1182">I wish the Acting Chairman, the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle season's greetings and thank them for facilitating Members in raising matters on the Adjournment during this session.</p>
            <p eId="para_1183">It is a sad indictment of the Minister for Health and Children and the Government that the HSE's national service plan for 2009 was leaked to the media and that the matter was not debated in the House prior to Christmas.  The House should have debated this important plan because a real emergency exists in respect of our health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1184">If we read between the lines of the HSE's plan for 2009, it is obvious that we face a catastrophe.  The plan is already obsolete.  It emerged in recent days that some €900 million in cuts will be required and not the €500 million to which the plan refers.  The Taoiseach stated yesterday that the purpose behind driving the efficiencies required is to maintain rather than reduce services.  If €900 million in cuts are going to be necessary in respect of the HSE, I do not know how it might be suggested that services, particularly those of a front-line nature, will be reduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185">According to the plan, a reconfiguration of the accident and emergency services is envisaged in respect of several hospitals, including Ennis General Hospital in my constituency.  The provision of 24-hour accident and emergency services at Ennis is again in the spotlight and under threat.  In recent days, Clare GPs have spoken out about this matter and stated that 24-hour accident and emergency surgical services are to be withdrawn at Ennis from 1 April 2009.  This will result in the loss of on-call anaesthesia services, intensive care and coronary care services and the discontinuation of all inpatient admissions and casualty services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1186">How does the Minister for Health and Children expect accident and emergency services to continue to be provided at Ennis General Hospital if surgical services are to be transferred?  I appeal to her — I have done so on many occasions — to publish the Teamwork report.  My sources inform me this unpublished report is already in place and being implemented by a project manager.</p>
            <p eId="para_1187">Who is going to pay the price for the cutbacks in the health service?  The answer is that patients in the system will suffer.  Long before the publication of the plan, patients were finding it difficult to access health services.  Despite commitments given by the Minister for Health and Children, not only are hospital facilities under-resourced but patients and their families in County Clare face long waiting times in respect of critical appointments and older people are unable to remain at home and cannot find places in nursing homes.  For those who wish to continue to live in their own homes, the primary care facilities are grossly underfunded.  Each day I speak with patients and their families in respect of the stress they are obliged to endure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1188">The number of people on trolleys in our hospitals during the week was unbelievable.  It is almost 40% higher than it was in 2006 when the Minister first said we had a national emergency.  Last Tuesday, there were 390 people on trolleys in accident and emergency departments throughout the country.  According to the Irish Nurses Organisation, there were 30 patients on trolleys in the Mid-West Regional Hospital in Limerick last Monday.  The situation at that hospital has been chronic during the past few weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1189">By end December 21,038 people will have passed through the doors of accident and emergency at Ennis General Hospital, 4,586 of whom were classed as emergency admissions.  How is Limerick Regional Hospital to cope with the additional influx of patients from Clare if accident and emergency services at Ennis General Hospital are contained?  It will also have to cope with additional patients from Nenagh General Hospital and St. John's Hospital in Limerick, the services of which are also to  be axed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1190">I want answers this evening.  I am tired of hearing promises such as that the hospital development plan will shortly be announced.  In an update I received recently from the Minister in regard to the progress in terms of implementation of the recommendations of the HSE following the incidence of C.difficle at the hospital, I was advised that the project to improve ward accommodation is progressing and is expected to go to tender early in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1191">We want to know the current position.  People are extremely worried.  I note that the only reference in the plan to the capital programme for the hospital is a capital injection of €0.4 million for 2009 for completion of the radiology department and in respect of an upgrade of CT scanner services.  We are awaiting publication of the report of the Health Information and Quality Authority into the tragic cases of misdiagnosis.  My fear is that the report, rather than dealing with the real concerns of the families involved, will be used as a smokescreen to downgrade accident and emergency services at the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1192">There will be chaos at Ennis General Hospital if these cuts go ahead.  There will be chaos in County Clare and lives will be lost.  A person in Kilbane who has the misfortune to suffer a heart attack — we must recognise in this regard international best practice in terms of the golden hour rule — will have to be taken directly to Limerick Regional Hospital, a journey of 117 km.  The spatial analysis study of ambulance resources for the hospital and mid-west area has not yet been published.  The ambulance service is already over-dependent on on-call services.  How is this service, without adequate resources, to cope with transferring many more patients out of the county?</p>
            <p eId="para_1193">The people of Clare have heard enough rumours and spin.  I want to know this evening if 24 hour services will continue at Ennis General Hospital; when the redevelopment project will go to tender, when additional resources will be made available for Clare ambulance services and, when the Teamwork report will be published?  We deserve answers.  It is time the Minister stopped running.  It is time for leadership, accountability and answers.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1194">I am responding to the Deputy on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</p>
            <p eId="para_1195">The Government is committed to ensuring the delivery of the best possible quality health service in an effective and efficient way.   Patient safety is of paramount importance in ensuring people have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes are achieved.  It is essential that patient safety and quality are prioritised and that services are organised and managed accordingly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1196">In February 2007, the Health Service Executive commissioned Horwath Consultants in association with Teamwork Management Services to examine the arrangements for the provision of acute hospital services at Ennis and other hospitals in the mid-west with a view to identifying the best configuration of such services in the region, including arrangements for accident and emergency, critical care, acute medicine and surgery together with diagnostic services so that the highest quality of care can be delivered to the population of the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1197">The work of the consultants will act as inputs to decisions on how best to reconfigure acute services in the mid-west region. The Government and HSE are committed to ensuring that the approach to reorganisation of services is carried out in consultation with the key stakeholders and that each element is progressed incrementally.  The Minister believes that it is important to work with health professionals and other interested parties to secure an increasing set of improvements over time.  This approach will, she is confident, produce the best outcome for patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198">Recent reports in regard to patient safety have raised concerns about the capacity of smaller hospitals such as Ennis General Hospital to deliver consistent high quality care for patients who present with complex care needs at accident and emergency.  Smaller hospitals treating low numbers of complex cases means that medical and nursing staff often have difficulty in maintaining skills in specialised areas and delivering safe care to such patients.  Concerns have also been raised in respect of the capacity to recruit permanent consultants in such hospitals with the inevitable reliance on long-term locum appointments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1199">Currently, the accident and emergency department at Ennis is staffed primarily by sub-consultant emergency care physicians who deal with all emergencies that present and then refer patients to the appropriate specialty or service based on their clinical assessment.  The HSE in the mid-west is currently working on a detailed plan to address the future configuration of emergency services in the region so that they will be in line with best practice.  This plan which will consist of an emergency care network under which designated services will be assigned to individual hospitals and service delivery will be based on clear protocols under the direction of a regional department of emergency medicine.  Many of the services currently provided in local hospitals will continue under the new arrangements but in a more structured manner and with patient safety and quality of care as the determining criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200">In regard to capital developments at Ennis, the Minister understands that installation of a CT scanner and radiology upgrade is under way and is expected to be completed in 2009.  On the particular issue raised by the Deputy, the HSE has been asked to prioritise and accelerate the Ennis capital development project along with other key capital projects in the mid-west in order to support the delivery of a modernised and improved service for this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1201">I assure the Deputy, on behalf of the Minister, that Ennis General Hospital will continue to play a significant part in the delivery of health care in the region.</p>

            <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_1204">This matter relates to funding in respect of two projects providing drug addiction services in County Wicklow.  The matter was brought to my attention by Sinn Féin's local councillor in the area, Councillor Eamon Long, who has been in contact with both groups to ensure that the information I read into the record today is correct and factual.</p>
            <p eId="para_1205">The Bara Project and Treo Nua are two community projects run by the County Wicklow Community Addiction Service which meet the support needs of drug users and recovering addicts in the east County Wicklow area, including Greystones, Enniskerry, Roundwood, Laragh, Rathdrum, Newtownmountkennedy, Newcastle, Kilcoole, Rathnew, Ashford, Wicklow Town, Aughrim, Avoca, Arklow, Carnew, Tinahelly and Shilleagh.</p>
            <p eId="para_1206">The Bara Project provides vital supports to people suffering addiction and to their families including advocacy, one-to-one supports, addiction counselling, holistic therapies, drug education programmes, onward referral, Prison Links work, and information and advice on drugs, drug use and related health promotion.  Since opening in January 2007, the Bara Project has provided support services to 348 individuals or families, a huge number given the rural nature of the areas listed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1207">Treo Nua is a rehabilitation project that provides vital support services, in the form of a structured day programme, to those stable or drug-free.  Although only established in January of this year it is already dealing with 35 referrals on an ongoing basis.  This is likely to be a fraction of the real level of need in the area which will become increasingly visible as the projects become better established.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208">The Bara Project and Treo Nua have been informed in writing that their budgets are to be reduced respectively from €259,648 in 2008 to €150,000 in 2009, a €109,000 reduction and from €474,585 in 2008 to €381,000 in 2009, a reduction of €93,000.  In 2007, the combined projects received a budget of €809,110.  In 2008, that was reduced to €734,228 and now it is being further reduced to €531,500.  That is a reduction of more than €277,000 in two years.  The implications of those cuts are devastating.  The staff cuts will mean that the numbers who can access the support services will be reduced.  Funding for the Bara Project is set to be cut by 37.5%.  A staff post will be lost, which means that some of those people seeking support to address their addiction will have to be turned away.  Likewise Treo Nua will lose one and a half staff posts, as its funding is cut by 42%, so it will not be able to meet the support needs that exist among ex-drug users.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">The bottom line is that one cannot meet the growing needs arising from the drugs crisis with fewer services.  What rationale can the Minister provide for the sweeping cuts?  The size of the cuts means they cannot be absorbed through technical efficiency manoeuvres or through expansion freezes.  They mean one thing only, namely, service reduction.  The implications of this budgetary decision for service users, their families and the wider community have been given zero consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1210">The Government talks tough on drugs but it is all talk.  Here is the evidence.  The full cost of the drugs crisis to society must be recognised.  Those costs are human, social and economic.  They include overdoses, road deaths, hospital stays, policing and prison costs, absenteeism from work, social welfare payments, related crime, intimidation and the existence of an extensive criminal underworld.  The Government must invest in prevention, treatment and rehabilitation.  Cuts are not the way forward, as the delivery of services cannot take place.  The two services to which I referred are doing great work but they were only beginning to address some of the problems in the east Wicklow area.  What they got in return for that is a kick in the teeth.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanHaughey" eId="spk_453" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey</from>
            <p eId="para_1211">Problem drug use remains one of the key challenges facing Irish society today.  Through the implementation of the actions in the national drugs strategy and the projects and initiatives operated through the local and regional drugs task forces, the problem is being addressed and the hardship caused to individuals and society is being alleviated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1212">The Government has been, and remains, firmly committed to tackling the problem of drug misuse in society.  That is evidenced by the fact that between 2003 and 2008, there was a doubling of funding targeted at community-based initiatives funded through the Vote of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, from €31.5 million to more than €64 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1213">This is an opportunity to reiterate the importance of the work of the local and regional drugs task forces, with regard to community based activities and projects.  Local drugs task forces, LDTFs, were established in 1997 in the areas considered to be experiencing the worst levels of opiate misuse and are an important element of the Government's overall response to tackling drag misuse.  Twelve areas in Dublin were identified as well as Cork city.  Bray was subsequently added in 2000 as an LDTF.</p>
            <p eId="para_1214">The ten regional drugs task forces, RDTFs, were set up in 2003, covering all parts of the country not covered by an LDTF and thus achieving full coverage of the country.  Following extensive consultation processes, each RDTF prepared a strategic plan and the implementation of those plans is now progressing.  The work of the task forces is an important element of the overall national drugs strategy and their role is to prepare and implement local action plans.  Those plans identity existing and emerging gaps in services in regard to each of the pillars of the strategy and support a range of measures including treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention and curbing local supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_1215">In addition, the task forces provide a mechanism for the co-ordination of services and strategies in those areas while, at the same time, allowing local communities and voluntary organisations to participate in the planning, design and delivery of those services.  The measures being implemented by the task forces are designed to complement and add value to the range of interventions being delivered through the State agencies.  Membership of the task forces include representatives of all the relevant agencies such as Departments, the Health Service Executive, the Garda Síochána, the Probation and Welfare Service, the relevant local authority, elected public representatives, the Youth Service, FÁS, voluntary agencies and community representatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1216">Across the 14 LDTF areas, more than 440 community-based projects, including those under the emerging needs fund, have been established employing more than 300 people.  The type of projects being supported range from delivering services such as advice and support for drug misusers and their families, community drug teams offering treatment, outreach and crisis intervention services and drug training programmes for community groups.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey</from>
            <p eId="para_1220">I appreciate Deputy Ó Snodaigh's advice.  That is what I was going to do.  A lot of information is provided in the script that may be of use to Members in their work dealing with the drugs issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1221">I will turn to the east coast regional drugs task force.  In terms of funding, across Government, we have had to take a range of difficult decisions, but our approach has been to do it in as balanced a way as possible.  We are all faced with difficult decisions in the current economic circumstances, especially in the short term.</p>
            <p eId="para_1222">This year, the budget for community-based initiatives in the local and regional drugs task force areas, including funding for new cocaine and rehabilitation measures introduced during the year, will reach approximately €34.8 million.  Funding for 2009 is approximately €34.6 million, which is a minor reduction of 0.5% on the 2008 allocation from the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1223">While it is accepted that there may be some additional costs for projects going into 2009, all task forces, including the ECRDTF, are being asked to identify savings across their area of responsibility.  I understand there will be some difficult choices to make but these are challenging times economically and we must all work together to minimise the impact on front-line services.  It will be a matter for all the drugs task forces to identify measures to enable them to work within their allocated budgets and decisions on the 2009 allocations for any individual projects in this case with regard to the east coast RDTF.  The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs will continue to liaise with the task forces, other relevant agencies and the national drugs strategy team in the months ahead to ensure the continued operation of vital services in disadvantaged areas most affected by drug misuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224">It should be noted also that the drugs strategy is based on a co-ordinated effort across many Departments and agencies and that the Department's allocation is only part of a much bigger investment programme in drugs services by those other bodies.  In 2007, it was estimated that expenditure on drugs programmes across all the bodies was in the region of €230 million.  I thank Deputy Ó Snodaigh for raising the matter.</p>

            <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan</from>
            <p eId="para_1227">I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for the opportunity to raise this important issue.  The Dyslexia Association of Ireland made a presentation to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service at the end of July explaining the difficulties it faced, in addition to the problems encountered by the parents of dyslexic children.  It was an informative presentation.  Sad to say, no action has been taken by the Government since the presentation was made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1228">The Dyslexic Association of Ireland has received a paltry €63,500 in grant aid from the Department of Education and Science each year for the past ten years.  The Department only agreed to fund the association yesterday for 2008 in spite of the fact that a submission for funding was submitted well over a year ago.  That shows a complete disrespect for the staff of the Dyslexia Association and for children with dyslexia who have been treated with contempt.  That is a crazy situation and it makes it almost impossible for the association to plan ahead for the next year, never mind for the next three or five years.  It is almost as if the funding being provided is an afterthought.  The association cannot grow or expand its service or meet the service needs of its members.  It is shameful as well that the funding has never been increased over the past ten years, even though the country was awash with money during the Celtic tiger years.  This is a disgrace, given the level of inflation over the past ten years.  The Fianna Fáil-led Government has never carried out a study to find out how may children suffer from dyslexia.  The funding received by the Dyslexia Association of Ireland is being used very wisely for assessments and funding for disadvantaged children, so clearly value for money is being achieved.  It is a voluntary association, with 31 branches throughout the country.  I want to take this opportunity to thank the staff for the great work they do in helping children who suffer from dyslexia.  It provides specialist out of school workshops, which cater for 1,000 children who have been diagnosed with dyslexia.  Sadly, the association has had to discontinue its very successful summer school this year because parents cannot afford the fees.  Clearly children are suffering because of the lack of support from the Government for dyslexia victims.</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">The Government must set its priorities and adequately fund the Dyslexia Association of Ireland, not just pay lip service to it.  This Government has squandered and wasted hundreds of millions over the past ten years.  That is one of the reasons we find ourselves where we are, in the current economic difficulties.  We have electronic voting machines just collecting dust.  They cost hundreds of thousands in storage fees each year.  Why can the Government not take a decision to scrap these machines and set this money aside to help and support the Dyslexia Association of Ireland and other organisations that find themselves in the same situation?</p>
            <p eId="para_1230">The Dyslexia Association of Ireland gives hope and help to those children who struggle with English and basic learning.  The Government has prided itself on the standard of education in the country, but clearly all children are not being treated equally or given the same help and opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">Every euro spent in early intervention education yields a return of €7 in later years.  I support the association's campaign for having tax legislation amended so that tuition fees for children attending association workshops, which cost between €800 and €900, should become tax deductible.  Perhaps the Minister of State might consider supporting such a tax concession for tuition fees, and raising this with the Minister for Finance.   It is estimated that the cost of allowing this tax relief would be €200,000, while at the same time the Dyslexia Association of Ireland pays the Revenue that amount in taxes.  This means it would be revenue neutral for the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1232">I ask the Minister of State and the Department of Education and Science to get real on this issue and adequately fund the Dyslexia Association of Ireland.  Can he please give certainty to this association by starting to fund it properly, and not make it wait to the last days of the year for confirmation as regards funding, which is totally unsatisfactory at the moment?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanHaughey" eId="spk_461" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey</from>
            <p eId="para_1233">I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Department of Education and Science has provided annual funding of €63,500 to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland.  This funding helps the organisation to operate an information service for members and the public.  In addition, part of the funding assists in meeting the costs associated with the attendance of some children from disadvantaged backgrounds at workshops and programmes organised by the association.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">Furthermore, a grant is awarded annually to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland towards the cost of its adult education activities.  The activities funded by the grant include literacy training, pre-course assessment, teaching materials and educational and administrative support.  A key focus and priority of the Department is to provide for resources in schools to support pupils with special educational needs, including those with dyslexia.  For mainstream primary schools, this is done through the general allocation model.  This model was introduced in September 2005 and ensures that mainstream primary schools have the additional teaching resources already in place to enable them to cater for children with high-incidence special educational needs, including dyslexia.  There is no need for schools to make separate applications for such supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">It is a matter for the individual school to use its professional judgment to identify pupils that will receive this support and to use the resources available to intervene at the appropriate level with such pupils.  The Department issued a comprehensive circular, SP ED 02/05, to schools to provide guidelines and advice on the manner in which they should use the resources that have been allocated to them to best effect.  In addition, the Department provides funding for a number of special schools and special classes attached to mainstream primary schools which have been sanctioned to meet the needs of children with dyslexia.  All special schools and special classes for such children operate at a reduced pupil-teacher ratio and pupils attending such facilities attract a special increased rate of capitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">Second level pupils with dyslexia are normally included in mainstream classes.  Additional teacher supports are allocated to second level schools and vocational education committees to cater for pupils with special educational needs, including, where appropriate, pupils with dyslexia.  To qualify for additional teaching support, under this category, pupils must be assessed by a psychologist as being of average intelligence or higher and having a degree of learning disability specific to basic skills in reading, writing or mathematics, which places them at or below the second percentile on suitable, standardised, norm referenced tests.</p>
            <p eId="para_1237">In accordance with the terms of circular letter M10/94 and depending on an educational assessment, pupils with dyslexia may meet the criteria for exemption from the learning of the Irish language on the grounds of having a learning disability.  They may also be eligible for special arrangements in State certificate examinations.  The Department provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia, with their education once relevant professionals recommend the equipment.  Schools can apply to the local special educational needs organiser directly for this support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1238">The Department supports teachers with additional training needs in the area of dyslexia.  The Deputy will be aware of the special education support service, SESS, which manages, co-ordinates and develops a range of supports in response to identified teacher training needs.  The SESS provides fees subsidies for the on-line training course, "Dyslexia: Identification and Early Interventions".  Fee subsidies are also provided for teachers to enable them to avail of the Dyslexia Association of Ireland courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1239">The Dyslexia Association of Ireland has over the years proved itself to be a genuine organisation that provides a range of supports for children with dyslexia and their parents.  The association has co-operated with various initiatives taken by my Department, including the task force on dyslexia.  I am pleased that the Department has been able to provide funding to the association.  The Department has developed an information resource pack on dyslexia in CD-Rom, DVD and video format, in association with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.  This product has been made available to all primary and post-primary schools.  The DVD and video provides support for parents of pupils with dyslexia while the CD-Rom assists teachers who are teaching children with dyslexia in the mainstream classroom.  The Dyslexia Association of Ireland supported and assisted in this initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1240">I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position on this matter.</p>

            <from>Deputy David Stanton</from>
            <p eId="para_1242">I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise this matter and the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Haughey, for coming in to address the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">I have raised the matter of the shortage of post-primary school places in Midleton, east Cork on a number of occasions in the House previously.  Currently, there are four second level schools in the Midleton area, a number in Cobh and a number in Youghal.  However, I want to focus on the situation in Midleton where the schools are full.  I have done a projection of the future need, based on the enrolment figures in the primary schools.  By the time the children from junior infants up to fifth class reach second level school, there will be 800 extra students looking for places in Midleton as some 20 primary schools feed into the town.  The schools are full now, but as far as I am aware, there are no plans to increase the number of places at second level.  A new school is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1244">In April last year the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, advised that the Department was in the process of identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation would be required at primary and post-primary level for 2009 and onwards.  Can the Minister of State inform us what is happening in that regard or communicate with me afterwards on the issue?</p>
            <p eId="para_1245">I have been told that no land is zoned for a school in the area, but that there has been some communication between the Department and the local authority.  However, not much seems to be happening.  Already this year, students have been told there is no school place for them and I am afraid the situation will get worse.  Some 800 extra children will come on stream in the next number of years as a result of the explosion in housing in the area, but no plans are in place to cope with this and no land has been zoned for a school.  What is even more worrying is that when I asked the former Minister for Education and Science last February about enrolment trends, she said the information requested was not readily available in her Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">I am aware there have been problems in the Dublin area in this regard, but it is now happening in the east Cork area.  A new rail link is coming into the area and large amounts of land were zoned for housing.  Houses have been built, but there is no provision for extra schools, although the schools in the area are full.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">I urge the Minister to take this issue on board as a matter of urgency and to start planning now.  I am sure the Minister realises that even if he cracks the whip in the Department today on planning, it will take five or six years before anything happens.  The schools are full now and are talking about putting up prefabs.  That may work at primary level, but will not work at second level because specialist rooms are required.  It is much more difficult to cater for these with prefabs.  There is also the question of health and safety.  We cannot cram children into narrow corridors and schools with not enough room for them.  The current schools were not designed for that.  The issue is crucial.</p>
            <p eId="para_1248">I am here to advocate on behalf of the people I represent in east Cork in the Midleton area.  There are also problems in Cobh and Youghal, but not to the same extent currently.  I look forward to what the Minister of State has to say in his remarks and hope he has a Christmas present for the people I represent.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey</from>
            <p eId="para_1249">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the Dáil the process being used in the Department of Education and Science to ensure there will be sufficient accommodation in schools at primary and post-primary level in all parts of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1250">In response to the rapid pace of social and demographic change in Ireland, the forward planning section of the Department now uses the latest technology in geographical information systems, GIS, to assist it in planning the location of schools for the future.  The GIS system contains information on all schools in the country, primary and post-primary, which are geocoded to their correct location.  This information is then linked to the relevant demographic information for those geographic areas, with a view to forecasting future school accommodation needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1251">Typically, the demographic information will be from the Census 2006 population figures, supplemented by information from the local authority.  The An Post geodirectory is also used to set out spatially where demographic increases are occurring.  To assess future school accommodation needs, growth projection figures are applied to existing population figures, which are supplied either by local authorities through their area development plans or based on CSO regional population projections.</p>
            <p eId="para_1252">The forward planning section of the Department is in the process of applying this technological approach to the entire country and when this exercise has been completed, a full data set on priority areas will be available.  As a matter of course, there is also ongoing liaison between the forward planning section and local authorities in order to establish the location, scale and pace of any proposed major housing developments and their possible implications for school provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1253">In this regard, officials from the Department have met with officials from Cork County Council to assess the extent of ongoing and proposed residential developments in County Cork, particularly with regard to the east and southern environs of Cork city, including the Midleton area.  As part of the Midleton special local area plan, the local authority has included plans for the provision and construction of primary schools and the setting aside of land for the construction of a new post-primary school to meet the educational needs of the population of the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1254">Progress on the development of these schools, together with any applications for capital funding from existing providers, will be considered for progression in the context of the Department's school building and modernisation programme, consistent with the priority attaching to these projects under the Department's published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1255">I thank the Deputy again for raising this matter and assure him that the capital allocation of €4.5 billion for school buildings under the current national development plan will be prioritised by the Department to ensure that school places are available where needed, including in Midleton.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">I take this opportunity to wish Deputy Stanton, all the staff of the House, the Acting Chairman, Deputy Charlie O'Connor, and all his constituents in Tallaght and surrounding areas a very happy Christmas.</p>

            <p eId="para_1259">A community service order requires an offender to perform unpaid work for between 40 and 240 hours, usually to be completed within 12 months. The aim of a community service order is to rehabilitate the offender and bring about meaningful reparation to the community for his or her crime. The Probation Service of my Department has responsibility for the supervision and management of these orders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">The Programme for Government provides for a community pay back scheme. It is intended that this will build on the community service scheme, which is currently the subject of a value for money and policy review by an independent evaluator. The review, which is nearing completion, will influence how best to progress this aspect of the Programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1261">The Children Act 2001, as amended, provides for a number of measures in relation to parental responsibility in respect of children involved in anti-social behaviour and children found guilty of offences. The imposition of any particular sanction provided for by the Act on the parents or guardians of an offending child is a matter for the courts. The National Youth Justice Strategy 2008-2010 provides for the monitoring of the use of the anti-social behaviour measures in the Act. This will be progressed during the term of the Strategy in the context of the commitment in the Programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1262">Tackling anti-social behaviour is a priority for both An Garda Síochána and my Department. The commitments relating to such behaviour in the Programme for Government were intended to be implemented over the lifetime of the Government and are currently being addressed with a view to their implementation, in co-operation with other Departments and agencies as necessary, within that time period, in the context of the resources available.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1265">I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1266">I have already dealt with many of the issues raised by the Deputies in my earlier reply to Question No. 2.</p>
            <p eId="para_1267">As I said since it became fully operational in 1999 over 45 million euro has been provided by the State for the activities of the Equality Authority alone.  In total, in the last five years my Department alone has spent €127 million on equality and disability issues. By any objective analysis, that is a clear statement of the Government's strong commitment to building an inclusive society rooted in the principles of equality of opportunity and fairness for all.</p>
            <p eId="para_1268">A robust and effective equality infrastructure has been developed in this country over the last number of years. The Government will continue to strengthen this infrastructure so that persons who do experience discrimination and inequality can continue to exercise, without impediment, their constitutional rights.  This is why I ensured additional funding of €340,000, an increase of 15%,  will be provided to the Equality Tribunal in 2009 — the Body which actually adjudicates on individual claims of inequality.  The additional support the Government is provided to the Tribunal reflects the priority which I believe should be given to persons who have a grievance in this respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1269">The total budget for State equality bodies in 2009 is almost €7.5m.  In the times we are in, that is a significant sum of money.  When account is taken of all equality issues including disability, integration, gender based violence as well as human rights, the budget for next year is €25.5m.  If proof is needed of my commitment and that of the Government to making Ireland a more equal place, then I would suggest you hardly need to look further than that.</p>
            <p eId="para_1270">As to contacts I have had with the Equality Authority, most recently, I met the representatives of the Authority last week at which they put forward a "Management Plan". Under the Plan the Authority wanted to retain current staffing levels at 53. They also wanted the Department, out of its own budget, to put forward extra non-pay expenditure of €0.7m. In total the Authority wanted a minimum allocation of €4m compared to the allocation of €3.33m announced by the Government. For the reasons I have mentioned — allowing for the Exchequer position, the clear need for economies and the establishment of priorities in my Department — I did not support the Authority's claims for more money in 2009. At any rate, that money is simply not there.</p>
            <p eId="para_1271">That the Chief Executive and one member of the Authority (Therese Murphy) should decide to resign from the Authority at this time is, of course, regrettable. I do not as Minister shares their views about the continued viability of the Authority. The Authority, based in Roscrea in new headquarters and staffed by the full complement of persons committed to being there will, I am satisfied, continue to be vibrant and effective.</p>
            <p eId="para_1272">I have said I accept that 2009 will be a difficult year for the Equality Authority and indeed other agencies in the Justice area. However, I am satisfied that the Authority can fulfil its core functions within the allotted financial envelope. I welcome the Board's statement in this regard and its stated commitment and determination to continue work effectively and independently for the elimination of discrimination and the promotion of equality on our society.</p>

            <p eId="para_1274">The Deputy will be aware that prior to 2004 there was a <i>de facto</i> ban on handguns in this jurisdiction.  However, I understand from the Garda Authorities that records indicate approximately 1,800 handguns have been licensed since the beginning of 2004 and that 31 have been stolen in that period.  I am further advised that stolen firearms are used in the course of the commission of other criminal offences but, because not all stolen firearms or firearms used in the commission of offences are recovered, it is not possible to say precisely how many formerly legally held handguns have been used in criminal offences.  </p>
            <p eId="para_1275">As I have stated on a number of occasions I am concerned with the situation we now find ourselves in following the growth in the licensing of hand guns over the past few years. We now have these 1,800 handguns licensed, and not as a result of a considered or deliberate public policy decision.  As Mr. Justice Charleton said in a recent judgement the public is entitled to feel alarmed at the proliferation of handguns.  I am not going to permit the growth of a ‘handgun' culture.  It was against this background that I recently announced my proposals for reform in this area, which include a ban on issuing new licenses for handguns and a strict regime for renewal of existing licenses, with limited exceptions made in relation to Olympic sports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1276">The House may note the recent endorsement of these proposals by the Chief Inspector of the Garda Inspectorate who draws on her own considerable experience of policing in the United States. She has recently been quoted as saying that a lot of guns used in the commission of crime in the States are guns that have been stolen from their rightful owners.  We must have controls in place to prevent the same thing happening here.  My proposals will be reflected in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which I will be publishing early in the new year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1277">It is important to say that my proposals in relation to handguns will not impinge directly on the activities of the vast majority of licensed firearms holders.  I recognise that those firearms holders pursue their legitimate interests in a law abiding way and am anxious to have a well regulated sector in which those interests can be successfully pursued, in co-operation with the relevant authorities.  But the reality is specific issues arise from the inherent nature of firearms.</p>

            <p eId="para_1279">The Garda Síochána Act 2005 sets out the duties and responsibilities of the Garda Commissioner in the direction and control of the Force and of the Garda Ombudsman Commission in the investigation of complaints.</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">Where the Garda Ombudsman Commission investigates a complaint or any other matter, it must include in its report to the Garda Commissioner a statement of the facts established, a recommendation about whether or not disciplinary proceedings should be instituted, the reasons for that recommendation and, if proceedings are recommended, the particulars relating to the proceedings that the Ombudsman Commission considers appropriate.  Any such disciplinary proceedings will be taken under fair but effective disciplinary regulations made in 2007.  These regulations addressed weaknesses in the previous disciplinary system identified by the findings of the Morris Tribunal.  The Ombudsman Commission must be notified by the Garda Commissioner of the outcome of any proceedings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">In at least one recent case, the Ombudsman Commission also made general procedural recommendations to the Garda Commissioner which are being actively pursued.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">The Ombudsman Commission may also make recommendations in its annual report or in other specific reports to me as Minister, and every such report is laid before the Houses.

Any such views would clearly deserve and require the most careful consideration.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1284">The number of Community Gardaí has grown significantly in recent years. The total personnel strength attached to Community Policing at the 30th of November 2008 was 689, up from 452 at the end of 2005.  That is an increase of 237, or 52%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1285">While these dedicated Community Gardaí carry out valuable specific duties in the community, it is important to appreciate that this supplements rather than supplants the efforts of all Gardaí in their work in the community.  Community policing is at the heart of the work of the Garda Síochána and has been so from its foundation.  Community policing in its broadest sense is the responsibility of every member of the Force, and I therefore do not believe that the case has been made for the creation of a special grading and promotion system. Indeed, there is a danger that such a discrete system, which could have the unintended effect of separating out community duties from general duties, could undermine the forcewide dedication to community policing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1286">In its report "Policing in Ireland — looking Forward" the Garda Inspectorate stated—</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1287">"The Inspectorate believes, however, that community policing should be more than a separate unit or operation within a police service. It must be the fundamental policing philosophy at the core of the organisation".</p>
            <p eId="para_1288">This is a view which I fully endorse.  I know that the Commissioner places the highest value on the close links between the Garda Síochána and the community it serves, and I am sure that this will be reflected in the work currently under way in the Force in developing a new national model of community policing.</p>

            <p eId="para_1290">The operation of the bail laws in force is kept under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">The Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution allows for bail to be refused to a person charged with a serious offence, where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">The Bail Act 1997 gave effect to this Amendment and also tightened up the bail regime generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1293">The Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides for mandatory consecutive sentences to apply where a person is convicted of an offence committed while on bail.  In addition, the law provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">The Criminal Justice Act 2007 amended the 1997 Act and other statutes governing the law on bail with the aim of facilitating a stronger challenge by the prosecution to applications for bail by persons charged with serious offences and of further improving decision making by the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1295">These stringent provisions include a requirement that applicants for bail may have to provide a statement of their means, their previous criminal record and details of any offences committed while previously on bail.  The Act also provides that a Garda Superintendent may give an opinion that bail should be refused on the grounds that the applicant is likely to commit a serious offence if granted bail.  The prosecution authorities are also given the right to appeal against decisions to grant bail or, where it is granted, the conditions attaching to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1296">The Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to conduct a formal annual review of the new measures in relation to bail introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  The issue of establishing a formal review mechanism will be addressed when the provisions have been in force for a sufficient period to enable trends to be meaningfully assessed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1300">As I indicated in my contribution to the budget debate I decided that the main priority in the Justice area in 2009 will be tackling crime. In that regard, decisions about funding reflect that priority with the result that in a small number of areas budgets have been reduced significantly. Moreover, in line with Government policies generally I have asked all bodies to substantially reduce their spending on consultants, advertising, promotional activities and other non-core items.</p>
            <p eId="para_1301">I met recently with the President and CEO of the Commission to discuss their financial situation and my Department is, of course, available to assist them in every practical way  possible. I consider that there is sufficient funding provided to enable them to discharge their core functions.  I would also remind the Deputy that the Human Rights Commission was, this month, awarded a supplementary estimate of €250,000 in order to assist them in discharging outstanding bills and expenses for 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1302">Both the Commission and the Equality Authority, the other body with which they are to integrate facilities with, currently operate from separate Dublin city-centre office premises which have a cumulative per annum rental cost of over 800,000 euro.  I firmly believe that significant efficiencies and savings can be realised by both bodies — and possibly others as well — sharing office facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1303">I can also state that I am prepared to agree at this stage that these savings may be used by both of the bodies in question to supplement their budgets in meeting the costs of discharging their core functions. I want to emphasise that this does not mean an increase in the published budget of either body and neither does it mean that the savings in question can be used for advertising or any other public relations type activities.  In other words, I do not propose to redistribute the savings to meet other expenditure requirements across my Vote Group.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1326">I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 42 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1327">One of the policing priorities set for An Garda Síochána for 2008 under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 is to combat, particularly in co-operation with other agencies and the community generally, the problems of public disorder with a particular emphasis being placed on alcohol related behaviour (including under age drinking) and socially disadvantaged communities. Public order maintenance is also one of the priorities I have set for An Garda Síochána in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1328">Public disorder is an issue where co-operation between the Gardaí and the local community is vital. That is why I am proceeding with the nationwide roll out of the joint policing committees, following their successful pilot phase. These committees enable local authority representatives and officials and Gardaí, with the participation of Oireachtas members and community interests, to get together in a structured way to discuss matters affecting the policing of the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1329">The Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) is an executive office of my Department working with the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. It is responsible for leading and driving reform in the youth justice area. The IYJS funds organisations and projects providing services, including Garda and Probation projects, to young people aged under 18 years who find themselves in conflict with the law.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330">The IYJS works in close co-operation with other Departments including Education and Science, Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and agencies including An Garda Síochána, the Courts Service, the Probation Service and the Health Service Executive. This is reflected in the development of the National Youth Justice Strategy 2008-2010 which focuses on children who have already had some contact with the criminal justice system. The aim of the Strategy is to provide a partnership approach among agencies working in the youth justice system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">Led by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the RAPID Programme targets 46 of the most disadvantaged areas in the country. The Programme requires Government Departments and State agencies to bring about better co-ordination and closer integration in the delivery of services to these areas. The Programme is structured around seven themes, one of which is crime and community safety. An Garda Síochána are leading the development of a local strategy and implementation plan for each area, the aim of which is to deliver targeted actions to improve community safety and tackle anti-social behaviour. My Department contributes to these aims, for example through the provision of funding for community based CCTV schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1332">The Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme, operated by Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers, has proved to be highly successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. It also enables referral to the Garda Youth Diversion Projects which are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives operating separately from the Diversion Programme. There are currently 100 of these projects operating in various locations throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1333">Strong provisions are in place to combat anti-social behaviour. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 modernised the law in this regard. In addition, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 contains provisions to deal with alcohol abuse, which is often at the root of crime and anti-social behaviour, and its effect on public order, and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides the Garda with powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1334">The Criminal Justice Act 2006 brought into force additional legislation to target public disorder and anti-social behaviour. In January, 2007 behaviour warnings and civil orders were introduced for adults, and in March, 2007 behaviour warnings, good behaviour contracts and behaviour orders were introduced for children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1335">The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, enacted last July, gives further powers to the Gardaí to tackle the misuse of alcohol. The Act places restrictions on the availability and visibility of alcohol and provides for more effective enforcement to deal with the consequences of alcohol abuse. The Gardaí may seize any bottle or container from a person under the age of 18 and which a Garda suspects contains alcohol to be consumed by a person under 18 in a public place. They may also seize bottles or containers containing alcohol where there is a reasonable apprehension of public disorder or damage to property and require a person to leave the place concerned in a peaceable and orderly manner. The Act also allows for the issue of fixed charge notices for the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place, which are offences under sections 4 and 5 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.</p>

            <p eId="para_1353">*Figures provided are provisional/operational and liable to change.</p>
            <p eId="para_1354">As the Deputy is aware, for over 30 years prior to 2004, it was policy not to license handguns in this jurisdiction.  Following a series of judicial decisions, that is no longer the case and approx. 1,800 handguns have been licensed since then.</p>
            <p eId="para_1355">Since my appointment I have expressed concern at the number of handguns which have been licensed here in recent years.  I am aware that the vast majority of licensed firearms holders pursue their interests legitimately.  I am conscious too that many of them deeply resent any connection that is made to the issue of licensed handguns in the context of our crime problem.  But as Justice Minister I cannot avoid the reality that the overall number of weapons in circulation and the type of those weapons can add to a gun culture.   Indeed the issue of handguns was highlighted by Mr Justice Peter Charleton in a judgement during the summer when he said that a reasonable person is entitled to feel alarmed at the proliferation of handguns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1356">My proposals for reform in this area include a ban on issuing new licences for handguns, although there will be limited exceptions in relation to Olympic sports.  Those who have licences already can, when they are due for renewal, apply to have them renewed under a new licensing procedure where the safety of the community will be paramount.  Together with the Garda Commissioner I will keep under annual review the outcome of the licensing procedure and, if the outcome leaves a situation which still poses an unacceptable risk to the community, will use new powers to ban particular types of firearm.</p>
            <p eId="para_1357">These proposals will be given legislative form in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which I will be publishing early in the new year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1358">The House may note the recent endorsement of these proposals by the Chief Inspector of the Garda Inspectorate who draws on her own considerable experience of policing in the United States. She has recently been quoted as saying that a lot of guns used in the commission of crime in the States are guns that have been stolen from their rightful owners.  We must have controls in place to prevent the same thing happening here.</p>
            <p eId="para_1359">As to illegally held firearms — however obtained — members from all sides of the House will agree that a priority of the criminal justice system is to rid society of illegal weapons.  This objective has been at the core of Operation Anvil since it was established in 2005.  Under that Operation up to 30 November, 2008 over 1,200 firearms have been recovered in Dublin and almost 1,000 in the rest of the country.  The Gardaí will continue to address the issue of illegal guns relentlessly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1360">It should be noted that a wide range of provisions to combat gun crime were introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2006. That Act introduced mandatory minimum sentences of between five and ten years for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of a firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, use of a firearm to resist arrest and a new offence of altering a firearm.</p>

The timeframe for the construction of phase 1 which will provide 80  new build detention places is the end of 2012.</p>

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_484">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1505">The following table contains the number of cases of murder recorded in which firearms were used, the number of prosecutions initiated and the number of convictions secured in each year from 1998 to 2007 and to date in 2008.  Figures provided for 2008 are provisional, operational and liable to change.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">One of the main priorities I have set for An Garda Síochána in 2009 is to target gun crime, organised crime and drug related crime through a range of measures, including the use of the Garda specialist units and targeted operations such as Operation Anvil.</p>
            <p eId="para_1507">An Garda Síochána meet this task by strategic actions, including in particular continuous and intensive intelligence led operations against groups and individuals engaged in such illegal activity.  Available intelligence is fully analysed and used in the strategic deployment of both local and specialised operational Garda units in targeting persons and groups.  It is used in carrying out searches and arrests aimed at both preventing attacks and apprehending persons suspected of being involved in such attacks.  Profiles regarding the personnel of organised criminal gangs are continually updated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1508">The Garda Commissioner has established, on a permanent basis, the Organised Crime Unit, with the specific objective of targeting those suspected of involvement in organised crime, including drug trafficking, importation, sale and supply.  Similar operations are undertaken by Garda specialist units, including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>
            <p eId="para_1509">Operation Anvil commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in 2005 to deal with this type of serious crime and was extended nationwide in 2006.  The primary focus of the Operation is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static checkpoints by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.  Under Operation Anvil up to the end of November, approximately 1,200 firearms have been recovered in Dublin and 1,000 in the rest of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1510">At a time when the public finances are under pressure, I will ensure that top priority will continue to be given to frontline policing.  Funding for Operation Anvil will increase in 2009 from €20 million to €21 million to enable it to continue with targeted disruption of serious and organised criminal activity.  Other key operations will be maintained through 2009, and any savings that have to be made will not be allowed to diminish frontline policing.  There will also be a 20% (€1.5 million) increase next year in funding for the Criminal Assets Bureau.  Overall, the Garda budget next year will be €1.589 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1511">There can be considerable difficulties for the Gardaí in obtaining evidence in shootings which are the result of gangland activities. This arises not least because many such victims (where they survive the attack) and their associates will not co-operate with the Garda investigation.  Nevertheless, the Gardaí are determined to pursue rigorously all killings, whatever their background.  The detection rate for murders by its nature increases over time as Garda investigations progress.  It is expected that in respect of each year the number of convictions obtained will increase as Garda investigations are concluded and the number of proceedings commenced are finalised by the courts.  This applies particularly to murders committed in the most recent years.  In addition, directions may be received from the Law Officers to charge persons arrested in connection with such incidents with offences other than murder.  Furthermore such persons charged and brought before the courts may be convicted of offences other than murder.</p>

            <p eId="para_1564">Legislation to give effect to Directive 2005/60/EC known as the 3rd EU Money Laundering Directive and the related Implementing Directive 2006/70/EC is being drafted at present.  The proposed legislation will also take into account relevant recommendations arising from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) third mutual evaluation report (2006) on Ireland's measures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">As the Deputy is no doubt aware Ireland already has effective anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing legislation in place as set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 and amended by the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 and the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005.  The legislation which is now being prepared will update the current legislation and further strengthen the legal framework in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1566">Due to the importance and relevance of this legislation to a wide range of stakeholders in the financial, commercial and other sectors, following Government approval in February to the drafting of this legislation, approval was also given to the publication on my Department's website of the General Scheme of the proposed Bill and for the initiation of a consultation process involving all interested parties.  An extensive consultation process took place in which a wide range of bodies including representatives of the financial services sector participated and which has proved extremely useful in identifying and clarifying relevant issues.  The proposed legislation is complex and as I have mentioned is of importance to a wide range of sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1567">I am also taking the opportunity through this Bill to repeal and consolidate the existing anti-money laundering provisions, an approach which will facilitate all bodies and agencies who operate in areas affected by this legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1568">I can assure the Deputy that priority is being given to the drafting of this Bill and my Department is working closely with both the Department of Finance and the Office of the Attorney General to expedite the completion of the Bill as soon as possible.  I expect to be in a position to publish the Bill as early as possible in 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_1570">I wish to inform the Deputy that there are strategies in place to deal with criminal gangs in prisons.  A number of recent initiatives have been introduced with a view to preventing identified gang leaders from conducting their business while in custody and also to prevent them exerting inappropriate influence over other persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">A High Security Unit was opened in Cloverhill Prison in May 2007 and a number of serious drug and criminal gang members are now segregated from other prisoners, thus limiting the inappropriate influence they might otherwise have been able to exert.   In addition, there are a number of high security prisoners detained in Portlaoise Prison, which has a constant army presence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1572">The new prison facilities at Thornton Hall will include a purpose designed high security facility capable of accommodating up to 40 prisoners in a safe, secure setting with appropriate support facilities.  It is also intended that the proposed prison development at Kilworth, County Cork will have a high security unit and this is being provided for in the design brief for the new facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1573">Other security initiatives have been introduced which make it more difficult for prisoners to engage in illegal activities while in prison.  These initiatives include the introduction of passive drug dogs, the installation of airport style security including scanners, x-ray machines, etc., and the establishment of an Operational Support Group.  A core function of this group is to gather and collate intelligence information on criminal gang members in our prisons and to carry out intelligence led searches on them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1582">Since the mid 1990s Ireland had significant rates of net inward migration. The immigrant population comprises United Kingdom nationals who have been coming here for many years, nationals of European Economic Area countries who have in large part free movement entitlements, and persons from other countries. Obviously the language needs of such persons vary greatly depending on their individual circumstances.  Because the provision of public services to immigrants is generally handled as part of the mainstream provision of service this poses challenges for all public service agencies — not just the Garda Siochana.</p>
            <p eId="para_1583">To that end, the Office of the Minister for Integration recently commissioned research in relation to interpreting and translating services. The research was published as a Report entitled "Developing Quality, Cost Effective Interpreting and Translation Services in Ireland" on 6 October 2008 and is available on The National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism website, www.nccri.ie</p>
            <p eId="para_1584">The recommendations made include a recommendation that a register of accredited practitioners be developed which Government service providers would use. This recommendation and the other recommendations in the report will be considered by a sub-group of the Cross Departmental Group on Integration which was recently established by the Minister for Integration, Mr. Conor Lenihan.  The Cross Departmental Group comprises senior civil servants from relevant Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1585">For its part, and to enable it to meet its current requirements, the Garda Síochána is currently undertaking an EU based procurement to put in place contracts for the provision of interpretation and translation services for the Force.  As part of this process, emphasis has been placed on ensuring that appropriate quality assurance mechanisms are in place both in the initial selection of the service providers and in the ongoing monitoring of standards over the duration of the contracts.  It is expected, subject to the finalisation of contracts, that the new services will be in place in the first quarter of next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1609">I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 204 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1610">Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children was commenced on 1 March, 2007. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children's Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1611">I am informed by the Garda authorities that from 1 January, 2007 to 30 November, 2008 922 behaviour warnings to adults and 601 behaviour warnings to children were issued.  There have also been 12 formal good behaviour contracts, which are used only in the case of children, agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1612">I am further informed that from 1 January to 30 November, 2008 479 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and 469 to children. In the same period, eight formal good behaviour contracts, which are used only in the case of children, were agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1613">I am also informed that up to 30 November, 2008 there have been six applications made to the Courts for civil orders (adult) and behaviour orders (child) by members of An Garda Síochána.  Three of these applications were successful resulting in two behaviour orders and one civil order being issued.</p>

         the action he proposes to take to combat the rise of criminal activity in all areas here with particular reference to tackling gun crime and the increasing use of illegally held weapons in homicides; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [47120/08]

          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_499">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1621">I must emphasise that I attach the highest priority to tackling organised and gun crime and bringing those involved in such activities to justice.  One of the main priorities I have set for An Garda Síochána in 2009 is to target gun crime, organised crime and drug related crime through a range of measures, including the use of the Garda specialist units and targeted operations such as Operation Anvil.</p>
            <p eId="para_1622">Operation Anvil commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in 2005 to deal with this type of serious crime and was extended nationwide in 2006.  The primary focus of the Operation is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static checkpoints by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.  Under Operation Anvil up to the end of November, approximately 1,200 firearms have been recovered in Dublin and 1,000 in the rest of the country.  There have also been over 7,000 arrests for serious crimes such as murder, robbery and burglary and 67,000 searches for weapons, drugs and stolen goods.  In this way, the Gardaí will continue to address the issue of illegal guns relentlessly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1623">At a time when the public finances are under pressure, I will ensure that top priority will continue to be given to frontline policing.  Funding for Operation Anvil will increase in 2009 from €20 million to €21 million to enable it to continue with targeted disruption of serious and organised criminal activity.  Other key operations will be maintained through 2009, and any savings that have to be made will not be allowed to diminish frontline policing.  There will also be a 20% (€1.5 million) increase next year in funding for the Criminal Assets Bureau.  Overall, the Garda budget next year will be €1.589 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1624">Since my appointment as Minister I have also expressed concern at the number of handguns which have been licensed here in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1625">Some time ago, I directed my Department and An Garda Síochána to carry out an urgent and intensive review of the firearms law.  Following that review, I have brought forward proposals which include no new licenses being issued for handguns, subject to limited exceptions in relation to Olympic sports.  Existing licenses will not be renewed unless applicants fully meet the requirements of a radically tightened licensing procedure where the safety of the community will be paramount.</p>
            <p eId="para_1626">While a de facto ban on new handgun licences is already in place, my proposals will be given legislative form in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which I will publish early in the New Year.  That Bill will also tackle comprehensively the issue of airsoft guns, including making their possession in public a serious offence.  It will also contain measures which the Garda Commissioner has suggested to me in relation to tightening up the law on possession of knives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1627">There are, of course, already very severe penalties for firearms offices in place under the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  For example, possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and using a firearm to resist arrest or aid escape carry a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years.  Possessing a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, possessing a firearm or ammunition in suspecious circumstances, carrying a firearm with criminal intent and altering a firearm carry a mandatory minimum sentence of five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1628">The Government has approved my proposals for a Criminal Justice (Covert Surveillance) Bill, and I have published the General Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1629">The Bill will open up the possibility of intelligence gained through secret surveillance being used in evidence for the prosecution of cases of serious criminal activity.  In the light of the increasing sophistication of criminals, subversives and terrorists, their use of intermediaries and the associated difficulties in obtaining direct evidence, the use of additional evidence is crucially important.  The Bill will provide for a system of authorisations for covert surveillance operations which will, as a rule, involve an application to a judge for authorisation to proceed with the surveillance and where the reasons for the surveillance will be clearly set out before the court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1630">The Bill also provides that in cases of exceptional urgency a senior member of An Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces may approve a surveillance operation for a period of no more than 14 days.</p>
            <p eId="para_1631">Work is also ongoing on the preparation of the General Scheme of the Criminal Justice Bill 2009 which will contain further useful measures to combat crime.</p>

            <p eId="para_1634">I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 55 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1635">The Garda Commissioner's Annual Policing Plan sets out strategic goals inter alia a commitment to significantly reduce the impact of crime and criminal behaviour. These goals are backed up by strategic actions which include a commitment to continue and intensify intelligence-led operations against groups and individuals engaged in the trafficking of illegal drugs and guns into and within the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1636">An Garda Síochána, in accordance with the priorities determined by me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform pursuant to Section 20 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and 2007 is committed to targeting violent crime and those who engage or facilitate persons involved in such activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1637">There are two categories of organised crime groups operating in this jurisdiction.  The first category consists of individuals/groups that are well established and tightly structured and are involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery and firearms offences.  The second category involves groups whose activities are characterised by less cohesive group structures and criminal activities which are mainly confined to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1638">An Garda Síochána targets organised crime groups on an ongoing basis and profiles regarding the personnel of such groups are continually updated. Intelligence-led operations to target those suspected of being involved in organised crime are primarily undertaken by specialist units of An Garda Siochana, under the remit of Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services.  These units include the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Organised Crime Unit, and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>
            <p eId="para_1639">An Garda Síochána have put in place specific strategies to target criminal activities including: the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau which identifies and targets funds accumulated by criminals, in order to seize such assets and to deprive them of the profits of their criminal activity; Operation Anvil which commenced in May 2005 and focuses on the disruption of serious and organised criminal activity.  To date, Operation Anvil has resulted in the seizure of over 1,200 firearms and recovered stolen property worth in excess of €30m in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) up to 30th November 2008 and the recovery of 983 firearms and the arrest of almost 23,500 prisoners in operations outside the DMR up to roster date ending 19th October 2008; the ring-fencing of €21 million within the Garda budget to ensure the continued operation of Operation Anvil; the establishment, on a permanent basis of the Organised Crime Unit which works in association with other specialist units; the allocation of additional resources to the Garda National Drugs Unit and at district and divisional level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1640">Organised crime, including persons suspected of involvement in drug-trafficking, importation, sale and supply, including the illegal importation of firearms, are being targeted by the Gardaí on a number of fronts.  A number of organised crime groups have been targeted recently resulting in firearms being recovered and drugs seized.  This has resulted in a number of prosecutions and convictions. An Garda Síochána use their resources and available criminal legislation to the fullest extent to target criminal activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1641">I am assured that Garda resources and operations are kept under regular review by senior Garda management in conjunction with Regional Assistant Commissioners and the heads of specialist units to ensure their continued effectiveness.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1643">It is the responsibility of the commercial consortium, under the PPP process, to arrange the funding and other resources to deliver the project and to have them in place when the contract is signed.  It is not appropriate, for commercial and procurement reasons, for me to comment on the specific financial funding aspects of the PPP contract negotiations which are currently in progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_1644">Since the enactment of  the Prison Development (Confirmation of Resolutions) Act, 2008 the Irish Prison Service, along with its technical advisors and the National Development Finance Agency has focused on progressing the Negotiation Phase of the Public Private Partnership (PPP) process with Leargas, the preferred tenderer, across financial, technical and legal aspects of the project. This involved the continuation of the design development of the project and contract negotiations to enable the Irish Prison Service to contract with the PPP Co and commence construction of the new prison development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1645">While negotiations on the contract are at an advanced stage they have not yet been completed to the point that the Project Agreement can be signed.  I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that it is anticipated that it will not be possible to have a contract signed this year.  The aim would be to have a contract signed early in 2009.   Construction will commence immediately after contract  award and should take no more than 3 years.  This timeframe is subject, of course, to the successful completion of the contract negotiations. I can say, however, that if the current contract negotiations are not successfully concluded there are other tenderers and other options which can still be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1646">The Thornton Hall project is a complex Public Private Partnership Project which involves the construction of more than 30 buildings, including 8 prison facilities on the site, a major internal road network, extensive perimeter security and a vast array of security systems both physical and electronic.  Additional matters have had to be addressed following the extensive public consultation involving the publication of the Environmental Impact Assessment and consideration of the development by the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1647">Pressures on the international financial markets have the potential to impact on all major capital projects.  The Irish Prison Service is being advised by the National Development Finance Agency in relation to trends and developments in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1648">The construction timeframe for the new prison facilities is approximately three years from the date of award of contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_1649">The cost of the acquisition of the site for the prison development was €29.9 million.  An additional 8.7 acres has also been acquired to provide a dedicated access road to the main site.  This was done following representations from the local community which reflected concern in relation to the effect of increased traffic generated by the prison project.  The cost of this additional land was €1.3 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1650">A total of €8.6 million has been expended to date on preliminary site works including surveys, landscaping, security and maintenance of the property, studies such as archaeological, topographical, etc., and professional fees including legal and specialist technical advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1651">It is not appropriate, for commercial and procurement reasons, to provide details as to the likely costs of the construction.  In particular it would not be in the public interest to give an indication of expected costs before a bid is accepted and a contract finalised.  The disclosure of such information is, in any event, not allowed under Department of Finance guidelines applicable to Public Private Partnership.</p>

As the Garda Reserve depends on volunteers who undertake their training and other duties during their free time, it is difficult to predict how many people will commence training in any particular period.  However, I can assure the Deputy that the Garda Commissioner is continuing to make every effort to reach the recruitment target and that no restrictions are in place for recruitment to the Garda Reserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_1663">Recruitment is ongoing and the Public Appointments Service (PAS) has received just over 4,000 new applications to join the Reserve already this year up to end November.  The PAS hold interviews on a rolling basis at a range of locations around the country. The ongoing public information campaign to recruit members to the Garda Reserve includes indoor and outdoor awareness raising campaigns and radio and TV promotional interviews nationally and locally.</p>

            <p eId="para_1718">It is not possible, with any degree of scientific precision, to estimate the proportion of seized drugs relative to the overall market for illicit drugs. However, through ongoing specific initiatives and intelligence-led operations, An Garda Síochána continues to seize substantial quantities of illegal drugs destined for the streets in this jurisdiction, disrupting those criminals involved in the importation, distribution, sale and supply of illegal drugs in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1719">Initiatives undertaken by An Garda Síochána to target those suspected of involvement in this type of criminality include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1720">1. the allocation of additional resources to National Units involved in combating illegal drug-trafficking and organised crime gangs;</p>

            <p eId="para_1722">3. continued collaboration with the Revenue Commissioners (Customs &amp; Excise Branch), the Naval Service and other international law enforcement agencies, including participation at the Maritime Analysis Operations Centre for Narcotics, which was recently established in Lisbon, Portugal in identifying and targeting those involved in the importation of illegal drugs into this jurisdiction;</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">4. increasing public awareness of issues relating to the sale, supply and distribution of drugs, through working with communities and community groups to encourage co-operation with An Garda Síochána; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">5. ongoing training programmes for personnel as Divisional Asset Profilers, who have the specific remit of targeting assets of persons who are suspected of being involved in the importation, sale and supply of drugs at local, divisional, and district level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1725">These specific initiatives are taken in conjunction with the responsibility on all members of An Garda Síochána who are tasked with implementing the criminal law, including relevant drug-trafficking legislation. The recent interception by the Joint Task Force off the West Coast of a shipment of Cocaine being imported for the European market is an example of the excellent results achievable through a multi-agency, intelligence-led approach to the activities associated with the trafficking, importation and sale and supply of illegal drugs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1800">While there are currently no proposals to introduce specific incentives for members of An Garda Síochána to live in communities they police, it is the case that where Garda official accommodation is available in any of the operational Garda Divisions, applications are invited from members to occupy such  accommodation, thus allowing Gardaí to live among the community they serve.</p>
            <p eId="para_1801">An Garda Síochána is committed to introducing a cohesive and integrated structure to community policing throughout Ireland and the development of the Garda Síochána National Model of Community Policing is at an advanced stage. Detailed and lengthy research was conducted with interested parties over a long period of time in the development of this model. I very much agree with the Garda Inspectorate's view that there is a strong foundation of community policing in Ireland and in that context it should be recognised that community policing is a matter for each member of An Garda Síochána.</p>

            <p eId="para_1823">I have been advised by the Garda authorities that Garda members are not barred from directly inputting data onto the PULSE system.  It is however a general policy that, with the exception of incidents where direct Garda input is required for operational reasons, incidents should be phoned into and created on PULSE by personnel in the Garda Information Service Centre (GISC).</p>
            <p eId="para_1824">The GISC provides for Gardaí, who would otherwise have to return to their Stations to input data onto the PULSE system, to log the information with their civilian colleagues in the GISC, while remaining free to continue their operational duties.  This major initiative has freed up significant amounts of Garda time for frontline policing.  Quality control and review of data is also managed by dedicated civilian staff at the GISC, thereby relieving Sergeants of this administrative task and allowing them to be deployed for more operational duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1825">PULSE, the main repository of incident information available to the Force, is more widely available than ever in over 340 locations nationwide and continues to be an invaluable tool used extensively by Gardaí in the performance of their duties. The establishment of the GISC in Castlebar has been one of the most successful efficiency measures in the history of the Garda Síochána. It is an overwhelmingly civilianised operation which has vastly improved the effectiveness and accuracy of the PULSE system.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1876">I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that there are two categories of organised crime groups operating in this jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1877">The first category consists of individuals / groups that are well established and tightly structured and are involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery and firearms offences.  The second category involves groups whose activities are characterised by less cohesive group structures, and criminal activities which are mainly confined to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1878">The membership of organised crime gangs tends to be fluid and the nature of criminal activity is such that offences committed by members of gangs may or may not be connected with the individual's membership of such gangs. Therefore it is not possible to ascertain the precise number of criminal gangs operating in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1879">Organised criminal gangs operating in this jurisdiction are targeted on an ongoing basis and profiles regarding the personnel of such groups are continually updated. Intelligence-led operations to target those suspected of being involved in organised crime are primarily undertaken by specialist units of An Garda Síochána, under the remit of Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services.  These units include the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drugs Unit,the Organised Crime Unit, and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>
            <p eId="para_1880">Measures have been put in place to deal with serious crime.  These include Operation Anvil and other intelligence-led operations which have been used to target specific individuals. Operation ‘Anvil' commenced in May 2005 in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and was extended country-wide in 2006.  The primary focus of Operation ‘Anvil' is the disruption of serious and organised criminal activity, using intelligence-led targeted operations on the one hand and an increased overt visible Garda presence on the other.  The Garda Commissioner has publicly re-affirmed his absolute commitment to the objectives of Operation ‘Anvil', which is but one tool used by members of An Garda Síochána in endeavouring to combat crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1881">An allocation of €21 million has been ring-fenced in the Garda Budget 2009 to ensure ongoing operations under Operation Anvil, which are augmented by other operations and initiatives, both locally and nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1882">Multi-agency approaches have been and continue to be used where all of the National Units from National Support Services i.e.  National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, Criminal Assets Bureau, Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation (Money Laundering) and the Garda Technical Bureau, are used to combat serious crime.  These Units are also supported by the Security and Intelligence Section who assist with intelligence briefings and the provision of timely information.</p>
            <p eId="para_1883">I am further advised that information on organised crime groups is disseminated to Europol on a regular basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_1885">I can advise the Deputy that there were 61 female prisoners on temporary release from Mountjoy Prison on 15 December 2008.  The reasons for the temporary releases varied and should not all be directly attributed to overcrowding.</p>
            <p eId="para_1886">It has consistently been acknowledged that there has been an overcrowding problem in the Dóchas Centre since its opening, even with the benefit of an additional 20 spaces provided in the final phase of its construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1887">In order to deal with the situation, it has been necessary to convert some rooms for use as sleeping accommodation.  The Prison Service will continue to closely monitor the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1888">Social and demographic trends indicate that we will inevitably continue to experience an increasing level of women prisoners in our prison system in the future.  It is the Government's intention, therefore, to include an expanded version of the Dóchas Centre in the plans to move the entire Mountjoy Prison Complex to a green-field site in the greater Dublin area.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1893">Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1894">The eligibility criteria and participation limits for CE are set by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE).  The qualifying criteria for participation are intended to facilitate the movement of participants through CE, allowing new participants who may not otherwise have such an opportunity, to avail of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1895">In relation to the Deputy's query a person signing for credits from Social Welfare is not eligible to obtain a position on a FÁS Community Employment (CE) scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1896">However, I am advised that the FÁS programme Expanding the Workforce (ETW) is specifically aimed at women returning to the labour market.  Women who have been out of the workforce for 12 months or more, who are not in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance or Benefit and want to return to work are eligible to participate in this programme.  Many other accredited training courses are also available from FÁS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1897">All of the options outlined can be explored in full by contacting the local FÁS Employment Services Offices where advice and guidance on the most suitable course of action for a client can be provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_1898">In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support into the future the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  In this regard, we are keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy John McGuinness)</from>
            <p eId="para_1900">As the Deputy will be aware, the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007-2013) contains a financial instrument, the SME Loan Guarantee Facility, that aims to improve the financial environment for SMEs by facilitating their access to debt and equity finance.   The total indicative budgetary appropriations for the financial instruments under Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme are €1.1 billion and about half of this, approximately €500 million, is foreseen for the SME Loan Guarantee Facility for the period 2007-2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1901">The SME Loan Guarantee Facility is operated by the European Investment Fund (EIF) on behalf of the European Commission and was launched by the Commission and the EIF, in late September 2007.  My Department informed the Irish Banking Federation of the proposal in December 2007, including, the operation and the scope of the arrangement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1902">Financial intermediaries are free to make contact directly with the EIF concerning participation in the facility and I am aware that some have done so in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_1903">Proposals from financial intermediaries will be examined by the EIF on a continuous basis up to 2013, within the constraints of the available Community budget allocations.  Irish financial intermediaries, therefore, continue to have an opportunity to participate in the Facility during this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1904">My Department continues to make itself available to any bank interested in pursuing the possibility of securing funding under the SME Loan Guarantee, with a view to their being put in contact with relevant officials in the European Investment Fund (EIF) and/or the European Commission, for further advice and assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1905">Participation in the Facility is however, a commercial decision for any financial intermediary concerned, in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1906">The Deputy will also be aware that the above EIF Loan Guarantee Scheme is separate from the recently announced €30 billion EIB Fund to provide loans to SMEs through commercial banks, in the light of the current economic environment.  The European Investment Bank (EIB) has in the last fortnight, indicated that it is in discussions with four Irish banks in relation to its new €30 billion Facility.  I very much welcome this development.</p>

            <p eId="para_1916">The allegations regarding the policy of the provisions of the Mines and Quarries Act 1965 are, to the best of my knowledge, unproven.  In any event, the legal advice available to me, is that the mere existence of statutory regulation in a specific sector does not, of itself, impose any duty of care on the State in relation to the employees in that sector.  The matter of compensation to former miners is, consequently, not a matter for my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1943">The details supplied with the Deputy's question raise a number of separate issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1944">Firstly, as regards the annual earnings limit for tax-relieved pension contributions, I should explain that, in Budget 2009, I announced a significant reduction in that annual limit from just over €275,000 to €150,000. This reduced limit will apply for 2009 to all individuals contributing to supplementary pension arrangements whether those individuals work in the private sector or the public sector. The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits, to determine the value of pension contributions on which an individual taxpayer will get tax relief at his/her marginal income tax rate in any year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1945">This change is targeted at higher earners and the reduction in the annual earnings cap to €150,000 will result in a significant fall in the maximum value of tax relief that higher earners can obtain on contributions to supplementary pension provision. This change was made to promote greater equity in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1946">The details supplied with the question also make reference to increases in public sector pension payments.  Total expenditure on public service pensions in 2007 was €2.3 billion and is increasing, arising from the growth in public service employment in recent years and from increasing longevity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1947">Measures to contain the cost of this increase in public service pensions have been put in place in recent years and policy options for further reform are outlined in the Green Paper on Pensions. These policy options are now being examined in the context of preparing a framework for comprehensively addressing the pension agenda over the long term.</p>

         asked the

         if he will introduce legislative changes in early 2009 to address the failure of financial regulation here over the past three decades. 
        [47327/08]

          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_533">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1949">The legislative regime for financial regulation In Ireland is largely based on a comprehensive EU framework of Directives which applies across the EU.  Arising from the recent financial turmoil, the Ecofin Council meetings in October and December 2007 agreed a set of common principles and a road map of further actions to enhance financial stability arrangements and the ability of authorities to respond to serious disturbances in EU financial markets.  These Ecofin Road maps deal specifically with strengthening EU arrangements for financial stability and actions taken in response to the financial turmoil.</p>
            <p eId="para_1950">New regulatory proposals currently being discussed at European level and due for adoption by the European Parliament in early 2009 include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1951">improvements to the Capital Requirements Directive to further strengthen the existing prudential framework for risk management and to put in place enhanced coordination among supervisors in relation to cross-border groups;</p>
            <p eId="para_1952">amendments to the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive to improve coverage levels and payout periods.</p>
            <p eId="para_1953">I will, of course, ensure that Ireland introduces the required amendments to Irish legislation as timely as possible in order to transpose the resulting Directives within the required timeframe allowed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1954">The role and mandates of national regulators have been the subject of in-depth consideration by the Ecofin Council arising from the Ecofin Road maps.  Common reporting standards for financial institutions are being introduced to enable greater EU-wide consistency in supervision and colleges of supervisors are being introduced for cross-border financial groups to allow for easier exchange of information between authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1955">It can be expected that further proposals in this area will be introduced during 2009 following the report of the de Larosiére Group, which was mandated by the European Commission to consider the organisation of European financial institutions to ensure prudential soundness, the orderly functioning of markets and stronger European co-operation on financial stability oversight, early warning mechanisms and crisis management, including the management of cross border and cross sectoral risks.  It will also look at co-operation between the EU and other major jurisdictions to help safeguard financial stability at a global level.  It is due to submit an initial report to the Spring European Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1956">I might also add that, following a request by the European Commission, the International Accountancy Standards Board (IASB) has made improvements in the valuation of illiquid assets in accounting standards (IAS 39 and IFRS 7) for financial institutions.  The Commission has also introduced proposals to improve the oversight of independent credit rating agencies, which will most likely be adopted in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1957">These measures are in addition to the broad range of conditions imposed on participants in the State's guarantee scheme for credit institutions.  The Regulatory Authority, which has statutory responsibility for the regulation of credit institutions, has advised me that it will continue to intensify its on-site and off-site supervision of credit institutions.  This will build on revised capital and liquidity measures introduced by the Regulatory Authority during 2006 and 2007.  The Regulatory Authority will focus on liquidity requirements, capital adequacy, risk management, balance sheet structure and corporate governance.  This may involve setting additional regulatory ratios as appropriate in order to reduce the risk in the balance sheet, reflecting the current domestic and global conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1958">In conclusion, many aspects of our regulatory systems have proved themselves to be robust and sound in the recent turmoil. But it is also clear that regulators in Ireland as elsewhere need to learn the lessons of recent events. I am relying on the Financial Regulator to do just that, and to adapt its regulatory systems to new conditions, to take on new skills and to ensure that Ireland has a top class regulatory system.</p>

            <p eId="para_1967">The Government's approach to the recapitalisation of credit institutions is designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of the banking sector in Ireland and to underpin its contribution through the availability of credit to individuals and businesses in the real economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1968">The Government has decided to support, alongside existing shareholders and private investors, a recapitalisation programme for credit institutions in Ireland of up to €10 billion. This will be done through preference shares and/or ordinary shares and will be subject to terms and conditions. The State may, where appropriate, participate on an underwriting basis. In principle existing shareholders will be expected to have the right to subscribe for new capital on the same terms as the Government. A key principle in the operation of such a fund will be to secure the interests of the taxpayers through an appropriate return on, and appropriate terms for, the investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1969">As the next step in the process I am initiating detailed engagement with the credit institutions themselves in respect of specific proposals. In order to safeguard fully the interests of the taxpayer, State investment will be assessed on a case-by-case basis in an objective and non-discriminatory manner, having regard to the systemic importance of the institution, the importance of maintaining the stability of the financial system in the State, and the most effective and economical use of resources available to the State, as well as each credit institution's particular requirement for capital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1970">The terms for disbursement of funds will be set, in this context, having regard to the particular position of individual credit institutions, to ensure that all State funds are deployed to optimal effect. Recapitalised institutions may be required to comply with such requirements as to transparency and commercial conduct as the Minister sees fit. Any State investment will be undertaken in line with best practice in the EU and elsewhere, consistent with EU State aid rules and in particular the recent European Commission communication on recapitalisation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2023">The Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE) launched in 2005 is an initiative of the European Commission together with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Investment Fund (EIF) to promote increased access to finance for the development of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the regions of the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_2024">When Ireland's ERDF Structural Programmes 2007-13 were being developed, my Department in consultation with representatives of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Enterprise Ireland, the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly and the Border, Midland and Western Regional Assembly had a number of discussions with representatives from the EIB on this issue. As part of these discussions JEREMIE was examined in the context of the arrangements then in place to assist SMEs in accessing appropriate financial support.  Having reflected on the matter fully and given the nature and structure of JEREMIE, particularly in terms of the scale of operations that would be required to secure EIF participation, it was not considered suited to our Structural Funds programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2025">Following the recent change in global economic circumstances, the EU Commission launched a "European Recovery Plan" on 26th November 2008.  As part of the plan, the Commission will be working closely with the EIF to accelerate and expand the existing provisions on financial instruments for small and medium enterprises under JEREMIE.  The Commission together with the EIF, EIB and Member States will launch early next year two specific networking platforms as a forum for exchange of information, guidance and good practice.  In this context, the Irish Authorities are considering if participation in JEREMIE is appropriate having regard to the ERDF programmes and the potential benefits to the Irish Businesses.</p>

Any State investment will be taken in line with best practice in the EU and elsewhere and consistent with the EU State aid rules, in particular the recent European Commission communication on recapitalisation.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5516">I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 104 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5517">The operation and impact of tax law as it applies to the legal obligation on a tenant, who pays rent to a non-resident landlord, to deduct income tax from the rental payments is monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis as part of the normal work of my Department and the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_5518">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the withholding of tax on rental income by tenants of non-resident landlords acts to promote greater compliance and deter evasion in this area, having regard to the obvious risk factors associated with non-resident taxpayers. The provision also ensures that a minimum tax payment is made by such landlords which might not be the case if the provision were removed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5519">The Revenue Commissioners accept that this provision might not be well known to some tenants and as a consequence could give rise to some practical difficulties. In recognition of this, where a tenant acts in good faith and is genuinely unaware of the obligation to deduct tax or of the residence status of the landlord, Revenue will only seek to apply the legislation from a current date. There is no question of such tenants being penalised for past failures to withhold tax from rental payments. This practical approach is reflected in Revenue's operational instructions in this area. In this context Revenue are prepared to review the specific case outlined by the Deputy. If the person forwards details of the assessment to Gerard Moyles, Customer Services, Galway County District, he will be pleased to assist. He can be contacted at 091535952 or by email at gmoyles@revenue.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_5520">On the general issue raised by the Deputy there are a number of factors that need careful consideration, not least to protect the Exchequer from loss of revenue through tax evasion. The removal of the obligation to withhold tax would create a situation where it would be easy for non-resident landlords to evade tax. Revenue would have no way of recovering the tax due as Revenue would not be in a position to force such non-residents to make a tax return and to declare their income.</p>
            <p eId="para_5521">I have to ensure that Irish income tax is capable of being collected and, having consulted with the Revenue Commissioners and considered the matter, I am of the view that the current position, whereby tenants operate a withholding tax on such rental payments coupled with the Revenue practice of accepting the good faith of tenants who were genuinely unaware of their responsibilities or of the residency status of their landlords, remains the most effective approach in this area. An alternative arrangement that would avoid opening up opportunities for tax evasion simply does not present itself at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_5523">The decision on whether a bank operating in Ireland passes on ECB interest rate cuts to customers is a commercial decision for the individual banks concerned.  While my Department monitors the impact of changes in mortgage interest rates on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), it has no direct function in relation to the individual bank decisions on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_5524">However, as the Deputy will be aware, I have publicly indicated that I expect banks to pass on funding cost reductions to their customers, including in particular to those purchasing properties on variable mortgages and to small and medium-sized enterprises. This is important to help support sustainable growth and employment along with the maintenance of price stability.</p>
            <p eId="para_5525">My Department will be working closely with the Financial Regulator to ensure that those institutions covered by the bank guarantee scheme do not pass on the costs of the bank guarantee to their customers in an unwarranted manner. However, it must be borne in mind that banks primarily borrow not from the ECB but from the interbank market, where spreads have been significantly above ECB rates over the last year. All covered institutions have to date passed ECB interest rate reductions to their customers in full. While two credit institutions have indicated that they will not be passing on the full amount of the recent interest rate cut to their customers, these are not covered by the guarantee scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_5531">The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) is responsible for ensuring that food produced and marketed in Ireland meets the highest standard of safety and hygiene possible. It ensures that food complies with national and EU legislation and, where appropriate, with the provisions of codes of good practice.works closely with my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</p>
            <p eId="para_5532">The current food safety system was introduced following the various crises that beset the European food industry in the 1990s. I believe that this approach has served Ireland well. Some of the major achievements since this restructuring include a dramatic decline in the numbers of BSE cases in the national herd which is largely due to the strict enforcement of food safety controls throughout the food chain, an increase in the number of food premises that have put in place food safety management system based on the principles of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point systems (HACCP) as required by law and the reduction of salt in processed foods which has been achieved through working in partnership with industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_5533">The efficiency and robustness of this system has been acknowledged by international experts. In 2008, the FSAI was awarded the World Health Organisation's Food Safety Award, a testimony to its excellent international reputation and a validation of the strong performance of the Irish food safety system. In addition, there was widespread favourable response to the speed and efficiency with which the three organisations dealt with the recent pork incident. French Agriculture Minister Michel Barnier welcomed Ireland's actions, stating that Ireland "reacted very rapidly". Androulla Vassilou, the European commissioner for public health, expressed satisfaction with Ireland's actions. Domestically, industry representatives welcomed the quick response from the Irish food safety system.</p>

            <p eId="para_5559">The objective of the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme is to ensure that the medical card benefit is available to those who are unable without undue hardship, to meet the cost of health services for themselves and their dependants.  I am satisfied that the Government decision to remove automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 or over with effect from 1st January 2009 is an effective measure to ensure that public health funding is used to help those most in need.</p>
            <p eId="para_5560">Under the Health Act 2008, which passed all stages in the Oireachtas and was signed into law on 12th December 2008, automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 and over will end on 31st December 2008, and with effect from 1st January, 2009, the income thresholds for entitlement to a medical card for those aged 70 and over will be €700 (gross) per week (€36,500 per year) for a single person and €1,400 (gross) per week (€73,000 per year) for a couple.  Persons whose income is above the specified thresholds will have until 2nd March 2009 to advise the Health Service Executive that their income is above those limits.  After that date, their medical card will no longer be valid.</p>
            <p eId="para_5561">Under the new arrangements, it is estimated that approximately 5% (20,000) of the current medical card holders aged 70 and over will no longer qualify for a medical card.  The 5% estimate was based on the best available information from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and the EU wide survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), which is conducted by the CSO to obtain information on the income and living conditions of different types of households.  These EU-SILC tables have been made available to Opposition parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_5562">In relation to the issue raised by the Deputy that persons over 80 years of age had an earlier entitlement to a medical card, I wish to clarify that Section 1 of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 provided a statutory entitlement to persons aged 70 and over to a medical card, regardless of income, with effect from 1st July 2001.  Persons aged 80 and over did not have a statutory entitlement to a medical card prior to that date.</p>

            <p eId="para_5607">In the course of the discussions which were carried out between the HSE, my Department and the Department of Finance, the HSE identified a range of issues which gave rise to service pressures and which would have to be addressed in the context of the Estimates for the Executive in 2009.  These were additional costs arising from demographic changes, increasing costs in relation to community schemes and in particular community drug services, additional pay costs, inflation, the full year cost of developments initiated in 2008 and the cost of implementing service developments deferred in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_5608">The Estimate for the HSE was determined against the background of very challenging circumstances facing the Public Finances.  In this context my Department and the HSE identified a range of measures that the HSE had to undertake in order to maintain existing services and provide for developments in accordance with the Government's priorities while operating within the level of funding allocated by the Government.  These included additional income generation, containing the cost of demand led schemes, reducing overhead costs and the further implementation of value for money initiatives.</p>

            <p eId="para_5625">Already, a number of actions have been undertaken at community level by the Health Service Executive. The HSE has worked with the Local Authorities and other groups to address the environmental factors that contribute to food poverty and obesity by developing food co-ops in disadvantaged areas. The HSE has also provided funding for the Food Poverty project Healthy Food for All which is being undertaken by a number of agencies, including St. Vincent de Paul, Combat Poverty and Safefood.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Mary Wallace)</from>
            <p eId="para_5630">I propose to take Questions Nos. 143, 144, 157 and 158 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5631">Implementation of the report of the National Taskforce on Obesity (NTFO) is ongoing.  By its nature, implementation of many of the recommendations was going to take place in the medium term with some of the actions more long-term.  A survey by the National Nutrition Surveillance Centre on the implementation of the NTFO Report shows that there has been action and progress on 60% of the recommendations. There is considerable evidence of action and delivery at local and community level.</p>
            <p eId="para_5632">Since becoming Minister of State with responsibility for Health Promotion, I have made tackling obesity one of my key priorities.  In order to give a new impetus to this issue I am currently in the process of conducting a series of bilateral discussions with relevant Departments with regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the Taskforce.</p>
            <p eId="para_5633">I am also in the process of establishing a multi-sectoral group representative of key Government Departments, Non-Governmental Organisations and other key experts to oversee implementation of the Task Force's recommendations.  Its first task will be to report before next Easter on the progress to date in the implementation of the report of the Task Force. I intend to Chair this Group and the first meeting will take place in January.</p>
            <p eId="para_5634">At Department of Health and Children level, a key recommendation of the Taskforce was the development of a National Nutrition Policy.  My Department is currently finalising this policy, which will provide strategic direction on nutrition for the next ten years.  The target group is young people, 0-18 years, and the priority actions are intended to reduce obesity and food poverty. The Cardiovascular Health Policy Group, due to report early next year, will be advising on measures to tackle lifestyle issues like obesity at population level as well as in the primary care setting.  My Department, through the EU High Level Group on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, is also playing an advocacy role within the EU to reform policies relating to healthy eating.  Specifically the Group has set targets for the reduction of salt in foods, on which work has already commenced. The next stage will be setting targets for a reduction in sugar and fats in food.</p>
            <p eId="para_5635">The HSE established a Working Group to implement the health related recommendations of the report of the NTFO. The working group has developed a framework for Action on Obesity. Among the actions already taken are: the development of specialist hospital services for the treatment of obesity; the development of obesity management programme for overweight children in the midland region; funded clinical management services in Loughlinstown, Crumlin and Galway; ongoing media campaign ‘Little Steps Go a Long Way'.  A sum of €3 million has been allocated to the HSE to fund obesity prevention and treatment programmes.  This is in addition to HSE spending on health promotion activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5636">My Department has been actively involved with other Government Departments in pursuing the implementation of the key recommendations of the NTFO with the result that a range of initiatives are being taken by various Government Departments and Agencies. These include: working with the Department and the Department of Education and Science on the development of Healthy Eating Guidelines for pre-schools and primary schools. Appropriate healthy eating training by community dieticians with preschool and primary school staff is currently underway. Guidelines for post-primary schools will be published shortly; working with the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs on drawing up literature for healthy food choices for the school food programme; liaising with the Department of Agriculture and Food who are leading out on the EU Fruit and Vegetable Scheme.  This scheme will build on the "Food Dudes" Programme.  There will also be consultation with the Department of Transport on their Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan which contains proposals for the development of a National Cycling Policy framework and the promotion of cycling and walking.</p>

            <p eId="para_5644">The prices paid to private hospitals by the NTPF for particular procedures are not directly comparable with the costs of similar procedures in the public hospitals.  HSE casemix data indicates the cost of treating groups of patients with similar conditions, not the cost of individual procedures.  Furthermore, the prices paid by the NTPF in the private hospital sector are for a full package of care, including pre- and post-operative treatment as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_5645">Nonetheless HSE casemix cost data is one of the comparators used by the NTPF in the course of its dealings with private hospitals in order to achieve competitive rates.  Other reference points used include estimated insurers' prices, consultant costs based on the insurers' schedules of fees and the prices proposed by peer hospitals for similar work.  With the information available from these sources, the NTPF enters into a negotiating process on individual pricing proposals and seeks to conclude a service agreement with a given private hospital for the provision of the required service.   On occasion, the NTPF has declined to agree prices with hospitals where it has been not been satisfied that value for money would be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_5646">The financial statements of the Fund are subject to audit by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG) on an annual basis.  The Committee of Public Accounts, in its recent Third Interim Report on the 2006 Report of the C&amp;AG on Expenditure in the Health Services, noted that the C&amp;AG had access to information about the prices paid by the NTPF for procedures undertaken in private hospitals and that this information should not be disclosed on the basis that the publication of commercially sensitive information would affect the negotiating position of NTPF and, as a result, its capacity to deliver value for money.  The Committee noted also that the C&amp;AG has agreed to carry out a review of these areas as part of his continuing audit of the NTPF's expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_5647">I wish to assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring that the NTPF achieves maximum value for money so that as many public patients as possible can benefit from treatment through the Fund.  Value for money will continue to be the subject of attention in the context of my Department's oversight and monitoring role in relation to the NTPF.</p>

            <p eId="para_5784">My Department received a proposal from Dublin Bus for revised services on Route 37 on 1st May 2008. Following an examination of the proposal, which included consultation with Dublin Bus, my Department deemed that the proposal would give rise to competition with an existing licensed service.  Accordingly, my Department advised Dublin Bus on 9th June, 2008 that an application in accordance with Section 25 of the Transport Act, 1958 was required should the Company wish to pursue the introduction of the change.  Dublin Bus subsequently submitted in July a revised proposal for this route. This revised proposal raised certain concerns of a legal nature from a competition point of view which have only been clarified in recent days. The application is now being processed and a decision in the matter can be expected shortly.</p>

The capacity (seated and standing) of the fleet has increased by over 30% over the period 2000-2008. The current NDP provides, through Transport 21, for a significant expansion in bus services in the Greater Dublin Area. Over the period 2006-2008 grants totalling €62 m have been paid to Dublin Bus towards the cost of 100 additional and 200 replacement buses. The position regarding the funding of further additional buses will be reviewed in light of the outcome of the cost and efficiency review currently being finalised.</p>

            <p eId="para_6109">The 2009 Exchequer subvention to CIÉ will be €313.279 million, an increase of 1.5% on the 2008 figure.  During the course of the Estimates discussions, my Department had discussions with the Department of Finance and with CIÉ in relation to the overall financial position of the CIÉ operating companies, Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann.  The Chairman and Chief Executive of each of the companies also briefed me on the financial outlook on 1st December.</p>
            <p eId="para_6110">CIÉ are projecting an operating deficit of €39.5 million for 2008 after Exchequer subvention, compared to an operating deficit of €1.47 million in 2007. This significant deterioration in the financial position of CIÉ is due in the main to loses in revenue due to a drop in demand for services and increases in costs, particularly fuel costs in the earlier part of this year. The outlook for 2009 is for a further deterioration in the group's financial situation in the absence of corrective measure.</p>
            <p eId="para_6111">It is a matter for the CIÉ group of companies to secure operational efficiencies and to reduce costs so as to maintain services at the highest level possible.  I have requested that, in deciding on service reductions to maintain rail services, peak-time bus services, and bus services to developing areas.  Service reductions should be a last resort in their efforts to maintain financial stability.</p>

            <p eId="para_6126">The deportation of illegal immigrants and refused asylum seekers is costly, particularly to distant countries such as Nigeria, China, etc.  In most cases removals are carried out using commercial flights which usually involves transit through other European airports as Ireland does not have direct flights to most of the countries of return.  In addition, most flights have to be booked at short notice very near the date of departure which involves higher costs than if booked well in advance.</p>
            <p eId="para_6127">In considering the costs of deportations, the considerable expense arising from the continued presence in the State of persons who are the subject of deportation orders has to be taken into account.  These costs include social welfare costs, direct provision costs, and detention costs in certain cases.  While it is important to keep deportation costs to a minimum, not to remove persons refused permission to remain in the State would call into question the integrity of the entire immigration system.  This would leave this country open to further illegal immigration and even more expense to taxpayers.</p>
            <p eId="para_6128">There are two main categories of repatriation charter flights. Smaller charters are organised to remove disruptive deportees that commercial airlines will not take on account of previous disruptive behaviour on board aircraft. Bigger charters are organised to return larger numbers of deportees in a more efficient way than using scheduled flights. It should be stated that Ireland does not have direct flights to the destinations where these charters have taken place. The alternative to chartering is transiting through hub European airports involving longer transfer times, more inconvenience to deportees and the attendant risk of deportees absconding in transit.</p>
            <p eId="para_6129">The use of charter flights, including joint charters shared by two or more countries, is accepted and used widely across the European Union as an effective and efficient means of returning persons illegally present on the territories of member States following individual consideration of their cases. The European Council of Ministers adopted a decision in April 2004 facilitating the greater use of joint repatriation flights as a means of demonstrating solidarity among member States, increasing the rate of returns and making more effective use of resources. The implications for State resources and the integrity of the asylum and immigration processes are plain to see should deported persons have been allowed to remain in the State. This factor must always be offset against the seemingly high cost of charter operations.</p>

            <p eId="para_6186">The deportation of illegal immigrants and refused asylum seekers is costly, particularly to distant countries such as Nigeria, China, etc.  In most cases removals are carried out using commercial flights which usually involves transit through other European airports as Ireland does not have direct flights to most of the countries of return.  In addition, most flights have to be booked at short notice very near the date of departure which involves higher costs than if booked well in advance.</p>
            <p eId="para_6187">In considering the costs of deportations, the considerable expense arising from the continued presence in the State of persons who are the subject of deportation orders has to be taken into account.  These costs include social welfare costs, direct provision costs, and detention costs in certain cases.  While it is important to keep deportation costs to a minimum, not to remove persons refused permission to remain in the State would call into question the integrity of the entire immigration system.  This would leave this country open to further illegal immigration and even more expense to taxpayers.</p>
            <p eId="para_6188">There are two main categories of repatriation charter flights. Smaller charters are organised to remove disruptive deportees that commercial airlines will not take on account of previous disruptive behaviour on board aircraft. Bigger charters are organised to return larger numbers of deportees in a more efficient way than using schedule flights. It should be stated that Ireland does not have direct flights to the destinations where these charters have taken place. The alternative to chartering is transiting through hub European airports involving longer transfer times, more inconvenience to deportees and the attendant risk of deportees absconding in transit.</p>
            <p eId="para_6189">The use of charter flights, including joint charters shared by two or more countries, is accepted and used widely across the European Union as an effective and efficient means of returning persons illegally present on the territories of member States following individual consideration of their cases. The European Council of Ministers adopted a decision in April 2004 facilitating the greater use of joint repatriation flights as a means of demonstrating solidarity among member States, increasing the rate of returns and making more effective use of resources. The implications for State resources and the integrity of the asylum and immigration processes are plain to see should deported persons have been allowed to remain in the State. This factor must always be offset against the seemingly high cost of charter operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_6190">Authorities in Member States responsible for returns are increasing their cooperation.  The main reasons for this are, inter alia, greater dialogue with third countries on migration issues and increased joint return operations involving a number of Member States and greater use of Member States of transit for return. Co-operation between the authorities responsible is in many cases a prerequisite for the successful completion of return operations. Article 9(1) of Council Regulation No 2007/2004 of 26 October 2004 establishing FRONTEX (OJ L 349, 25.11.2004, p. 1) stipulates that, subject to the Community return policy, the Agency is to provide the necessary assistance for organising joint return operations by Member States.  In accordance with the Commission communication of 19 July 2006 on policy priorities in the fight against illegal immigration of third-country nationals, "FRONTEX will provide the necessary assistance for organising and coordinating the joint return operations".  Ireland first participated in a FRONTEX operation in June of this year as indicated in the table above.</p>
            <p eId="para_6191">It is well established that an effective deportation process is a necessary element of an Immigration system. The lack of an effective means to deport persons not granted permission to remain in the State would call into question the integrity of the entire immigration and asylum laws. Failure to enforce deportation orders in the case of disruptive behaviour would produce two inevitable outcomes. Firstly, it would send a clear signal that deportation can be avoided by simply being disruptive. Secondly, disruptive behaviour by deportees on scheduled flights would become the norm, leading to concerns for the safety of passengers and staff on aircraft and cause further difficulties for the Gardaí in the already problematic task of enforcing deportation orders.</p>

            <p eId="para_6561">I believe that the establishment of the Garda Reserve is one of the most progressive innovations in policing in Ireland in recent years . It has strengthened the links between An Garda Síochána  and local communities and is a source of local support and knowledge. Full-time and Reserve members are working well together and I believe that the positive impacts made since the establishment of the Reserve in late 2006 bode well for the future of the force.</p>

            <p eId="para_6563">The powers of Reserve Gardaí are as follows: Under the Road Traffic Act 1961/2006: they can demand production of driving licence in accordance with Section 40 of the Road Traffic Act 1961/2006;  they can demand production of a certificate of insurance or exemption in accordance with Section 69 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961/2006; they can regulate traffic movement in accordance with Section 91 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961/2006; they can require a person driving a vehicle in a public place to stop in accordance with Section 109 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961/2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_6698">The person concerned arrived in the State on 26 August 2005 and applied for asylum on 29 August 2005. Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_6699">Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 31 March 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her. She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why she should not be deported.</p>
            <p eId="para_6700">Her case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on her behalf by her legal representative for permission to remain in the State. On 25 November 2008, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of her. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present herself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Tuesday 6 January 2009 in order to make travel arrangements for her removal from the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_6701">I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum and for temporary leave to remain in the State, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport her is justified.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.</p>

The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State and, following consideration of this application, it was determined that the person concerned was not eligible for Subsidiary Protection in the State.

            <p eId="para_6733">On 26 July 2005, the Minister signed a Deportation Order in respect of the person concerned. Notice of this Order was served by registered post.  This communication advised the person concerned of the legal requirement that she ‘present' herself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on 18 August 2005 in order to make arrangements for her deportation from the State.  The person concerned ‘presented' on this occasion but failed to ‘present' on a subsequent occasion and was therefore classified as a person evading deportation.  This position continued to obtain until May 2008 when the legal representative of the person concerned enquired into the possible entitlement of the person concerned to make an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State. Arising from this enquiry, and in accordance with the Minister's discretion under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006, the person concerned was allowed to submit an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State which she duly did.  This application is under consideration at present. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</p>

            <p eId="para_6742">I am informed that the gathering of the information requested would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_6743">Temporary/early release arrangements operate similarly to a system of parole, which is a feature of prison systems worldwide.  They are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way.  The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence.  Each case is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made. In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to the offender's Garda Station. Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Gardaí.</p>

           the number of prison spaces currently available; the number of prisoners in prison; the number on early release; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_6745">I wish to inform the Deputy that as of 16 December, 2008 there were 3,611 permanent beds available in the prison system.  On the same day there were 3,656 prisoners in custody. In addition there were 453 persons on temporary release.</p>
            <p eId="para_6746">Most of our prisons are currently operating at close to or slightly in excess of their bed capacity.  It is the case that there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by approximately 280.  The provision of an extra 1,300 prison places in recent years had largely addressed the issue of overcrowding which had become a chronic problem for the prison system.  However, it is my view that the continuation of the current capital programme is essential if overcrowding is not to become a major problem again in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_6747">It has to be acknowledged that the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts.  Figures show, over the past 12 years, the numbers in custody have increased by 65% and the numbers on temporary release have decreased by 34%.  Current developments will provide an extra 400 prison spaces by summer 2009 by means of: a new remand block in Castlerea Prison which will accommodate approximately 100 prisoners which is due to be completed in early 2009; a new block in Portlaoise Prison which will accommodate approximately 150 prisoners which is due to open in the coming months; a new block in Wheatfield Prison which will accommodate 150 prisoners which is due to be completed in the summer of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_6748">Most recently over 30 extra spaces have been made available at the open centre at Shelton Abbey and a further 40 spaces have been made available at the open centre at Loughan House.  It should also be borne in mind that our prisons have contingency plans in place whereby they can accommodate numbers above their ideal working capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_6749">These new developments will see the prison service through to the opening of the prison complex at Thornton Hall.  Quite clearly the Government and the Irish Prison Service have anticipated the demand for prison spaces and have acted accordingly.  The Irish Prison Service capital programme will also ensure the elimination of the unacceptable practice of slopping out and will effectively complete the modernisation of the prison estate.  The Irish prison estate will be comparable to best international practice in terms of accommodation and facilities and services for the rehabilitation and reintegration of prisoners back into society. This will put the Irish Prison Service in good stead for the 21st century.</p>

            <p eId="para_6754">I wish to advise the Deputy that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the cost of what the Deputy refers to as a "gangland hit".  As I am sure the Deputy will agree, the placing of a contract on anyone's life is a reprehensible and cowardly act.  As such it is incumbent on all members of society to fully assist Gardaí with their investigations into such activities and to provide information which may assist them in solving crimes such as that identified by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_6755">The placing of a contract on a person's life is a wholly illegal activity and as such it is subject to the full investigative efforts of An Garda Siochána's and the full rigours of the law.  The Garda authorities attach the highest priority to combating and preventing all murders including those resulting from organised crime and the activities of criminal gangs.</p>
            <p eId="para_6756">Organised criminal gangs operating in this jurisdiction are targeted on an ongoing basis by specialist units of An Garda Síochána, under the remit of the Assistant Commissioner, National Support Service.  These include the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>
            <p eId="para_6757">An allocation of €21 million has been ring-fenced in the Garda Budget 2009 for Operation Anvil which commenced in May 2005 in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) and was extended countrywide in 2006.  The primary focus of Operation Anvil is the disruption of serious and organised criminal activity.  To date under Operation Anvil and other Garda operations/initiatives, Gardaí have seized over 1,200 firearms within the DMR.  Operations outside the DMR have led to the recovery of 983 firearms.</p>
            <p eId="para_6758">The Organised Crime Unit is now established on a permanent basis and specifically targets those suspected of involvement in organised crime and drug trafficking, including the importation, sale, and supply of drugs.  This unit works in association with other specialist units including the Criminal Assets Bureau, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, and the Garda National Drugs Unit,</p>
            <p eId="para_6759">To date the Organised Crime Unit has participated in numerous intelligence-led operations which have resulted in the arrest and prosecution of several high-profile criminals.  Operations have also resulted in the seizure of drugs with an estimated street value of almost €50m and the confiscation of approx. 230 firearms.  An Garda Síochána remains fully committed to targeting violent crime and to using its resources to pursue those who engage in or facilitate persons involved in such activity.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_6763">A wide range of provisions to combat gun crime were introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2006. That Act introduced mandatory minimum sentences of between five and ten years for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of a firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, use of a firearm to resist arrest and a new offence of altering a firearm.</p>
            <p eId="para_6764">Since my appointment I have expressed concern at the number of handguns which have been licensed here in recent years.  I am aware that the vast majority of licensed firearms holders pursue their interests legitimately.  I am conscious too that many of them deeply resent any connection that is made to the issue of licensed handguns in the context of our crime problem.  But as Justice Minister I cannot avoid the reality that the overall number of weapons in circulation and the type of those weapons can add to a gun culture.   Indeed the issue of handguns was highlighted by Mr Justice Peter Charleton in a judgement during the summer when he said that a reasonable person is entitled to feel alarmed at the proliferation of handguns.</p>
            <p eId="para_6765">As the Deputy is no doubt aware, my proposals for reform in this area include a ban on issuing new licenses for handguns, although there will be limited exceptions in relation to Olympic sports.  Those who have licenses already can, when they are due for renewal, apply to have them renewed under a new licensing procedure where the safety of the community will be paramount.  Together with the Garda Commissioner I will keep under annual review the outcome of the licensing procedure and, if the outcome leaves a situation which still poses an unacceptable risk to the community, I will use new powers to ban particular types of firearm. My proposals will be given legislative form in the Criminal justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which I will bring before the House early in the new year.</p>
            <p eId="para_6766">It is important to stress that these proposals will not impinge on the vast majority of licensed firearms holders.  While any inconvenience caused to those who will be affected by the proposals is, of course, regretted I am satisfied that my proposals are in the public interest.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_6771">As the Deputy is aware, the legislation introduced by the Government to tackle serious drug trafficking in Section 27 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 (as amended by the Criminal Justice Acts 1999, 2006 and 2007), provides for mandatory minimum sentences of not less than 10 years imprisonment for individuals convicted of a first offence under sections 15A and/or 15B of that Act. The provisions of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 were recently renewed by my Department and provide the Gardaí with strong powers of detention in relation to persons suspected of drug trafficking offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_6772">The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, under the stewardship of Minister of State Mr. John Curran, T.D., is the lead Government Department with responsibility for coordinating the implementation of the current National Drugs Strategy. That Department is currently in the process of developing a new strategy for the years 2009 to 2016. This work is being led by a steering group with representatives from the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and with representation from the community and voluntary sectors. Both my Department and An Garda Síochána are represented on this group. The Government is determined that the new Strategy will facilitate the tackling of the illicit drugs problem in a comprehensive and effective way.</p>
            <p eId="para_6773">I am advised that An Garda Síochána proactively targets the activities of criminal organisations involved in drug associated crime, including the importation, sale and supply of drugs. The Gardaí also conduct targeted operations against individuals and organisations operating within this jurisdiction with known links to international criminals, including Irish nationals based abroad. There continues to be very strong cooperation between the Gardaí and the Revenue Commissioners (Customs) under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding to investigate persons suspected of being involved in international drug-trafficking.</p>
            <p eId="para_6774">The Criminal Assets Bureau works closely with the Garda National Drug Unit. A dedicated unit within the Garda National Drugs Unit has been established to liaise with the Criminal Assets Bureau to target in particular those criminals and criminal groupings believed to be deriving profits and assets from drug-related criminal activity. The Bureau liaises and works with the Divisional Criminal Assets Profilers in each Garda Division throughout the country in implementing the statutory remit of the Bureau.</p>
            <p eId="para_6775">Other Units, operating under the direction of the Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services, also target those suspected of being involved in the importation, sale and supply of drugs.  These include:</p>
            <p eId="para_6776">the Garda National Drugs Unit which is responsible for targeting networks involved in the sale and distribution of illegal drugs;</p>
            <p eId="para_6777">the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation which is responsible for the investigation of individuals and organisations involved in Money Laundering;</p>
            <p eId="para_6778">the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation which is responsible for investigating the activities of organised criminal networks;</p>
            <p eId="para_6779">the Organised Crime Unit which has a specific remit of targeting those suspected of involvement in organised crime, including drug trafficking, importation, sale and supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_6780">These units are supported by other units and agencies as necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_6781">At a local level Divisional and District Drug Units have been established with the specific remit of targeting individuals engaged in the sale and distribution of drugs to local communities.  These units are supported by local resources and supplemented by National Units as and when required.</p>
            <p eId="para_6782">International cooperation is also crucial in tackling drug crime.  This work is greatly facilitated by the work of Garda liaison officers based in London, Paris, the Hague, Madrid, Europol and Interpol Headquarters and now also at the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre (Narcotics) in Lisbon.  An Garda Síochána exchanges strategic and operational intelligence with other law enforcement agencies, including Interpol and Europol, in accordance with legislative and operational protocols.  Gardaí also assist international law enforcement agencies who are conducting investigations with suspected involvement by Irish nationals, through the Mutual Assistance Agreement in criminal matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_6783">The hugely successful Operation Seabight which was a recent coordinated effort by An Garda Síochána, the Customs Service, and the Naval Service working in conjunction with our European partners at the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre (Narcotics) in Lisbon is further evidence of inroads being made against those involved in this form of criminality.</p>
            <p eId="para_6784">The Garda authorities advise that in addition to the considerable volumes of drugs continuing to be seized, significant impact has been made over the last eighteen months by arresting and prosecuting a number of major players involved in drug trafficking through the importation, sale and distribution of drugs. A significant number of crime gangs involved in this type of criminal activity have been disrupted and dismantled.</p>
            <p eId="para_6785">Senior management in An Garda Síochána are keeping the situation under review to ensure an effective law enforcement response is in place to tackle the drugs problem.</p>

            <p eId="para_6797">Ensuring protection for the rights of workers is a central concern of the Government. The development of European policy and practice, as reflected in EU law, has been hugely positive for Irish and European workers. Directives cover a range of issues and rights, including equal pay for men and women; parental leave; maternity leave; the organisation of working time; equal access to men and women to employment and vocational training; equal treatment in social security; minimum health and safety requirements in the workplace; part-time workers; fixed-term work; and equal treatment in respect of racial or ethnic origin.</p>
            <p eId="para_6798">As the Deputy will be aware, last month the Government and social partners ratified a series of commitments aimed at legislating in the area of collective bargaining and trade union recognition by June 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_6799">In addition, the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights represent a significant advance with regard to the rights of workers, not least in respect of the operation of collective bargaining. Other rights covered include workers' right to information and consultation within the business, free access to placement services, to protection in the event of unjustified dismissal, to fair and just working conditions, a prohibition on child labour and the protection of young people at work, rights of parental leave and to social security and assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_6800">This was recognised by both the Executive of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the European Trade Union Confederation when they decided to lend their support to the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
            <p eId="para_6801">In its meeting of 11/12 December, the European Council carefully noted the concerns of the Irish people as presented by the Taoiseach, and as set out in Annex 1 to the Council Conclusions. It agreed that "all of the concerns set out in the said statement shall be addressed to the mutual satisfaction of Ireland and the other Member States".</p>
            <p eId="para_6802">A number of social issues, including social progress and the protection of workers' rights, were included in the Taoiseach's statement. The European Council agreed that, in addressing these concerns, it would confirm the high importance attached by the Union to these matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_6803">In the months ahead, the Government will be working with our EU partners and with the EU institutions in order to give to effect to the commitments contained in the European Council conclusions, including in relation to workers' rights.</p>

            <p eId="para_6805">Education is a key component of Ireland's Overseas Development Aid programme. This is reflected in the White Paper on Irish Aid, which states that: "Education is the primary vehicle by which economically and socially marginalised adults and children can lift themselves out of poverty".</p>
            <p eId="para_6806">In 2006, total Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) amounted to approximately €814 million, of which €595.4 million was administered by my Department through Irish Aid. €51 million of this was spent on a wide range of education projects and programmes across the aid programme. This represents approximately 6% of total ODA and 9% of the Irish Aid budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_6807">In 2007, total ODA amounted to €870.8 million, of which €725.7 million was administered by Irish Aid. €70.4 million of this was spent on education, representing approximately 8% of total ODA and 10% of the Irish Aid budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_6808">Funding for education is delivered through a number of channels, including direct support to Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs), Ministries of Education and missionaries as well as multilateral agencies and global initiatives. Support to education encompasses assistance which is designed to put in place sustainable education systems, through support for teacher training, provision of textbooks and teaching materials, school construction and the development of curricula.</p>
            <p eId="para_6809">Our assistance also enables Ministries of Education to provide quality education with a focus on child centred learning for the increasing numbers of children attending schools. The main focus is on primary education, including support for girls' education and also strengthening the role of the education sector.  Our assistance also enables Ministries of Education to provide quality education with a focus on child centred learning for the increasing numbers of children attending schools. The main focus is on primary education, including support for girls' education and also strengthening the role of the education sector in responding to HIV and AIDS.

            <p eId="para_7033">The Deputy will be aware that in addressing the public financial challenges all areas of expenditure have been examined and the budget of the ISC has been impacted following this process.  Nevertheless the huge social and economic benefits of sport are acknowledged by this Government and are reflected in the unprecedented level of Government funding for sport over the last number of years. Since 2000 more than €307m has been allocated to the Irish Sports Council (ISC). The allocation in 2009 is over €53m, an increase of more than 300% on the 2000 funding level of €13m. While there is a reduction on the 2008 allocation, I am confident that the 2009 allocation will be sufficient to support the work of the ISC in maintaining existing programmes and building on recent significant progress in all areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_7034">I understand that my colleague, the Minister for State with responsibility for Health Promotion, Ms Mary Wallace TD has made it one of her key priorities to address the issue of overweight and obesity.</p>

         if she is taking steps to ensure that private sector defined benefit pension schemes can meet their funding requirements; if she proposes to make changes to the regulations governing such funds; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_7055">The Pensions Act provides for a minimum Funding Standard which defined benefit pension schemes must meet on an ongoing basis.  Generally speaking, the Standard requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them to discharge accrued liabilities in the event of a scheme winding up. Where schemes do not satisfy the Funding Standard the sponsors/trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding within three years. The Pensions Board can allow a scheme up to ten years to meet the standard in certain circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_7056">In 2007, 81% of defined benefit schemes reporting to the Pensions Board passed the Funding Standard. Most of those schemes failing the test had a funding proposal in place. It is expected that the number of schemes failing the funding standard will increase significantly in the coming year. However, the extent of the problem will not be fully apparent until schemes carry out end of year actuarial assessments and report the results to the Pensions Board as required under the Pensions Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_7057">In recognition of the current market difficulties and the difficult decisions that pension schemes will face, the Government has put in place short-term measures to ease the pressure on schemes. It has been agreed with the Pensions Board that an additional six months will be allowed for trustees to prepare funding proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_7058">This will mean that schemes will have 18 months to review the situation with sponsoring employers and to formulate proposals for recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_7059">The Government is working with the Pensions Board, representative organisations and the social partners to find ways to ease the pressure on schemes by striking a balance between the long-term nature of pension savings and the need to ensure short-term security of accrued benefits. As outlined, it has already taken some short-term measures in this area. The long-term response to the situation is being considered in the context of the Green Paper on Pensions and any changes proposed will be announced in the context of the overall framework for pensions which the Government will announce in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_7093">The Department is committed to supporting families and values the role that the Family Resource Centres play in communities all over the country.  Funding from the Family Support Agency helps with staffing and equipping these centres.  By the end of 2008, the number of Family Resource Centres will have expanded from an original 10 to 107 nationwide.  The funding for the Programme increased from €317,000 in 1994 to nearly €19 million in 2008.  In the context of the National Development Plan, it was intended to expand the number of Family Resource Centres by up to 6 centres this year and to provide some existing ones with additional staff.  The organisation referred to by the Deputy is one of the projects that have applied for inclusion in the Family Resource Centre Programme and that meet the criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_7094">However, as part of the Government's collective approach to controlling short-term expenditure in the interests of Ireland's future prosperity, with the exception of two new FRCs, one in Killeshandra, Co. Cavan and one in Duiska, Galway City, no other Family Resource Centres will open in 2008 or 2009.  It will also not be possible to increase the staffing complement of the existing centres. Government support for family services will however remain strong.  Last year, additional staff were funded for 40 Family Resource Centres.  Also in June I approved counselling grants of almost €11 million to 600 voluntary and community groups supporting families nationwide.</p>

            <p eId="para_7102">The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) is the main Government funded service which provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  There are 53 independent companies with voluntary boards of management operating the local services throughout the country.  There are currently 246 money advice staff equating to 218.3 whole time equivalents employed to provide the MABS services.  In 2008 almost €18 million has been provided to fund the service.  All MABS Companies operate an appointment system for meeting clients.  Information is not available on the MABSIS on the waiting times for appointments at different offices. However, in all cases, clients with urgent difficulties are dealt with promptly.  Less urgent cases are referred to the MABS National Telephone Helpline, 1890 382438 available from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday to Friday and to the MABS website www.mabs.ie available 24 hours for immediate assistance with budgeting and money management issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_7103">Tables 1 and 2 detail the amount of funding allocated to MABS in each year since 2004 and the whole time equivalent staffing levels for the last three years.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_7126">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a supplement to be paid in respect of mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The scheme is administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department.  The purpose of mortgage interest supplement is to provide short term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. In general a person may be entitled to a mortgage interest supplement provided that:</p>
            <p eId="para_7127">s/he is habitually resident in the State;</p>
            <p eId="para_7128">the loan agreement was entered into at a time when, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, the person was in a position to meet the repayments;</p>
            <p eId="para_7129">the residence in respect of which the loan is payable, is not offered for sale;</p>
            <p eId="para_7130">the mortgage interest payable does not exceed such amount as the Health Service Executive considers reasonable to meet his or her residential needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_7131">In exceptional circumstances, a supplement may be awarded where the mortgage interest exceeds such amount as the Executive considers reasonable:</p>
            <p eId="para_7132">but such a supplement is payable for a maximum of 12 months only;</p>
            <p eId="para_7133">s/he satisfies a means test;</p>
            <p eId="para_7134">s/he or their spouse/partner is not engaged in full-time employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_7135">Mortgage interest supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance, appropriate to family circumstances, less a minimum contribution, currently €13, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  The minimum contribution will be increased to €18 a week from January 2009.  Many recipients pay more than the minimum contribution because they are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their accommodation costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_7136">The existing mortgage interest supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase.  In recent years improvements have been made to the means test to encourage eligible people to engage in employment without losing their entire mortgage interest supplement.  Those availing of part-time employment (less than 30 hours a week) and/or approved training opportunities can receive mortgage interest supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_7137">Since June 2007, where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first €75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above €75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.  This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.  There are currently over 7,800 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement.  The cost of the scheme in 2008 is estimated at €26million.  The provisional estimate for 2009 is €29.6m based on current levels of service.  Expenditure on mortgage interest supplement is closely monitored on a monthly basis in the context of the Government's framework for reporting on public expenditure and estimates of future expenditure will be revised as appropriate taking into account trends in recipient numbers and average monthly mortgage interest payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_7138">Electronic statistics are not available on the length of time it takes to process an application for mortgage interest supplement.  The scheme is delivered locally by community welfare officers who interview claimants when they first present to enquire about their possible entitlement for mortgage interest supplement.  Claim details are recorded electronically only in cases where it is established that mortgage interest supplement is payable.</p>

            <p eId="para_7140">The earnings disregard of €200 per week applies to income from employment.  It does not apply to income from any other source such as self-employment, farming or rents from leasing property.  Income from sources other than employment is covered by the general means disregard of €30 per week.  It should be noted that in contrast to persons in employment, expenses necessarily incurred in carrying out any form of self-employment have always been disregarded when calculating means from self-employment.  Such earnings are assessed net of expenses incurred by the person in the course of their work e.g. on petrol/diesel, purchase of equipment, raw materials, etc.  The effectiveness of means testing arrangements are kept under review and, where appropriate, changes are considered in a Budgetary context.</p>

         the amount spent on rent supplement payments by her Department in 2008; the measures being taken by her Department to ensure money is not spent on substandard properties; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_7146">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The cost of the rent supplement scheme for 2008 is expected to be €436m.  There are currently 72,840 people in receipt of rent supplement.  The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible tenants living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</p>
            <p eId="para_7147">Responsibility for setting and enforcing housing standards rests with the local authorities.  The community welfare service of the HSE is not qualified to undertake this work.  However, accommodation occupied by rent supplement tenants should at least meet minimum housing standards.  Under legislative provisions introduced by the Department in 2006 and 2007, the HSE can decide that a rent supplement may not be payable where it has been notified by a housing authority regarding non-compliance with housing standards.  Where a notification of non compliance with standards, is received from a housing authority in respect of an existing tenant, guidelines recommend that a community welfare officer discuss the situation with the tenant and take whatever action it decides is necessary in the best interests of the tenant.  The objective is to ensure that substandard accommodation does not come within rent supplementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_7148">The HSE must be satisfied that accommodation funded under the rent supplement scheme, is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant.  Where the HSE becomes aware of accommodation or blocks of accommodation which appears to it to be sub-standard, it notifies the local authority and it may advise prospective tenants at that premises that rent supplement will not be paid in respect of those tenancies.  Details of long-term rent supplement tenancies are provided to local authorities via the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on a quarterly basis and this information sharing assists in enforcing housing standards.  In addition, details of new rent supplemented tenancies are given to the PRTB in order to ensure that these tenancies are registered by landlords.  Revenue generated from registration of each new tenancy supports the inspection of sub-standard accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_7149">The Government has recently approved a package of measures to update minimum standards regulations for rental accommodation.  The new regulations will take effect from 1 February 2009 and apply in their entirety to all new, first time lettings.  There will be a four year phasing in period for properties already on the market in relation to certain capital intensive compliance works.  A number of elements of the package require legislative amendments and these will be delivered via the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 which is currently before the Oireachtas.  Enforcement of the new standards will be undertaken by local authorities.  The Department is committed to supporting the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government and local authorities in meeting their responsibilities in relation to the enforcement of housing standards</p>

            <p eId="para_7192">My Department is engaged in an on-going capital building programme designed to modernize and enhance the training, operational and accommodation facilities available to the Defence Forces both Permanent and Reserve.  The programme focuses mainly on infrastructural projects comprising of the construction of new buildings and the refurbishment of existing buildings.  The requirement for living-in accommodation in the Dublin Area is being considered as part of the overall Defence Force requirements and the provision of any accommodation required will be addressed in the 3-5 year programme.  In addition a detailed review of single living in accommodation is due to be completed early in the New Year.  Projects are prioritised in terms of addressing Defence Force operational requirements taking into account the annual capital allocation for the ongoing building programme and the requirement for further accommodation in Cathal Brugha Barracks will be examined in the context of operational requirements and the result of the accommodation study.</p>

However the transfer of posts to the three other locations in the South East — Waterford (225 posts), New Ross (125 posts) and Kilkenny (62 posts) — is being deferred pending the outcome of a review in 2011 in light of budgetary developments.  My Department's Headquarter offices in Wexford are under construction and expected to be completed and ready for occupation in Q1 2009.  My Department will then transfer 270 posts into these offices in 2009.  The transfer of the National Building Agency and the Local Government Computer Services Board, to Wexford and Drogheda respectively, are also deferred pending the review.</p>

My Department's role is one of supporting and assisting local authorities in delivering fire services through the provision of funding under the fire service capital programme and through setting of general policy. Further investment in the fire service in County Waterford under future capital programmes will have regard to the fire authority's priorities, the spread of existing facilities and the competing demands from other fire authorities for available funding. The council recently indicated that their current priorities for fire stations are Kilmacthomas,  Lismore, Portlaw and Tallow.</p>

            <p eId="para_7382">Turf cutting may continue as normal on the vast majority of bogs in 2009. A small number of bogs are protected because they are nature conservation sites of European importance under the EU Habitats Directive. As such, these have been designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs). For 32 raised bog SACs, which were nominated for designation in 1999, turf cutting is due to come to an end at the close of the current season, following the expiry of a 10-year period of grace. This period was allowed to give turf cutters the opportunity to find alternative sources of fuel. Ireland has a substantial proportion of western Europe's remaining area of active raised bog. However, it is being lost at a significant rate due mainly to the cutting of turf and associated drainage. The protection of Ireland's most important remaining areas of raised bog is a requirement under EU law and is necessary for the preservation of one of Ireland's prime examples of natural heritage. Most of Ireland's bogs are not designated for protection, and cutting may continue as usual on these. Cutting may also continue on blanket bog SACs, under the existing restrictions which limit it to non-commercial harvesting and excludes the use of certain machinery.</p>

My Department's role is one of supporting and assisting local authorities in delivering fire services through the provision of funding under the fire service capital programme and through setting of general policy. Further investment in the fire service in Donegal will be considered under future capital programmes and will have regard to the fire authority's priorities, the spread of existing facilities, and the competing demands from other fire authorities for available funding.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_7386">Waste management services have traditionally been provided at a local level, with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances. The present legal framework, as determined by the Oireachtas, reflects this. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver scheme, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator. Significant regulatory issues have emerged as waste management services have rapidly evolved in recent years. These issues, which have been the subject of a formal public consultation, include the need to ensure that necessary public service criteria in relation to the provision of services in particular areas or in respect of specific households are properly addressed. The existing regulatory framework requires modernisation. The identification of the changes necessary will be greatly assisted by the recent OECD report on the review of the public service, which includes a specific case study on waste management. My Department has also recently received the report by the Ombudsman Waste Waiver Schemes Administered by Local Authorities and will be giving the report, and in particular the recommendations contained within it, full consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_7387">It is also the case that the revised approach to the collection of household waste being taken by the Dublin local authorities will further inform what measures may be necessary to underpin sustainable waste collection services, whether delivered by the private or public sectors. In these contexts the appropriate policy responses will be developed and elaborated to address the concerns raised.</p>

            <p eId="para_7390">I propose to take Questions Nos. 285 and 286 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7391">The position on this matter was most recently set out in reply to the Dáil Adjournment item on 5 June 2008 and in reply to Question Nos. 347, 348 and 349 of 9 July 2008. The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) has published a new amended Standard Recommendation on the use of aggregates as infill for civil engineering and road construction work. The new Standard Recommendation came into effect on 7 December 2007 and it is intended to address the quality standards of new homes and buildings insofar as problems relating to pyrite are concerned. My Department has now incorporated this NSAI Standard Recommendation into the relevant Technical Guidance Document (TGD-C) associated with the Building Regulations. A copy of the relevant amendment to TGD-C is available on my Department's Website at www.environ.ie. My Department has also notified Local Authorities, the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Home Builders' Association and other key stakeholders of the provisions of the amended TGD-C. In addition, I am aware that HomeBond has included the amended NSAI Standard Recommendation in their published 6th edition of the House Building Manual.</p>
            <p eId="para_7392">I am satisfied that the measures outlined represent an appropriate response to the issues and I have no proposals to establish a Task Force or to order a traceability audit of materials in relation to this matter. I remain of the view that the resolution of problems arising between building owners and builders are matters between the parties concerned, namely, the building owner, the relevant developer, and the builder's insurers. Where the construction of a building is the subject of a contract between the client and the builder, enforcement is a civil matter.</p>

The Programme for Government contains a commitment to examine spending limits at local elections as part of the Green Paper on Local Government. Submissions made in the course of preparing the Green Paper, published in April 2008, were generally supportive of some kind of expenditure limit. In October 2008, I consulted the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the issue of spending limits. A policy research document prepared on behalf of the Committee and presented at that meeting offered useful practical guidance. There are a number of complexities that need to be considered, and I discussed these with members of the Committee. I am conscious of the proximity of the local elections due to be held next year, and work is therefore being expedited in my Department on the preparation of the proposed legislative changes.</p>

            <p eId="para_7466">Cork harbour is a complex marine environment.  In the event that an application was received to have the area classified in respect of mussels, consideration would have to be given by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority to a number of factors including the bacteriological and biotoxin status of the area.  The known intermittent occurrence of PSP in the area is one of a number of such factors that would be part of any such consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_7471">I propose to take Questions Nos. 301 and 302 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7472">As outlined in the reply to Question Nos. 914 and 915 of 10 July, in accordance with Section 10 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, local authorities are required to prepare development plans, setting out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area over a six-year period.  Housing and settlement strategies, which form part of a development plan, are required to be prepared on the basis of defined need and to facilitate and manage appropriate levels of growth in a sustainable manner.  Such need would be established having regard to, inter alia, evolving economic and demographic circumstances.  Under Section 13 of the Act, a planning authority may at any time, for stated reasons, decide to make a variation of a development plan.  Revised regional population targets on foot of the Census 2006 data analysis have already been reflected in regional and local plans.  To assist planning authorities in the development plan process, my Department published Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans in 2007.  These are available from my Department's website at www.environ.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_7473">The 2004 Regional Planning Guidelines, which are statutorily valid for a period of six years but which set targets and policies for a 12-year period, are due to be reviewed by 2010.  The updated guidelines will have regard to the National Spatial Strategy, the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and other national policy developments and will also take account of regional social and demographic issues, economic and employment trends, and infrastructural developments and needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_7474">In February 2008, I published for public consultation draft Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas accompanied by a best practice Urban Design Manual.  A total of 69 submissions were received on foot of the consultation process and these have been considered by my Department in preparing the finalised guidelines on a statutory basis under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act.  It is my intention to publish the Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas and the accompanying Urban Design Manual before the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_7488">REPS 4 is a measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007–13 and is subject to different EU Regulations from the preceding versions of REPS.  Under REPS 4, all payments are to be made in just two instalments.  The first payment, of 75%, can be made only when all administrative checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the Single Payment Scheme are completed.  This is why it has not yet been possible to release payments even to farmers who applied for REPS 4 some time before the closing date of 15 May.</p>
            <p eId="para_7489">Most REPS plans are now prepared using eREPS, the electronic planning system approved and funded by my Department.  As the information in these plans is in computerised format, the administrative checks can be carried out quickly.  However a substantial minority of plans submitted this year were not prepared using eREPS.  Administrative checks on these have to be done manually and are extremely time-consuming.  An effect of recent industrial action in my Department's local offices was that this process was delayed.  While normal working has resumed in the local offices following the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission, there is still much to be done before the administrative checks are completed.  In these circumstances my Department sought some flexibility from the European Commission which would have allowed payment of those REPS 4 cases which had been fully cleared, but the Commission were not prepared to allow this.  As a result, it is now apparent that REPS 4 payments cannot issue before the end of 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_7527">REPS 4 is a measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007–13 and is subject to different EU Regulations from the preceding versions of REPS.  Under REPS 4, all payments are to be made in just two instalments. The first payment, of 75%, can be made only when all administrative checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the Single Payment Scheme are completed.  This is why it has not yet been possible to release payments even to farmers who applied for REPS 4 some time before the closing date of 15 May.</p>
            <p eId="para_7528">Most REPS plans are now prepared using eREPS, the electronic planning system approved and funded by my Department.  As the information in these plans is in computerised format, the administrative checks can be carried out quickly.  However a substantial minority of plans submitted this year were not prepared using eREPS.  Administrative checks on these have to be done manually and are extremely time-consuming.  An effect of recent industrial action in my Department's local offices was that this process was delayed.  While normal working has resumed in the local offices following the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission, there is still much to be done before the administrative checks are completed.  In these circumstances my Department sought some flexibility from the European Commission which would have allowed payment of those REPS 4 cases which had been fully cleared, but the Commission were not prepared to allow this.  As a result, it is now apparent that REPS 4 payments cannot issue before the end of 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_7529">While I am anxious that the REPS 4 payments should go out as soon as possible, and my Department will make every effort to facilitate this, there are of course still over 48,000 farmers in REPS 3 and just under 16,000 of those have anniversary dates on 1 November and 1 December this year.

Certain assumptions were made on the extent to which product in free market circulation would be subject to recall and prove eligible under the Product Recall Scheme. The amount of €180 million announced on Thursday last is a facility to enable processors to claim assistance in respect of eligible product rather than a target amount.</p>

            <p eId="para_7607">Under the terms of my Department's Primary School Transport Scheme, pupils who reside 3.2 kilometres or more from, and are attending, their nearest suitable national school as determined by my Department, are eligible for free school transport.  Under the terms of my Department's Post Primary School Transport Scheme, a pupil is eligible for transport if s/he resides 4.8 kilometres or more from her/his local post primary education centre, that is, the centre serving the catchment area in which s/he lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_7608">The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside.  However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area, otherwise known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their ‘own' post-primary centre have been catered for. Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.</p>

There is no provision, in the scheme, to provide a special school transport service for pupils living in a Gaeltacht catchment area, who have enrolled in a school outside of their own catchment area which is teaching through the medium of English. Exceptions are made in certain cases, for example, for children who have an exemption from Irish.  The Deputy may also be aware that there are matters of relevance to the availability of teaching through the medium of English for children in the Gaeltacht before the courts at present which are to be the subject of a mediation.</p>

            <p eId="para_7677">I have recently announced a review of the procedures for the establishment of new primary schools under the Commission on School Accommodation.

            <p eId="para_7678">In the interim it is not proposed to recognise any new primary schools, except in areas where the increases in pupil numbers cannot be catered for in existing schools and which require the provision of new schools.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_7682">I can inform the Deputy that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) which is administered by NEPS.</p>
            <p eId="para_7683">There are currently 156 psychologists employed in my Department's NEPS service, including some 27 psychologists who have been appointed since the end of June last.  Furthermore 2 individuals have agreed start dates in early January 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_7684">The NEPS service is available in all 26 counties and my Department will be preparing a statement on the current coverage by county at the end of January  2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_7685">Additionally I was pleased to announce recently, in the context of Budget 2009, an increase in the funding available to NEPS with which it is envisaged that up to 50 further psychologists can be appointed.  Recruitment of these psychologists will begin early in the new-year from the existing panel of qualified personnel, until its depletion, and discussions will commence between my Department and the Public Appointments Service in relation to the establishment of a new competition and panel in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_7686">NEPS does not keep waiting lists for assessments of children but in common with other psychological services encourages a staged assessment process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist.  Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment.  This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.</p>
            <p eId="para_7687">The introduction of the General Allocation model for primary schools in 2005/06 means that children with high incidence special needs no longer have to wait for an individual assessment before they can get access to extra support.</p>
            <p eId="para_7688">Children who manifest very special or urgent needs in school and who have not been previously assessed by a psychologist and are brought to the attention of a NEPS psychologist by the Principal teacher will usually be assessed by the psychologist within that school term.  Normally, principals of schools prioritise those children in need of psychological assessment in consultation with the assigned psychologist.</p>
            <p eId="para_7689">In the case of schools that do not currently have dedicated NEPS psychologists assigned to them, as I already mentioned, such schools have access to psychological assessments through the SCPA.  Under this Scheme, schools can commission assessments from a member of the panel of private practitioners approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the fees directly to the psychologist concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_7690">Should school authorities have specific difficulties with regard any of the foregoing I would suggest that they should contact the local NEPS Regional Director, contact details for whom are also available on my Department's website.</p>

            <p eId="para_7712">Notwithstanding the increase of €302 million in the Education budget for 2009, which is a real achievement in the current economic climate, a number of tough  and difficult decisions had to be taken.  These decisions included reductions on the aid for school books scheme which in the case of schools outside of the  DEIS scheme will involve savings of approximately €7.5 million on current levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_7713">Approximately €7 million was made available in 2008 to DEIS schools for the aid for school books scheme and this fund of €7 million will be made available for distribution to schools in the DEIS programme in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_7714">I appreciate that this measure will pose difficulties for other schools outside DEIS.  However, many schools operate book rental schemes built up over the years and this combined with increased capitation funding will help to mitigate the impact on schools and parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_7715">The Education Budget for 2009 has provided for improvements to the overall level of funding for day to day running costs of primary schools which will see funding increase from €167 million in 2008 to almost €190 million in 2009.  The  Government is committed to making further improvements as resources permit.</p>

            <p eId="para_7719">The school to which the Deputy refers is among the schools that were judged by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a sufficient level of disadvantage among their pupils to warrant their inclusion in DEIS (Delivering  Equality of Opportunities in Schools), the Action Plan for educational inclusion.  The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the current DEIS programme which runs from 2005-2010.  There will not be an opportunity before this to be included in the current DEIS programme of supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_7720">This school together with 26 other urban primary and 73 post primary schools retained resources, both human and financial, including Home School Community Liaison and concessionary disadvantaged posts under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing educational disadvantage.  When DEIS was introduced, a commitment was given as a concessionary measure to these schools that they would retain a level of support for the duration of the DEIS Initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_7721">While it is appreciated that the discontinuation of these resources will impact on these schools, given the current challenging economic climate, I considered that it was prudent to advance the withdrawal of such supports from non DEIS schools to the beginning of the next school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_7722">The main focus of Social Inclusion measures will be to retain resources in DEIS schools.  There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_7725">I propose to take Questions Nos. 385 and 395 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7726">I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.  I fully accept that these decisions are not of themselves desirable and that they can only be justified by the imperative of securing the future economic stability of the country.  I have called for co-operation from all the education partners in meeting the challenges facing us both as an education community and as a country.</p>
            <p eId="para_7727">The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements.  Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_7728">My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their staffing and grant allocations.  The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools.  The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7729">I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers or on grant levels in schools for the 2009/10 school year.  I will do this when the allocation processes have been completed.  Furthermore the staffing schedule will be published and it is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.</p>
            <p eId="para_7730">At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_7731">I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_7734">In primary schools there will be substitute cover for teachers on uncertified sick leave other than on the first day of absence.

            <p eId="para_7738">The budget measures will mean that the level of language support will be reduced from a maximum of six extra teachers per school to a maximum of two teachers per school, as was the case before 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_7739">However, the ongoing requirement for current levels of language support teachers in schools should also start to reduce in line with lower levels of immigration and in line with improvements in the levels of proficiency of those pupils for whom this resource has been available.</p>
            <p eId="para_7740">Nonetheless, schools that require language support will still be entitled to get it. We still envisage having over 1,400 language support teachers in our schools in September 2009 and up to about 500 other teachers in part-time posts.  By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge will be to ensure that it is used to maximum effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_7741">As I announced on budget day we will also provide for some alleviation for the position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment.  This will be done on a case by case basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_7742">The allocation process for language support teachers is an annual one and existing provision is not rolled over automatically.  Schools will be applying afresh in the spring and early summer of 2009 for the 2009/10 school year, based on their assessment of the prospective needs of existing pupils and any new pupils they are enrolling.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_7748">The Giving Children an Even Break (GCEB) Programme operated from 2001 to 2005 and supported schools to implement reduced class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes and 27:1 in senior classes in addition to providing additional financial resources.  The scheme was integrated into DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools), the new Action Plan for educational inclusion when it was launched in 2005.  DEIS brings together, and builds upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.  There are 876 schools in DEIS. These comprise 673 primary schools (199 Band 1, 141 Band 2 and 333 Rural) and 203 second-level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_7749">Under DEIS all 199 Urban Band 1 schools benefit from reduced class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes.  In addition some 53 DEIS  Urban Band 2 schools and 15 non DEIS schools enjoy the lower pupil teacher ratio from the pre-existing GCEB scheme.  These reduced pupil teacher ratios are explicitly protected under DEIS and will continue for the duration of the DEIS programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7750">In line with my focus on retaining resources in the most disadvantaged areas, it is important to note that following Budget 2009 those DEIS and non DEIS schools which benefit from a reduced pupil teacher ratio will not be affected by the general increase in the pupil teacher ratio.</p>
            <p eId="para_7751">Notwithstanding the increase of €302 million in the Education budget for 2009, which is a real achievement in the current economic climate, a number of tough and difficult decisions had to be taken in framing the 2009 Budget.  These decisions were taken in order to control expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long term.  In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be entirely spared, and I acknowledge the impact of funding restrictions in a number of areas, including at school level.  However, these are the inevitable result of the challenging economic environment and the need to manage Exchequer resources prudently.  As a consequence it has become necessary to withdraw additional financial resources from all non DEIS schools with effect from 31  August 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_7752">While it is appreciated that the discontinuation of these resources will impact on these schools, given the current challenging economic climate, I considered that it was prudent to advance the withdrawal of such supports from non DEIS schools to the beginning of the next school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_7753">The main focus of Social Inclusion measures will be to retain resources in DEIS schools.

            <p eId="para_7754">Targeting resources at the most disadvantaged schools that are working to counteract educational disadvantage will continue to be a priority for the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_7760">The Deputy refers to a number of fee-charging schools of which there are 56 in  the State; 21 are Protestant, two inter-denominational, one Jewish and the  remainder Catholic.</p>
            <p eId="para_7761">With the exception of the Protestant and Jewish fee-charging schools,  fee-charging schools do not receive capitation grants or related supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_7762">Protestant fee-charging schools receive, and will continue to receive, the  Protestant Block grant, which amounts to €6.25 million in the current school  year.  This payment covers capitation, tuition and boarding grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_7763">A similar arrangement exists for the Jewish school and amounted to €43,684 in  the 2007/08 school year. This arrangement will continue also.</p>
            <p eId="para_7764">The arrangements for minority schools reflect the importance the Government attaches to ensuring that students can attend schools that reflect their denominational ethos.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_7771">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme (SSP). DEIS brings together and builds upon a number of existing interventions in schools with concentrated levels of disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_7772">The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the  Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate. There are 876 schools in DEIS. These comprise 673 primary schools (199 Urban Band 1, 141 Urban Band 2 and 333 Rural) and 203 second-level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_7773">In line with my focus on retaining resources in the most disadvantaged areas, it is important to note that following Budget 2009, DEIS supports in DEIS schools are not being affected. Those DEIS schools which benefit from reduced class sizes will not be affected by the general increase in the pupil teacher ratio. All DEIS Urban Band 1 schools enjoy a lower Pupil Teacher Ratio (PTR).  In addition some 53 DEIS Urban Band 2 schools enjoy a lower PTR from pre-existing schemes. These reduced pupil teacher ratios are explicitly protected under DEIS and are not affected by the Budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_7774">Furthermore for the duration of the DEIS initiative, which is scheduled to run until 2010, all DEIS urban schools will maintain access to Home School  Community Liaison services and the School Completion Programme while all DEIS Urban and Rural schools will maintain access to additional capitation and grant aid for school books.</p>
            <p eId="para_7775">For schools other than those that benefit from lower PTR under DEIS, the mechanism used to allocate classroom teachers to primary schools is the staffing schedule and, with effect from September 2009, the enrolment bands will be based on an average of 28 pupils per class rather than the current 27 pupils per class. My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their staffing allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_7776">The ceiling of two on the number of language support teachers per school is being re-imposed, with some alleviation for the position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall pupil enrolment. This will be done on a case by case basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_7777">In primary schools there will be substitute cover for teachers on uncertified sick leave other than on the first day of absence. In a school where more than one teacher is absent on the first day of uncertified sick leave, substitute cover will be provided for the second and subsequent teachers that are absent. In schools with two teachers or less cover will be provided where any classroom teacher is absent.</p>
            <p eId="para_7778">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.</p>
            <p eId="para_7779">Prudent management of the Government finances is particularly important at this time of global economic uncertainty when tax revenue has fallen so significantly and when world economic conditions are so serious. Even with the  Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_7780">While I appreciate that the abolition of certain grants will make it a challenging year ahead in terms of the day to day funding of schools, I have prioritised funding for primary schools. The Education Budget for 2009 has provided for improvements to capitation and ancillary grants for primary schools which will increase from €167 million in 2008 to almost €190 million in 2009. The budget improvements involve an increase of more than €21 to bring the rate to €200 per pupil and the ancillary services grant for primary schools will also be improved by €3.50 to €155 per pupil. My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their grant allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_7781">We are committed to investing in education but we have to invest at a level that is consistent with what we can afford and what is sustainable at the moment given economic circumstances. Targeting resources at the most disadvantaged schools that are working to counteract educational disadvantage will continue to be a priority for the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_7786">I propose to take Questions Nos. 398 and 400 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7787">SPHE was introduced into all schools, at Junior Cycle level, on a phased basis from September 2000 and has been a part of the Junior Cycle Curriculum since  2003. It builds on the various Life Skills, Health Education and Pastoral Care programmes already on offer in many Post Primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_7788">The aims of the SPHE are to enable the students to develop skills for self-fulfilment and living in communities, to promote self-esteem and self-confidence, to enable the students to develop a framework for responsible decision-making, to provide opportunities for reflection and discussion and to promote physical, mental and emotional health and well-being.</p>
            <p eId="para_7789">‘On My Own Two Feet' is a class-room materials resource for substance-use education in the context of the SPHE programme. It is an integral part of the  SPHE curriculum, drawing on three approaches: development of values and attitudes, decision-making and social competence. As such it is a comprehensive life-skills programme. The programme is being delivered in 750 secondary schools throughout the country with the aim of reaching all students in Junior Cycle. ‘On My Own Two Feet' was subsumed into Social Personal and Health  Education Programme (SPHE) September 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_7790">The overall operational costs for SPHE which includes ‘On My Own Two Feet' for 2006 was €446,000.  For 2007 it was €461,000 and for 2008 it has been €400,000 to date.  The SPHE receives funding from my Department, as well as the Department of Health and the HSE.  The figures quoted do not include substitution or secondments costs for the teachers who organise and attend the in-service provided by SPHE.</p>

            <p eId="para_7795">At present, the English language sector is regulated on a voluntary basis by the Advisory Council for English Language Schools (ACELS), a company limited by guarantee which operates under the aegis of my Department.  It provides a voluntary quality assurance and inspection scheme for private sector English language schools. ACELS also  approves teacher training qualifications for the EFL private sector, and has developed English language proficiency test instruments.   Schools which comply with the ACELS quality assurance and inspection scheme are approved by my Department for the purpose of providing English language programmes in the private sector. The conditions for recognition of schools are available on the body's website at www.acels.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_7796">In April 2005 my Department established an Internationalisation Register which sets out programmes approved for the purpose of access to work by students who are citizens from outside the EU, EEA and Switzerland. Under the immigration regime, such students will only be given access to work if they are attending full time programmes on the Register. The criteria for inclusion require that the programme be full-time, at least 15 hours per week for a minimum of 25  weeks, and lead to a nationally recognised award, or its international equivalent. Language programmes which meet the duration criteria and are approved under the ACELS quality assurance and inspection scheme are also eligible for inclusion on the Register, provided they offer assessment for students at the end of the programme using recognised language proficiency test instruments. The criteria for inclusion are included in an Information Note, along with the Internationalisation Register, on the Department's website at www.education.ie. The register is updated on a monthly basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_7797">I have already indicated my intention that the qualifications body, which will arise from the amalgamation of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council and the Further Education and Training Awards Council, should take on responsibility for providing the overall regulatory framework for the provision of international education programmes.  The role and functions of ACELS will be examined as part of the amalgamation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_7798">The most recent data regarding the number of international students in this sector comes from a Fáilte Ireland-commissioned report, carried out by Indecon consultants in 2007, entitled "International Competitor Analysis and Benchmarking of Ireland's English language learning sector".  This report suggests that the language sector attracts up to 130,000 students per year and that the sector is worth €500 million annually to the Irish economy.  The  overwhelming majority of students in this sector come from European countries.   The Indecon report suggested that 74% of English language students were from  Europe.</p>

            </p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7809">1.1  This Circular Letter replaces and supersedes Circular M 39/02. The Minister for Education and Science wishes to inform authorities of post-primary schools of the arrangements for the pensionability of supervision and substitution payments and restate and clarify the revised arrangements for supervision and substitution in second level schools.  The purpose of this circular letter is:</p>
            <p class="indent_4" eId="para_7810">a) To advise schools regarding the new arrangements for paid supervision and substitution that will apply arising from agreement between the parties at the Teachers' Conciliation Council.</p>
            <p class="indent_4" eId="para_7811">b) To set out the conditions that will apply to the pensionability of supervision and substitution payments.</p>
            <p class="indent_4" eId="para_7812">c) To outline to schools the funding/payment arrangements that will apply.</p>
            <p class="indent_4" eId="para_7813">d) To confirm the extension of paid substitution.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7814">1.2 Context of the Agreement on paid Supervision and Substitution.</p>
            <p class="indent_4" eId="para_7815">Teachers are routinely involved in supervision of pupils in their care as part of their contractual duty of care in a variety of situations. Supervision of pupils in classes under their control is an integral part of teachers' professional duties and the contracts of employment. This proposal relates to supervision of students during periods that are not assigned to any teacher and which had previously been provided by teachers on a voluntary basis.</p>
            <p class="indent_4" eId="para_7816">The paid substitution element of this agreement is intended to cover situations where a suitable substitute is not immediately available. This has, up to the present, generally involved other members of the teaching staff  substituting/supervising for their absent colleagues on a voluntary basis. It is this substitution that is intended to be provided under the new paid supervision and substitution arrangements.</p>
            <p class="indent_4" eId="para_7817">While the scheme envisages that supervision and substitution will be provided by teachers, the circular letter also makes provision for the situation, which may pertain in those schools where teachers are not available to carry out this work.</p>
            <p class="indent_4" eId="para_7818">The scheme, which applies to all post-primary schools, is outlined below. Detailed operational guidelines specific to the three different sectors (Community and Comprehensive, VEC and Voluntary secondary schools) may be circulated by the relevant management authorities following consultation with the relevant teacher unions.  The Department may also issue further elaboration/clarification as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_7819">
              <b>2. Basis of Scheme for Supervision and Substitution</b>
            </p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7820">2.1 Schools will be allocated hours for supervision and substitution on the basis of 37 hours per wholetime teacher equivalent (WTE) per school year. The WTE figure used for the allocation of supervision and substitution hours will be based on the teacher allocation as on the 1st September each year to the school.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7821">2.2 Hours will be allocated to VECs on the basis of the teacher allocation as on 1st September each year to the scheme.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7822">2.3 Payment will be made in July of each year on the basis of certified delivery as provided in the scheme. The payment will be calculated by reference to the hourly rate, appropriately weighted to give proportionate effect to any increases in the rate in the school year ending on the 30th June preceding payment. It is intended that payment will be made through the normal payroll system on the basis of certification by the Principal or Board of Management/VEC in relation to the commitment entered into by each individual teacher and the actual hours delivered.   Further discussions will be held with the parties on agreeing arrangements for an advance payment in December.</p>

            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7824">3.1 Permanent, temporary and part-time teachers employed in the school may volunteer at the commencement of the school year for supervision and substitution duties over the course of the year. A copy of the contract for permanent wholetime teachers is attached as Appendix 1. Other contracts will issue in due course.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7825">3.2 Wholetime volunteers will be required to contract to deliver a minimum of 37 hours supervision and substitution over the course of the school year.  Part-time and job-sharing teachers who volunteer will be required to deliver supervision and substitution on a pro-rata basis. This will cover both the supervision and substitution requirements of the school as determined by the school authorities following a consultation process.  In the event that the full allocation of hours available to the school is not exhausted by the volunteers on the basis of the minimum commitments, the additional hours may be distributed among the volunteers, or any number thereof, on a pro-rata basis or as agreed locally, subject to a maximum allocation of 49 hours per annum, in the case of wholetime teachers, not being exceeded.  In addition to the maximum allocation of 49 hours per annum, a part-time teacher may commit to the difference between the annual contracted part-time teaching hours with the school/VEC and 735 hours.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7826">3.3 The supervision and substitution contract will provide that volunteers, who are wholetime teachers, will not normally be required to provide more than 1 hour 30 minutes per week on the contracted duties in a given week.  However, the contract will provide that a teacher may agree to undertake contracted duties for more than 1 hour 30 minutes in a particular week on the request of the Principal.  Additional time worked in such circumstances will be reckoned towards the total annual commitment.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7827">3.4 The system of extra and separate payment for both supervision and substitution is for service in addition to normal class contact hours. Payment for supervision duties may not be made for periods within assigned timetabled class periods. In applying the system of additional and separate payments for both supervision and substitution the practice of timetabling teachers for these duties within normal teaching hours should cease.  Similarly direct delivery of supervision and substitution duties should no longer form part of the duties of an Assistant Principal or Special Duties post.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7828">3.5 On the basis of the contractual arrangements outlined above, teachers will qualify for additional annual payments, on the basis of an hourly rate of €37 w.e.f. 1 September 2002. Payment will be made on the basis of actual delivery. However, in the event that management does not demand delivery of the 37 contracted hours during the course of the school year, payment for the 37 hours contracted commitment will be made. Final payment on this basis will be made in July each year.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7829">3.6 In the event of the allocation of hours to a school not being exhausted by the contractual arrangements the remaining hours may be used by the school to:</p>
            <p class="indent_4" eId="para_7830">(i) pay teachers in addition to their contractual arrangements in respect of any additional casual supervision and substitution they provide, or</p>
            <p class="indent_4" eId="para_7831">(ii) pay any other teacher, if no contracted teacher is available, to perform these duties on a casual basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_7832">
              <b>4. Operational Arrangements for Supervision/Substitution</b>
            </p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7833">4.1 The Principal should consult with the volunteers in deciding on the timetable  for supervision duties.  Supervision duties should be timetabled over the course of the school year.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7834">4.2 Residual hours available after the timetabling of supervision will be available for substitution. The specific arrangements for a substitution timetable should be made following consultation between management and teachers.  The total time assigned to substitution and supervision may not exceed 1½ hours in any given week (save where otherwise agreed with the teacher).  A commitment from teachers to be available for two timetabled class periods per week will form part of these arrangements.</p>
            <p class="indent_4" eId="para_7835">Where, in any given week, a teacher is not called upon for substitution, the unmet commitment remains but is subject to a maximum delivery in any future week of 1½ hours within the two designated class periods (save where otherwise agreed with the teacher).</p>
            <p eId="para_7836">
              <b>5. Pensionability of Supervision and Substitution Payments</b>
            </p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7837">5.1 Teachers who are in pensionable service and who give a commitment in writing to undertake supervision and substitution duties under a 37 hour contract on an ongoing basis to retirement will have the agreed payment made pensionable subject to the payment of contributions and the rules of the Superannuation Scheme.   The pensionability of supervision and substitution payments for part-time teachers will be addressed in the context of the discussions on the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7838">5.2 Serving teachers, in order to qualify for pensionability, shall make the necessary commitment on or before the 1st September 2004.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7839">5.3 New teachers, in order to qualify for pensionability, shall make the necessary commitment within 12 months of first appointment.   Details of  teachers who have entered such a commitment should be notified  to the Department of Education and Science in order that payment of the pension contribution can commence.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7840">5.4 A teacher, who has entered such a commitment, but later ceases to meet the commitment, will forfeit pensionability and will not be allowed to re-enter such a commitment.  The teacher will not, in such circumstances, be entitled to a refund of superannuation contributions paid in respect of supervision and substitution payments.  Such teachers must advise their boards of management of their decision on or before the 30th June prior to the commencement of the relevant school year.   However, this will not be a barrier to the provision of paid supervision and substitution on a casual basis.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7841">5.5 Where teachers make an ongoing commitment, the commencement date for pensionability shall be the 1st September 2001 in the case of serving teachers who have delivered  the appropriate service in each year since that date or the date of appointment in the case of new teachers.  On entering the commitment teachers will be required to make the appropriate pension contribution with effect from these dates.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7842">5.6 The pensionability of the supervision and substitution payment is restricted to the minimum commitment of 37 hours over the course of the year.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7843">5.7 A teacher who is not entering a commitment to undertake supervision and substitution  duties under a 37 hour contract on an ongoing basis to retirement may continue to provide supervision and substitution duties on a casual non-pensionable basis.  Such teachers should advise their board of management of their availability on or before the 30th June preceding the next school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_7844">
              <b>6. Supervision</b>
            </p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7845">6.1 School management has a responsibility to discharge its duty of care to pupils and to provide adequate supervision of pupils during the full period of time that schools are in operation.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7846">6.2 Teachers are routinely involved in a variety of situations in the supervision of pupils in their care as part of their contractual duty of care.  Supervision of pupils in classes under their control is an integral part of a teacher's professional duties and contract of employment.  The issue being addressed in this scheme relates to supervision of students on the school premises outside of specified classroom teaching duties that has, up to the present, generally been provided by teachers on a voluntary basis.  Under this scheme, the Department will make resources available to schools to provide supervision on a paid basis.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7847">6.3 The supervisor in discharging his/her duty should take such care as to ensure the health and safety of the pupils as is reasonable in the circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_7848">
              <b>7. Substitution</b>
            </p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7849">7.1 Substitution is the replacement of an absent teacher by another qualified teacher and substitution arrangements should aim to maximise appropriate teaching during substitution periods.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7850">7.2 At present, the Department provides for paid substitution for specified approved teacher absences.  In the case of absences for which paid substitution is available, schools normally employ a suitable qualified substitute as soon as possible to teach the subjects and classes of the absent teacher.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7851">7.3 Under the terms of this agreement, the Department will now provide schools/VECs with resources to extend paid substitution for absences of teachers on uncertified sick leave, and other approved absences on school business, with a view to minimising the disruption of teaching programmes and improving the service to pupils. This substitution should be arranged in the normal way by the employment of a substitute teacher.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7852">7.4 In addition, in order to facilitate school management in dealing with short-term unplanned or unexpected absences, teachers already employed by the school may commit to and be paid for casual substitution under the supervision and substitution arrangements set out in Paragraph 3 of this Circular.   This does not alter the existing arrangements for part-time teachers to undertake duties as a substitute in the normal way.</p>

            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7855">8.1 A claim form should be completed by each teacher who wishes to apply for payment. A copy of the claim form is attached  as Appendix 11.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7856">8.2 Valid claims should be certified by the Principal and retained in the school.  The Principal of each school should notify the Department/VEC of the list of teachers eligible for payment on a composite claim form.  The composite claim form will be forwarded to schools in due course.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7857">8.3 The Department/VEC will arrange for payment of the teachers concerned through the teacher payroll system on receipt of the composite claim form.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7858">8.4 Further discussions will be held with the parties on agreeing arrangements for an advance payment in December.</p>

              <b>9. Supplementary Arrangements</b>
            </p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7860">9.1 The process of seeking teacher volunteers (from amongst the permanent, temporary and part-time teachers employed by the school) may not produce enough school-based volunteers to cover the school's supervision and substitution needs.  In such circumstances, school management may source and recruit personnel to provide supervision services before school, at break-times and after school, and (where substitute teachers are not available) supervision of classes where teachers are absent on uncertified sick leave or on other approved absences on school business.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7861">9.2 Such personnel employed by the school as supervisors may be paid either on a casual basis or on a contract basis from funds provided by the Department based on the balance or proportion of the balance of the non-committed supervision and substitution hours. Supervisors who contract for the delivery of supervision services will be remunerated at a weekly rate of  €370 per week for which they will be expected to provide a minimum of ten hours and up to a maximum of twenty hours actual supervision per week.  Supervision on a casual hourly basis or in excess of 20 hours for contracted staff in any week will be paid at a pro-rata rate.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_7862">9.3 These supplementary arrangements will continue to be kept under review in consultation with school management authorities.</p>

            </p>
            <p eId="para_7864">In the normal way each school/VEC will be required to keep records of the utilisation of the hours allocated under the supervision and substitution arrangements.  Each school/VEC will also be required to provide a balancing statement showing the hours allocated, the hours certified for payment and expenditure on the employment of non teaching staff where applicable.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_7905">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for  educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying  levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  DEIS brings together and builds upon a number of existing interventions in  schools with concentrated levels of disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_7906">The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the  Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices  and the Inspectorate.</p>
            <p eId="para_7907">73 post primary schools, 27 urban primary schools and 123 rural primary schools that were not identified for inclusion in DEIS, retained resources, both  teaching posts and financial, under pre-existing schemes and programmes for  addressing educational disadvantage. When DEIS was introduced, a commitment was given as a concessionary measure to these schools that they would retain a level of support for the duration of the current DEIS Initiative which is scheduled to end in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_7908">The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the  current DEIS programme which runs from 2005-2010. There will not be an  opportunity before this to be included in the current DEIS programme of  supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_7909">While it is appreciated that the discontinuation of these resources will impact  on these schools, given the current volatile and challenging economic climate,  difficult decisions had to be made in order to contain public sector spending.  One of these decisions was to advance the withdrawal of such supports from non  DEIS schools to the beginning of the next school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_7910">The main focus of Social Inclusion measures will be to retain resources in DEIS  schools. There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most  need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations  of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on  Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most  disadvantaged communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_7975">Whole-school evaluation (WSE) is a model of external evaluation for primary and  post-primary schools that was introduced during the school year 2003/2004.  Whole-school evaluation is designed to encourage a culture of improvement and  an emphasis of the quality of provision in schools. It does so by providing an  external perspective on the quality of the key aspects of the school's work  including its management, leadership, teaching and learning. It seeks to affirm  good practice and constructively identify areas for improvement.</p>
            <p eId="para_7976">In the 2004-2008 period, whole-school evaluations were conducted in 241  post-primary schools as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_8000">In addition, 336 Tuairisc scoile reports were issued to primary schools in  2004, and a further 90 Tuairisc scoile were completed in 2005. Whole-school evaluation replaced the Tuairisc scoile model of evaluation during the 2003/2004 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_8001">Whole-school evaluations form just part of the Inspectorate's business plan in  any given year. In 2007, for example, the Inspectorate carried out 303 whole  school evaluations, 758 subject inspections, 23 programme evaluations, 23  evaluations of centres for education, the evaluation of 57 Irish-language  summer colleges and the probation of 2,362 primary teachers (3 visits on  average per teacher) and 9 thematic evaluations. The total number of  inspections/evaluations carried out in 2007 was 3,535.</p>
            <p eId="para_8002">As the Inspectorate is part of the Department of Education and Science, all  costs associated with its work are paid from the administrative budget of the  Department. In addition to conducting whole-school evaluations, inspectors are  also involved in a wide range of other work such as subject inspections,  programme evaluations, the preparation of composite and thematic evaluation  reports on aspects of educational provision in schools, participation in appeal  boards established under Section 29 of the Education Act, and contribute to policy formulation and development in areas such as teacher education, special education, and curriculum and assessment. It is not possible at present to separate out the costs specifically associated with whole school evaluations from other evaluations and from other costs incurred in carrying out the wider range of duties undertaken by inspectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_8003">On the 1st September 2008 there were 59 primary inspectors and 51 post-primary inspectors assigned to school evaluation activities including the conduct of whole-school evaluations. However, it should be noted that the number of inspectors involved in the evaluation of schools and teachers may vary throughout any given year due to assignments to other duties, secondments, maternity leave, etc.</p>

            <p eId="para_8008">Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by my  Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil  enrolment. In accordance with these rules each school management authority is  required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved  teacher allocation. It is a matter for the school to employ teachers up to the  limit of its approved allocation and at its discretion to deploy those teachers  to the subject areas that the school chooses to provide.</p>
            <p eId="para_8009">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. Decisions were made in order to control expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long term. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be entirely spared, and I acknowledge the impact of funding restrictions in a number of areas, including at school level. However, these are the inevitable result of the challenging economic environment and the need to manage Exchequer resources prudently.</p>
            <p eId="para_8010">Specific information in relation to the detailed staffing allocations that individual schools will have for the commencement of the academic year 2009/10  cannot be determined until the allocation processes have fully concluded. There is nothing exceptional in this. The allocation processes include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. This is particularly relevant at post-primary level where the appellate process considers in particular any specific curricular needs of the school concerned.  Up to now there has not been an effective system wide redeployment scheme at post-primary but discussions on the arrangements for redeployment that will apply in the case of teachers that become surplus in situations other than school closure will re-commence shortly and the parties have agreed that these discussions will be finalised by end  March 2009.  Discrete allocations are made to post-primary schools for example to cater for pupils with Special Educational Needs and those with Language difficulties and these allocations can alter the ultimate position of the school in relation to any over quota position.</p>

            <p eId="para_8013">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect, the education sector, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_8014">My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their staffing and grant allocations.  The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools.  The staffing allocation processes, including notification to schools, will commence early in the New Year.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers, my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels, which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_8015">I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers or on grant levels in schools for the 2009/10 school year.  I will do this when the allocation processes have been completed.  Furthermore, the staffing schedule will be published; it is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.</p>
            <p eId="para_8016">With regard to supervision and substitution, the situation is as follows: in primary schools there will be substitute cover for teachers on uncertified sick leave other than on the first day of absence. In a school where more than one teacher is absent on the first day of uncertified sick leave, substitute cover will be provided for the second and subsequent teachers that are absent.  In schools with two teachers or fewer, cover will be provided where any classroom teacher is absent.</p>
            <p eId="para_8017">Each post-primary school will be provided with a defined number of hours of substitution cover outside of the supervision and substitution scheme to provide cover for teacher absences arising from uncertified sick leave and official school business.  This will be calculated on the basis of the number of pupils in a school with a minimum number of available hours for all schools with less than 100 pupils.  Thus for the remainder of the school year 0.16 hours substitution cover will be allocated for each pupil in a school as per the school's recognised pupil enrolment on the 30th September 2007.  Examples are an allocation of 32 hours for a 200 pupil school and 64 hours for a 400 pupil school.</p>
