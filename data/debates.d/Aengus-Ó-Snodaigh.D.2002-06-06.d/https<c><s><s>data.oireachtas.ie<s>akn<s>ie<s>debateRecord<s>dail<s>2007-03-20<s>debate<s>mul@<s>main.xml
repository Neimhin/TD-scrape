One assistant principal officer deals with the Deputies and assists the Chief Whip in this matter.

            <p eId="para_18">It is well known that four Independent Deputies continuously supported the last Government.  The two remaining Deputies in that category are Deputies Healy-Rae and Fox.  Contact with them is as required.  In the last Dáil there was regular contact because the Government did not have the numbers between its two parties without their support, so they were kept in touch with on a regular basis.  Contact is not as necessary for each Bill as it was but whenever it is necessary to brief them on legislation arising this is done.  Members of my office and that of the Chief Whip deal with issues raised by Deputies, not only Independent Deputies.  Not a week would go by without some Deputy from some side of the House having a request, whether regarding a visitor or some other issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_19">In response to the Deputy's second question, within my Department we endeavour as best we can to deal with correspondence in Irish relevant to the Department and to ensure at least one person in each section is fluent in written Irish.

When the Taoiseach says the service is only available now, as required, one must ask by whom it is required and for what purpose.

He asked me to appreciate that if he found someone helpful and constructive over five years, he would not just turn over the book and say the numbers are different and that he is not interested any more.  He said this is not the way he works because it would be disrespectful.  I took note of this because I presume he is considering the post-election circumstances.  If, for example, the Progressive Democrats is not in a position to be in Government, will it be in the favoured position of having been formerly helpful, thus resulting in a new tranche of partially favoured Opposition Members, bearing in mind that we cannot say what the outcome of the election will be?  Would that be too many partially favoured Opposition TDs and would the Independent Members have to be dropped as they would then be a distant memory?  Is there a limit to the number of partially favoured Opposition TDs the Taoiseach puts in that special position?</p>

I ask the Taoiseach who overseas that and what is the differentiation between the politics and the public relations end of it.  I understand the Taoiseach is on record as saying the early child care supplement will cost approximately €3 million.  Currently, it is €150,000 and rising.

A Minister or a Minister of State in any Department cannot simply decide to produce a publicity leaflet without being satisfied that it comes within the procurement arrangements and the guidelines.  A number of issues arose in the past six or seven years since the Public Office Commission was set up and they were addressed in the guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_68">Regarding these questions, if a Minister decided to take on staff by fast-tracking the post and not going through the normal procurement arrangements or if it was somebody in the public relations area, it was considered that there should be a new procurement arrangement where there was any doubt involved.  The Quigley report specified that in any such case it should be first certified and cleared with the Secretary General of the Department and, if there was any doubt, with the Secretary General of the Government.  That has since happened.  I understand there have been four or five such cases to date.  If there is any doubt, the matter must go not only to the Department but to the Government secretariat which would arbitrate on the decision.  It does not come to the Government or to me.  Under existing guidelines, the Government contracts committee and the Government handbook, the Government secretariat would make a call on whether it was permissible.</p>

            <p eId="para_73">Deputy Kenny mentioned that coming up to the last general election the Minister of State with responsibility for children misused taxpayers' money to blatantly convey a political message.  However, he was not the only one.  Several Ministers promoted themselves and their party affiliations under the guise of imparting information to the public coming up to the last general election.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that we will not see a recurrence of that practice on this occasion?  On how many occasions has a Minister sought to implement the procedures to notify the Secretary General to the Government of a particular PR or communications contract since the guidelines, to which he referred, were introduced in, I believe, February 2005?  On how many occasions has the appointment of a particular person or enterprise in that area been considered by the Government Secretariat?  On how many occasions has the Secretary General made a recommendation to the Taoiseach in respect of any special procurement procedures that ought to be observed in this case, and which Ministers were the subject of this process by the Secretary General?  How many times have these procedures been invoked since the affair involving the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, that prompted the guidelines in the first instance?</p>

            <p eId="para_74">I do not accept that Ministers breached the public procurement guidelines and the various rules in the handbook prior to the last general election.  Ministers must follow the guidelines.  There were a few cases outside of election times that were brought to the attention of the Standards in Public Office Commission, which were looked at.  I do not believe informing people about the FIS system or the other systems where people at times do not take up their entitlements is in breach of guidelines.  It is a good service and I do not believe we should not inform people.  That said, it is a regular practice for the Government secretariat to inform Ministers or Departments of the proper practice in relation to the Government handbook and the criteria for following up issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_75">To reply to Deputy Rabbitte, in regard to the Quigley report five cases which came within the terms of the guidelines have been processed so far.  Two of these related to the appointment of an arts adviser at the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  I approved both of these appointments following appropriate prior consideration by the Government secretariat, the Minister having brought them to the Government secretariat for advice.  The other three cases were on investigation by the Government secretariat found not to be within the scope of the guidelines.  Those were an IT consultant in the Department of Transport and a PR and communications consultant in both the Department of Transport and the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  In those cases they were not within the guidelines but followed the correct criteria.  Usually when issues arises, they come under the normal public procurement guidelines and the Government handbook and the Department of Finance rules which are very straightforward.</p>

            <p eId="para_77">In relation to the group established in the Taoiseach's Department to oversee the awarding of public relations contracts and the information he has already shared with us this afternoon, surely there must be a wider remit than just oversight.  Can he elaborate on the function and the expected performance of the group?  It has been mentioned, without specific identification, that in the issue of e-voting some €3 million was expended on PR company work in the promotion of that failed intent.  Will the Taoiseach state this is a serious amount of money?  Is it his view that part of the role of the group would be to promote the use in the first instance of the Government press office and the respective PR officials in each of the Departments and that it should be only in the most extreme and special circumstances that outside PR consultants would be needed?  Are there guidelines in respect of the decision to seek private consultancy in relation to press work and public relations and, if so, will he outline the guidelines to the House?</p>

            <p eId="para_78">In regard to any contract in a Department, there is the criteria set down by the Department of Finance, the Cabinet book and directives that cover what Ministers or departmental sections can do in the promotion of any campaign.  There is also the Government contracts committee.  All of these lay down the rules.  The issue in the Quigley report dealt with a PR communications area where there is a significant element of direct service to a Minister or where a Minister is suggesting the name of a person or enterprise for a consultancy contract.  In that case the Quigley report recommended a strengthening of the guidelines in the Department of Finance and in the Government contracts committee.  It also stated, to remove doubt, that the Secretary General of a Department would have to arbitrate in a first case.  If he or she was in any doubt, it was permissible within the guidelines that it would be referred to the Government secretariat, which regularly arbitrates on issues that fall within the Government handbook or Government guidelines.  For a normal contract, a departmental section or agency must comply with the guidelines of the Department of Finance and the contracts committee.  These documents require rigorous compliance.  No one can tender for a contract without fulfilling the requirements of the guidelines.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_85">I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 to 16, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">Mr. Loughlin Deegan, a qualified solicitor, was appointed on 29 July 2002 to the position of special assistant to act as a liaison between the Attorney General and myself and other Departments on items relevant to the programme for Government.  His duties also include briefing the Attorney General on items arising in the Dáil and Seanad or media which could impinge on, or be relevant to, the role of the Attorney General.</p>
            <p eId="para_87">Mr. Deegan does not provide legal advice or legal services directly to Departments but provides advice and assistance directly to the Attorney General on the matters relevant to the work of the Attorney General.  He provides assistance to the Attorney General in matters such as the drafting of speeches and public presentations.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">The Office of the Attorney General has sanction for 135 staff.  Of this number, 15 have recently been sanctioned by the Department of Finance and the office is recruiting these additional staff.  Several competitions, organised on behalf of the office by the Public Appointments Service, are in train.  These include competitions for advisory counsel grade III and legal researchers.  Internal competitions are in train and others are being prepared.  There remain a small number of administrative or support posts to be filled from the normal Public Appointments Service general service or decentralisation panels.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">In addition to permanent staff, the office retains six drafters on contract.  These positions are filled pursuant to Department of Finance sanction.  All contract drafters engaged by the office have significant drafting experience either in the State or in common law jurisdictions.  In the past, all have previously held senior drafting positions, including former heads of office of the UK Office of Parliamentary Counsel, the Canadian Federal Drafting Office and the Office of the Scottish Parliamentary Counsel.  All contract drafters come highly recommended.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">Typically, a contract drafter will be given a one-year contract which may subsequently be extended depending on the level of work dictated by the Government's legislative programme and the availability of permanent staff, which can be affected by term-time working arrangements, maternity leave etc.  The need for contract drafters is kept under constant review.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">The amounts paid in respect of the contract drafters are set out in the following schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_92">Thomson Roundhall delivered its report on 6 February 2007 on the electronic Statute Book.  Of the recommendations contained in the report, consideration is being given to two options.  The first option could be concluded within seven weeks at a cost of €37,000 and would correct the errors.  The second, more technical and less urgent option would involve reformatting and would take 25 weeks at a cost of between €125,000 and €175,000.  It is not intended to proceed with it initially. However, this route will be further considered in the context of the electronic Statute Book value for money review which is far advanced.  The cost of the feasibility and costs report from Thomson Roundhall was €10,587.50, including VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_93">On the question of the role of the Attorney General in determining fees to be paid, all tribunal counsel fees are sanctioned by the Department of Finance and are paid from the relevant departmental Vote.  In that context, the Office of the Attorney General offers a view as to the level of fees payable.</p>
            <p eId="para_94">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_95">Schedule — engagement of contract drafters 2002 to 2006</p>
            <p eId="para_96">Please note that annual information is presented and that all the contract drafters may not have been engaged at the same time during the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_97">During 2002, the office retained four contract drafters and paid amounts of €65,468, €68,755, €72,373 and €137,095.</p>
            <p eId="para_98">During 2003, the office retained five contract drafters and paid amounts of €10,158, €69,528, €73,772, €91,390 and €142,270.</p>
            <p eId="para_99">During 2004, the office retained six contract drafters and paid amounts of €35,951, €73,807, €81,206, €96,178, €121,682 and €137,762.</p>
            <p eId="para_100">During 2005, the office retained seven contract drafters and paid amounts of €1,293, €41,675, €87,668, €114,680, €131,822, €136,462 and €154,668.</p>
            <p eId="para_101">During 2006, the office retained eight contract drafters and paid amounts of €15,548, €61,839, €74,536, €92,600, €99,324, €115,904, €144,911 and €168,526.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_57">
            <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_102">Does the Taoiseach regard the Office of the Attorney General as a non-political office?  I understand the Attorney General has a special adviser who has a political role.  As the Attorney General must give advice to the Government, is his office viewed as non-political?  When does the Taoiseach expect we will have an on-line version of the pre-1922 statutes that are still legally effective?  Persons who wish to gain access to them are very restricted.</p>
            <p eId="para_103">Given the on-line version of legislation, which is the one most readily accessible to citizens, researchers, academics, legal practitioners, etc., has been seen to be less than 100% correct, has a trawl been carried out as to the number of items of legislation that are inaccurate in the on-line version?  Is the Taoiseach's Department aware certain Acts published on-line are not fully accurate?  Is an analysis of that deficiency currently ongoing, and does the Taoiseach have any information as to when, or if, that work will be concluded?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_58">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_104">That was the issue to which I referred.  Following the completion of the work, the Attorney General's office found an error in the chronological tables.  The office has been seeking to correct the error in that work.  As I stated in the reply, two possible options have been identified to correct the errors that have occurred.  The first would not take too long.  It involves seven weeks of work at a cost of €37,000.  I presume that is the option that will be chosen.</p>
            <p eId="para_105">Another option would take approximately six months to conclude.  This would involve re-formatting the work, which is a more technical job.  The Attorney General's office will have to make a decision based on value for money criteria.  Considering the investment made, it would appear to be advisable to proceed, unless there was a reason not to do so.  Most of the work on-line has not been affected.  The work involved in the original project is being used, except where the deficiency concerned arises in regard to work carried out by the company that did the original work — Juta Limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_106">This company was originally contracted to provide an electronic version of the Statute Book.  A computerised process was used by the company to insert the hyperlinks into the electronic Statute Book.  Where one item of legislation refers to another, the first item contains a link which allows the user to click directly into the second.  This is a helpful resource which, in the majority of cases, makes the electronic Statute Book user-friendly.  This facility works very well.  However, in some cases, the technical process used by the original contractors resulted in some legislative texts being obscured.</p>
            <p eId="para_107">The contract held with the outside contractor in question ended in 1998 and the company concerned has not been awarded any other contracts by the Office of the Attorney General since that time.  A second outside contractor has periodically updated the electronic version of the Statute Book.  The hyperlinking error has not been repeated by any of the new outside contractors working on the legislation from 1999 onwards.  It is a question of correcting errors in work done prior to that date, which is not too expensive.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">Deputies will be aware of the efforts being made by my Department and the Office of the Attorney General to modernise the Statute Book by repealing obsolete pre-1922 legislation.  The second Bill relating to this area is currently before the House.  It is Government policy to ultimately repeal all of the pre-1922 legislation through an ongoing process of legislative reform.  In that context, there is little value in making pre-1922 legislation available in electronic form.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">The post referred to in Deputy Kenny's question relates to a special assistant, who works with the Attorney General.  It is not an adviser, as is the case in other Departments.  That individual liaises with Ministers regarding issues in the Office of the Attorney General and also provides a useful point of contact.  In the normal course of events, with so much legal and legislative work, and so many other cases passing through the Office of the Attorney General, it is key to have someone who can liaise.  It is not a political issue, but it is very important to have someone who can fulfil that role.  For some time, a special assistant has liaised between the Attorney General and the Departments on programmes for Government and day-to-day legislative issues.  It is not in the political context of an adviser, since the role is quite different.</p>

            <p eId="para_112">Can the Taoiseach tell us the three largest sums paid to contractors and state their nationalities?  Is he aware of the extreme concern at the employment of so many contract drafters from abroad, including people who have been pensioned off in their home countries, instead of training young people as full-time drafters in the Office of the Attorney General?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_113">As I said in my reply, some 15 additional staff have been taken on.  We have some very able Irish drafters, but there are difficulties when someone is on maternity or special leave as, unlike many other posts, one cannot easily find experienced people.  I agree that we should at all times endeavour to have our own draftspeople, and it is to be hoped that the extra staff will help.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">I will not go into too much detail as this information is provided with the answer.  The three largest sums paid last year were €168,526, €144,911 and €115,904, respectively.  We have been using contract drafters for many years.  There are normally between four and six in any one year, and other payments tend to be small, depending on the length of the person's employment.  We have been lucky, since the House now passes 70 or 80 Bills each year, and without contract drafters we would never be able to keep abreast of the workload.</p>

Given the growing market of recent years, it is not surprising that the yield from stamp duty has increased.  However, such growth cannot be taken for granted in future.  However, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, no stamp duty is paid on the vast majority of new houses bought by first-time buyers and other owner-occupiers.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">Consideration of ways to improve the structure of the tax would have to have regard, among other things, to simplicity and cost.  For example, the estimated cost of introducing a system whereby stamp duty would be applied on a marginal basis for houses priced above the current exemption thresholds, based on the full year 2006 yield, is €553 million — that is, more than 42% of the yield on residential property.</p>
            <p eId="para_120">In particular, the Government wants to assist those who are trying to buy their first home.  That is why I increased the exemption and reduced stamp duty rates for first-time buyers in budget 2005 and why I increased mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers in budget 2007, with benefits to those about to purchase and those who had purchased in the last seven years.  By making these changes, I was able to assist first-time buyers directly without impacting on the overall market conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_121">This must be a key consideration in the continuing evaluation of policy in this area given the vital importance of the construction sector to the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_122">Stamp duty is a significant contributor to the Exchequer, which helps fund public services such as health and education, while keeping the direct tax burden low, thereby facilitating continued economic success which is of benefit to all taxpayers.  It has helped us to reduce taxes on work and enterprise with clear benefits for the economy as a whole.</p>

            <p eId="para_123">Would the Minister agree that a tax which accelerates so rapidly as house prices rise, is inequitable because of its extraordinary structure?  Is the Minister aware that the amount of stamp duty collected in 2006 was fourfold that collected in 2002?  Is he also aware that in 2002 the stamp duty paid on a typical house was 4% and came to €9,000, while now, just four years later, the corresponding figure is 7.5% with the average person paying €29,000?  Would the Minister agree that the structure of this sort of tax, with such a sharp acceleration in take from many young families is unfair?  It needs to be reformed so that the tax is equitable in the way it is applied and is also proofed against this extraordinary rollercoaster of huge surges when house prices rise.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">The Deputy will be aware that the stamp duty code has applied a single rate to the full value of the property where the rate applicable depends on the value of the property concerned.  That has been the nature of the tax since its inception.  While there have been increases in the yield of this tax in recent years as a result of increased property prices, that is not something we can factor into future revenue yields either from that tax or the general Revenue take.  Nor can we expect that market conditions, which have softened in recent times, will be renewed with the increased price inflation that would result.</p>
            <p eId="para_125">When considering how to improve structures of taxes such as this, one must have regard, among other issues, to simplicity and cost.  If the threshold issue was applied to current rates, the full cost of it would be over €550 million or 42% of the yield on residential property.  We have been able to reduce the direct tax burden on income, which means there has been an increased contribution from capital taxes and stamp duties as a result.  This must also be borne in mind.</p>

            <p eId="para_126">I would like to ask the Minister a straight question.  Does he believe it is fair that the exemption limit for first-time buyers is now 40% below the average house price in Dublin?  The exemption limit for second-time buyers — many of whom are families trading up from smaller homes — is just 23% of the average house price in the capital.  In a tax code that is supposed to be fair, what is the meaning of exemption thresholds that are set so far below the price at which anyone can buy a house?  Does the Minister not recognise that those sort of thresholds are unfair because they have been left there for so long without taking account of what has happened in the market in the intervening years?</p>

            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_127">I changed the thresholds in budget 2005, increasing them considerably in respect of first-time buyers of second-hand houses.  According to data available to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in the first half of 2006, over 50% of houses purchased by first-time buyers of second-hand properties in Dublin were valued at under €317,500 and were not liable for stamp duty.  Those are the figures up to mid-2006, but statistics for the third quarter are not yet available.  In terms of total Revenue take, it is important to recognise the significant changes we have made in income taxation.  The contribution these taxes make to the Exchequer must also be taken into account.</p>

        <b>Ms Burton</b>
        asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
          his views on the risk posed to the Irish economy by continued high inflation; his further views on the resulting loss of competitiveness in the Irish economy and the significant number of redundancies particularly in traditional manufacturing jobs, and the fact that Ireland lags behind other EU member states on a number of indices including broadband provision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  
        [10252/07]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_67" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_129">The prospects for the economy are favourable.  Strong growth is expected this year with both GDP and GNP forecast to increase by 5.3%.  With more than 2 million people now employed in the State and unemployment forecast to be under 4.5% this year, we are effectively at full employment.  However, we recognise that clear challenges remain, which must be addressed if living standards are to continue to improve as they have done over the past ten years.</p>
            <p eId="para_130">The Government is keenly aware of the importance of Ireland's competitiveness position concerning investment, exports and, hence, jobs.  Inflation is one of the factors impacting on competitiveness.  Competitiveness is also influenced by exchange rates, wage inflation, public spending growth and capital spending on infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_131">The annual rate of consumer price index, CPI, inflation was 4.8% in February, down from 5.2% in January.  A better measure of underlying inflation is the EU comparable measure of inflation, the harmonised index of consumer prices or HICP.  The HICP differs from the CPI in terms of coverage.  The most notable difference is the exclusion of mortgage interest repayments from the HICP.  Annual HICP inflation in Ireland was 2.6% in February, down from 2.9% in January.  The recent pick-up in inflation was largely due to external developments over which the Government has no control — in particular, increased interest rates by the European Central Bank.  This can be seen by the fact that the CPI, excluding mortgage interest payments, averaged 2.5% in the year to February.  I am confident that inflation will moderate over the course of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_132">We all recognise that the Irish economy cannot compete on the same basis as in the past.  To maintain and enhance competitiveness in the context of a higher-cost economy, a greater focus on productivity across all sectors of the economy is essential because in the long run, in a small economy like Ireland's, economic prosperity ultimately depends on our ability to sell goods and services abroad.  Recognising this challenge, the Government has developed policies which are designed to help Ireland's competitiveness.  Important policy issues in the medium term include developing our innovation potential, improving the regulatory environment, enhancing the human capital of the country, and developing our economic and technological infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_133">The Government will spend an average of 5.4% of GNP per year over the period 2007-13 on capital infrastructure under the new national development plan.  We are also investing in education; our strategy for science, technology and innovation will support more science and technology graduates which businesses will need in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_134">The Government has also introduced incentives for research and development, which will also help us as we build towards a more knowledge-based economy.  These initiatives will enhance our competitive position and allow us to produce goods and services more efficiently, while maintaining and improving our living standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_135">While some jobs losses have recently been announced in exposed sectors of the economy, this Government has developed the conditions that created nearly 90,000 new jobs in the past year.</p>
            <p eId="para_136">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_137">Turning to the Deputy's reference to broadband, the provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for private sector companies.  The role of Government is to implement regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of affordable, high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers.  Since October 2004, the number of broadband subscribers has increased from 63,000 to more than 500,000 by the end of 2006.  Prices have also dropped and are in line with EU standards.  There is no evidence to suggest broadband availability has been a negative factor for foreign or domestic investment.  The Deputy should note that the Government has committed itself to ensuring that, in those parts of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity, it will address it via a new scheme.  When fully rolled out, that scheme will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in rural areas are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_138">I am confident that the stable macro-economic environment this Government has created through the pursuit of sound public finances, will support the economy's competitiveness in the years ahead and will, in turn, provide the basis for achieving further economic and social policy objectives in the long term.</p>

            <from>Ms Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_139">The policy initiatives the Minister has announced to improve competitiveness are too little too late.  I do not know if the Minister has had a chance to read the annual reports of the National Competitiveness Council and Forfás.  According to that data, Ireland performs poorly across a range of infrastructural areas, including energy, waste and broadband, to mention but three.</p>
            <p eId="para_140">How does the Minister explain that the price of electricity was 15% below the European-15 average in 1996, whereas now, after ten years of this Government and on his watch, the price is 13% above the European average?  Our share of the world merchandise trade has fallen from its peak in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_141">Has the Minister had a chance to consider what the annual competitiveness report says about this Government's gross economic mismanagement?  During the best years the Minister left the Government with many indicators facing downwards and 35,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost during the last five years.  What does the Minister have to say to workers leaving factory jobs, including high-end jobs in companies such as Motorola and what does he say about the competitiveness challenge?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_69" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_142">During the period referred to by the Deputy, 2002 to 2006, there was a reduction of 31,000 in manufacturing jobs but the economy created 250,000 jobs during the same period.  The net benefit to the economy was in the region of 220,000 jobs and this is a significant indicator of overall competitiveness in the Irish economy.  Ireland is still regarded as a suitable location for inward investment and new businesses in the indigenous sector due to increased demand, higher incomes, a bigger labour force, tax reforms and greater domestic demand.  Other major European economies have been trying to create such a scenario for many years.</p>
            <p eId="para_143">It is true that there has been turbulence in the energy markets relating to oil prices and so on.  Independent regulators have been introduced to Irish utility markets that were previously monopolies.  Competitive structures have come about through the appointment of regulators.  Turbulence in the oil market has caused significant increases in electricity and gas prices and the regulator is examining ways to reduce the regulated price over a period, rather than leave it as it is.</p>
            <p eId="para_144">Broadband coverage has increased from 63,000 to more than 500,000 subscribers since and prices have dropped in line with EU standards.</p>

            <from>Ms Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_145">I will repeat the figures in this regard.  In 1996, before the creation of the regulator, electricity prices here were 15% below the+European-15 average.  The Government's attempt at regulation was supposed to benefit industrial, commercial and domestic consumers but since it began electricity prices have risen to 13% above the European average.  Talk of regulators is well and good but the Government's actions in the field of energy have driven electricity prices ever higher and we are now at the top of the European table in this respect and at the bottom of the range on broadband.</p>

            <p eId="para_146">I do not agree with the Deputy's comments and I have indicated the changes that are taking place regarding broadband.  The reforms agreed by the Government in the White Paper on Energy are a further indication of our commitment to bring more competition to the market and ensure the consumer gets a better deal on price.  The introduction of the independent regulation of utility markets is occurring against a background of price freezes and reductions compared to prices of up to a decade previously.</p>

          his views on the possible impact on the economy of legislation currently before the US Senate to restrict US companies’ deferral of taxation on foreign earnings to revenues from products and services both rendered and sold or consumed in the foreign country in view of the fact that this legislation is predicted to have a dramatic impact on US foreign direct investment here.

            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_148">First and foremost, I would like to assure the Deputy that Ireland continues to be an attractive location for US inward foreign investment based on a number of well known factors.  Furthermore, Government policy continues to ensure that our strengths are maintained and promoted through, for example, increased spending in education and training and in overall investment in infrastructure under the National Development Plan 2007-2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_149">While I am, of course, mindful of any international developments that could potentially impact on the level of foreign direct investment here, the Deputy will appreciate that the interpretation of specific foreign legislative provisions is a matter for the relevant authorities of the country concerned.  That said, my understanding is that the legislation referred to by the Deputy, which was recently introduced in the US Senate, is aimed at locations considered as secretive offshore tax havens and not countries which are US tax treaty partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_150">In this regard the Deputy will be interested to note that the double taxation treaty between Ireland and the US provides for a full exchange of taxpayer information between both countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_151">Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that, as is the normal case in such matters, a close watch is kept on any such developments.</p>

            <p eId="para_152">Has the Government discussed these impending developments in US legislation with US authorities at any level?  In the course of his recent visit to the United States did the Taoiseach refer to them in his conversations with President Bush or other key political players he met there?</p>
            <p eId="para_153">The Minister has confirmed an awareness of developments in this regard in the United States and will keep a keen eye on them but are strategies to cushion the effect of the development described in my substantive question being considered by the Minister, his Department or Government?  The Minister must agree that it is imperative we recognise the potential impact of such legislation and that we must not be unaware of the reality of the situation as it applies to many US based inward investors operating in this jurisdiction.  In the region of 470 such employing entities exist in this economy with a workforce of approximately 92,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_154">Will the Minister comment on some of the more negative views expressed by economists in periodicals and newspapers here regarding the expected effect of the passage of this legislation?  Do such opinions encourage a proactive approach by Government to the matter to stave off the worst potential impacts of the legislation?</p>
            <p eId="para_155">Does the Minister agree that the passage of this legislation will demonstrate that low corporation tax alone is a poor basis on which to promote this jurisdiction as an attractive location for inward investment from the United States and elsewhere?

            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_158">We have transparent tax arrangements in this country.  We have positive rates of taxation, 44 tax treaties in place, a system of full exchange of information and the proper regulation of activities to the highest standards.  We maintain a low general corporation tax rate by ensuring a wide tax base and the careful, prudent management of public finances.  We collect €6.7 billion per annum in corporation tax.  This tax arises from profits based on activity and substance.  To take the international financial services sector as a specific example, the latest industry figures indicate that more than 19,000 people are employed in the three core sectors of banking, funds and insurance.  Our system is transparent — deliberately — in order that everyone can see the attractions and benefits to the State.  Other countries often have high nominal rates of corporation tax which mask the true lower rate in deductions through deals with individual firms.  The Irish system does not operate in this manner and is transparent.</p>
            <p eId="para_159">Ireland is bound by the same state aid code of conduct and rules of the European Court of Justice as all European Union member states.  The EU treaty contains specific rules on the provision by member states of aid to industry.  The European Union also has a code of conduct, a political agreement designed to curb harmful competition in business taxation, which is similar to the process at OECD level.  Ireland is fully in compliance with the code and the OECD process.  Our track record shows that we act swiftly to amend regimes to close down abuses and if similar circumstances arise in the future, we will do so again.</p>
            <p eId="para_160">Ireland abides by the arm's length principle in these matters.  We expect companies operating here to observe this principle and we have endorsed it in our tax treaties.  As I indicated, there is no question of the legislation to which the Deputy refers having a "dramatic impact on US FDI here" for the reasons I gave in my primary reply because both Bills contain a list of countries drawn from the IRS filings and regarded as tax havens.  Ireland does not appear on either list for the good reasons I have given in my secondary reply.</p>

More than 800,000 members of the 2 million workforce are employed in small and medium size enterprises, the great majority of which are indigenous.  I introduced proposals in the most recent budget to comprehensively overhaul the business expansion and seed capital schemes to ensure investment is directed into areas that will create entrepreneurship and more jobs and increase skills.  The research and development tax credit is applicable to small companies and other businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">Although an important factor and one I will continue to defend, our low tax rate is not the only reason foreign direct investment is attracted here.  The question of what attracts FDI to a particular country is a complex one and a range of factors explain the reason Ireland is attractive.  They include our English speaking, skilled labour force, on which we continue to work and have a strategy to improve, a flexible market, ease of access and proximity to the European mainland, membership of the European Union and access to its markets, membership of the euro area, a pro-business outlook, political stability and social partnership.</p>

        <b>Mr. Bruton</b>
        asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
          if he has assessed the contributions from different sectors to consumer price growth in the past five years; and the implications this has for Government policy.  
        [10196/07]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_81" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_167">My Department assesses data produced by the Central Statistics Office on the contribution from different sectors to price growth.  The CSO rebased in December 2001.  The figures for the years 2002-06 show that consumer price inflation increased by approximately 12.5% over this period.  Of this figure, it is estimated that approximately 10% is due to services sector price inflation, while 2.5% is due to goods inflation.  It is important to note, however, that during this time the economy grew by 22% and 260,000 jobs were created.</p>
            <p eId="para_168">Where it can, the Government is taking action to contain inflation by implementing responsible fiscal policies.  For example, with the exception of an increase in indirect tax on tobacco in the 2007 budget, which was done for health reasons, indirect taxes have not been raised in the past three budgets.  We have also reformed sectors such as the communications and insurance sectors and these are now showing low rates of inflation.  The Government also removed the groceries order and data recently released by the Central Statistics Office show that this is beginning to have a moderating impact on food prices.  I understand that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government specifically requested that to support competitiveness in the economy and protect the interests of communities.  Local authorities should exercise restraint in setting any increases in commercial rates and local charges in the context of their budgets for 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_169">We must also be aware that a number of important factors which influence inflation are outside Government control.  For example, mortgage interest rates are set by the European Central Bank and mortgage interest added in the region of 2% to total CPI.  Equally, energy prices in Ireland are set by independent regulators and reflect international market prices and other factors such as investment costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_170">Goods are generally traded internationally and, as a result, goods inflation is kept low by international competition.  However, services are largely non-tradable and the relatively high rate of services sector inflation is a cause for concern.  The Competition Authority is undertaking a number of detailed studies of how competition is operating in specific sectors of the economy and the Government will pay close attention to the results of these studies.  Areas such as the restaurant, hotel and licensed premises sectors are of particular concern as it is estimated that they contributed approximately 3% to overall inflation in the past five years.  This highlights the need for pay and profit restraint in these sectors to reduce price pressures and we must ensure that the wage increases granted under the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, are reflected in productivity gains.</p>
            <p eId="para_171">In addition to the steps already outlined, the Government is taking a broad approach to dealing with inflation.  We are investing heavily in public infrastructure, which will enhance our ability to produce goods and services more efficiently and, therefore, help keep inflation down on a continuing basis.  The economic conditions fostered by the Government will support the economy's competitiveness and provide the basis for our continued future economic success.</p>

            <p eId="para_172">I ask the Minister to comment on a few important features of inflation in the past five years.  Is he aware that the prices of goods in the shops, once the old reliables of alcohol, fuel and tobacco are removed, have not increased in the past five years, whereas the prices of services priced or regulated by Government have increased by 40%?  I note the Minister indicated that his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has told the local authorities they must get their act together by reducing the burden imposed by commercial rates.  Does he not agree that the first priority for Government in managing prices in its own sector is to get its act together?  Does he accept that manufacturing, which has taken a price cut in the past five years, cannot survive if Government controlled sectors are so far out of line?</p>
            <p eId="para_173">Will the Minister back up his statement that prices for products set by regulators are competitive when compared with prices in other countries?  Gas is 50% more expensive and electricity much dearer than in the United Kingdom.  On what grounds does he base the statement that the regulated prices set by the Minister and the regulators are competitive?</p>

            <p eId="para_174">I do not set prices, they are set by the regulators.  There is an independent regulatory sector.  The specific characteristics of an island market of this size mean that the electricity and gas sectors differ from those of the United Kingdom and other countries.  The Government's long-term strategy is to continue to reposition the economy towards the production of more knowledge intensive goods and services.  As these tend to be less energy intensive, this development should help reduce our exposure to international energy price developments.  The regulator must also take into account investment returns in terms of the nature of the market in which investment is being made.  As I indicated, the size and island nature of our market must be taken into account in terms of the major utilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_175">The impact of higher energy prices on the economy will ultimately be a function of how economic agents, including policymakers, react.  In the past, higher energy prices resulted in higher wage demands and increases in public spending, both of which had a detrimental impact on economic performance.  There is now a greater awareness that we cannot compensate ourselves for these increases.  We are, therefore, coming from a position of insufficient competition in the marketplace in certain areas.  The purpose of independent regulation of the market is to meet EU requirements and facilitate competition.  Interconnection between North and South and east and west should open up possibilities to reduce inflation in these areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_176">Has the Minister examined the statistics provided by the CSO which show that the Government regulated sectors have price increases of two and a half times the rate of the rest of Europe?  These other European countries are experiencing the same oil price increases, interest rate rises and international pressures of competition.  It is only prices regulated here, however, that show these hefty increases.</p>
            <p eId="para_177">The Minister is disavowing any responsibility for this.  Is he not aware that it is Ministers who set prices for rail and bus services, televisions licences, prescribed drugs, health insurance and so on?  Many of the sectors in which the greatest increases have taken place are those where prices are directly set.  Is the Minister not aware that the regulatory framework is set by the Government and that it is his responsibility to cure the deficiencies he has acknowledged in our regulatory framework?</p>

            <p eId="para_178">I am not suggesting there are simply deficiencies in the regulatory framework.  I am saying this is the discipline imposed on the market by the introduction of the independent regulatory framework.  In the past, prices in these areas were regulated by Departments working through the commercial semi-State sector.  All sides in this House long ago agreed that commercialisation of the semi-State sector is a requirement for our continued sustainable competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_179">Services inflation has added some 10% to overall inflation.  It is a wide-ranging concept covering electricity, gas, telecommunications, alcoholic beverages consumed on licensed premises, meals out, housing, rent, mortgage interest repayments, insurance, public transport, entertainment and recreation, education, household services and miscellaneous services including child care, social protection and package holidays.  Where inflation in health and education is running at close to 5% it should be noted that these sectors have relatively small weights in the basket of consumer goods and services and that their impact on overall inflation is relatively low.  Many factors that influence health inflation, such as doctors' and dentists' fees, are outside Government control.</p>
            <p eId="para_180">I said in my reply that the level of service inflation is a cause for concern and that we are working to deal it with as comprehensively as possible, recognising the changed structures of some of these markets and how they operate in Ireland.</p>

        <b>Ms Burton</b>

        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
          his views on the fact that monthly mortgage repayments have increased by approximately €40 to €50 on a €300,000 variable mortgage as a result of the latest quarter point increase by the ECB on 8 March 2007; if he is aware that this is the seventh successive such increase since December 2005, that sub-prime mortgage holders are reported to be spending as much as 25% more a month servicing their mortgages than they did before interest rates started to rise; if he will implement measures to provide clear information for mortgage holders on the effect of projected future interest rate increases on their monthly payments; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that the European Central Bank has indicated the likelihood of further interest rate rises; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  
        [10253/07]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_86" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_182">The level of interest rates is determined by the independent European Central Bank, ECB, in fulfilment of its mandate to secure price stability for the euro area as a whole.  The impact of ECB interest rate changes on household incomes in Ireland is an important element of the context for the Government's overall economic and fiscal strategy.  This strategy has successfully delivered sustained economic growth, record levels of employment, low unemployment and rising incomes.  It is has also underpinned the achievement of a strong and responsible fiscal position within which significant tax and expenditure priorities have been achieved.  It enables us to plan the delivery of a major programme of investment in our economic and social infrastructure under the National Development Plan 2007-2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_183">Households currently experiencing higher mortgage repayments on account of rising interest rates benefit significantly from a range of supportive economic and financial factors, including, for example, low income tax rates and a relatively high savings rate in respect of which savers are increasingly benefiting from higher retail interest rates.  The Finance Act 2007 gives effect to those measures I announced on budget day that are designed to sustain our economic performance and improve both take-home pay and the affordability of housing.  These measures include a doubling in the ceiling for mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers as well as increases in relief for other mortgage holders.</p>
            <p eId="para_184">The sub-prime mortgage market in Ireland is small and exists to serve a need for mortgage finance by borrowers who experience difficulty in accessing finance from mainstream lenders owing to an adverse credit record or difficulties in verifying income.  Sub-prime borrowers tend to refinance their mortgage in the standard mortgage market once they have restored their credit record.  The Consumer Credit Act 1995 requires information on key aspects of mortgage lending to be provided to borrowers on a mandatory basis.  This includes, in particular, information on the impact of an increase of 1% in interest rates in the first year of the mortgage.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">The Financial Regulator's consumer director provides extensive information to help consumers make informed choices regarding mortgage products.  The consumer director's cost surveys, consumer guides and fact sheets assist consumers in shopping around for the best available mortgage deal.  Major efforts have been made to raise the level of awareness of the importance of responsible borrowing behaviour.  Against the backdrop of the rising trend in interest rates, the Financial Regulator has published information for consumers on the potential impact of these increases on different mortgage products.</p>
            <p eId="para_186">Mortgage interest rates in Ireland remain low by historic standards.  This reflects both the current level of ECB rates, which are lower than those prevailing in either the United States or the United Kingdom, and the increasingly competitive nature of the Irish mortgage market which ensures that margins on mortgage lending remain low.  I am confident the economic and fiscal framework now in place is properly aligned to the current requirements of the economy and can adjust to potential changes in the financial environment over time.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_87">
            <from>Ms Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_187">The Minister referred three times today to the additional mortgage interest relief provided in the budget.  Does he agree that the latest increase in mortgage interest rates, the seventh since December 2005, means the impact of the increase in mortgage relief has been fully absorbed for most mortgage holders?  Welcome as the increased relief was, it is now effectively used up.</p>
            <p eId="para_188">Has the Minister heard of the phrase "toxic debt", which is used widely in the United States in reference to the sub-prime market?  It refers to the situation of a family that has borrowed heavily, usually initially for housing purposes, before proceeding to refinance its borrowing, perhaps to take in other short-term borrowings such as car loans and so on.  With continuous increases in the rate of interest, the net result for such families is a growing unaffordability of the debt they have accumulated.</p>
            <p eId="para_189">The Minister referred to the tables published by the Financial Regulator on various mortgage prices and products.  Does he agree these tables are not easily readable for most people?  Many families are exposed on remortgaging and credit card debt, with the latter currently running at some 13%.  What is the Government doing to help people who are moving into the danger zone of toxic debt and who are particularly vulnerable to interest rate increases?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_88" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_190">I do not accept that the increase in mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers has been wiped out by the ECB interest rate rises in recent months.  It depends on the circumstances of the household concerned.  In the case of a mortgage of €250,000 taken out for a typical loan period of 33 years for example, a 0.25% rise in interest rates results in an increased payment of some €38 per month.  This compares with increased monthly tax relief of €53 for a married couple and some €67 for a single person.  For a mortgage of €350,000 over 33 years, a 0.25% increase results in an increased repayment of €53 per month, compared with increased tax relief of €128 in the case of a married couple and €67 for a single person.</p>
            <p eId="para_191">It was estimated at budget time that approximately 125,000 first-time buyers had interest payments of sufficient size to benefit from the increased level of relief.  As interest rates have increased, it is likely that the numbers benefitting have also increased.  I made my decision on this matter in a way that would help buyers and those who already have mortgages without affecting affordability via an increase in house price inflation.  This was against a background of emerging evidence of a softening housing market.  It was the right approach to take in the circumstances that pertained.</p>
            <p eId="para_192">I have heard the term "toxic debt" in regard to sub-prime lending.  It is a feature of the liberalised market in the United States where some companies have got into serious difficulties as a result of the sub-prime lending policies they have pursued.  There is no evidence from the Financial Regulator that a similar situation exists here.  The sub-prime mortgage market is relatively small.  There is evidence that where people have regained credit with regard to how they are viewed as borrowers, they have moved from the sub-prime market back into the mainstream mortgage market.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_89">
            <from>Ms Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_193">I recall that when the Minister introduced the extra mortgage interest relief in the budget in December, he told us it would compensate for the increase in interest costs on a typical mortgage.  Mortgage costs had risen in October and have gone up again since he made that announcement in December, and the bulk, if not all, of the extra interest relief has been absorbed by both interest rate increases.  Will the Minister comment on that?  Has he excluded the October increases from the effect on an average family?  He seems to be playing with the statistics.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_90" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_194">I am not playing with statistics, just dealing with the Deputy's assertions.  The decision taken brought a direct benefit to people involved in the mortgage market, not just to prospective buyers but to those already in the mortgage market for the previous seven years, totalling 125,000 first-time buyers.  In this way, the greatest possible benefit could be given to the greatest number of people requiring assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_195">The Deputy knows interest rate policy is the independent ambit of the ECB.  We have seen a number of increases of 0.25% over the past 12 to 18 months.  Further increases are not expected, but one cannot anticipate what the ECB may do.  It must be acknowledged that we are operating in a historically low mortgage interest environment against a background of greater disposable income and higher income growth.  The fact that there are so few defaults on mortgage commitments, albeit against a higher interest rate environment in recent times — while the overall interest rate is low, there have been increases — indicates people have been able to meet their commitments.</p>
            <p eId="para_196">The Deputy referred to those in the sub-prime market.  There is evidence they have moved into the mainstream mortgage market because of the improved economic situation, which, thankfully has been open to them as well as to others.</p>

          the amount collected to date by the Revenue Commissioners through special investigations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  
        [10230/07]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_91" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_198">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that to the end of February 2007 they have recovered €2.297 billion from 31,950 taxpayers as a result of their programme of special investigations.  The three major legacy investigations relating to bogus non-resident accounts, offshore accounts and single premium insurance products, account for the bulk of the amount recovered.  The balance is accounted for by recoveries related to the Ansbacher investigation, the NIB-CMI scheme and tribunal related enquiries.</p>
            <p eId="para_199">All Revenue's special investigations are now at an advanced stage and some are nearing an end.  The follow-up phase of the bogus non-resident investigation is almost complete and the follow-up phases of the offshore and single premium insurance products investigations are well under way.  The inquiry letter phase of the offshore investigation, which follows up those who did not make voluntary disclosures, started in 2006 and is expected to continue into 2008.  The inquiry letter phase of the single premium investigation, which similarly follows up those who did not make voluntary disclosures, is scheduled to start at the end of this month and will involve the issue of approximately 5,000 inquiry letters initially.</p>
            <p eId="para_200">Tax, interest and penalties continue to be collected as the investigations progress and this will be the position for some time to come.</p>
            <p eId="para_201">The Revenue Commissioners inform me that these investigations have been very successful, not just in recovering outstanding taxes but in improving tax compliance in general in this country.  The overall approach has been very effective and in some cases is being adopted by other revenue administrations.  The powers of access, through the High Court, to financial information and, in particular, the powers provided in the Finance Act 1999 have proved to be of vital importance enabling Revenue to identify taxpayers with undeclared liabilities who did not come forward during the voluntary phases of the investigations.</p>

            <p eId="para_202">I thank the Minister for his response.  Following these successes of the Revenue Commissioners, does he agree that the statement of the former Minister, Mr. McCreevy, that there were no pots of gold with regard to unpaid taxes, was untrue?  There was always a special situation for particular people who were not subject to the same tax regime as the PAYE sector.  I congratulate the Revenue Commissioners on pursuing the issue of unpaid taxes.</p>
            <p eId="para_203">How many court orders or court cases have the Revenue Commissioners taken to gain access to financial information to help them pursue these cases?  Are the Revenue Commissioners able to pursue the issue of credit card accounts held offshore that allow some individuals to pay for off-shore purchases?  How many cases have raised issues relating to inheritance tax arising as a result of the pursuit of various tax avoidance or evasion schemes?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_93" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_204">I do not have the details on inheritance tax or credit card issues in this regard as that information is not available to me.  I will find out whether the information is available.  These issues arise as a result of non-compliance by taxpayers, whether PAYE or non-PAYE taxpayers, in respect of undeclared income that may have been moved offshore, used in single premium policies, resulted from bogus non-resident accounts, the result of deposit interest retention tax audits or arise from other issues that come up in tribunals or as a result of NIB or Ansbacher issues.  These cases are being pursued on the basis of non-compliance.  Some 31,950 taxpayers are involved out of a total of 2 million taxpayers.  Of course, even one is one too many.</p>
            <p eId="para_205">The recent annual report of the Revenue Commissioners stated that the level of tax arrears is about 2%, which in international taxation terms is a good indication of a far more compliant culture being in place than may have been the case in the past on account of non-compliance by individual taxpayers or the failure of the system to be sufficiently efficient or timely in ensuring it dealt with issues as they arose.</p>
            <p eId="para_206">On the question of the process of obtaining High Court orders to access financial information to support investigations, I am advised that in the case of the bogus non-resident account investigation 18 High Court orders were granted and no further applications for High Court orders are anticipated as the investigation is almost finished.  In the case of the offshore accounts investigation and the single premium insurance products, 21 High Court orders were sought and granted.  It is expected a further eight applications may be required.</p>

            <p eId="para_207">Does the Minister have figures available as to the sums recovered as a result of special investigations by the Revenue Commissioners in 2006 into the construction industry?  With regard to the Minister's role in asking the Revenue Commissioners to undertake particular special investigations, section 881 of the Taxes Consolidation Act makes it a crime to evade taxes knowingly and this has a retrospective application.  The Minister recently closed a number of loopholes with regard to stamp duties, one relating to the use of shelf companies and another relating to setting up third parties in the sale of properties.  Is it not in order that special investigations should be taken into these areas to see how much was lost to the State by allowing these evasion measures to take place?</p>

            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_208">I an not so sure whether they were evasion or avoidance schemes.  As the Deputy knows, avoidance schemes are not subject to recovery, but evasion is illegal and is subject to recovery in any circumstances and in any area of taxation.  These matters are proceeded upon by the Revenue Commissioners.  With regard to any issues they have sought to pursue, I have facilitated them either by way of legislation or administrative arrangement.</p>
            <p eId="para_209">I do not have details of recently commenced inquiries into the construction industry which commenced during the course of 2006.  Of the special investigations mentioned DIRT audits yielded €225 million, bogus non-resident accounts €627.2 million, off-shore assets €856.2 million, single premium policies €422 million, Ansbacher €68.4 million, NIB-Clerical Medical Insurance €59 million and tribunals €39.4 million giving a total of €2,297.1 million to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_217">While the promotion of renewable energy, including bio-fuels, is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the taxation system, in conjunction with other policy measures, can play a part in attaining environmental objectives including the development and deployment of renewable sources of energy, including bio-fuels.  In this regard the taxation measures which are already in place or are being introduced include a five year excise relief scheme for bio-fuels, costing over €200 million, which commenced in November 2006.  The scheme provides for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of bio-fuels per annum; 50% vehicle registration tax relief for hybrid vehicles, flexible fuel vehicles and electric vehicles; extending the qualifying period from 31 December 2006 to 31 December 2011 for the scheme of corporate tax relief for corporate equity investments in certain renewable energy generation projects such as solar, wind, hydro or biomass technology categories, which have been approved by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources; and extending to 31 December 2013 and enhancing the business expansion and seed capital schemes which can, among other manufacturing areas, be used for investment in companies engaged in renewable energy generation and recycling.</p>
            <p eId="para_218">In addition, I announced in the budget the commencement of a public consultation process on adjusting VRT to take greater account of CO2 emissions of vehicles.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has undertaken a similar exercise.  Any changes will have effect from a target date of 1 January 2008.  My Department will also examine, in the context of the preparations for budget 2008, the case for disallowing, totally or in part, capital allowances and leasing expenses for high CO2 emission vehicles.  Consultations will take place with the motor industry and the business sector as part of any review.</p>
            <p eId="para_219">The overall level of excise relief available for bio-fuels under this scheme is that which the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources proposed in advance of budget 2006.  It is regarded as a level which is sufficient to match Ireland's output potential for renewable energy crops for motor fuels over the coming years.  These fiscal incentives were designed to kickstart the domestic bio-fuels industry and the evidence suggests that this is happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_220">The Deputy might also wish to note there are additional non-fiscal measures that can be used to promote renewable energy, including bio-fuels, and reach the targets identified.  In this regard to provide further market certainty and encourage projects of scale, the Government recently announced its intention to move to a bio-fuels obligation by 2009, with targets for market penetration for bio-fuels of 5.75% in 2009 and 10% by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_221">The Government will examine other tax incentives or disincentives where these can be shown to have a clear cost-benefit in reducing CO2 emissions.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_235">This Government has spoken many times in the past ten years about the delivery of a world-class health service.  It was the Government's number one commitment before the last election and has turned out to be the number one hoax from Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  This has been the case for ten years, billions of euro have been spent by three Ministers for Health and Children, and the service is absolutely appalling in some circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">At Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda the midwife staffing levels are far below what they should be.  Mr. Patrick Kinder, the head of the maternity task force there, said this showed the extent of serious risk to women in the north east who are forced to rely on the services of this hospital.  Women attending the maternity unit there must wait until the fifth month or 20th week of pregnancy before seeing an obstetrician.  No expectant mother, particularly a young mother with a first pregnancy, should be forced to wait 20 weeks to see an obstetrician when she should have that appointment within 12 to 14 weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">That level of "world-class service" is not unique to Drogheda.  I received an e-mail from a woman in my county about her experience in Mayo General Hospital in February.  She spent three days on a trolley in the accident and emergency unit.  To judge from what she told me, her experience was not an isolated incident.  Despite the efforts of the fantastic staff to whom she refers, she said the overcrowding was reminiscent of a Third World service and not what should be expected in modern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">She wrote an eyewitness account on her trolley according to which on Sunday, 25 February she had no pillow and her blanket had a blood-type stain.  There was no ladies toilet available, only the gents was working.  There was no visible security.  On Monday, 26 February a lady with pleurisy was placed opposite an entrance-exit door which opened onto the casualty waiting area.  At times one could hear the wind whistling through.  There was no place to have a shower.  Trolleys blocked areas which bore a sign stating "keep clear at all times".</p>
          <p eId="para_239">On Tuesday, 27 February the toilets were absolutely filthy.  She said she could not begin to describe the nauseating stench.  The patients' trolleys were taken and they were given chairs.  When they asked why they were told the trolleys were needed for the day care patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">That is the lady's summary of the world class health service the Government promised to deliver: more than 30 on trolleys, with no privacy, washing facilities, hot food or visible security.  As an elderly woman was escorted down the public corridor her nappy fell off.  What does the Taoiseach say to the people who must put up with this standard of care?  What does the Taoiseach say to expectant mothers who must wait 20 weeks to see an obstetrician?  Is that what the Taoiseach meant when he said his Government, comprising members from Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, including the absent Minister for Health and Children, would deliver a world-class health service to the people?</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_111">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_242">On the general question about a world-class health service, we have made real progress in the health service.  We have over 100,000 dedicated professionals treating over 1 million patients in our public hospitals alone.  There are 38,000 new staff, including 2,700 medical dental personnel and 9,000 nurses.  Some 8,700 specialists were recruited in the past ten years and almost 1,000 consultant posts were created.  Since I became Taoiseach, the numbers on hospital waiting lists have more than halved.  In the past year, accident and emergency waiting lists have almost halved and, because of good practice and resources, 60% of hospitals have nobody at all waiting in accident and emergency units for more than six hours.  The Irish taxpayer is funding the increase in spending from €4 billion to €15 billion, as Deputy Kenny correctly stated.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">It is hard for Deputy Kenny to analyse the system on the basis of one letter and I could quote letters written by very satisfied people.  I take the Deputy at his word regarding the letter he quoted, notwithstanding all the great staff.  The letter stated nobody was cleaning or looking after the toilets, food or anything.  The Deputy will be aware that there are several hundred staff in the hospital in question, employed at a cost of tens of millions of euro.  Perhaps the day referred to was a bad day and the staff were elsewhere.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_246">However, the Deputy cannot assert that all those things are true while acknowledging all the staff are great.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">On the antenatal outpatient clinic at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, the HSE has confirmed that, because of the increased number of births therein, it has been very hard pressed to get the waiting list in line.  There is no doubt that this is a real problem and I will not defend the fact that people are waiting for 20 weeks, if they are doing so.  The HSE said it has a problem related to people having to wait a number of weeks for a routine appointment and this is certainly not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">Management at the hospital already said it is trying to address these issues and that it has recently approved 22 new midwife posts, two specialist nurse posts and three new consultant anaesthetist posts with a view to improving its services.  It has also confirmed that a new 25-bay emergency department is being developed at the hospital and it is to be opened early next year.  Two new floors are also being built above the emergency department to provide more space.  Obviously these are needed and the resources have been provided therein.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">We are spending almost €500 million on the capital programme this year, as we have done in the past few years.  Ireland and Norway are on top of the list of countries investing money in the capital programmes pertaining to their health systems.  Obviously our system needs this investment and there is no doubt about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">I have answered the Deputy's question on accident and emergency figures.  The accident and emergency figures continue to be well over 50% down, as they have been the whole winter.  We are now in what we consider the 24th week of the winter and there was one difficult week in which reductions of over 50% were not achieved.  Even Deputy Kenny, from his position, will have to acknowledge this represents a big improvement in a year.  It is still not good enough and that is why we are investing the resources I have outlined.  I hope a big improvement will be made over the next year when all the facilities come on line.  The Government continues to put in place the resources and staff and continues to make the necessary improvements and seek reform.  This is the correct approach.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_115">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_251">The Taoiseach is probably correct in that he is on the run-in to being run out of office.  When he visits hospitals, does he take the time to go down the corridors?  We do not live in fantasy-land any more.  Mr. Patrick Kinder, chairman of the taskforce dealing with Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, does not live in fantasy-land and said the women of the north east are exposed to serious risk because they cannot see an obstetrician for 20 weeks once pregnant.  That is a scandal.  The lady who wrote to me from her trolley in Mayo General Hospital is not fantasising either.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">In the past fortnight, I have been in St. Vincent's, Cavan, Mayo General, Galway Regional, Nenagh and Limerick hospitals, and in a number of others.  In every one, people who built this nation are lying on hospital beds and trolleys with their medical problems exposed for all to see.  A general practitioner in Kildare stated recently that 35 weeks elapsed between a screening test and a hysterectomy and that, in his opinion as a physician, the woman in question was essentially killed as a result.  In Tralee Hospital last week, the consultants told me quite clearly that people are dying because of the endless waiting list for scope analysis and endoscopies.  This is simply not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">I agree that when people get through the system and are treated in hospital, their care can be fabulous, but it is a scandal that the Government has, for ten years, failed to manage competently the accident and emergency system, thus causing all these problems.</p>

          <p eId="para_255">The general practitioner in Kildare is not fantasising, nor is the consultant in Tralee.  It is not just a case of spending money on the system, but of reform, change and competent management, together with performance audits.  These have not occurred under the Taoiseach's Government and that is why every Deputy in the House is getting endless streams of letters about the appalling circumstances that obtain daily in our hospitals.  Is this the kind of world-class health system the Taoiseach and his absent Minister for Health and Children said they would deliver to the people?</p>

          <p eId="para_260">I understand the agenda of the Deputy, who has visited all the hospitals in question.  We are tracking each other in that I have been to most of them also.  I have heard the negative comments but have also heard an endless number of positive ones.  People who have been in for major cardiac surgery, heart and lung transplants, maternity care or other kinds of treatments, including people who believed they were on death's door, have said they were treated well.  It is true that I have encountered problems and seen old buildings that in my non-professional view are past their sell-by dates and can never be addressed and that is why we are investing the resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">There are 140,000 positions, including 100,000 full-time equivalents.  There has been a great increase in the number of doctors, and the number of consultants has doubled.  There are thousands of extra nurses and an additional €11 billion or €12 billion has been spent in a short period.  Spending compares well <i>pro rata</i> against that of other countries and problems are being addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">I agree with Deputy Kenny that there are problem areas; there is no doubt about this.  If the consultant in Tralee could use his influence to complete the consultants' contract, it would help to deal with some of the endoscopies.  If he could put a word in with his union, in addition to talking to the Deputy and me, it would also help.  The Deputy is correct that certain reforms are required.  We are trying to make these reforms in the ongoing negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">If, in any area of life, one goes around the country looking for problem cases, one may find them, but one must acknowledge that, according to independent surveys, the vast majority of the 1 million patients in our public hospitals last year were happy with the service.  There are problems in accident and emergency wards, that is why we are building so many new units, why we are putting so many extra services into accident and emergency wards, why we are setting up primary care teams and injury clinics, why we have emergency consultants working in accident and emergency and why we have increased the staff in accident and emergency.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Many of the buildings are just not suitable for the necessary developments but there are construction programmes in every area.  In Drogheda, there is an ambitious plan for the whole north east.  The Teamwork Management Services report spelled out what is needed in that area.  I admit the report points out that the present system, whereby five local hospitals in the north east deliver acute care and services for people with severe illnesses to a relatively small population, has exposed patients to increased risks and this must change.</p>

We are not world class in every area, we know that, but we continue to resource the health service and make our services top class in many areas.  We should acknowledge that.</p>

          <p eId="para_270">The Government has decided to give private developers a write off for the construction costs of private hospitals on the grounds of public hospitals.  On 28 February, I asked the Taoiseach if it was the Government's intention to proceed with the signing of contracts to implement that scheme between now and the general election.  The Taoiseach told me, "I am not aware of any contract.  The Deputy can table a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health and Children.  I am aware of no contract at any stage of negotiation."</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The following day, as it happened, the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children and the chief executive of the HSE were before the Committee of Public Accounts.  My colleague, Deputy Burton, asked a similar question, to which the Secretary General replied: "I understand the procurement process will proceed along a timeline which means contracts could be or would be expected to be, whatever phrase the Deputy wants to use, awarded some time in April, that is the latest information I have."</p>
          <p eId="para_272">The Taoiseach would have us believe he knows nothing about this, the Secretary General says it will go ahead in April and the Minister for Health and Children goes on the radio this morning to say it is nothing to do with her, the HSE will sign any contracts.  The Labour Party's desire to maintain an improved public health service is ideological, she says, a concept entirely alien to her and her party leader.  She then said that it is not a sale anyway, it is a lease.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">As luck would have it, at that meeting of the PAC, Professor Drumm was asked, "Is it a lease or is it a sale?"  This is the man who is supposed to be handling the process.  Professor Drumm said, "While I understand it is a sale, I must check."  I do not believe for a second that Professor Drumm does not know the answer.  I believe that like 85% of consultants in Ireland, he does not agree with what the Government is forcing on him.  The Chairman, Deputy Noonan, reminded the Secretary General what he had been asked.  He said: "Specifically, the Deputy asked whether contracts will be signed for the disposal of HSE land to the private sector between now and the general election."  Mr. Scanlan replied, "My understanding is that the answer is "Yes" as that is the timeline being worked to."</p>
          <p eId="para_274">How is it, with all the running around the Taoiseach is doing, as Head of the Government he has never heard of any of these contracts?  Is this a lease or a sale?  Will they be signed in advance of the general election and what is the estimate of the cost to the taxpayer of so doing?</p>

          <p eId="para_275">I refer to the last day when we debated this issue when I said to Deputy Rabbitte that I did not know of any contract negotiations and that he should table a question.  He obviously did the right thing the following day and asked the people directly involved.  The Minister for Health and Children has answered since and answered again today in an interview.  The Deputy knows the answer to the question because she answered it a few hours ago and he was obviously listening or read the text of the answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">I also explained that day the general policy of the Government and the decisions we had made two years ago in the summer of 2005 regarding the issue.  As I understand it, eight hospitals remain in the process: Limerick Regional Hospital, Waterford Regional Hospital, Cork University Hospital, St. James's Hospital, Beaumont Hospital, James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown, Tallaght Hospital and Sligo General Hospital.  The examinations are under way to see if there are contracts done in these areas.  As the Minister said today, she does not know at this stage whether they will take a period of weeks or months because negotiations are ongoing and the HSE will issue the invitation to tender to the selected bidders at the end of this week or early next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">The HSE aims to evaluate the tenders and select the successful bidders over the period it requires to examine this.  The Minister said today that some of those could be in April and that the final contract would be subject to planning approval.  The system is to try to free an additional 1,000 beds for public patients that are currently being used for private cases.  That has been our stated policy for the last number of years and those negotiations are continuing.</p>

          <p eId="para_278">Once again the Taoiseach has not answered any of the questions I asked.  He said he does not know.  Quite honestly, I do not believe that for a second.  None of the Taoiseach's predecessors could come into this House and get away with the way the Taoiseach twists and obfuscates.  Is the Taoiseach seriously telling me that the Government is maintaining this shift towards a for-profit system of medicine and he, the socialist Taoiseach, knows nothing about it?  I do not believe that for a second.  I ask again — is it a lease or a sale?  Will the contracts be signed?  The Minister for Health and Children said nothing about not knowing if it would be weeks or months today.  The Taoiseach is right, I listened to the interview and she did not say that.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">I am asking the Taoiseach if this is a lease or a sale and what the cost is to the taxpayer.  Is the story at the weekend by the eminent political correspondent of <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> true, that the tender process will conclude by 30 March and sites will be “awarded”, to use his term, by 16 April?  Is that the position?  Will sites be awarded?  How can the Taoiseach claim not to know the answers to something as major as this, on the biggest priority confronting our people, namely the state of the health services?  I give him another opportunity to indicate whether contracts will be signed or are we engaging in some kind of Aer Lingus ruse about letters of intent that will prove to be irrevocable some months from now?  This House is entitled to know the answers to those questions and the Taoiseach has been evading, obfuscating, twisting and distorting, ducking and diving.  What is the answer to the question?</p>

I also noted on that occasion that he indicated he would give no guarantee to this House that he would not sign contracts for same prior to the dissolution of the current Dáil.  Can the Taoiseach explain to the House his notion of socialism when he states that he cannot accept the presence of private beds in public hospitals but he has no problem in accepting private hospitals co-locating on public hospital sites?  That is ridiculous.  Will the Taoiseach not accept that is the case?  Will he not accept also that while his response to Deputy Rabbitte's point is very weak, a full four weeks prior to the set of responses we are both now quizzing him on further, in response to a parliamentary question from myself, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, indicated on 31 January exactly what was taking place regarding the eight sites mentioned?

It does not hold much weight that the Taoiseach could not have known of such an important intent on the part of a key Minister and Ministry within his Cabinet and Government.  How can the Taoiseach reconcile such a proposal?  Why, even at this point, can he not give an assurance not to commit the State and future Government to a set of contracts, one or more depending on whatever number of the eight designated sites will move towards that within the coming weeks?  Does the Taoiseach not believe it is wrong of him and his Government to commit this State and future Government to contracts that he, this Government, the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive cannot currently deliver, and with a general election pending?  That is not acting in the public interest, apart from the fundamental flaw in the very notion of co-location and the reality of closing the potential to develop public hospitals on public sites into the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_339">I think the Deputy is confused on the issue.  The policy of co-location was enunciated in July 2005.  There is no confusion about the policy.  The question I was asked on 28 February was about the contracts.  I am not involved in the detail of the contracts.  I do not involve myself with any of the agencies about the stage of contract and negotiation they are in.  I have no knowledge today, nor had I then, of the stage the contracts are at.  The contracts are being dealt with by the negotiators in the HSE and I do not know whether they will be finished this week, next week or in six months' time.  They have told me they will issue an invitation to tender to selected bidders at the end of this week or early next week.  That will be in March.  Where they go from there will be a matter for their negotiations but the Minister for Health and Children said today she expected some of those would be finished at the end of April.  The overall issue on co-location is to achieve one central purpose, namely, to improve the services for all patients, particularly public patients at public hospital campuses.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">For many years, which I do not think people quite understand, we have had 2,500 private beds in public hospitals ring-fenced for privately insured patients.  In addition many public beds have been used for private patients.  We have excessive use of the public hospital beds for private fee earning by consultants.  That has been the system for decades.  This system has reached its limits and it simply must change.  Since we enunciated the policy in summer 2005 we have said we want all the beds in public hospitals to treat all patients and we have moved on the first 1,000 of those.  We will free up many of these beds by inviting the private sector to invest in new hospital facilities in a planned way and a way that integrates services in public hospital sites and protects the public interest.  We believe this is an innovative way.  We are not saying it is the first place in the world to do it because many others have done it.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">We believe it is a good solution under a number of headings.  In value for money, it will achieve new public beds at less than half the cost of direct construction of equivalent beds.  That seems like a good idea to us.  As we know from our own experience it takes years on end to try to get a public hospital from the time it starts to the time it is constructed, commissioned and staffed.  By doing this we could get 1,000 public beds in operation far more quickly.  The best commercial terms will be paid to the State for leasing the land.  Nothing will be given away.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">The second position is the speed of building.  The private sector has a track record of building quickly.  I have been criticised several times on Leaders' Questions as to why we can build in the private sector but cannot do it in the public sector.  It is true.  We have all the procurement and other arrangements, but we cannot do it as fast.  That is a second good reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">The third reason is that it is a new source of investment in health.  The new private-sector investment will complement our public health capital programme, which is already the highest in the world as a proportion of national income.  With billions of euro being invested in international property every year there is nothing wrong with channelling private investment into health.  The next reason is that it gives equity for all patients.  All admissions to a public hospital will be on the basis of medical need and all beds will be routinely available for public patients.  As well as availability of new services the public sector will be able to purchase services from private providers at discounted prices.  We believe all of those are good ideas, which will dramatically assist the public patient.  That is the reason we are pressing ahead with this.</p>

          <p eId="para_353">I do not really understand the Deputy's argument, but I will give him my answer having listened carefully to him.  He asked me on what basis do we judge it.  We base it first on international experience where Sweden, Germany, France, Spain, UK, Australia and others operate this system.  In the past few years we have successfully brought into our health service, for both public and private, 7,500 nursing home beds, which we otherwise would not have, by having private investment in the service.  We would be in a very difficult position if we did not have that today.  I base it on the view of already having so many private hospitals in the State that operate very effectively.  Many of them have being doing it for many years.  I base it on the operation of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which we only introduced a few years ago and which is catering for 50,000 public patients who are getting the benefit of a private service.  All of those provide good enough evidence for me.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">This is where I do not understand the Deputy's argument.  He claims that consultants tell him this will not work because they do not see it as providing equity.  I suppose a consultant receiving the income from beds in a public hospital that are designated and ring-fenced as private would hold that view.  I understand the argument from the Deputy's point of view — to protect the consultants in that position.  I have nothing against the consultants.</p>

          <p eId="para_408">It was at your initiative, as I understand it, as a result of the antics of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  We now have, in the area of health, a position where major changes are being proposed to a Bill on Report Stage, yet it is being guillotined tonight.  We are opposed to such antics by the Minister for Health and Children where amendments are coming forward which we would like to support in regard to the Freedom of Information Act and in regard to protection of whisteblowers, but we are not being given the chance to scrutinise them properly and to do our job to protect the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Extraordinarily, an item relating to the right to get married in one's own home has been tagged on to the Health Bill, the purpose of which is to set up HIQA.  The only reason it is being tagged on is that the Government took that right away in 2004 when it introduced new legislation.  This is not the way to produce legislation that is robust and serves a public interest.  We are opposed to the guillotining of this Bill and urge the Government to understand the importance of the work of this House.  We have just listened to the Taoiseach tell us fairytales.  We are in a position where we are preparing to guillotine legislation even though we have not had a chance to ensure that legislation is constitutional and will deliver what it promises.  We are opposed to guillotining the Health Bill 2006.</p>

          <p eId="para_526">Next week is an important and critical date in respect of the St. Andrews Agreement and the Good Friday Agreement.  I understand the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain is to make a statement in respect of some further allocations of funding to deal with the implications of the setting up of the Assembly.  Is it envisaged that the Government, even possibly at the weekend, might be inclined to issue a statement in respect of some of these major developments, be it the North-South interconnector, the road to Derry, the Erne canal or whatever, further than the commitments already made by the Minister for Finance?  I share the Taoiseach's view on the restoration of the Assembly and support the Government's activities in that regard.  I hope the parties involved will ensure that happens.  Is it intended to issue a further statement in that regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_527">Deputy Bruton and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, referred to the legislation covering the tax code, especially in regard to stamp duty.  Does the Taoiseach intend to introduce any reforms in that regard?</p>

On the first issue, ongoing discussions are taking place between ourselves and the Chancellor of the Exchequer on how to deal with these matters.  Whatever we do will probably have to be resolved within the next 24 hours or so.  As the Deputy is aware, the meetings are scheduled for Friday and Saturday morning and we are trying to come to a conclusion on this matter.  Whether more resources will be required, we have already completed Derry Airport and a number of issues were addressed in the national plan.  All the parties have requested that we try to move further and these issues are being discussed.</p>

However, if Committee and Report Stage amendments are required to a Bill that we have only just received, we will be incapable of addressing any issues that arise during the debate, since we will hardly have started.

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_561">That, pursuant to Standing Order 170, Standing Order 125 is modified to permit an instruction to the Committee to which the Health Bill 2006 may be recommitted in respect of certain amendments, for which it has power to make provision in the Bill in relation—</p>

          <p eId="para_570">I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the House for allowing a debate on those issues, which are to be dealt with in the Health Bill 2006.  I had intended to introduce the amendments regarding the first two issues on Committee Stage but was advised that they were outside the Bill's scope.  The third issue, which relates to the Civil Registration Act 2004, is a technical amendment.  However, it has serious implications for a very small number of people and must be dealt with urgently, as I will outline shortly.  It is therefore necessary to take the opportunity offered by this Bill to introduce that amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">I propose to amend the Health Bill to insert section 101 to introduce legislation to provide for protected disclosure in the health sector.  The section inserts into the Health Act 2004 a new Part that makes provision regarding the protected disclosure of information.  The term "protected disclosure" means that where a person makes a disclosure in good faith in accordance with the provisions of the legislation, that person is protected from civil liability.  If the person is an employee in an organisation providing a health service, he or she is protected from victimisation by employers where making a disclosure in good faith in accordance with the provisions of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">In addition, any person who makes a report to a professional regulatory body can benefit from those provisions.  However, to ensure that the provisions are not abused, the protections do not apply where the person making the disclosures does so knowing that the disclosure is false or misleading or where he or she made the disclosure recklessly without regard to whether it was false or misleading, frivolous or vexatious.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">The legislation requires the Health Service Executive and certain health corporate bodies to establish procedures so that employees can report matters of concern where patients may be put at risk, there is waste of public funds, or legal obligations are not being met.  In the case of the Health Service Executive, I am amending the 2004 Act to provide that the procedures be included in the HSE's code of governance, which of course must be approved by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The HSE's procedures apply to service providers and any other person receiving assistance from it under section 39 of the 2004 Act or section 10 of the Child Care Act 1991.  However, a service provider may, subject to the agreement of the HSE, establish its own procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">The procedures must provide for the appointment of an authorised person to whom employees can make reports.  The authorised person must investigate the report and may refer the matter to one of the regulatory bodies listed in Schedule 2A or to a profession's regulatory body or, if he or she is of the view that a criminal offence has been committed, to the gardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">The provisions also allow for the continuation of investigations by the authorised person or another person appointed by the person in charge of the body where matters have been referred to the regulatory or professional bodies or the gardaí.  That is to enable the relevant body to deal with any disciplinary matters that may arise from the disclosure.  The employees of relevant bodies must use the established procedures if they wish to obtain protection under the legislation.  Relevant bodies are defined under the Bill as the Health Service Executive; a service provider; any other person receiving assistance in accordance with section 39 or section 10 of the Child Care Act 1991; or a body established under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">The scheme also provides that the protections and sanctions apply to employees of private nursing homes who report matters to the Chief Inspector of Social Services and employees of private psychiatric hospitals who report matters to the Inspector of Mental Health Services.  Any person who reports a matter to a professional regulatory body is also protected from civil liability under these provisions.  The professional regulatory bodies are defined in the Bill as An Bord Altranais, the Dental Council, the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, the Medical Council, or the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">If that person is an employee he or she is protected under section 551 from victimisation, whether he or she is working in a public sector or a purely private sector operation, as the definition of employee is sufficiently broad to cover both sectors.  It should be noted that the definition of employee also covers those placed for the purpose of vocational training and those who work for agencies providing staff for health service providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">In addition, where a person makes a disclosure to an authorised person of the Health Information and Quality Authority, or the chief inspector of social services, or the inspector of mental health services in the course of the performance of their functions, such disclosures, subject to the conditions set out in the legislation, are deemed protected disclosures.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">Section 55A sets out the definitions for this Part.  Sections 55B, 55C, 55D, 55E, 55F and 55G set out the circumstances in which a disclosure may be considered a protected disclosure, which I have already outlined.  Section 55H obliges the executive and certain other relevant bodies to establish procedures to deal with protected disclosures.  Section 55I sets out that it is a condition for those providing a service on behalf of the executive, or receiving assistance from the executive, to adhere to the executive's procedures or to the procedures they establish with the agreement of the executive.  Section 55J sets out the obligations of relevant bodies in dealing with protected disclosures.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Section 55K stipulates that employees of relevant bodies may only make disclosures and attract the protections under this legislation if they comply with the established procedures, or if they are making a report to a professional regulatory body or to an authorised person of the Health Information and Quality Authority, or the chief inspector or mental health services inspector.  However, this section provides that an employee of a relevant body may make a disclosure directly to one of the regulatory bodies listed in Schedule 2A if: the employee has reasonable grounds to believe that the immediate reference to that body is justified by reason of the urgency of the matter to which the disclosure relates; or the employee has reasonable grounds to believe that there has been no investigation of the matter; or if an investigation has taken place that there has been no action or recommended action on the matter to which the disclosure relates.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">Section 55L provides for protection from civil liability of any person making a protected disclosure.  Section 55M sets out the provisions for the protection of employees from victimisation for making protected disclosures and the procedures for seeking a remedy from a rights commissioner or the Labour Court where an employee alleges that they are being victimised for making a disclosure.  Section 55N deals with matters concerning the proceedings of the Labour Court in respect of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">Section 55O deals with the enforcement of Labour Court decisions.  In particular, it provides that if an employer fails to carry out a determination of the court, an application can be made to the Circuit Court and the Circuit Court can apply interest penalties in addition to the amount of compensation decided by the Labour Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">Section 55P is a technical provision regarding evidence and attendance at a hearing of the Labour Court.  Section 55Q sets out in more detail what the term penalisation means.  Section 55R is a technical provision ensuring that a change of ownership of a business does not frustrate the provisions of the legislation.  Section 55S makes it an offence to make false reports and provides for the prosecution of such offences.  Section 55T provides that the legislation will not affect the Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998.  That Act provides protection from victimisation and civil liability for persons reporting the abuse of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">The introduction of protected disclosure provisions in the health sector will result in greater public confidence in the safety and quality of our health care and social services.  We need to promote a culture of openness in the health service where health service employees are encouraged to raise any concerns in regard to the safety and welfare of patients.  The provisions we will look at today will improve the level of protection provided to employees in the health service who raise such concerns in good faith.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">The provisions also ensure consistency of approach throughout the health service in regard to procedures for the protected disclosure of information by employees.  Moreover, the provisions will support the existing statutory frameworks governing health professionals and those proposed in the Medical Practitioners and Pharmacy Bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">I will now deal with the amendment of the Third Schedule of the Freedom of Information Act 1997.  The Bill provides for the application of freedom of information legislation to the Health Information and Quality Authority.  All its records will come within the scope of that Act and the public will have rights of access as defined within the Freedom of Information Act.  The provisions of the Bill, as published, also ensure clarity regarding the transfer of records and the preservation of rights concerning existing records and current staff of the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board and the social services inspectorate.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">I take the opportunity presented by this legislation to update the Third Schedule of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 with regard to non-disclosure clauses within other health legislation.  Certain health legislation provides for confidentiality provisions which, if they are not listed in the Third Schedule of the Freedom of Information Act, mean that they take precedence over that Act.  I am therefore including a range of Acts and regulations in the Third Schedule.  I am also providing that where legislation to establish statutory bodies places an explicit duty of confidentiality on staff and others, that legislation will be included in the Third Schedule of the Freedom of Information Act.  This is to remove any doubt as to the application of the Act to these bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The list proposed in the amendment arises from the most recent review of health legislation by my Department, which has identified a number of confidentiality clauses not listed in the Third Schedule and which should be so listed to remove any doubt as to the application of freedom of information rights of access.  Most are staff confidentiality clauses within legislation to establish new bodies.  Others arise from the transposition of EU directives that require confidentiality in the acquisition of commercially sensitive information.  These changes stem from a formal review under section 32 of the FOI Act.  They reflect the recommendations of the information commissioner and the report of my Department to the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The first part of the amendment concerns primary legislation.  The amendment lists the staff confidentiality clauses within the legislation establishing the Health Insurance Authority, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, and the Office of Tobacco Control.  The amendment also ensures that the strict confidentiality of the work of the health repayments scheme appeals office does not prohibit the consideration of FOI access in appropriate circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">The second part of the Schedule relates to secondary legislation.  The amendment lists the staff confidentiality clauses within the statutory instruments establishing the following: the Crisis Pregnancy Agency; the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery, the Health Research Board, the National Haemophilia Council, the National Health Council on Aging and Older People, the National Social Work Qualifications Board, the National Treatment Purchase Fund Board, the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, St. James's Hospital board, St. Luke's Hospital board, and the Women's Health Council.  The amendment also clarifies that the confidentiality of the patient record within a nursing home does not prohibit the consideration of access to information under the provisions and protections of FOI.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">The remaining non-disclosure clauses listed in this part of the amendment arise from the transposition of EU directives that contain specific protections for commercially sensitive information.  Inclusion of these in the Third Schedule means that, while the commercial sensitivity of the information will be recognised, the provisions of the FOI Act can apply in so far as the original directive permits.  The information commissioner has recommended that these be included in the Third Schedule for this purpose and I agree with this approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The proposed amendments to sections 51 and 52 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 arise from the urgent need to continue to facilitate the marriage of seriously or terminally ill people who, by reason of their illness, are unable to travel to a public venue for their marriage.  The current legislation, which makes provision for special arrangements for the marriage of persons who are seriously ill, is due to be repealed on the commencement of the marriage provisions, Part 6, of the Civil Registration Act 2004, which will take place within the next few months.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">Section 52(1) of the new Act provides that a marriage may be solemnised at a venue chosen by the parties to the marriage with the agreement of the registered solemniser and, in the case of a civil marriage, the approval of the authority — that is, the Health Service Executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Section 51 of the Act makes it a substantive requirement for all marriages that they take place in venues which are open to the public.  In other words, it is one of the requirements for the validity of a marriage.  Recent legal advice received by my Department indicates that section 51, as currently worded, may cause difficulties concerning the solemnisation of the marriages of people who are seriously ill, which occasionally take place in their own homes or in hospices.  The effect of the proposed amendment to section 51 is to remove the requirement that the venue be open to the public in cases where a medical report has been furnished confirming that one or both parties are unable to attend such a venue due to illness.  The effect of the proposed amendment to section 52 is to remove the requirement that Health Service Executive approval is required for venues in such cases which involve civil marriages.  Such marriages could then continue to be solemnised in private homes or other such venues as required, subject to the agreement of the registered solemniser who is performing the ceremony and the approval of a superintendent registrar or an tArd-Chláraitheoir.  The amendment would secure the constitutional right to marry of persons in such circumstances and avoid these tragic situations being exacerbated by the stress of uncertainty over the legal rights of partners and children.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">Apart from the urgent need to secure the right of people to marry in these circumstances, this amendment is urgently needed to ensure the smooth commencement of the remainder of Part 6 of the Act.  If this issue is not dealt with now, the commencement of Part 6 as it currently stands could either prevent the marriages of seriously ill people or place in doubt the validity of such marriages, if they proceeded.  Alternatively, the commencement would have to be delayed to facilitate discussion of this issue at a later date.  Such a delay would, in turn, impede the modernisation of the marriage registration service, as envisaged by the Act, and prevent other couples from having civil marriage ceremonies at venues other than registry offices, which the Act also permits for the first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">I thank the House for considering these matters and move that the amendments be discussed as part of the Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_285">
          <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_598">Would this legislation protect me if I were to send the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, a letter detailing the concerns expressed to me by a constituent regarding practices in a hospital, nursing home or health care facility in County Wexford?  I think the answer to that is no.  The Deputies and Senators of Oireachtas Éireann are not considered trustworthy enough to be covered by this legislation.  People trust us, to some degree, as public representatives, to carry information on their behalf with a certain amount of protection from the State to help look after their interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">Information given to me as a Deputy may be false and this is something that we must be wary of.  Under this legislation it will not be possible to get protection when a constituent passes on information without announcing it in public as a parliamentary question that receives parliamentary protection.  I will not be able to write to the Minister requesting she explore concerns expressed to me by a constituent at a clinic.  The Minister is suggesting that people with concerns, for example in Wexford or the south east, must instead make their complaints about a person in a health care facility to an individual in an office who may work with or be married or related to the person in question.  The Minister is not that stupid and knows that it will not be long before issues of confidentiality relating to who has come before a deciding officer come down the grapevine.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The legislation relating to whistleblowers is useless and not worth the paper on which it is written.  People will not be willing to approach a person in the structures the Minister has established, though they will receive whistleblowers' protection.  The Minister should have learned from the Leas Cross matter, though it is clear she has made no inquiries as to what happened in that case.  If a person who made complaints about Leas Cross had to adhere to these procedures he or she would have been ostracised by those working for the HSE.  The Minister must change this legislation so that people can have access to others who they trust with complaints and to ensure a certain degree of anonymity in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">The Minister must have a contract with the HSE.  If a general practitioner, GP, trainer went to the HSE suggesting his or her trainee had an alcohol problem there could be a risk because, to the best of my knowledge, the GP trainers who train the next generation of Irish GPs have no contract with the HSE.  If GP trainers have no contract with the HSE how will the Minister protect them when they express concerns about trainee GPs?  If the concerns are expressed in reports that go back to the central office and the information is incorrect they may be subject to legal action.  GP trainers cannot protect patients of the future under this legislation because the Minister has no contract with them and is making no effort in this regard.  She is blindly letting this happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">The HSE was set up under the Health Bill 2004 and it took two years for the Minister to sign off on Part 9, the complaints procedure.  Regarding Leas Cross, I have seen nothing that gives me confidence that the HSE will not try a cover-up or whitewash if something goes wrong.  It is clear that neither the Minister nor Professor Drumm bothered to read the Leas Cross report on protecting patients by Professor Des O'Neill.</p>

          <p eId="para_611">The Minister did not sign off on them yet they are being used throughout the health service.  Is the Minister in charge of the Irish health service?  The Minister knows that this legislation will not protect anybody.  Senior management, who chose to ignore things going wrong for many years, will not take responsibility for their actions.  Usually an unfortunate individual down the line is made a scapegoat and pays the price for things going wrong.  This legislation is more of the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">The Minister spoke eloquently on the two midwives who bravely stepped forward but her legislation would do little to protect them.  They would be expected to approach an individual in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, where the problem existed in 1998, to make the complaint.  There was significant public support for Dr. Neary when he was exposed because people do not expect such things to happen.  The two midwives happened to be in a solicitor's office when they made their statements and the solicitor followed up on them.  The midwives are not protected by this legislation and could be charged under it.  In this legislation the Minister has failed to protect the midwives she spoke of so much.</p>

          <p eId="para_622">I fail to see how that is the case.  Perhaps the Minister will explain how the two midwives in question would be protected because my reading of the legislation is obviously wrong.  The reason the Bill will fail is that the Minister did not provide an option allowing people to contact a truly independent person.  She will not achieve the objective she has set for the so-called amendment on whistleblowers.  The provision is a sop to hide her failures in this area over the past eight or nine years during which she has paid scant regard to the protection of patients in the health care system.  She is trying to rush through a number of Bills to prevent her from being exposed as having disregarded patient protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">The only way to protect patients is to establish a patient safety authority with full responsibility in this area, as the Labour Party and Fine Gael Party have proposed.  People would trust such an independent body to inquire into their complaints.  The Minister obviously does not like information of this nature entering the public domain.  Her failure to establish an independent patient safety authority notwithstanding, one would at least expect her to regard Members of the Oireachtas as suitable authorising persons on condition that they made inquiries in a discreet manner through the appropriate Minister.  Deputies do not abuse parliamentary privilege because they respect the institution of the Oireachtas.  The Minister could have made such a provision.  She failed miserably and has made a lukewarm attempt to cover up the gross failings of the Government in the area of patient safety.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_304">
          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_624">I have grave concerns about the Government's general policy of pushing legislation through the House at breakneck speed without affording Members sufficient time to obtain legal advice or scrutinise and debate the various changes it proposes.  We are paid to do this job but are not being given a chance to carry out our remit.  This approach, which is particularly evident in the area of justice, is also notable in the area of health.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">The only reason the House is debating this motion for one hour is that the Ceann Comhairle initiated changes in Standing Orders in response to the practice of introducing swathes of amendments on Report Stage.  This practice, a characteristic of the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is evident in the amendment to the Health Bill.  It prevents Members from ensuring legislation being passed meets needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">A chunk of amendments has been introduced at the 11th hour to deal with fundamental issues.  The right to speak, the right to know and the right to marry are basic human rights but Deputies do not have an explanatory memorandum for the various amendments being proposed.  While we received a note, the normal practice in presenting Bills is to provide an explanatory memorandum to inform Deputies and ensure we are on the right track.  In the absence of such a memorandum, I must confess that I do not feel sufficiently well equipped to live up to my responsibilities in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">The Labour Party takes seriously the issue of whistleblowing on which it introduced a Bill in 1999.  The Government accepted the Bill tabled during Private Members' business and referred it to committee.  It has behaved badly since, however, because the select committee has not met to discuss the legislation.  Although subsequently included again on the Order Paper, no action has been taken to progress the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">The Government gave a commitment to provide protection, sector by sector, to allow people to feel safe when reporting something amiss in their sector.  If that is Government policy, one would expect it to have a standard template under which the same type of conditions and safeguards for protecting disclosure would apply to each sector.  In such circumstances, we would not need to continually reinvent the wheel.  Does the health sector have particular requirements which do not exist in other sectors?  I do not imagine that is the case.  While working in the health sector carries a great deal of responsibility because one deals with life and death, the act of disclosing information to an appropriate person does not vary.  The original whistleblowers Bill introduced by my party related to enterprise and employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">If there is a template for whistleblowing protection, why on earth did the Minister not introduce this amendment, which she knew she would publish, as part of the original Bill?  On Second Stage she alerted the House that measures to address this issue were coming down the tracks.  This showed a certain incompetence on her part in that she knew what she wanted to do but did not include the relevant provisions in the Bill in the normal fashion so as to enable public scrutiny.  Deputies are a small circle.  Those affected by this issue have not had an opportunity to make an input to the proposals.  Whatever the restrictions applying to Members, those applying to the public at large and people affected by this issue are absolute.  Given that the Minister knew what she wanted to do, the question arises as to why the proposals in the amendment were not in the original Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">It transpires that the Minister did not have the right to state she would introduce an amendment on Committee Stage because she had no powers to do so.  At the end of Committee Stage she informed the select committee that she would introduce the amendment on Report Stage.  I believe her admission that she did not have any knowledge about how this was done.  Having asked for a short debate, I discovered that the particular requirement was already addressed by Standing Orders.  This is not a good way to process legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">Deputy Twomey asked whether people can have confidence that the person to whom they are reporting is truly independent.  Without such confidence this process will not work.  The case of the two midwives who finally blew the whistle after 18 years of practice in the case of Dr. Neary should be salutary.  To this day, we do not know their identities and while the Minister may argue that this is by choice, we must ask why they would choose to maintain anonymity after all the good they have done and all the courage they have shown.  The reason they choose anonymity is not fear or cowardice but well grounded.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">This is an important issue in terms of getting the legislation right.  The Labour Party is fully committed to the principle of protecting whistleblowers.  We want to support the Minister in extending the Freedom of Information Act to new areas in the health service.  As Minister of State at the then Department of Enterprise and Employment, Eithne Fitzgerald, did the country a great service when she introduced a Freedom of Information Act that was regarded at the time as living up to a difficult challenge.  It has proven to be progressive even though the Government tried to cut back its provisions.  The fundamental principle of freedom of information is now established in our culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">I cannot help but smile when I hear the Minister speak about a culture of openness in the HSE.  Problems still exist in that organisation.  Even now the culture of openness is more an aspiration than anything else.  My colleague, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, gave me a letter she received from the HSE dated 12 March relating to issues relevant to this Bill.  I understand it was couriered to her.  This letter was issued in response to her inquiries about nursing home inspections, including such questions as when they would be available and the reasons that some had not taken place.  This information was sought by her on 5 December last but no response was forthcoming until 12 March.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">There is much tokenism from the Government in regard to openness and transparency but the evidence indicates otherwise.  Reference is frequently made to evidence-based practice in the health sector.  This is also a good standard for politics.  The evidence does not support the existence of a culture of openness and transparency.  Extending the freedom of information legislation to the professional bodies or whatever does not necessarily deal with the issue in terms of how the HSE is operating.  We all support efforts to ensure there is more access and that the norm is openness rather than concealment.  However, the Minister must recognise that we are dealing with a vast organisation — one of the largest employers in the country — that is almost impenetrable not only from without but often also from within.  That is what I hear from staff in the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">The amendments relating to the registration of marriages cause us to question the competence of the Government.  It introduced legislation in 2004 to enable people to get married in more congenial conditions and surroundings.  This was a positive initiative and we all supported it.  We are still waiting, however, for that legislation to come into operation.  One of the most remarkable discoveries in wading through these 30 pages of amendments is that the right people used to have to be married in their own home where, for example, one of the parties suffered from a chronic illness, was taken away by the Government without it even realising it had done so.  This was only brought to its attention because the legislation could not be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">This Bill was originally intended to establish an inspectorate for nursing homes but it became a Bill to establish HIQA.  In addition, it now provides safeguards for whistleblowers and also entitles people to get married in their own home.  I assume there will be no more surprises.  Again, one must question the competence of the Government in providing good legislation.  Several of the amendments to the Schedules, for instance, include an asterisk and accompanying note informing us that a "printing error has resulted in incorrect line references".  What standards are applied that we end up with these notes and asterisks?  Can these printing errors not be rectified before Report Stage?</p>
          <p eId="para_637">This may seem a minor point but one must bear in mind the importance of this Bill.  Its original purpose, the establishment of a nursing homes inspectorate, became the new purpose of the establishment of HIQA.  I hoped this body would be empowered to deal with facilities across the health sector.  I was deeply disappointed, however, to find that hospitals, for example, do not come under HIQA's remit.  It is likely to be something of a toothless tiger if that function is not included from day one.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">The Minister, Deputy Harney, does not work out her actions in advance.  This is the Minister whose greatest achievement was to force through the establishment of the HSE without adequate planning and preparation and without even a chief executive officer to manage the change.  We have been living with the dire consequences ever since.</p>

          <p eId="para_646">I will share time with Deputies Gormley and Finian McGrath.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">The memo from the Department of Health and Children's legislation unit to the Government Chief Whip's office, which was copied to Opposition spokespersons, states that the Government made a decision on 7 March 2006 to address the issue of whistleblowing on a sectoral basis.  It further stated that Ministers were instructed to introduce whistleblowing provisions in draft legislation being prepared in their respective Departments.  We find in the case of the Health Bill, however, that the Government's amendments on disclosure of information and the Freedom of Information Act were ruled as being outside the scope of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Could the Government not have anticipated such a ruling when it made its decision to incorporate whistleblowing amendments into legislation that was already advanced in drafting?  This has created a messy legislative situation.  An already unsatisfactory Bill, as I described it on Second Stage, is having two distinct new elements grafted onto it.  We must go through a roundabout procedure to deal with these amendments.  Has this situation arisen in the case of other Bills as freedom of information amendments were applied to them?  How will the Government deal with this in future Bills?  Perhaps the Minister will throw some light on these questions in her reply.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">It is interesting that the memo to which I referred also states the Health Bill provides the only opportunity in which to make the necessary amendment to the Civil Registration Act 2004.  As civil registration bears no relation to the subject matter of this Bill, we can conclude that the Government anticipates little or no further legislation coming before the Dáil and that the general election will be called in a matter of weeks.  Perhaps the Minister of State will enlighten us on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">It is right that whistleblowers should be protected, nowhere more so than in the health services.  Brave people in these services have repeatedly exposed wrongdoing and neglect which has resulted in injury and sometimes loss of life.  It was a courageous midwife who blew the whistle on the appalling scandal in the obstetrics and gynaecology department of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  Michael Neary's professional peers protected him for years from the consequences of his brutal actions on dozens of women, and even tried to protect him after he had been exposed.  Every protection should be offered to those who out of selfless motives act in the public interest.  They should not be penalised.  Too often it is the person who reports the wrongdoing who is punished while the culprit escapes censure.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">I agree that some deterrent is needed to prevent false reporting.  However, I am opposed to the provision in Government amendment No. 37 for terms of imprisonment for false reporting.  That is over the top and I appeal to the Minister to withdraw that part of the amendment as the fines for this offence are more than sufficient.  It is entirely inappropriate to impose custodial sentences, and we have few enough places available to accommodate people.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">On the civil registration amendment, I am concerned at the way this is being tacked on to this legislation to fill a gap in the 2004 Act.  This seems to be another example of legislative drafting going wrong.  I agree we should facilitate those who wish to hold marriage ceremonies in their homes and I have no difficulty in facilitating them by way of this amendment.  However, questions arise with regard to the way the Government does such business, not for the first time as the recent sexual offences legislation has shown.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_313">
          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_653">This amendment to the health legislation has not received the type of scrutiny I would like to give it as it has come late in the day.  It has become a feature of this Administration that much of its legislation is rushed and put through for optics.  We are approaching a general election and the Government wants to clear the decks and be able to say it has dealt with the whistleblowing issue which is being tacked on to the health legislation, and everything is fine.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">I and many Opposition Deputies do not have the resources to deal with legislation foisted upon us in this manner.  I hold three portfolios and do not have the numbers of staff the Minister of State has to examine these issues in detail.  If we are to be serious about legislation, the Opposition must be shown some respect.  I know there is a tendency in Government to see the Opposition as a nuisance and to dismiss it.  Legislation rushed through in this manner has many flaws.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">I have questions with regard to what was called in the Minister's speech, "an authorised person".  Whistleblowing is important in exposing corruption and mismanagement.  Long before Leas Cross became an issue, I outlined an instance where an employee of a nursing home came to me as a public representative and informed me of appalling conditions, mistreatment of patients and bad food etc.  This nurse would not report the situation to her superiors and all she would do was make anonymous phone calls to the then Eastern Health Board, but those calls were never acted on.  Her question now would be, what sort of protection would be afforded her under this legislation.  The midwives in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital could well ask the same question.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">When people come forward and inform an authorised person, can we be sure they will be treated properly subsequently?  We are told they can inform these authorised persons  and their disclosures will be known as "protected disclosures".  People want to know how safe this system is.  Over and over again, I have seen situations where whistleblowers are not protected.  I am sure the Minister of State is as aware of such cases, even where people go to a local authority to complain about disorderly neighbours.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">I take the point made by Deputy Ó Caoláin, but sometimes false or exaggerated reports are made to the detriment of an individual.  Similarly, there is often a level of intimidation and a great deal of fear with regard to making reports, with the result that people do not wish to provide their names.  In particular, this is often the case with regard to local authority issues and people complain instead to public representatives.  Deputy Twomey made the valid point that we are on the receiving end of so many complaints that we know the score.  There is a role here for public representatives.  We should be in a position to pass on such information, but, regrettably, that is not covered in the legislation.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_314">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_658">I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on this motion.  It is important when talking about the health service that we have a vision and plan for its development.  The health service belongs to the people, the taxpayers and citizens of the State.  No-one should hold the high moral ground in debate on the health service nor should the issue be used as a political football.  It is important to point out that the majority of Deputies and Senators support the health service and health service staff who do their best to improve the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">When I was elected in 2002, it was as a member of the independent health alliance which aimed to support reform, investment and change in the development of the health services.  During debates in recent years I have been critical of the faults of the health service, but at the same time I have strongly supported the issues and sensible proposals made by Deputies, particularly my colleagues the Independent Deputies, for the development of the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">We must have strong legislation and do our best to assist and protect whistleblowers.  By whistleblowers I mean people with a genuine grievance or who have recognised something wrong with regard to practices in the health service.  I am not talking about cranks and accept we need to be very cautious about false reporting.  On the amendments, it is going too far to talk about imprisonment.  This is too harsh as fines are adequate to deal with the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Our focus must remain on patients in the overall debate.  We must declare it is unacceptable to have patients on trolleys in accident and emergency units, particularly in a country awash with money.  Many policies are emerging in the run-up to the election as people want to give away more money.  Patients are still on trolleys after ten years of this coalition in Government.  That is not acceptable to me, to the doctors, the ancillary staff, the consultants or the nurses.  We need reform and investment and this Government must wake up to the reality that we need more beds to provide proper services for patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">We must continue to develop community care, particularly for general practitioner services.  I welcome the recent developments especially on the north side of Dublin because we need quality services to assist accident and emergency services.  We must also develop specialist services.  Some of the best doctors and nurses on the international stage work here.  They entered the profession to save lives and help patients and we should give them our maximum support.  They in turn have a responsibility to realise they are working for the taxpayers and need to respect citizens when it comes to change and development, and reform of the health services generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">I received an e-mail from John Edwards on 5 February last, from the United States, in which he states we must stop using phrases such as access to health care which mean less than universal care and which person, family or child we are willing to leave behind without the care they need.  We need a universal solution.  This is relevant to today's debate because we need a quality health service and long-term plans to develop that.  We should not be afraid of studying and learning from countries which have excellent services and a broad vision of society.  I encourage the Minister of State to develop services for people with disabilities who are often forgotten.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">Rushed legislation is always dangerous as we should have learned from the past.  We all want a quality health service and we should support that demand.</p>

          <p eId="para_665">I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the House for facilitating this motion.  I will respond to some of the less than positive comments about aspects of the proceedings, for example, about the whistleblowing provisions.  These are based on principles in legislation in other jurisdictions which in general provide for adherence to certain procedures.  The authorised persons will be independent.  If a person is victimised he or she has recourse to a rights commissioner, and the Labour Court and is protected from civil liability.  The midwives in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital would have been protected by virtue of the definition of employee.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">I do not believe, however, that the Opposition spokespersons oppose the fundamental principles underpinning the amendments.  How can they oppose whistleblowing, improving freedom of information, and facilitating marriages for those who are too unwell to get married in a public place?  The House has considerable interest in these principles and understands the benefits for the health service and for individuals that will result from these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">The provisions for the protected disclosure of information by employees represents a milestone in the health services.  It is essential that employees feel empowered to make disclosures in good faith in the best interests of patients and service users.  A culture of openness must be an integral part of the health service if we are to continue to improve standards of safety and quality and to ensure the patient is always to the forefront.

          <p eId="para_705">The amendment we are considering today to introduce provisions for protection of the disclosure of information in the health service will allow employees to know that they will be listened to, will not be penalised in the workplace for speaking out in good faith and will be protected from civil liability in making disclosures in good faith, and that disclosures will be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">In respect of the amendment to Schedule 3 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 it is important to remove any doubt about the appropriate right of access under that Act to information held by health bodies.  The provisions of the amendment stem from a former review under section 32 of the Act and reflect the recommendations of the Information Commissioner and the report of my Department to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">The amendment to Part 6 of the Civil Registration Act 2004, deals with the law relating to marriages.  Under section 51, a marriage must be solemnised in a place open to the public.  Sadly it may not always be possible for a person who is seriously or gravely ill and who wishes to marry to attend a public venue.  We all hope that such circumstances are extremely rare but we need to ensure that provision is made for those who find themselves in such circumstances.  As outlined, the proposed amendment to section 51 will remove the requirement that the venue be open to the public where the appropriate authority is satisfied, on the basis of a medical report, that one party is, or both parties are, too ill to attend a public place and gives approval to the person solemnising the marriage for holding the marriage elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">In human terms, the amendment will mean a tremendous amount to people in difficult health circumstances.  Apart from this incalculable benefit, it is important that any question mark be removed in respect of section 51 so Part 6 of the Civil Registration Act overall can be commenced as planned, thus ensuring the modernisation of the marriage registration service, as envisaged by the Act.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_713">7.—The object of the Authority is to promote safety and quality in the provision of health and personal social services for the benefit of the health and welfare of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">I hope Deputies Ó Caoláin and Twomey, who tabled amendments Nos. 7 and 8, respectively, will be satisfied to withdraw them on the basis of what I propose, especially given that I had strong regard to what was said during Committee Stage on this subject.  As legislators, all Deputies are aware of the need to draft legislation carefully, having regard to what we wish to achieve.  Consequently, in framing any legislation it is imperative to distinguish between functions and objectives.  Functions are specified in a concrete manner because they relate to the activities that the body in question is required to carry out and they are interpreted accordingly in any legal proceedings involving their consideration.  The objectives of any organisation, be it in the private or public sector, are goals it strives to achieve through the proper performance of its functions.  Objectives are strategic and serve as means to guide the organisation in carrying out its business.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The functions of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, are clearly set out in section 7.  On the amendments of Deputies Twomey and Ó Caoláin, explicit provision for the setting of standards is already made under this section and the overall objective of promoting safety and quality is implicit in the functions assigned to the authority as a whole, as it is in respect of every health service agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">To make the Deputies' amendments would be to introduce a vague and unquantifiable element to the authority's functions.  However, having considered the points raised on Committee Stage, I believe it would be helpful to set out in the Bill the core objective of HIQA.  Its objective is to promote safety and quality in the provision of health and personal social services for the benefit of the health and welfare of the public.  Amendment No. 6 expressly provides as a function of the authority that it will seek to further this objective to the extent practicable, and this marries the functions with the objectives to the greatest practicable degree.  The joint effect of both amendments is to make certain that the core objective acts as a guiding principle for the new authority in carrying out the tasks associated with its wide remit and ensures the importance of patient safety is rightly recognised.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_355">
          <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_717">One of my problems with HIQA was that patient safety was not its core objective.  The role of the Social Services Inspectorate is to examine standards in all institutions involved in health provision.  HIQA's role does not just concern social services inspection but also the evaluation of technologies.  This is a nice euphemism that slipped through in the explanatory memorandum.  Another of its functions is the exact same as that of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom.  I have raised this on Second and Committee Stages and therefore the Minister of State will be fully aware of the role of that institute.  Quite clearly, the core problem with the institute, which is supposedly built around patient care or safety, is that it decides whether one can receive treatment according to a cost-benefit analysis.  If one is expected to live for so many years and one's treatment costs so much, one will receive it, but if one is expected to live only for a short time and the cost of one's treatment exceeds a certain figure, one will not receive it.  This does not comprise a patient safety issue, even by the widest stretch of the imagination of a member of the Progressive Democrats.  The Minister of State will agree with me in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The same problem applies to HIQA.  When trying to create an ethos of patient protection, it is inappropriate to include among the functions of the organisation that deals with standards and safety issues in nursing homes and hospitals a function that would deny a person medical treatment because of its cost or because he or she will not live long enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">We must all have an idea of costs and I would like nothing more than a cost-benefit analysis of the co-location of private hospitals on the grounds of public hospitals but unfortunately the Government cannot get around to carrying this out.  Putting accountants in the same room as patient safety staff will confuse the ethos of HIQA and it will therefore not work very effectively.  My first four amendments, Nos. 1 to 4, were deemed out of order because they attempted to address this.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">The Social Services Inspectorate and the Mental Health Commission should have been amalgamated as part of a patient safety authority.  My colleagues in the Labour Party would very much agree with this because we do not want to stigmatise those with mental illness as different from patients in the rest of the health service.  Instead of breaking down barriers and destigmatising certain sectors, especially the one for which the Minister of State is supposed to be responsible, the Government is drawing in an even darker pen the line between patients with mental illness and patients in other areas of the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">I will not press my amendment on the basis of what I have said but I believe the Minister of State has made a mistake.</p>

          <p eId="para_732">The standard set by HIQA will apply to the public health service, which is made up by the HSE and service providers funded by the executive.  HIQA standards will also apply to services provided by the private sector on behalf of the executive.  Moreover, the new inspection system provided for in the Bill with the establishment of the office of the chief inspector of social services will encompass private nursing homes.  HIQA can also operate accreditation programmes for the public and private services.  The spirit of the amendment, therefore, is to be found in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">It is important to refer to the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance that the Minister recently established.

It will look at a statutory system of licensing of public and private providers of health care and better integration of the work of different regulatory bodies in the health system to achieve a joined up approach and a sharing of best practice.

Deputies McManus and Ó Caoláin are anxious to establish beyond doubt that HIQA will have responsibility for setting standards on safety and quality in hospitals and for monitoring compliance with standards set.  I assure them that is the case under section 7(1)(<i>a</i>) as currently drafted.  Under the Health Act 2004, the HSE has responsibility for delivering health and personal social services or arranging the delivery of these services on its behalf.  Hospital services are provided directly by the executive under the Health Acts and by voluntary hospitals on behalf of the executive and are therefore included within the relevant definition.  Accordingly, this amendment is unnecessary and its inclusion might create the impression that providing standards for hospitals would be of a higher priority than for other services.</p>

          <p eId="para_754">The Minister of State is suggesting that the Labour Party spokesperson and Deputy Ó Caoláin are foolish people who cannot read the Bill but the Bill is drafted in such a complex manner that it does not refer to anything directly or simply.  It is a poor standard of legislation.  It is not clear what it is about.  When senior parliamentary spokespeople and senior legal representatives who advised the Labour Party on the matter do not know what it was about, I think the Minister of State must be wrong on this issue.  The limited scope of the Bill indicates that the Labour Party and the Sinn Féin spokespeople are right and the Minister of State is wrong.  He should re-examine this and state it clearly in the legislation so that even barristers know what they are reading.  If they are confused and suggest amendments that the Minister of State says are entirely unnecessary, there is something wrong with the legislation as written.  I will press the idea that hospitals will be included.  In fact, I ask the Minister of State directly, will St. Vincent's Hospital in Athy be covered by this legislation?</p>

          <p eId="para_771">I wish to share time with Deputies Burton, Costello and Lynch.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">Tonight is the third time in the past three years that the Labour Party has used its Private Members' time in the Dáil to raise the issue of class size.  In April 2005 and May 2006, we tabled similar motions to the one I have moved on behalf of the party tonight.  We have considered this issue and the logistics of how we can reduce class sizes in Ireland to what children in other European countries enjoy, and we intend to do so in the next Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">It is important to stress that we are serious about this issue.  It has been raised in a large number of public meetings with very large attendances throughout the country, and pointing out that the Labour Party has raised this issue three times in our Private Members' time is an indication that we take it very seriously and intend to reduce the class sizes to European norms.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">We will not repeat the empty rhetoric of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats programme for Government, which promised that all children under nine will be in classes of fewer than 20:1 and then proceeded to ignore that promise.  The number of children in classes of 30 or more has increased rather than decreased.  Failure to keep promises like that is what makes people lose faith in politics.  That is one of the reasons we were all greeted with a fair degree of scepticism when we attended the Irish National Teachers Organisation meetings throughout the country in the past few weeks and it is the reason I intend, on behalf of the Labour Party, to outline the measures we will take to reach our commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">Essentially, there are three elements required, extra teachers, extra schools and classrooms and the revenue and capital resources to pay for them.  It is not rocket science.  They are three basic elements and they can be delivered if there is the political will.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">We must factor in also the expected growth in the school-going population, which is estimated at an extra 100,000 in the next ten years, and a system must be put in place to pinpoint where those children will be living.  Essentially, this is about forward planning, which we have not seen in the system here.  That is something other European countries do as a matter of course.  On the other hand, the Government has stood by and wrung its hands as if the problem had jumped up to bite it, and it had no idea how those young children were suddenly there with eager faces ready to take up their constitutional right to education.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">Laytown in County Meath is a prime example of that.  This has been an ongoing issue for some time.  I read in the newspapers in the past week that a site may or may not be bought for a temporary school to address urgent need while the permanent one is being built.  The parents there do not know what to say to their children.  Will they be going to school or will they not?  Will they be going to school in the locality?  Will they have to travel long distances by bus or are there any spaces within bus distance of Laytown?  Neighbouring schools in east Meath, such as Le Chéile Educate Together in Mornington, have faced similar problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">The parents of Laytown spent so much time on this issue they came before the Joint Committee on Education and Science to talk to us about the solutions they believe are necessary to address the needs of these growing communities in terms of the provision of schools.  They made some worthwhile proposals in that regard, but it should not be up to the parents who have suffered so much in a particular area to come up with proposals to provide school places for children.  That is the job of the Government, particularly the Minister for Education and Science.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">This is a fiasco born of a failure of political leadership.  It is time the Government took charge of providing schools.  Otherwise, we will continue to play catch-up on crisis management of numbers, particularly in the growth areas around our cities.  The Labour Party has come to the view that a radical change of approach is needed to allow us plan and deliver schools and classrooms to be ready when the population needs them.  My colleagues have examples in their locations of schools that are bursting at the seams, with no place to put the extra children and where it is constantly a case of crisis management.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">We propose that the National Treasury Management Agency be given the task of gathering the information on where and when extra classrooms and schools will be needed and of acquiring the sites on which to build them.  This should be done in co-operation with local authorities.  We plan to introduce legislation to implement the recommendation of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution to ensure that land can be acquired by compulsory purchase order for educational purposes.  That proposal was made some years ago but there has been no attempt by Government, despite the fact that it is a recommendation of an all-party committee, to implement the recommendation.  While this proposal will probably require a substantial capital investment initially, it will save money in the longer term because the State will no longer be held over a barrel by developers who know they can practically name their price because a school is urgently needed and suitable land is in such short supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">For example, a gaelscoil in my constituency, of which I am sure the Minister is aware, has been waiting, in atrocious temporary conditions, for more than a decade for a site to be bought because the Office of Public Works is reluctant to pay the inflated price to the public purse that is being asked for the site deemed most appropriate for the school.  I am aware there are similar cases in other constituencies, and the sites are probably much more expensive around the greater Dublin area.  Failure to plan is costing us money and forcing children to spend years in dilapidated, unhealthy classrooms.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">There is a rash of prefabs throughout the country which are costing a considerable amount of money, whether they are being bought or rented, to the public purse.  If we plan in advance and buy the land at a cheaper rate before it becomes so urgently needed that the developers can almost name their price, we will need a short-term increase in capital money but in the long term we will save money to the public purse and ensure children do not have to spend, in many cases, all their school life in a prefab.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">If the provision of schools and extensions in expanding areas is a specific task for the National Treasury Management Agency, which is a Government agency with expertise and experience in this area, that will leave the Department of Education and Science's building unit and the OPW with the much more manageable job of assisting existing schools in upgrading their buildings and replacing unsuitable classrooms and prefabs.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">The reason we have concentrated on the building aspect of the solution to the issue of class size is that it has been the most intractable.  It is the reason most children in County Kildare, for example, must be five before they get into school and the reason in the northern part of that county only 2.2% of children are in classes of fewer than 20 and 31% are in classes of 30 or more.  That statistic is a national disgrace and it is not much better in several other counties.  More than 100,000 primary school children and 35,000 post-primary students are in classes of 30 or more.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">If we do not address this issue now, we do a great disservice to the children of Ireland and to our future.  One can imagine being a five year old in a room with 32 other five year olds trying to follow what one adult is trying to help them understand.  If they do not grasp it, are they able to get the teacher's attention and will he or she be able to give them the time to explain?  I think not in a class of that size, and that is the experience throughout the country for very young children for whom this is their only opportunity.  If they slip back in the early years, it is much more difficult to catch up at a later stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">One of the striking aspects about the INTO meetings has been the huge numbers of parents attending and the passion of their contributions.  Parents considerably outnumbered teachers at these meetings.  I was struck by how strongly the parents in my constituency felt about this issue, and I know that has been the experience in other parts of the country.  They know their children are not getting the attention they need in large classes.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">Children with special needs are particularly vulnerable.  Most mainstream classes now have a number of children with learning support needs and many have not been allocated that support despite recommendations from psychologists and other professionals.  The implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act has proved a bitter disappointment in many cases.  The weighted model for the allocation of resource teachers in primary schools has delivered support based on numbers rather than need and many disadvantaged schools with large numbers of children with learning difficulties have lost rather than gained teachers.  Basic literacy competence has not improved in some schools in the past decade because while we have a child-centred curriculum, we do not have a child-centred allocation of resources to implement the curriculum.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">There are many difficulties in schools throughout the country with regard to the allocation of those special resources, particularly in post-primary schools that do not have <i>in situ</i> resource teachers.  Issues arise also regarding a shortage of speech and language therapists and a number of other specialists.  The suggestion is that now that we have the legislation everything is sorted out for children with special needs, but that is very far from the reality in schools throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">I spoke to a number of young teachers after the INTO meeting I attended, which was packed to the doors, with some people having to overflow into the next room.  Those young teachers were clearly idealistic and hugely positive about the vocation they had chosen.  However, they were all very frustrated and disappointed that they could not do their job as it should be done.  I was really struck by these young teachers who were trying to cope with very large numbers of children and wanted to be good teachers — and were good teachers.  However, in the circumstances they were finding it extremely difficult to implement what is still described as the new curriculum in primary education, which is child-centred with the opportunity for children to work individually.  It is not a talk-down curriculum.  However, it is very difficult to implement it in large classes.  These teachers simply could not give the kind of attention each child needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">This brings me to the second element in reducing class sizes to EU norms, which average at 20:1 and in which we are second from bottom of the table.  Only the United Kingdom has larger class sizes than we have.  We need to continue to increase the number of teachers graduating from our colleges of education and universities every year.  I congratulate the INTO on the work it has done on the teacher numbers required.  I welcome the fact that we have a considerable number of additional teachers in the system, for which I give the Minister credit.  However, it does not need to be an either-or situation.  The capacity exists if there is the will to deliver.  The will certainly exists in the colleges of education.  The numbers who apply for undergraduate and postgraduate primary education courses and for the higher diploma in education and second level teaching-related courses continue to increase as indicated by the most recent CSO figures.  The colleges are more than willing to expand their place numbers, provided they are given the necessary resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">However, I do not accept that a choice needed to be made between class size reduction and special needs and newcomer children.  The Minister knew that special needs children were to be mainstreamed as it was Government policy.  In setting its priorities the Government should have known that these children would need such supports.  As it has been Government policy to bring in workers from other countries to develop our economy, the number of newcomer children should not have been a surprise.  The commitment in the programme for Government on class size should have been incrementally implemented over the five-year lifetime of the Government.  It was a very specific commitment that both parties signed up to.  Therefore it should have been politically driven and monitored.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">However, we have a Government that is in charge of everything but in control of nothing.  It is part of a pattern of apportioning responsibility for all the crises, from the health services to traffic gridlock to someone or something else.  It claims to be helpless to do anything about all the children, sick people and cars clogging up our schools, hospitals and roads?  The Government is responsible and was elected to take the actions that will make things work.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">This is an issue that should be a priority for all elected representatives.  Education has been at the heart of social and economic progress in Ireland.  We have traditionally invested in it in so far as our wealth permitted, but that is no longer the case.  While 5.4% of GDP was spent on education in 1994, it has fallen to 4.6%.  We are near the bottom of the EU and OECD tables on the portion of our national wealth that we spend on education, particularly pre-school, primary and second level.  The Labour Party will, in government, put education back in the centre of spending priorities again.  We are committed to allocating the resources, capital and revenue, that will be needed to reduce class sizes to EU norms, which average 20:1.  We know that a commitment to average size and pupil-teacher ratios are not enough in themselves.  It is of no use to a child in Dublin West who is in a class of 38 children to know that elsewhere there are only ten children in her cousin's class.  We also need to set maximum class size targets as specified in the motion.  The measures we are proposing for the building programme will allow us to achieve such targets in a set timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">The <i> ad hoc</i> reactive system that operates at present has seen PE halls used as classrooms, playground space eaten up by prefabs and children spending their entire school years in unventilated, squashed, damp, unhealthy conditions.  I spoke to the mother of an autistic boy last Friday who told me that the local school attended by the rest of her children has a problem taking her son, who is ready for mainstream, because of concerns that there will not be room in the classroom for the adult who will be needed for a limited period of time to help him to cope with the transition from the one-to-one system he has had to full participation in the class.  I know that my colleagues can outline other cases of classes with insufficient space.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">We are aware of the problems that are being stored up for these children into the future if we do not comprehensively address their needs as they develop.  This is solvable if the will exists.  I urge all Members to support the motion.  I am disappointed that the Government has tabled an amendment.  We should have united in supporting the motion which concerns planning for the next generation.  It can be done and the resources exist to do it.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_381">
          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_796">What is another year in terms of primary school education, particularly in Dublin West?  It is another period of agony for parents and children as they wait to find out whether they will get a school place at primary or second level.  Last August the Minister made her first visit to Dublin West in a formal capacity to see a primary school.  I noticed that she came when the school was empty apart from one token child in a school uniform to allow the school appear spacious.  The very successful Castleknock community college has 60 children on a waiting list for a place.  Across the road in St. Patrick's school in Diswellstown, the one the Minister visited last year when it was empty of children, has 200 children seeking 89 places.  These figures indicate the lottery for parents with four or five year olds seeking a school place.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">I recently spoke to a parent with a daughter already in Mary Mother of Hope school in Clonee.  Another daughter of his turned four in January and although this is a sibling place she is 23rd on a waiting list for a place in the school.  I am told more than 60 children are now on that waiting list.  I have sent the Minister personal correspondence about the much-loved village school in Mulhuddart, which is apparently to be closed at the instigation of the Minister and her colleague, the Minister of State.  The children are to be transferred to a new super-sized primary school with capacity for more than 1,000 pupils, to be located two to three miles away from the existing school, about which no consultation took place with the parents.  The class teachers have suggested to existing pupils that if they have a brother or sister due to start next year he or she will be in another school two or three miles away.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">The Minister has ducked and weaved and avoided responsibility to an extraordinary degree regarding Dublin West.  I also refer to Diswellstown in the Clonee area that is serving a population living in more than 8,000 houses built in the past ten years.  The Minister promised a second level school for the area, but it now appears that it will not be built until 2008-09 or later.  All the parents in these areas, as the Minister must recall from her visit last year, are working and buying houses with large mortgage repayments.  They are paying their taxes and are not the people with Ansbacher accounts.  They are doing it right and paying their way.  They are contributing to society.  Is it too much to expect that they might get a school place for their children?</p>
          <p eId="para_799">Last year after months of tabling parliamentary questions, the Minister finally supplied an answer on class sizes.  Nine schools in Dublin 15 had 89 classes of 30 children or more out of a total of 155 classes — 57% of the classes were super-sized classes.  I have no reason to believe the situation this year is any different and although I have asked for the information repeatedly by way of parliamentary question, this term and last term, and although the Department collected the statistics towards the end of September, the Minister obviously believes the Dáil can go into recess and the general election without feeling obliged to acknowledge the figures for Dublin West.  In other areas the Minister appears to have much concern for education but her performance and that of her predecessors in regard to Dublin West is truly appalling.  The core reason for what has happened is that her party is in hock to the developers who are building the houses and making fortunes and neither she nor her predecessors have had the courage to get the sites.  She is telling us she will do it now.  She told us last week there will be a new VEC-patroned primary school for children who get into no school.  When will we know about this?  The school places are being allocated in Dublin West at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">To my knowledge there are 400 children in Dublin West with no school to go to at either primary or second level.  Can one imagine the uncertainty in those families?  The parents of those at primary level are trying to make a hard decision.  Should they hope for the best that the child will get a place and give up their preschool place or crèche place?  What does the Minister advise these parents to do?  Should they hold on in the hope that in May when the general election is on the rounds that she and the Taoiseach will cobble together another solution?  She is building super-sized primary schools in Dublin West.  No primary school in Dublin West is to be for fewer than 1,000 pupils.  This is a bit of political magic because this is to happen on a site half the size of that for traditional primary schools.  On some of these half size sites there is to be an Educate Together school on one side of the site and a traditional Catholic parish school on the other side of the site.  What about activity and children being free to run around?  These are three-storey schools in half size sites with twice the number of pupils.  If this is what the Government is delivering to the parents of Dublin West all I can say is that when the general election comes, I hope they will give their answer.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_382">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_801">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the crucial issue of class size and compliment Deputy O'Sullivan on tabling the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">Education is another of the coalition's monumental failures.  This time the failure cannot be blamed on the Progressive Democrats as Fianna Fáil has held the education and science portfolio for all of the past ten years.  Probably the most glaring failure of all is the failure to reduce class size.  Everybody knows that the number of children in a class determines the amount of time and attention the individual child receives from the teacher.  Everybody also knows that if a child has learning difficulties and there is no time to address these difficulties in the classroom there is a real danger that child's education may be adversely affected and impacted upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">Small classes and early intervention contribute enormously to good quality learning and give a child the maximum opportunity to progress at the earliest stage in life and education.  The present nationwide campaign by the INTO highlights the extraordinary failure of the Government to properly resource Irish education.  While Ireland is top of the league of wealthy countries in the EU and the OECD it is second from the bottom in terms of class size.  The average class size in Lithuania is 15, in Ireland it is 24.  There are more than 100,000 pupils in primary schools taught in classes of more than 30 pupils.  This is totally unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">In 2002 the Government agreed in An Agreed Programme for Government that the average size of classes for children under nine years of age would be brought below the international best practice guideline of 20:1.  No action whatsoever was taken on this commitment by the Government until three years had expired.  Consequently, little or no progress has been made in reducing class size to date.  If the Government had delivered on its promise, two-thirds of all classes would have fewer than 20 pupils and all younger children up to the age of nine would be receiving the individual attention they are entitled to and so often need.  In reality, more than 80% of primary school children are in much bigger classes than were promised five years ago when this Government took office.  It is a sad and dismal fact that this Government has reneged on its promise to eight out of every ten pupils in schools in Ireland today.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">What is needed — what we will deliver in Government in any agreed programme and what is lacking in An Agreed Programme for Government to date — is a five year plan with targets set and audited for each year in terms of additional recruitment of staff, teachers, extra classrooms, planning ahead for new schools and the extra resources required to deliver on those commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">Cherishing the children of the national equally must be our priority at all times.  This was very difficult when Ireland was an impoverished country for more than 75 years since these words were written in the Proclamation in 1916.  Now we are a wealthy country but have become an impoverished society in the critical areas of health, housing and education.  That is the real failure of the Government.  It has failed the people, young and old, who most need its assistance.  The Minister's boast on education which is contained in the amendment is embarrassing.  It reads that she "welcomes the fact that last year there were 80,000 less primary school children in classes of 30 or more than in 1997."  It took ten years for the Minister to remove 80,000 children from classes of 30 or more not from classes of 20 or more, as was the target, or as in Lithuania, from classes of 15.  What an empty embarrassing boast.  The Minister should be ashamed to state that as part of her amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">In her amendment the Minister refers to investment in school buildings and modernisation under the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  Hard pressed parents throughout the length and breadth of Ireland know only too well of the failure of the Government to engage in spatial planning, to plan ahead so that when new developments take place no provision has been made for educational and community facilities.  Houses without schools are par for the course for this awful Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">In my constituency, Gaelscoil Barra has been waiting for ten years for a new school in Cabra.  Children have been taught in old dilapidated prefabs since 1997 when this Government came into office.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">On the eve of the 2002 election the Taoiseach avoided a protest march from Parnell Square by promising a new school if and when he was elected to a second term of office.  Now five years later the Minister has replied to a series of parliamentary questions from me in recent months and years in which she said she is working hard on delivering the school.  What is she doing?  She is still seeking a site after ten years and has begun to employ the services of her colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, who has responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  I wait in anticipation to see what the Taoiseach pulls out of the hat this time as the election looms over the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">This is a Government of failure.  It fails to provide for the elderly in terms of the health service and our children in terms of the education service.</p>

          <from>Ms Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_811">I wish to put the record straight.  It is a mistake to think the Government made a promise to reduce class sizes to 20:1 at the last election.  It was not during that election but during the 1997 general election that the promise was first made.  It was repeated at the last election.  The hypocrisy is amazing when one considers the Government did not deliver it in its first five years and made the promise again, which it has still not delivered.  People need to be reminded that a ten-year old promise has still not been delivered on.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">When the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, was appointed, it was as if it were a badge of honour that she said after several months that it could not be done.  She asks what are we all cribbing about.  I have some examples of what we are cribbing about.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">Class sizes in Cork are the worst with more than 30,000 children in Cork city and county in classes of 30 or more.  Overcrowded classrooms are not just bad for the child who needs special attention but also for exceptionally bright children.  Overcrowded classrooms mean the teacher simply does not have enough time to give each child the individual attention he or she needs.  As Deputy O'Sullivan has said, planning for education is not rocket science.  In an area with young couples, it should be known they will have children in five years and schools will be needed then.  There is an intervening period to ensure educational facilities are planned and provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">Last week, I received a telephone call from an angry parent with a child who falls into an unusual category.  It is a category that will become less unusual with more women entering the workplace.  There was no preschool available for the child in that part of Cork city.  The principal of a progressive school in the area decided to set up a class, in which there were 16 children, which she called Just Four.  The birthdays of these children fell in June, July and August.  In the normal run of affairs, those children would have started school in September when they would be too young.  The special class, Just Four, was devoted to preparing those children to enter primary school; the class motto was "Preparing to Learn".</p>
          <p eId="para_815">Recently, the principal was informed by the Department of Education and Science that the class's resources were to be stopped.  Those children, because they are already enrolled in the school, will have to go into senior infants.  They are not old enough for it but it is the only way they can remain in the school.  The caring Minister and her officials in the Department are aware of this situation as the principal has been in regular contact with them on this matter.  The school is in band 1 of DEIS but does not have an Early Start programme or its Just Four class.  The principal has been informed she will receive funding for a preschool on the existing school site.  That, however, does not solve the problem of those children who must go into senior infants.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">At the other end of the cycle is the leaving certificate.  I may be in a minority but I believe the leaving certificate as an examination is very egalitarian as each student is only identified by a number.  I was glad that Professor Áine Hyland, despite the former Minister's coaxing, found it was a most equal process.  How a child gets to the leaving certificate point can often show where inequality exists.  Like the children in the Just Four class, some children will go through school without the facilities found in other areas and will not be in an equal situation going into those types of examinations.  That is the type of inequality that must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">In Cork city, from the gate of St. Vincent's girls' primary school, one could hit the North Mon boys' primary school with a stone.  However, one school is in band 1 and the other in band 2 of DEIS.  This is despite the fact that siblings attend both schools.  The needs and social problems of the area are the same but the two schools are in different categories.  It is outrageous but it seems the Department of Education and Science is a law unto itself, doing exactly as it pleases.  It can deliberately disadvantage children who need all the support that should be available to them.  It can do this by removing them from particular bands and not providing the facilities to give them an equal chance when they come to the end of the educational cycle.  The Minister knows this as I have spoken to her on several occasions about it but she will continue to allow this to happen.  She will give us reams of statistics concerning the average class size, 500 extra secondary school teachers and so forth.  Yet, there are children in classes of 25 and 30 where, regardless of ability, none of them receives the attention he or she needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">When the Minister tells us about her concerns for education and class sizes, it is by her deeds we shall know her.  So far, the Minister's deeds are nothing to write home about.  There are areas that require special attention.  It is imperative that certain schools have Early Start programmes but they do not.  The teachers in those schools are not getting the type of incentive or encouragement they need to encourage children not just to stay in school but to achieve their best potential.  They cannot do so because they simply do not have the resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">It is the teachers who must face the parents, not the Minister for Education and Science or politicians when they knock on doors, and explain their children are in overcrowded classrooms and cannot be taught on an individual basis.  That is not right.  The Minister can make all the excuses and claim it is up to the boards of management.  That typical response from the Department of Education and Science is not true.  The allocation of resources is a matter for the Department of Education and Science which, in turn, is a matter for the Minister.  It is with the Minister that the buck stops.  We pay our Ministers well because they have particular responsibilities.  This is probably the one case where I will say that size does matter.  The size of a class will determine the attention a child will receive which in turn will determine their prospects.  It will have a major impact on all our futures.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_826">notes that as a result approximately 50,000 children from disadvantaged areas are already in much smaller classes;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_827">further notes the major increases in staffing supports for children with special needs, the improvements in the process for accessing such supports and the Government's commitment to the full implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004;</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_832">welcomes the provision of €4.5 billion for the school building and modernisation programme under the National Development Plan 2007-2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">The priority the Government has given to education is unparalleled.  In 1997, we took over from an Administration in which the current leaders of the two main Opposition parties had voted to freeze direct school funding and cut teacher numbers.  Investment in school buildings was minimal and provision for children with special needs in mainstream schools was virtually non-existent.  We set out to return education to the centre of Government policy, to increase investment and to improve outcomes, and we have succeeded in those aims.  A total of 10,000 extra teachers have been put in place.  Primary class sizes have been reduced to their lowest level ever.  Supports for children from disadvantaged areas and those with special needs have been dramatically improved.  Under the largest school building programme in Irish history, thousands of existing schools have been modernised, while many more new ones have been built.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">We are rightly proud of the significant increase in resources for education that has been put in place in a relatively short time, but it is the improvement in outcomes that matters most to us.  More young people than ever are finishing school.  With the creation of 45,000 extra college places and the success of targeted access initiatives, real breakthroughs have been made in the participation of students from disadvantaged areas in third level education.  At the same time, we have laid the foundations for a vibrant fourth level sector as the key to attracting even greater investment to Ireland.  We are fully aware of the many needs which have still to be addressed, but we are proud we have provided for the most sustained increase in funding and participation in the history of Irish education.</p>

          <p eId="para_836">Yes.  The Private Members' motion before the House concentrates on the areas of class sizes, special education and school planning.  Having visited more than 400 schools in two and a half years and met parents, teachers and students throughout the country in small one or two-teacher schools and in large schools with more than 1,000 pupils, I have seen at first hand the progress we have made.  I am happy to have the opportunity to outline what is being achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">First, I will address class size, which is an issue we take seriously.  There are now 10,000 more teachers on my Department's payroll than there were in 1997.  A total of 8,000 of these are primary teachers.  As a result of these increases in staffing, not only are children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas getting better support than ever before, but primary class sizes have been reduced to their lowest level ever.  When the Government came into office there were 80,000 more children in classes of more than 30 than there are now.  It is worth saying that.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">Over the past ten years, a revolution has taken place in our schools, with the largest increase in teacher numbers in Irish history.  The average primary class size has been reduced from 27 to 24.  With all the extra support teachers now in place, there is now one teacher for every 17 primary pupils, down from one for 22 in 1997.  While more remains to be done to reduce class sizes further, it should be acknowledged how much progress has been made in this area in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">It should also be acknowledged that, in providing 5,000 extra primary teachers since 2002, the Government had to decide how best to use these posts.  If all of them had gone into classroom teaching, our class sizes would be a lot smaller than they are today.  However, we decided, rightly in my view, to target children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas in the first instance, and in so doing we have greatly improved the teaching support available to such pupils.</p>

          <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_840">It was the Government that made the commitment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_390" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_841">With these areas now largely addressed, in the current school year extra teachers were provided to reduce class sizes and, as Deputies will be aware, the Government has already committed to providing another 800 primary school teachers next September.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">In the course of this debate, some Members will bring up examples of primary schools with which they are familiar that have large classes in particular grades and will try to claim these are typical of the situation in our school system as a whole, but that is not the case.  Not only is the average class size at national level now 24, but all primary schools are staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 pupils.  This is down from one teacher for 29 pupils in the last school year and it is being reduced to one for 27 from next September.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">It is important to appreciate there are a number of different reasons a particular school may have a large class in a given year.  Large classes can result from a significant fluctuation in enrolments from one year to the next.  They may also be the result of a decision by the school principal not to have multi-grade classes.  When I examine why a particular school has a class of 35 pupils in a particular grade, the reason is that there is another class in the same school with just 15 pupils.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">I appreciate that splitting classes may not always be an option because, for example, there might be a large group in junior infants and a small group in sixth class and so on.  However, where it is possible, I believe principals should consider the benefits of having smaller multi-grade classes as against having large differences in class sizes at different levels in the school.</p>

          <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_392" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_846">Multi-grade classes are the norm in the majority of primary schools which are small schools that have four teachers or fewer.  There is no evidence that being taught in a multi-grade setting is to the detriment of the child.  The opposite is the case.  Perhaps more principals should consider multi-grade classes where they are in the best interests of pupils who might otherwise find themselves in large classes.  During this debate, we will not hear of the small rural schools that have only two or three teachers, the island schools where there is only one teacher or the very disadvantaged schools, to which I will return.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">The Government accepts that smaller class sizes at junior level can make a difference.  That is why we have reduced and will continue to reduce class sizes in our primary schools.  However, there is considerable evidence to show reductions in class size must be accompanied by a change in teaching styles to achieve all the benefits.  Teacher quality and the work the teacher is doing in the classroom are even more significant than the size of the class.  The two go hand in hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">For my part, I have prioritised increased investment in teacher professional development to ensure teachers get the ongoing training they need to stay at the top of their game and maintain the high quality we have at present.  My Department has also conducted and commissioned excellent research, such as the recent report on reading levels in our schools, which provides invaluable information and guidance for teachers on practical ways to improve outcomes for pupils.  Examples of best practice in a range of curriculum areas have been sent to schools and new support services have been set up to assist them.  I am committed to ensuring the highest quality of education in our schools.  I know all partners will work with me to ensure that this is the case, as we continue to increase the numbers of teachers in our schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">The Private Members' motion also refers to class sizes in disadvantaged schools.  I am happy to inform the House there are now in the region of 50,000 primary school children from disadvantaged areas in classes of 15 or 20 at junior level and 20 or 24 at senior level.  The number of children benefiting from smaller classes was expanded with the introduction of the DEIS action plan.  This plan was an independent, objective process based on information provided by schools.  Teacher numbers is only one factor that impacts on children's achievement.  For this reason, smaller classes is just one of the many different types of extra support being provided under DEIS.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">Anybody who thinks that simply reducing the sizes of classes in disadvantaged areas is all that is needed to improve outcomes does not understand the nature of educational disadvantage and the multifaceted approach needed to tackle it.  It is because the Government understands all the different factors involved that we have ensured that, in addition to smaller classes, children in primary schools serving the most disadvantaged communities are also benefiting from special literacy and numeracy programmes with intensive extra tuition to help pupils with difficulties at an early stage.  In addition, after-school and holiday time supports, including homework clubs and summer camps, are provided.  Extra funding has also been provided for school book schemes and school meals.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">We are also conscious of the positive impact working with parents in disadvantaged areas can have on children's progress.  Accordingly, the home-school-community liaison scheme has been extended.  New teachers have been recruited for that scheme and a new family literacy initiative is being developed in co-operation with the National Adult Literacy Agency and other partners.  We believe this comprehensive package of extra support for children and their parents will improve attainment levels in disadvantaged areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">We know the scale of the challenges facing children and young people in disadvantaged areas but we are confident they can be overcome.  Even before the DEIS plan was put in place, there was evidence that the extra investment targeted at disadvantaged areas by this Government between 1997 and 2005 made a difference.  By 2005, 85.8% of Irish 20 to 24 year olds had attained upper second level education or equivalent, up from 82.6% in 2000.  This has put Ireland considerably ahead of the EU average of 77.5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">This progress is reflected in the fact that the number of young people from areas such as Finglas, Ballymun and the inner city going to third level doubled between 1998 and 2004.  I accept we need to do much more to improve educational outcomes in disadvantaged areas, which we are doing under DEIS, but the progress made in recent years should be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">I am sure Deputies will be pleased to hear there is now one teacher for every 13 students at second level, down from one for 16 in 1997.  As Deputies are aware, schools are accorded a considerable local discretion in the way in which they organise matters of subject choice, teacher allocation and class size.  That naturally leads to variations in the size of classes, with some being very small where not many students opt for a subject or level.  The most recent edition of the OECD report Education at a Glance gave an indication of how the size of second level classes in Ireland compared with those in other OECD countries in the 2003-04 school year.  The report found that the average class size at junior cycle in Ireland was, at 19.8, considerably lower than the OECD average of 23.8.  While it is for school principals to decide how they organise their classes, it is clear that in the last year for which comparative data are available our second level class sizes compared well with those in other OECD states.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">The motion before the House this evening also refers to special education, another area in which major progress has been made by the Government.  It is the improvement in supports for children with special needs in recent years of which I am most proud.  There is no doubt that the record of the State over decades in providing for children with special needs was very poor and that we are still playing catch-up.  However, significant advances have been made, improving the lives of many children with special needs and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">There are now 15,000 adults in our mainstream primary schools working solely with children with special needs, compared with a fraction of that number a few years ago.  As well as providing for substantial increases in staff, we have also improved procedures for accessing extra support.  A guaranteed allocation of resource teaching hours has been made to all primary schools, replacing the need for an individual assessment for each child.  That was never promised and never part of any programme for Government.</p>

          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_858">The increased allocation will ensure that, for the first time, each school will have resource teaching to meet children's individual needs.  That was the priority that we set, and I stand by it.  We have put a team of 80 local special educational needs organisers on the ground to work with parents and teachers and help them get the appropriate support for their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">At second level, nearly 1,900 whole-time-equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special needs, compared with approximately 200 in 1998.  In addition, there are more than 500 whole-time-equivalent learning support teachers and approximately 1,400 whole-time-equivalent special needs assistants in our second level schools.  More than €820 million is being provided for special education in 2007 — €180 million, or nearly 30%, more than in the 2006 Estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Further improvements in services are on the way, with the roll-out of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  The Act provides for an educational assessment for children with special needs and the entitlement to an individual educational plan.  It also provides for parents to be consulted and informed at different stages of the process.  Parents will also have recourse to an independent appeals board, which will have the power to compel bodies, including the Health Service Executive, to take specific action to address matters before it.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">While many sections of the Act have already commenced, the remaining sections relate mainly to the statutory assessment and education plan process for which it provides.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, recently submitted its implementation report to me, which sets out its views and recommendations on a plan for the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  That is being considered by my officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">Guidelines regarding devising and implementing individual education plans have already been issued to schools by the NCSE.  It is the council's intention that those guidelines provide a benchmark for best practice pending the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 and that schools use them to draw up school policies and procedures regarding individual education plans in advance of the mandatory requirement for them to do so.  Once the relevant provisions in the Act have been commenced, it is envisaged that the guidelines will have statutory effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">I assure Deputies that the Government will continue to prioritise extra resources for children with special needs to allow the full implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">The final issue before the House tonight relates to the school planning process.  Reversing the effects of decades of underinvestment in existing schools and providing new ones in areas of growing population has been a major priority for the Government.  Under the largest school building programme in the history of the State, we are spending over €540 million on school buildings in 2007, compared with only approximately €90 million in 1997.  Thousands of schools have benefited from the €3 billion provided for school buildings since 1997.  A great many more will benefit from record investment of €4.5 billion in the school building and modernisation programme under the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  The level of work being done under the school building programme is at an all-time high.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">While increased investment has been a central reason, changes in how projects are managed have also made a major difference.  Not only are we spending more than five times what was provided for school buildings in 1997; the innovations made in the design and delivery processes for school building projects are also helping to achieve ever greater success.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">Some 1,100 schools have been approved for projects under the summer works scheme this year.  That innovative scheme, which allows schools to get small projects done over the summer holidays, did not exist when we entered office, and schools waited very many years for improvements such as rewiring, new roofs and windows.  Now, when the school gates close for the summer, the builders move in, and the students come back to an improved environment just a few months later.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">To reduce red tape and allow projects to move faster, responsibility for smaller projects has been devolved to school level.  I recently announced details of more than 250 schools approved for works under the small schools initiative and the permanent accommodation scheme, neither of which existed until 2003.  Standard designs have also been developed for eight- and 16-classroom schools to facilitate speedier delivery of projects and save on design fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">In addition to those changes, particular focus has been put on improving forward planning through the publication of area development plans and greater co-operation with local authorities.  In 2004 my Department adopted an area-based approach to school planning whereby, through a public consultation process involving all interested parties, a blueprint for schools' development in an area is set out over a ten-year timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">The areas covered in the pilot phase of that new approach to school planning include the rapidly developing areas of north Dublin, south Louth and east Meath, and the N4-M4 corridor running from Leixlip to Kilbeggan, including all rapidly developing towns and villages in that belt.  In addition to improving our own planning processes, we are also naturally anxious to ensure that education be central to the planning decisions being made by local authorities.  As Deputies will be aware, my Department must be informed by local authorities of all development planning processes at county and sub-county level.  That ensures that the Department is alerted about new and expanding residential areas and affords an opportunity to safeguard appropriate zoning provision for educational purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">However, as well as ensuring that sufficient education provision is included in local authority development plans, there is significant scope for greater co-operation between my Department and local authorities to fast-track the delivery of schools and community facilities.  Agreement has been reached with Fingal County Council on a new partnership approach to do precisely that.  Under that arrangement, and based on the school planning projections of the Department, Fingal County Council will identify and acquire appropriate sites where schools with enhanced sporting, community and arts facilities are to be built.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">In practice, the local authority will identify the sites when adopting local area plans.  The council will go on to acquire sufficient land as recommended by the Department on which an appropriately sized school or schools for that local area can be built.  In return, the design of the schools on those sites will be varied to meet community needs identified by the council.  The range of enhanced combination facilities will include full-size sports halls, stage and dressing rooms, community meeting rooms, all-weather pitches and playgrounds.  Those additional facilities, which will be over and above the Department's standard specifications for schools, will be available not only to the school during normal school hours but also to the local community in the evenings, at weekends and during school holidays.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">The Department will benefit from major savings on the cost of school sites, as the council will make land in its ownership available at a reduced cost and negotiate the purchase of lands from developers at a lower cost.  In return, the Department will invest part of the savings achieved in enhanced sports or community facilities, which will also be funded by the county council.  That model will be used in Fingal to deliver approximately 20 schools.  I am anxious to see that partnership approach replicated throughout the country and urge Deputies to use any influence they have on their local councils to encourage them to follow Fingal's lead.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">Another provision allowing local authorities to ensure that schools are in place when needed is, of course, the strategic development zone process.  Using that model, the Department is working closely with South Dublin County Council and developers to produce an integrated solution to education and community facilities in Adamstown that matches the delivery of new housing.  The strategic development zone for Adamstown requires that housing and supporting infrastructure, including schools, be provided in a phased manner.  It is a condition of the strategic development zone that, on completion of phase 2, with a maximum of 1,800 housing units, a primary school of eight classrooms or a post-primary school of 12 classrooms be in place.  Each additional housing phase requires the provision of further school accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">Such an approach ensures that schools are in position ahead of, or in line with, demand, and it should be adopted by other planning authorities regarding major new housing schemes.  Major progress is evident across the whole spectrum of education.  It is particularly evident in the improvements in school staffing, prioritising children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas, reducing class sizes this year and last year, and providing unprecedented investment in school buildings.  We know that challenges remain, but we are also confident that we have put the investment, policies and priorities in place to address these challenges.</p>

However, having read through the Private Members' motion last week when it was first published and having re-examined it today, I consider it to be a missed opportunity on the part of both main Opposition parties, but particularly on the part of the Labour Party which tabled the motion.

          <p eId="para_884">I have been teaching since 1967.  I moved into a so-called new school in 1974, which was hardly more than a hovel.  Its roof has had to be replaced three times in the intervening period and it has had a major revamp.  If Governments comprising the main Opposition parties had made the necessary investment in those years, such a revamp would not have been required.  I have heard that parents cannot find school places for their children, but the vast majority of school students where I taught were bussed to schools in the inner city.  There was no planning either, but I will not dwell on the past.  I wish to talk about what this Government's record demonstrates.  When we came into office in 1997, ground-breaking legislation was introduced, which now underpins education.  Ministers, including Deputies Martin, Woods and Hanafin, have been responsible for the body of legislation covering primary and secondary education.</p>

          <from>Mr. Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_886">Anyone with any association with teaching will remember the famous rules and regulations in primary schools comprising circular letters each September as they came in from the Department.  There was no consultation or advanced planning.  Nothing was being done at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">I do not want to go back over everything the Minister said but it is important to remember the investment that has been made in schools.  The vast majority of schools in the Dublin area that required upgrading have been upgraded.  Some three weeks ago, I visited a school with an enrolment of approximately 110 infants.  I counted 27 people working with that group of children, including ancillary staff, classroom teachers and resource staff.  There are challenges of course and that is as it should be.  We need to examine how teaching is currently delivered and the Minister adverted to this in her speech.  This brings me back to what I said earlier.  It is a great pity that some valuable resources were taken out of the teacher training sector at that time.  I hope that this Government, along with others who might be associated with planning future education policy, will examine innovative ways of ensuring we have the best possible teaching practices available.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">Some time ago, we saw a report by inspectors who found that a substantial number of trainee teachers were not effectively delivering the lessons they were being asked to teach in the classroom.  There is no doubt that hard questions need to be addressed by the teaching unions and those who operate teacher training colleges as to how we can improve the pedagogy which is a fundamental requirement of any good educational system.  From time to time, it is no harm to compare ourselves with other countries through OECD reports.  We should not be afraid to look at the blind spots we may have in our system.  A number of years ago, who would have envisaged that we would require so many specialist teachers of English in our schools?  That probably could not have been anticipated but the matter now needs to be addressed.  Language instruction has not always been the strongest point in Irish education, whether it concerns the teaching of Irish, English or foreign languages.  That area needs to be addressed and we have an opportunity to do so now.  While much has been achieved, some school classes are still too large but the numbers are decreasing all the time.  I have no doubt that, given the investment in a further 800 teachers this year and another 800 or more in the coming academic year, class sizes will be reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">We need to examine teaching methodologies.  In 1974, when I moved into the school to which I referred earlier, the building had shared areas.  Unfortunately, however, such areas became unfashionable later and within five years we were broken down into standard classrooms again.  In retrospect that was not a good move.  With the current availability of resources, there are now opportunities we did not have heretofore, which will allow us to examine better teaching methods.  It is not always about information technology, although sometimes that is essential.  I do not wish to disparage the importance of IT, but a lot of teaching involves standing in front of a class and making a serious effort to impart knowledge to students.  I am not suggesting that it should be done by rote, but teaching does involve some old-fashioned reinforcement of information that children cannot otherwise acquire easily.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">Recently, I saw a report on the Cherry Orchard model whereby the progression of preschool, primary and secondary education is provided almost seamlessly on the same campus.  I firmly believe the day is fast approaching when that model will be adopted everywhere, although I accept it is not always possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">School principals can work together under the aegis of the home-school liaison scheme.  In Ballymun, for example, 16 principals meet regularly to plan, develop and implement an agreed syllabus for that area, in co-operation with parents and the Department's inspectors and other specialist staff.  That is the way forward.  I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I look forward to hearing the visionary statements from the Opposition.</p>

          <p eId="para_893">This motion is timely as the appalling record on education of the Government must be put on the record of the Dáil.  I was interested to hear the remarks of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, and her colleague, Deputy Carey, who started with a dissertation on the Opposition and then pointed out, in his own words, the issues that need to be addressed.  The Deputy seemed to forget that his party has been in office for almost ten years and has had ample opportunity to deal with the issues before us tonight, many of which have not been addressed.</p>

          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_895">Every stage in the education system is equally important, from preschool to third and fourth level learning.  Education is a vital tool with which people can change their lives and livelihoods.  However, if a child or a young person falls outside the education system early in his or her schooling it is extremely difficult to get them to re-engage in learning at a later date.  In short, this means that both preschool and primary education is of particular importance to all people and getting the best start, in educational terms, makes all the difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">We know that the unacceptable rate of early school leaving at second level has been unchallenged by the Government and I was amazed by the Minister's statement in this regard tonight.  She suggested that more young people than ever are finishing school.  Replies to several parliamentary questions we tabled have indicated that 1,000 children still fail to make the transition from primary to post primary level and that there is a sharp urban-rural divide on retention rates to leaving certificate level, with Dublin city running at 69% compared to Roscommon at 86%.  Only 72.1% of boys and 83.3% of girls complete the leaving certificate examination and answers to parliamentary questions in recent years indicate that this statistic has not improved.  I do not see how more young people than ever are finishing school, as the Minister suggested, unless there has been a population bulge in recent years that has increased the overall number of young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">We have documented evidence that the literacy standards of children from disadvantaged backgrounds have not improved over the lifetime of this Administration.  The seeds of many of these educational problems are sown at a very young age, yet the Government has failed to recognise this fact by supporting preschool and primary education.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">While this evening's motion deals with primary level education, I wish to briefly comment that the lack of preschool opportunities for many children in our society is a crying shame.  I accept that Ireland, unlike many European countries, does not have a strong tradition of preschool education.  However, the educational benefits that accrue to children in the short term and the long term from access to preschools are well documented.  A deeply regrettable lack of vision on the part of the Government has meant that the provision of preschool has not been advanced.  The Government has been in power for a full decade, yet it has not put forward a clear statement or plan of action to ensure that all children have access to preschool education within a defined timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">At primary level the inadequacies of the Government are very clear.  Though maximum class guidelines are set at 28 pupils per teacher, the reality is that more than 110,000 primary school children are in classes of 30 or more.  At a time when the education system is going through a period of rapid change and expansion, the delivery of new buildings continues at a very slow pace.  Teachers now face many new challenges, such as the diversity in our schools and classrooms, but the Government response has been slow, insufficient and out of touch.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are quickly moving from out of touch to out of time.  The Government has had a chance to govern and has failed children, young people, teachers and parents.  Why, after ten years of government by Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats, is the process of getting clearance for a new classroom akin to climbing a Mount Everest of red tape?  Why, after ten years of government by Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats, are many schools still unclear as to their position on the school building programme and how long they will have to wait for new school buildings?  Under the Minister it is no longer possible to check the progress of applications on-line.  At least that was possible when Deputy Dempsey, whom Deputy Carey forgot to mention, was Minister for Education and Science.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">Why, after ten years of this Government, have schools, given the go-ahead for new buildings, yet to see a new block or brick laid?  A Fine Gael survey recently found that, of the schools given the green light for new works in the past 18 months, more than 80% had not proceeded to construction stage.  Why, eight years after the establishment of the national educational psychological service, are 50% of primary schools still outside the realm of the service?  The Minister repeatedly refers to the weighted system but she is missing the point as it is a waiting system that faces our children.  Almost every school in the country has children awaiting an assessment and the provision of a different, weighted, system does not address the needs of many such children.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">Why, five years after all teachers were promised a laptop computer to help them to teach, are they still waiting?  Why, three years after the announced introduction of standardised testing at primary level, are we still waiting for the tests to take place?  At the education estimates committee meeting earlier today I asked the Minister for Education and Science a question on standardised testing and she admitted that her Department would only gather the results from this testing from schools in the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, programme.  This means that the standardised testing results for thousands of schools will not be gathered; that there will be standardised testing but no information on the results of that testing.  Not only will the results not be published, they will not even be available to the Department of Education and Science so these tests will achieve nothing.  The results will be private information available only to the individual schools in question.  That is ridiculous and it makes a joke of standardised testing.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">The Government has failed to join the dots and we can no longer afford to look at every problem from the heart of central Government.  A new approach is required, one which reforms how the Government works, how individual schools function and how local authorities and planning and development laws incorporate the needs of wider society.  It seems this type of co-ordinated approach to planning for the future of our education system is not in place.  Over the coming five years it is estimated by the Department of Education and Science that the number of children at primary school level will increase by close to 60,000.  We will need about 2,300 classrooms to accommodate them.  Who among us has confidence that if this less than dynamic duo of Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats is returned to power we will have these necessary classrooms by 2012?</p>
          <p eId="para_904">In conjunction with better planning from central Government, a key aspect of the Fine Gael approach to primary education is to empower schools to plan for their own development and address the specific challenges they face.  Day in and day out, schools are working with vulnerable children and young people.  Many have initiatives in place, some without direct funding, some with funding from other Departments, that are helping to keep young children in school and improve their education.  For one school keeping children engaged and learning might depend on giving them a decent breakfast.  For another the way to a child's mind might be through a homework club or a computer class.  In education, what works should be supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">Fine Gael is committed to establishing a schools excellence fund, starting with €100 million, which schools can access directly to provide additional services for pupils.  In addition to more mainstream supports this fund would be used by schools to support innovative initiatives to tackle literacy and numeracy problems and to support the recruitment of new teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">Overcrowded classes will be tackled as, despite grandiose promises to reduce class sizes, the Government has failed to improve the situation in many classrooms in all parts of the country.  Given the projected increase in pupil numbers at primary level the matter must be prioritised for action.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">The Minister for Education and Science washed her hands of the issue of class sizes as quickly as she could when she assumed office.  In Government Fine Gael will concentrate additional resources on dealing with the 110,000 children in classes of 30 or more.  We want to see class sizes reduced across the board, but we believe that the real drive must first be to address the unacceptably large classes in schools.  In tandem with a reduction in unacceptably large class sizes, we believe that it is crucial that junior classes have fewer numbers as the formative years in a child's development are most important.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">We are all aware of the significant problems that schools in urban areas face, with 35 and 36 children being taught in many classrooms.  However, we cannot overlook rural schools where, in addition to the problem of overcrowding, there is the challenge of teaching children of different ages and stages in multi-classes.  I disagree with the Minister who made this sound like a very simple thing to do — teachers mixing junior and senior infants with first and second class pupils in one classroom will attest that it is a near impossible task that requires support.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">A review of retention figures is necessary as we need to build some flexibility into the current system which allows schools to lose a teacher if one family and one child leaves a community.  We must examine the rules governing developing schools to ensure that schools which are growing in size substantially and quickly are awarded the resources they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">In terms of local planning, the disconnection between the provision of housing and the provision of schools must end.  I accept that the system in Fingal is working, but that is not replicated around the country.  I was recently approached by a planner who wanted to know if a school was to be provided in a particular area so he could make a decision.  He felt it would be irresponsible of him to make a planning decision without knowing if one would be provided, yet there is no legal compulsion for him to take such responsibility.  I was not in a position to answer the question as answering questions on planning decisions is not the job of any TD.  However, this incident indicates the lack of a proper planning structure.  Fine Gael will ensure that local authorities have the power to require that the provision of sites for community buildings such as schools, or payments towards such facilities, will be part of new residential developments.  While local authorities award planning permissions for new housing, they often take a back seat in planning for school development.  Why should the authority that awards planning for housing developments not also consider the future educational needs of those living in its area?  To ensure local authorities can plan properly for the educational needs of their communities, the Fine Gael Party, in Government, will ensure that all local authorities draw up specific development plans for the provision of educational facilities in their areas over ten-year periods.  We will also prioritise the delivery of preschool education for all young children.  Increasingly, educationalists point to the preschool period, usually the year before a child enrols in full-time education, as being of critical importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">There is no single solution to the problems our schools face.  An agenda for action on a number of fronts, which places a high priority on delivering for children with special educational needs, driving down class sizes, giving schools greater autonomy in planning for their future and meeting the needs of their pupils, and reform of our approach to education, will lead to the best solution to the challenges our schools face.  The Government promised many things to parents, teachers and pupils but failed utterly to deliver on its commitments.  Our agenda for reform is achievable and, when delivered, the education sector will be significantly enhanced to serve the best interests of all children and young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">I have no doubt the best fiction on television this weekend will be on RTE 1 at 8.30 p.m. on Saturday when we will hear Fianna Fáil rededicate itself to unfulfilled promises on class size for the third election in a row.  I ask people to think seriously about falling for such promises again.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_409">
          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_913">I congratulate the Labour Party and Deputy O'Sullivan on tabling this important motion.  I distinctly recall that the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties announced with great fanfare a definitive programme to dramatically reduce class sizes before the previous general election.  This programme did not materialise.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">Parents, teachers and boards of management in every school will not allow the Celtic tiger to come and go without having the issue of class size addressed.  I have not seen anything like the crowds who attended recent public meetings on this issue.  Last week, 1,000 people turned up for one such meeting in Loughrea.  They did not come for fun but because they believe the Government has not delivered on certain promises and want to know if Fine Gael and the Labour Party would be better.  I sincerely hope we will do certain things better than the Government when we get the chance.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">Addressing the problem of class sizes will mean recruiting extra teachers and rejuvenating the schools building programme in parallel.  I am a long time dealing with this issue and I have never seen such trouble as that experienced in having a small extension made to a school, whether the smallest school in County Galway or the biggest school in the largest urban town.  Why are ten specific steps necessary, usually over a ten-year period, to bring a school building project from conception to completion?  Given that we can build 90,000 houses in one year without any trouble, why can we not build a few additional school classrooms without such a rigmarole?  Where is the featherbedding?  Is the number of people and agencies involved such that the Department cannot cut to the chase to ensure works are completed quickly?  How can a Government stand over the current position?  Most young parents are asking these questions.  Following the forthcoming general election, the new Minister for Education and Science will be able to take immediate steps to overcome the current bottleneck.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">In County Galway alone, 2,600 children are in classes of between 36 and 40 pupils.  Can Deputies imagine a teacher trying to do his or her best in an overcrowded room?  I have had no involvement in the education sector other than in my capacity as a parent.  Some of my children have been through the system and become teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">In large classes teachers control rather than teach.  They are barely able to control their classes and are unable to teach, facilitate interaction between pupil and teacher and bring out the best in their students, as they have been trained to do.  How can one expect a teacher to be able to achieve these objectives in a classroom in which there is no room to swing a cat?</p>
          <p eId="para_918">In fairness to Deputy Carey it is evident he has served as a dedicated teacher.  Unfortunately, I must conclude.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_919">I welcome the opportunity to speak to this important motion and thank the Labour Party and its spokesperson on education, Deputy O'Sullivan, for tabling it.  During the most recent general election campaign, the then Minister for Education and Science gave a commitment to reduce class sizes.  When the current Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, was appointed she did not row back on the promise.  The Government should be ashamed of its failure to meet its commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">I and Deputies from both sides of the House have attended meetings organised by the Irish National Teachers Organisation.  Last week, more than 400 parents, teachers and others attended one such meeting in County Wexford, which was bursting at the seams with people who have a genuine interest in class sizes.  I was struck by how members of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats spoke out of both sides of their mouths.  A Fianna Fáil councillor said she could not understand the reason the problem of class sizes had not been raised in Dáil Éireann.

          <p eId="para_921">Deputy Connaughton referred to the schools building programme.  The Department must undertake an internal review of the programme.  I have made so many telephone calls, written so many letters and tabled so many parliamentary questions to an official named Alan McIntyre that I could be forgiven for mistaking him for my brother.  The school building section of the Department in Tullamore is a scandal.  I apologise to Deputy Enright in whose constituency the office is located.  An internal review must be carried out quickly to sort out the problems in the schools building programme.  This review must be given priority if class sizes are to be reduced.  While I accept it is not as simple as recruiting additional teachers, the Government has not made any major proposals to simplify procedures for completing schools building projects.</p>

          <p eId="para_932">Tá brón orm nach raibh mé ábalta a bheith i láthair ag tús an díospóireacht ar an Chéim seo.  I am sorry I was not in the Chamber for the commencement of Report Stage, but I had to attend a meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">This amendment is designed to strengthen the hand of the authority to hold the Health Service Executive to account.  It provides for ongoing monitoring by the authority of the executive's compliance with its rulings.  The HSE must be fully held to account.  There can be little doubt in the minds of any in this House that the HSE has become what I can only describe as an enormous and unaccountable quango, with no democratic accountability whatsoever.  With all its flaws, the former health board system had a much greater level of accountability and transparency, most importantly courtesy of the input of democratically elected members of local authorities, who played an important role in its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">The HSE has become an enormous and unaccountable quango and that is perfectly illustrated by the way in which information relating to its work is now more difficult than ever for Members to ascertain.  Members of this House will know that only too well.  We have seen the ever-increasing percentage of questions tabled to the Minister for Health and Children and the Ministers of State at the Department that are referred directly to the HSE.  The figure in this regard represents an increase of almost 35% on what applied during the previous Minister's term in office.  Despite the repeated promises and commitments made by the parliamentary affairs division of the HSE, we continue to encounter inordinate delays in responses to parliamentary questions.  In my experience, these delays are generally measured in months rather than days or weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">I and other Members warned of this lack of democratic accountability when the health boards were abolished.  In return, the Government promised greater efficiency and committed to the better delivery of health care services across the board, but the opposite has happened.  We now have a seriously deficient health service at every level, from acute hospital services across the entire range of services.  There are grave concerns and difficulties are experienced by service users.  There is great discontent among direct employees, those who deliver the service at the coalface, and this has been particularly exemplified recently by the members of the Irish Nurses Organisation and the Psychiatric Nurses Association.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">The public hospital system is clearly in a deepening crisis, the primary care strategy has been virtually abandoned, MRSA is endemic and the HSE is being used to implement the privatisation of services through what can only be described as the infamous co-location project, which is very much the baby of the current Minister and which reinforces the two-tier system that is at the root of many of our problems.  The HSE and the Minister must be held to account.  The HIQA may provide the means to do this, and therefore, I urge the adoption of this amendment.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, is in the position to give us an affirmation of its acceptance.</p>

        <speech by="#TimOMalleyPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_417">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O’Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_937">This amendment is very similar to one moved by Deputy McManus on Committee Stage.  The position is as follows.  Under section 7(1), HIQA is required to monitor compliance with standards it sets, other than those standards set on services inspected by the chief inspector of social services.  Under the Bill, "designated centres" are residential centres for children in need of care and protection, residential services for people with disabilities and residential centres for older people, including private nursing homes.  Designated centres must be registered by the chief inspector of social services if they are to operate.  If designated centres do not meet HIQA standards, they will not be registered by the chief inspector.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">The Bill also amends the Health Act 2004 to require the HSE to have regard to other standards set by HIQA in so far as is practicable and subject to the resources available to the executive.  It is envisaged that service agreements between the HSE and service providers, under the 2004 Act, will contain appropriate provisions regarding adherence to HIQA standards.  Given the extensive powers given to HIQA for monitoring compliance with standards, I believe the level of compliance will be very much evident.  Accordingly, I do not intend to accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_939">I am disappointed the Minister of State's response is negative.  I am not certain whether the response to the previous ten amendments followed the same pattern.  However, if this is the pattern of the Government approach, it is on a collision course with Opposition voices.  The Government seems unprepared and unwilling to accept reasonable amendments which seek to improve and strengthen the legislation which is severely deficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">It is critically important that the HSE is held to account and that it is seen to be the case that there is open, transparent accountability applied to all its work and decisions and that the public's confidence is built through such an exercise.  That confidence cannot reach the standards we desire until such time as the structures are changed to ensure there is democratic accountability and that the Minister who presides over the Department and the HSE — although she would have us believe she does not — or someone in that role in the future once again takes full and accountable charge of the delivery of health services in this jurisdiction.  This is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">Again, I commend the amendment to the Minister of State and appeal to him to reconsider the response he already offered.</p>

          <p eId="para_951">Consistent with the national health information strategy, section 7 confers a number of information related functions on HIQA.  Those functions are interrelated and are designed to ensure the authority can examine and evaluate existing information systems, provide advice and make recommendations to the Minister and HSE about deficiencies and set appropriate standards for the HSE and service providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">I understand the intention behind the Deputy's amendment, but believe it could limit HIQA in its information evaluation function and consequently impact adversely on its other information functions.  As a specialist body, HIQA must not be constrained in how it examines our complex health information environment.  The new section setting out the objectives of HIQA is sufficient to provide proper guidance in this area.  The sort of information the Deputy seeks to include in the provision is by its nature the sort of management information with which the HSE should be concerned and is far too detailed to be included in legislation.  For these reasons, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_956">While I appreciate the principle behind this amendment, it is not a good idea for HIQA to revisit past events.  HIQA is a new body with a new mandate and its role will be to prevent the mistakes of the past recurring, through quality-based and patient safety driven standards, accompanied by better information systems rather than by investigating them.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">We have a range of existing mechanisms that can be used to investigate historical matters, for example, the legislation introduced by the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  This legislation would allow investigations in the health area.  It would be inappropriate for a body such as HIQA to begin by conducting historical investigations.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_424">
          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_958">That is a great pity.  We do not propose an indefinite backward period.  That HIQA does not have a role in this regard undermines its strength and supports the argument made by those on this side of the House for a patient safety authority.  If we look at the record on health, we see that many serious scandals were only unearthed a long time after they began.  The Dr. Neary case is a good example of this.  It took a long time, even after the health board acted, for the full story to unfold and for justice to begin to be done.  It is a pity that it takes a while to expose such situations within the health service.  This is not being established on a greenfield site as if nothing had ever happened before the establishment of HIQA.  In fact HIQA should have been set up at the same time as the HSE.  That was the deal, and the structure was to be such that there would be a watchdog and a new form of management.  We never got the watchdog although we got the new form of management which is not always a pretty sight.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">The watchdog being introduced has such limited powers that "watchdog" is probably not an accurate term.  It is disappointing that HIQA's brief does not include assessing hospitals or investigating other issues.  Much was promised with HIQA.  It was rolled over with the inspectorate of nursing homes which was not its original function.  It was to be an independent authority that would protect the patient.  We must wait, however, for a new Government to establish a patient safety authority for a secure system that people can trust.  That authority will listen to complaints rather than say that it cannot pay attention to incidents that happened before the date of this legislation, no matter how bad they were.  How will HIQA learn if not from past experience?  Is that not the best way for us all to learn?</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_965">(<i>a</i>) the report of the investigation shall be absolutely privileged,</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_966">(<i>b</i>) due process and fair procedures shall be observed,</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_967">(<i>c</i>) any person called to give evidence, shall be allowed legal representation if he or she so requests, and there shall be a duty on any person conducting an investigation to inform such a person of his or her right in that respect, and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_968">(<i>d</i>) there shall be a duty of cooperation on any member of staff of the service provider save where such a person receives legal advice to the contrary.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">In the earlier debate on the amendment to this Bill I asked the Minister of State to explain whether it covered certain examples, such as the two midwives from Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  This legislation does not protect them but they are covered under other legislation which provides for client privilege which entitles someone to make a complaint to a solicitor who protects his clients if he passes the complaint on to an authority such as the former health board.  Had the two midwives in question approached anyone outside the mythical chain of command that the Department has set up they would not have been protected.  The Minister of State describes this structure as independent but we know it will be deeply involved with the Health Service Executive, HSE, in some form or other and will not be as independent as he thinks.  It is always necessary to protect people.  Each time I put these questions to him the Minister of State referred to the advice he was receiving to get himself out of the problem rather than state the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">I also raised the issue of a general practitioner trainer who might pass on his concern about one of those he was training to the HSE.  The trainer would not be covered because he or she has no contract for training a GP.  It might sound unbelievable to the Minister of State that 150 GPs are trained every year but there is no contract with the trainers.  The legislation does not cover someone such as a consultant employed by Deloitte &amp; Touche to examine PPARS who might express concerns about the system.  This shows the deficiency in the whistleblowers amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">My amendment approaches the issue from the other side.  Although we on this side of the House have always told the Government it needs to wake up and root out the poor nursing homes there is a serious need, which the Minister often does not realise, to protect natural justice because the HSE can and does abuse its position.  At one time parents caring for foster children with autism expressed doubt that they could cope.  The HSE did not send in psychologists, social workers or extra home helps, it sent in the A-Team to kick down the door and grab the children.  In this way it can sometimes abuse its clout.  This amendment aims to protect everybody's constitutional rights.  We want to make sure that people being investigated are made fully aware of their legal rights so that we can always be sure of proceeding in the proper manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">When this matter was raised on Committee Stage the Minister said she would consider this issue and respond to us.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TimOMalleyPD" eId="spk_428" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
          <from>Mr. T. O’Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_973">My legal advice is that absolute privilege, which is a complete defence to a defamation action applies even where the words complained of are published with knowledge of their falsehood and with the intention of injuring another.  While I do not believe that reports of investigations will contain deliberate falsehood or be slanted in any way I am reluctant to include such a wide provision on privilege in the Bill.  The Minister stated on Committee Stage that the legal advice available to her was that a person undertaking an investigation or inspection and making a report would have qualified privilege.  He or she would have a defence in a defamation case where statements were made in good faith.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">In view of the Deputy's concerns in the matter, further legal advice was taken in regard to what provisions, if any, might be included.  Accordingly, having consulted further and concerned to ensure that there is no ambiguity or lack of clarity on this important issue, I am tabling amendment No. 32 which expressly provides for qualified privilege in respect of reports or documents prepared by, or communications made by HIQA, an authorised person, the chief inspector, inspectors and qualified persons.  As is the norm in this area, however, such reports, documents and communications must be made in good faith and in carrying out relevant functions by the persons concerned.  The legal advice available to me on due process and fair procedures is that these are implicit under common law and that specific inclusion of this provision would be redundant and perhaps even result in an unintentional effect on common law.  Any person connected with an investigation can have access to legal representation if he or she so wishes.  If the Bill is silent on this matter the right to legal representation is part of due process in common law.  I am reluctant in any event to accept the amendment as inclusion of this provision in the Bill immediately begs the question of who is to pay for the legal representation.  In any event, the legal advice is that it would not be appropriate to include the provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">With regard to the duty to co-operate, save where the staff member receives legal advice to the contrary the legal advice is that the proposal in this regard would weaken the Bill.  It would be odd if the legal advice were that somebody should not co-operate given the obligations to do so under the Bill.  In this regard, a person who is in charge of a premises or service, or who possesses or is in charge of relevant records, is required to furnish any information required by an authorised person appointed by HIQA to carry out an investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">There is also a requirement under the Bill to provide an explanation of any record or other information provided or matters which are the subject of the functions being exercised by the authorised person.  Moreover, section 76 provides that authorised persons cannot be obstructed or impeded when conducting an investigation and that false or misleading information must not be given to an authorised person.  Contravention of these provisions is an offence under the Bill.  On this basis I do not intend to accept amendment No. 15 but hope the Deputy will be reassured that the Minister's amendment, together with the legal advice I have outlined, is sufficient to meet his concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">A GP trainer or GP trainee who is acting inappropriately could be reported to the Medical Council and the person making the report would be protected under the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">The purpose of the provision is to ensure that proper procedures are put in place to enable employees to make reports in good faith.  It follows the principles set out in whistleblowers legislation in other jurisdictions, which legislation in general provides that the relevant organisation establish procedures and appoint officers to whom reports can be made.  This Bill provides for both.  The authorised person, by virtue of being a statutory officer, is independent in the performance of his or her functions.  The Minister's amendment, therefore, provides the legal framework for making such disclosures.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">On Deputy Twomey's point, it should be remembered that it was to the North Eastern Health Board's solicitors that the midwives made their initial complaint.  This new statutory framework will mean that, in future, there should be no reason an employee would feel the need to report the matter to a legal representative.  The two midwives would be protected as employees.</p>

She said there could be problems in ensuring the balance across the board and claimed that women dominated in many areas.  That was news to me.  The Minister said she would consider my amendment sympathetically.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">There is no provision in the legislation — maybe I am missing it — to show there has been any movement to get the balance right.  Ultimately, it is all a matter of where one stands.  If one is in favour of ensuring a balance, one can deliver it.  Arguments were made in the past that a gender balance of 40% could not be achieved because there were not enough women in senior positions in the areas of concern.  When this was put to the test, it was quite clear that the Minister was motivated and wanted to do right by women.  As a result, many women have been promoted to decision-making positions in a beneficial way.  This goes some way towards striking the balance although we are a long way off parity.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">In this instance, the argument is that we may not be able to find enough men in senior positions.  I do not accept this in respect of women or men.  If this were a matter of Catholics and Protestants, black and white or Jew and Christian, we would not even have to debate it; we would automatically have provided safeguards to ensure proper representation on decision-making boards.  Given that this is an issue of men and women and that we operate in a context in which women comprise only 13% of the representatives of this House, which figure is lower than the average in sub-Saharan Africa, there is a culture of denying the imbalance that pervades not only State boards but also other boards with decision-making power throughout society.  When we have an opportunity to put things right, we should seize it and address the imbalance in good heart.  I believed the Minister had taken on board my message and therefore the Minister of State might tell me what resulted from the fine words we heard on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_986">It should not have been necessary to table this amendment.  Every Government-sponsored Bill providing for the appointment of members to a board, authority, council etc. should contain the requirement for the appointment, through affirmative action, of at least 40% of either gender serving on the board.  That should be expected of Government.  That we must repeatedly and continuously make the argument is a damning indictment of the Government's failure over the past ten years to employ affirmative action to ensure there is every opportunity for women to play a role not only on such bodies but at the heads of such bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">Any cursory look at the make-up of the vast majority of care providers in the health and social care provision areas will reveal that the overwhelming number of them are women.  Are we to anticipate once again the oft-trundled out reply rejecting the arguments behind such an amendment?  It is long past time that the Government grasped the nettle and acknowledged that the only way to ensure that women will have the opportunity to play a full participatory role in such bodies is through such a provision in legislation.  The authority in question is a particular authority where we should adopt this approach.  Who among us will say that women cannot aspire to hold up to at least 40% of the posts on this board?  It beggars belief that anyone would defend the view that would leave us in a situation where the overwhelming number, if not all, would be men.  I join Deputy McManus in appealing to the Minister of State to turn the corner on this issue through this legislation.  I therefore commend the amendment to him.</p>

          <from>Mr. T. O’Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_988">The Minister was sympathetic to the objective of this amendment on Committee Stage.  She made the point then, and I make it again, that under the existing provision, there is nothing to stop 80% or even the entire board of the authority being female.  Currently five of the 12 board members of the interim HIQA are women.  The matter has been further researched and we have found that legislation establishing boards invariably addresses the matter of gender balance in board membership.  The exact wording tends to vary from statute to statute but it seems clear the principle of gender balance is normally stated as an objective rather than an absolute requirement.  There is one exception to this principle and I will refer to it later.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">This is to ensure that decisions on board membership, especially in cases of casual vacancies, which can create particular difficulties where gender based percentages or absolute numbers are involved, are not determined solely on gender considerations.  There is a particular need for this where the organisation involved has specialised functions.  In such situations a primary consideration must be that a board member has the knowledge, experience and/or qualifications to enable him or her to discharge properly his or her public responsibilities as a board member.  HIQA is a specialised body covering a wide range of expert areas, including safety, quality, health information systems and standards and health technologies.  To be fully effective there must be flexibility in board appointments to ensure the appropriate mix of specialist skills on the board.  Accordingly, it would be inappropriate to subject appointments to an overriding and exclusive gender consideration, especially where a vacancy occurs where a specialist member resigns and his or her expertise must be replaced.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">In addition to the above policy consideration, legal advice was sought.  That advice stated the current provisions in the Bill adequately address the matter of gender balance.  The Minister has a mind to ensure there is an equitable balance between men and women and to allow for the proper retention of necessary ministerial discretion.  More significantly, from a legal perspective, the advice was that acceptance of the proposed amendment posed a legal risk that arises from the fact that at any given time, there may be an unavoidable delay in making a required appointment after a vacancy occurs pending the recruitment and appointment of a suitably qualified man or woman.  Whenever the number of board members falls short of statutory requirements, there is a chance that the argument that the board, and hence the authority, is not legally constituted might succeed.  If so, that has potential to adversely affect the board's ability to function, the authority of which the board is the governing body and the authority's employee, the chief inspector.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">I referred earlier to an exception to the special principle, the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act 2004, which requires the Minister to ensure that at least six of the members of the 13 member council are women and at least six of them are men.  Even in that Act, when it comes to the membership of the special education appeals board, which is a specialist board, there is no reference to gender balance.  It is stated that the chairperson and ordinary members of the appeals board shall be appointed by the Minister from among persons who have a special interest in or knowledge of education and, in particular, the education of persons with special educational needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">Having regard to all these factors and the legal advice received, I feel that the current provision is the most appropriate in the circumstances.</p>

          <p eId="para_997">This amendment relates to the protection of the rights of an individual to appeal a decision because otherwise the Bill would have the effect of disqualifying such a person from membership of the body.

The Minister may claim it is implicit that this right exists but that is clearly wrong in law.  There is a provision to protect people in the Electoral Act in the same way we propose in this amendment.  I was surprised the Minister did not table a similar amendment.  Perhaps the Minister of State is going to accept this amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. T. O’Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_998">On Committee Stage, the Minister indicated she would consider this matter further, especially in light of the Deputy's reference to the Electoral Act.  Since then, the relevant provisions in the Electoral Acts, namely sections 41 and 42 of the 1992 Act, have been examined and legal advice has been obtained.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">The situation covered, however, is not identical to that in the Health Bill in matters that give rise either to disqualification for election to the Dáil or from existing Dáil membership.  The Electoral Acts do not disqualify someone from Dáil membership even where he is convicted of a serious indictable offence.  In terms of board membership of HIQA, however, it would not be appropriate that a person convicted of an indictable offence should remain as a member.  Even in situations where such an individual was contemplating or undertaking an appeal, it would be inconsistent with his professional and personal responsibility to protect the reputation of HIQA to remain on the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">The legal advice received from parliamentary counsel is that the statutory triggering of automatic cessation of board membership as currently set out in the section is appropriate under Irish law and does not offend the Constitution.  Hence, there is no need constitutionally for a saving provision that would allow a person to continue as a member of the board pending expiration of an appeal period or the outcome of an appeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">Eligibility to run for the Dáil and the matter of removing an existing Dáil Member go to the heart of our parliamentary democracy.  In that context, we are not comparing like with like either generally or specifically in terms of general principles when we compare Dáil membership with membership of a State board.  This was a point strongly made by Parliamentary Counsel.  He distinguished between the right of adult citizens to stand for election to the national Legislature, which is an essential feature of a democratic state, and membership of a board appointed by a Minister.  The limitations provided under section 42 of the Electoral Act 1992 are consistent with the former but unnecessary for the latter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">Provisions to the same effect as section 14(2) of the Health Bill 2006 are common in the Irish Statute Book without saving provisions staying their operation pending the expiration of an appeal period or the outcome of an appeal.  Parliamentary Counsel's opinion was that for consistency throughout the statutes it would be inadvisable to provide differently here.  All of the advice received confirmed the point that we are not comparing similar situations and, on balance, the current provisions, which are well established in legislation dealing with membership of State boards, are appropriate.  I shall not, therefore, be accepting the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1009">This is an odd situation in terms of lines 43 to 47 because what that subsection provides for in real effect is a gagging order against the chief executive.  This is an exercise to not only censor but close down the independent utterances of the chief executive.  I wonder about the genesis of this subsection.  Is it indicative of the difference of opinion regarding the numbers of public beds that might be required between the Minister on the one hand and the chief executive, Professor Drumm of the Health Service Executive, on the other?  What is the Minister's and the Department's explanation for the inclusion of such a gagging measure which is counterproductive because it is in the public interest that we have full exposure of such differences of opinion and the dichotomy that can exist between the Minister and the Department on the one hand and the chief executive of the HSE on the other.  I would like to hear an explanation of it.  The amendment, which seeks to delete same and ensure there is greater public scrutiny, awareness and knowledge of the range of different opinions that exist between both entities, should be accepted.</p>

          <from>Mr. T. O’Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_1010">There was much comment in committee about this subsection being a gagging measure.  The Minister stated that she saw the principle behind this provision as fundamental to the way our parliamentary system works.  I can only set out again in some detail the valid justification for the provisions the proposed amendments seek to delete.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">Section 24 provides for the chief executive of HIQA to attend before certain Oireachtas committees to give an account of the general administration of the authority.  Section 41 similarly requires the chief inspector of social services to attend and to give a general account of the activities of his or her office.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">It is important that there should be accountability to Oireachtas committees but that accountability must be properly focused in terms of the persons appearing.  Both the chief executive officer and the chief inspector are employees of HIQA.  While they are senior public servants they are not responsible for formulating Government policy and to require them to comment either on the merits of any Government policy or the merits of the objectives of such policies would be inconsistent with their role.  Accordingly, the section recognises that the chief executive officer and the chief inspector should be answerable for administrative matters only.  It is the responsibility of the Minister to answer to the Oireachtas in respect of policy matters.  Acceptance of the amendment would dilute the role of the Minister in this regard and for those reasons I do not accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1017">With regard to amendment No. 20 there is a serious issue that is not being addressed by the Minister with regard to conflict of interest.  I am surprised at this when I consider what the Minister said on Committee Stage.  A very serious situation arose in regard to the HSE.  A special adviser was brought in by the chief executive officer of the HSE who had been connected with a company that was involved in developing primary care centres.  He subsequently left his role as adviser on primary care strategy prematurely and is now on the board of directors of the same company, that is, a commercial company interested in making profits out of the primary care provision.  In the same way, we have various bodies being established and new inputs into the health service, particularly from private for profit companies, but we do not have robust regulation of standards when it comes to participation in what can be important and influential bodies.  We have seen that in the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">We are now establishing a new body at HIQA and the issue of conflict of interest has not been bolted down.  The Minister accepted the criticisms I made on several occasions.  I make this criticism not to get at an individual but because there have been shock waves through the health service, particularly among health professionals who are concerned at the new direction the Minister is taking without considering the dangers.  When there is a great deal of money to be made from providing health care and determining the nature of the delivery of health care, there will be predatory practices.  We do not have the protections or the experience of what is happening  now, whether it is in co-located hospitals, the provision of primary care centres or issues related to the pharmacy sector, with which the Minister of State is very familiar.  The Pharmacy Bill will be debated shortly and there are not protections in that Bill from these predatory forces.  I have major concerns about that.  Attention has been given to this issue on Committee Stage.  I raised these concerns on Committee Stage and I felt I got a good hearing from the Minister but nothing is happening.  That is a characteristic of this Minister for Health and Children.  She makes all the right comments but then does something else or, more importantly, she does not do what must be done to provide the protection for the public good.</p>

There are several related provisions in the Bill dealing with the codes of governance — section 33; standards of integrity, section 79; and codes of conduct, sections 80 and 81 — which are relevant to any consideration of these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">Regarding the first amendment, it is clear that the authority shall comply with its own code of governance.  Any failure by HIQA to comply with this code would be a matter for the Minister to consider and to determine the appropriate action.</p>

          <p eId="para_1022">I draw particular attention to section 33(5) which requires that arrangements for implementing and adhering to the code of governance must be included in the authority's annual report and section 36(2)(<i>e</i>) requires that the annual report contains a report on the authority’s arrangements for implementing and adhering to its code of governance.  In addition, under section 33(4), the code will be publicly available.  These provisions will further ensure HIQA’s compliance with the code.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">As regards the second amendment, that the code of governance should include a requirement on board members, staff etc. to disclose interests and avoid conflicts of interest, which would then be available through a register for public inspection, I will make a number of points which I hope will reassure the Deputy that the provisions in the Bill are adequate and appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">The key point of the proposed amendment is to address conflicts of interest.  The Minister stated in committee that she shared Deputy McManus's view on the importance of conflict of interest issues and in the past week has had this issue investigated further.  It would perhaps be useful to set out the implications of the ethics Acts — the collective citation for the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 — and the authority.  Under the ethics legislation, if a conflict of material interest exists the person concerned, if he or she is a person to whom the ethics legislation applies, must not perform the function and must disclose the interest.  It is intended that board members and senior management of the authority will be subject to the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.  In that regard, the interim HIQA is already a prescribed body under regulations made in 2005 for the purposes of the Ethics in Public Office Act and its chairperson, board members and chief executive are designated as designated directors and persons, respectively, for the purposes of these Acts.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_1109">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">This Bill is an amending Bill, but it is a very important one which is urgently required in order to introduce some necessary technical changes to its parent Act, the Asset Covered Securities Act 2001.  I might clarify at the outset for Deputies that the term "asset covered securities", or ACS, is a sort of Irish brand name for covered bonds issued under our legislative framework as set down by the 2001 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">The 2001 Act was a landmark piece of legislation for our internationally-focused financial services sector.  It facilitated the establishment in Ireland of a robust legislative and regulatory basis for the issuance of covered bonds by Irish-based specialist banks.  The ability to issue covered bonds is now a very important tool for banks' liquidity as it enables them to use some of their existing loans — currently restricted to residential mortgage loans and loans to public sector institutions under the 2001 Act — to raise new funding on a cost-efficient basis.  This new funding can then be used for further lending operations by the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">This involves putting the relevant loans into a "cover assets pool" and then issuing bonds, that is, asset covered securities, against that pool.  The loans in the pool serve as collateral backing for the bonds and the interest and principal repayments on those loans are used to meet the interest payments on the bonds and eventually to redeem them.  Meanwhile, the funding raised from the bond issue can be used to make further loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">This technique is not exactly a recent innovation.  It originated in the form of the German <i>Pfandbriefe</i> model about 150 years ago. However, it was only over the past decade or so that other member states with developed financial services industries began facilitating this type of activity.  This has, in part, been necessitated by the changing pattern of consumer saving.  Up until relatively recent times, banks could rely on substantial savings and deposit accounts to help fund their lending programmes.  However, with more and more savings now going directly into investment funds and pension schemes, it is important for banks to be able to draw on diversified sources of funding in order that the financial system can effectively support economic activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">The term "asset backed securities", ABS, covers a very wide spectrum of financial products, but covered bonds are at the tightly-regulated and low-risk end of that spectrum.  This refers to the fact that investors in our covered bonds have a preferential claim on the cover assets in the assets pool, the value of which invariably exceeds the value of the bonds outstanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">The main features of this type of covered bond activity can be characterised as follows.  First, the right to issue such bonds is governed by specific legislation — in Ireland's case, the Asset Covered Securities Act 2001.  Second, the issuing credit institution is subject to special prudential and regulatory supervision. Third, the set of eligible cover assets is tightly restricted and set down in the legislation and must also meet certain credit quality requirements.  Fourth, it is an "on balance sheet" activity, that is, the loans are not sold off to some special purpose vehicle, as with a securitisation operation.  The loans remain on the balance sheet of the issuing bank and-or group.  Also, the bondholders are equally-ranking, and, as I have mentioned before, they have priority claim on the relevant assets in the cover assets pool in the event of the default of the issuer.  Finally, the cover assets pool must contain sufficient collateral assets to cover bondholders' claims throughout the whole term of the covered bonds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">I take it that it will be clear to Deputies from these details that the ACS sector is a very tightly controlled and carefully regulated one.  In fact, it might even be described as micro-regulated, reflecting investors' preferences for a high-quality, low-risk investment product.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">To complete this overview of the covered bonds landscape, I should explain that this activity takes place in the wholesale sector of the banking industry and that the bonds are not aimed at retail investors.  Those who invest in these bonds are, for the most part, professional institutional investors such as pension funds, investment funds and banks, including even central banks.  Those<b> </b>investors are located worldwide, so Irish covered bonds are now a global capital markets product.  The attraction of these bonds is that they provide investors with access to a security that is supported by high quality assets over which the investors maintain a robust, preferential claim.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">While our asset covered securities legislation was landmark financial services legislation, it was also pioneering.  When originally introduced, there was no ready-made blueprint available for such legislation from another common law jurisdiction to guide in constructing a statutory framework for this type of financial activity.  While the concept has been on the continent for 150 years in the form of German <i>Pfandbriefe</i>, from which our legislation drew inspiration, there were many areas where national discretion had to be exercised and carefully balanced judgment calls made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">Nevertheless, the legislative and regulatory framework developed in Ireland was widely regarded as a best practice regime and even an improvement in certain respects on those of some other long-established jurisdictions in this market.  Some of the features pioneered by Ireland have been taken up by other countries when introducing new covered bonds systems or by others updating their existing covered bonds frameworks.  The legislation has been a major success and has underpinned the development of Ireland as an international location for the covered bond issuance.  Since the enactment of the 2001 Act, bonds to the value of over €60 billion have been issued under the framework.  It is expected that further issues to the extent of approximately €10 billion may be made this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">Asset covered securities are, therefore, a significant element of Ireland's success in international financial services activity.  Total employment in Irish-based international financial services firms stands at more than 19,000.  It is an important source of revenue for the Exchequer.  The total yield of corporation tax from IFSC companies in 2006 was over €1 billion, according to the Revenue Commissioners, approximately 17% of total corporation tax.  Our entry into the covered bonds niche sector has been a particular success for the IFSC regime, generating significant employment, incomes and tax revenue and creating an international profile for Ireland as an important centre for covered bond issuance.  This amending Bill will build on our existing success and will help to ensure our ongoing competitive position in this highly competitive sector, thus underpinning existing employment and creating the opportunity for further growth and sustained competitive advantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">As with any new prototype, even in a specialist area of financial services legislation, the day-to-day operation of the model inevitably brings to light some areas where the link between theory and practice requires some refinement over time.  The Bill will provide greater legal clarity and will facilitate greater flexibility when operating certain provisions.  Accordingly, it is necessary to make a number of technical changes to the 2001 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">The definition of "duration" in the 2001 Act required clarification which is being addressed by way of amendments in sections 20 and 35.  The new definition is in line with standard industry practice.  Members may have noted the plethora of amendments — over 20 — whereby the term "comprised" is substituted for the word "included".  These all follow from section 2(<i>n</i>) which inserts a new definition of the term “include” into the 2001 Act.  This definition is needed to make it clear that the insertion of an asset or contract into the cover assets pool does not mean the continued maintenance of that asset in that pool.  This is because it is necessary to actively manage the assets in the pool on an ongoing basis.  It is particularly important to reassure the counter-parties to a hedge contract that the hedge collateral held in the pool can be returned to them when the contract so requires.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">There are also related consequential amendments affecting entries in the registers which are kept to record the assets in the cover assets pools.  Another technical change relates to the use of derivatives in the cover assets pool.  Derivatives, such as swaps, are used to hedge various risks such as currency risks, credit risks or interest rate risks.  It is also being made clear to hedge counter-parties that the hedge collateral is protected for them in the event of the issuing bank's insolvency.  This is ensured by holding the hedge collateral in the pool but as a separate asset category from the other assets in the pool.  Without this amendment, the counter-parties to hedge contracts would be less willing to hand over collateral to back their hedge contracts if that collateral were not properly safeguarded for them while in the pool.  Accordingly, the section 5(<i>a</i>) amendment provides important legal clarity to the 2001 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">While the initial urgency for this Bill arose from the need to achieve greater legal clarity for some provisions of the 2001 Act, such as some of those I have just outlined, other strategic considerations have since come into prominence.  From 1 January 2007, the EU's capital requirements directive, CRD, came into force across the European Union giving legislative effect within the EU to the Basel 2 Agreement on the capital requirements for credit institutions.  We now have a window of opportunity in exploiting some of the reforms introduced under the CRD.  It is not just a question of aligning our regime with the provisions of the CRD so as to enhance our competitive advantage; it is also the case that if we do not align our asset covered securities framework quickly with the CRD's, our covered bonds may become less attractive as investment products for foreign banks and other entities which hold these bonds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">At the same time, by being an early mover in incorporating the CRD's reforms into our asset covered securities regime, we will undoubtedly gain some competitive advantage for those who issue those bonds under our legislative and regulatory framework.  It could lead to more Irish financial institutions taking up this activity and encourage overseas issuers to locate in Ireland, with all the associated benefits for the economy with high quality jobs, tax revenue and the development of our international financial sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">The modernisation to the asset covered securities framework prompted by the CRD includes the definition of "public credit".  This is being modified to bring it in line with the CRD definition.  New Zealand and Australia will be added to the existing list of non-EEA countries — Canada, Japan, the Swiss Confederation and the USA — whose assets may be included in a cover assets pool.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">To reflect the developing nature of the asset covered security business, it is proposed to provide for the use of loans to highly-rated multilateral development banks such as the IBRD, the EIB, the Asian Development Bank etc.  It will also cover loans to international organisations such as the IMF and BIS.  The pool eligibility criteria for so-called substitution assets — essentially cash held on short-term deposit with highly-rated banks — are being brought into line with the CRD. <i>Inter alia</i>, this involves reducing the Irish limit for substitution assets of 20% on a pool asset basis to 15% on a covered bonds outstanding basis.  It will also involve more frequent property valuations.  The CRD requirement for annual valuations for commercial property and three yearly valuations for residential property are covered by the amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">The amendments provide for the inclusion of residential and commercial mortgage backed securities, that is, units of mortgage securitisation issues, in the cover assets pool and meet the requirements of the CRD in this regard.  The current provisions which restrict the level of public credit covered securities to 50 times the institution's funds level are being modified as a result of changing risk weighting of public sector loans under the CRD.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">Under existing legislation, covered bonds can effectively only be issued against residential mortgage loans and loans to public sector institutions.  However, a new type of designated credit institution, a designated commercial mortgage credit institution, is introduced to issue covered bonds secured on commercial mortgage loans.  This innovation, too, is inspired by the provisions of the CRD.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">The opportunity is also being taken in this legislation to modernise the legal framework in the light of international developments in this sector since the 2001 legislation was put in place.  For instance, the 2001 Act requires that the asset covered securities be fully, that is 100%, collateralised.  Some other jurisdictions have specified a requirement that there be a degree of over-collateralisation.  It is appropriate that Ireland, too, should strengthen the safeguards for investors by introducing mandatory over-collateralisation of 3% in the case of residential mortgage loan and public sector loan pools and 10% in the case of the proposed new commercial mortgage loan pools.  It will, of course, still be open to issuers to give a contractual commitment to investors that they will maintain even higher levels of collateralisation than are statutory required by the reforms in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">This is technical and complex legislation.  The reforms I have outlined have been carefully drafted in consultation with industry legal experts, the Financial Regulator and by the Parliamentary Counsel.  The proposals have also been formally vetted and cleared by the European Central Bank which confirmed it had no problems with them.  I shall be bringing forward a few amendments on Committee Stage which are of a minor technical nature and to correct some cross-references.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">While this is an amending Bill and as such is just making modifications to an existing framework Act, I cannot over-emphasise the importance of the early adoption of these reforms for the ongoing effectiveness of this important sector of our financial services industry and for the wider economic activity it underpins.  I commend this Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_1133">I cannot pretend I understand fully the products which necessitate a change in the legislation governing them.  To a large degree, we are taking on trust what the Minister and his officials tell us.  I recognise this is a sector of the economy that has grown rapidly and where early movers can get a significant market share.  Ireland has been most effective in developing a good niche in the financial services sector in recent years.  I am supportive of any development of our legislation which has a sound prudential basis but which is also allowing new products to develop.  We have developed a well-earned reputation for being effective on the regulatory side, while doing it with a light touch that is not excessively bureaucratic.  We must maintain that reputation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">With the establishment of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, some of the financial institutions involved in these more arcane areas of financial product development have felt that perhaps the new regulator has been on a learning curve and the system has become more bureaucratic than had been the case in the past.  Inevitably, with any new institution there is a bedding-in period.  We are moving from a situation where financial regulation probably considered only prudential concerns and did not consider consumer issues but that is changing.  As regulatory regimes develop, regulators have to come to grips with a need to look in more than just one direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">I am encouraged that this is a sector where there continues to be growth and high quality employment is provided.  We could probably go further in working to develop the pool of talent and educational supports to make this industry grow.  As we have seen in recent times, some of our traditional manufacturing industries and even some of our more recent internationally traded services are coming under some pressure.  This sector has not suffered any such reversals in recent times and we need to cherish and nurture it to some degree.  For that reason I am pleased to support this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">I accept the legislation is urgent and the Minister is anxious that we pass it before the end of this Dáil session.  We will not be able to go into the Bill in the detail that such legislation might warrant in other times.  However, I am confident sufficient work has been put in by the official side to make sure this is proofed against any problems in the future.  We have to take that on trust, but our faith is based on a reputation that has been well earned by those who are sponsoring this legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_449">
          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_1137">As I understand it, this legislation refers to facilitating banks to avail of secured long-term funding by issuing covered bonds and using certain types of assets such as residential mortgages and some of the assets of public sector loans in a covered assets pool and then issuing bonds secured under the covered bond legislation against the pool.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">Like other Deputies, I received a note from the Minister for Finance rather late last week to say it was urgent that this proposed legislation would be enacted.  The original legislation was brought before the Dáil in the recent past.  The Minister needs to tell us why there is a need to amend this legislation already.  I accept some measures relate to new moves in regard to the European Central Bank and arrangements in regard to European directives.  However, I notice the Minister is also amending the existing legislation.  I would be grateful if he would explain what exactly that is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">In addition, the Minister referred to this legislation having been vetted in some way by the Financial Services Regulator.  Again, I would like the Minister to be more specific about what exactly that involves.  It is difficult to get a specific and personal request from the Minister for Finance to facilitate legislation he deems to be urgent yet at the same time to get little or no briefing.  Bonds are widely used in financial services markets.  With depositors and lenders to banks not behaving as they once did in a stable pattern by holding their money in banks over a long period, banks have to evolve different types of instruments to address this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">As with all rushed legislation, the Opposition is obliged to take the word of the Minister for Finance in this case as being his bond.  The legislation issued over the St. Patrick's weekend and there has been no opportunity for the Opposition to seek independent advice or to have any opportunity to meet with people from the industry concerned and to hear some independent counsel.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">In many ways the Financial Regulator has done a good job but, nonetheless, we heard on RTE in recent days about a subsidiary company of Friends First in which a fraud took place and where the person concerned, who was a director of a subsidiary company, is still serving in that capacity.  The Financial Regulator has appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service at various times and informed us in great detail about the stringent conditions which were being introduced to address the qualifications of directors considered suitable to serve on the boards of financial institutions.  In addition, he referred to the matter of people serving as senior executives in the banking and insurance industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">While the Financial Regulator has done much good work, the Opposition and accountability to the Dáil should not be completely taken for granted.  We largely rely on the Minister's description of what is involved and his word being his bond in this case.  Within the IFSC and related companies, there is much employment available to graduates.  This area of the employment market pays well.  It is a hapless record for the Government that 35,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in the past five years.  In the context of these huge job losses, it is appropriate that we would support a measure which at least sets out to secure good quality employment in the banking sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">On that basis, and taking the Minister's word on trust, because there has been no time to get any kind of independent evaluation carried out, I am prepared to support the Bill.  The Minister of State referred at the end of his contribution to the great work of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel.  If it is that great, why does the Bill need to be amended so soon?  The history of legislation rushed through the House in a couple of hours in this manner has not always proven fantastic.  With those caveats in mind, I support the Bill on behalf of the Labour Party.</p>

        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_452">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_1146">Like previous speakers, I feel that we have not been given sufficient time to examine the Bill in detail.  The original legislation was passed in 2001, some six months before dissolution of the 28th Dáil.  That all too brief debate was also led by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance and responded to by spokespersons on behalf of Fine Gael and Labour.  The degree of uncertainty that exists now also existed then, and there is probably a need for wider briefing on the part of the Department regarding the issues involved in this part of the financial services industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">That said, the original legislation seems to have been enacted, and is probably now being amended, at the behest of certain financial institutions that have come to operate successfully in the international financial services sector.  It seems to have been led in particular by German financial institutions seeking standard practices across Europe.  This Bill appears to be a further development of that principle, seeking as it does standardisation with such countries as Australia and New Zealand.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">As a concept, it deserves wider inspection.  As I understand it, and as Deputy Burton has articulated, the Bill seems to give financial institutions the ability to borrow on the basis of lending in the mortgage market in particular.  As we are now in an uncertain situation regarding the property market, I am unsure whether Irish mortgage-holders will be exposed or whether we are allowing international financial institutions operating from the IFSC to benefit from a standardisation of international practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">In his opening contribution, the Minister of State highlighted that we are governed by the need to introduce certain changes owing to the EU capital requirements directive.  On those grounds, not many in the House could oppose the Bill.  I share Deputy Burton's concern at the number of changes being made to legislation only five and a half years old that seem to be of a very technical nature.  For example, changing the word "compromise" to "include" suggests a slight flaw in the existing legislation not properly explained to us on this side of the House.  In summing up, perhaps the Minister of State might explain those grounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">The debate offers us some opportunity to comment on the state of financial services in this country.  I notice that the Irish Banking Federation, representing practitioners who will have to operate under the legislation, has welcomed the Bill.  On this side of the House, we will have to take that recommendation very seriously.  However, we must also take cognisance of the international climate regarding hedge funds, the stock markets and the international property market in general.  For instance, we should take into account the fact that last week's sneeze on the international stock markets was caused by a large number of people defaulting on property loans in the United States.  With an economy strongly linked to the success of its US counterpart, that should cause Ireland concern.  When discussing legislation of this nature, those concerns should be recorded.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">The Financial Regulator has highlighted issues regarding 50 cases of market abuse currently being examined by his office.  On the scale of things, that might not be too serious, since he has publicly stated his underlying suspicion that one in every four transactions on the London Stock Exchange is an example of insider trading.  When world stock markets are in such a state of flux and we pass legislation relating to financial services, the House must take such matters into account.  It is unfortunate that we have not had the opportunity of a longer lead-in time with more detailed examination of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">The Financial Regulator is now the watchdog for 10,000 financial institutions in Ireland, a fairly frightening figure.  Everyone in the House will accept that the job is largely being done well by the body, but there are questions, given the large number of institutions being overseen.  Are we getting the resources right?  Deputy Bruton asked whether we were getting the balance right between appropriate legislation and regulation that might be stifling.  We could have gone into that in greater detail in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">The recent G7 meeting of Heads of Government, of which Ireland is a participant only through the President of the European Commission, recorded unhappiness regarding hedge funds.  I do not know whether the Minister believes in international regulation of that market, and the Minister of State may not be able to respond on the growing international apprehension regarding the prevalence and insidiousness of many such funds.  I believe that we are getting the balance right in Ireland, but there has been unfavourable comment in recent years to the extent that, without the appropriate level of transparency and regulation in its financial services, Ireland risks being considered akin to the Cayman Islands in international circles.  We cannot allow such comments to go unchallenged.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">The concept behind this Bill is the German one of <i>Pfandbriefe</i>.  Perhaps Irish financial services are now subject to that degree of international scrutiny — ironically, by German political figures on the basis of <i>Schadenfreude</i>.  Irish financial services have become more successful over the past three years, and we must present that in the best possible legislative light.  If this Bill helps us do so, the Green Party is prepared to support it.  However, caveats have been entered by other speakers regarding the need to deal with the legislation properly and have a longer lead-in time.  On this occasion, the Government has not allowed us proper consideration.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_453">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1155">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  I welcome the debate on the Asset Covered Securities (Amendment) Bill 2007.  I always welcome reforming legislation coming before the House, and this also gives us an opportunity to discuss in detail the financial sector, the economy, banking, jobs and investment, which are crucial at this point in our history.  It also gives us a chance to put forward new ideas on investment and job creation.  We must have a constant stream of new and radical policies on investment, economic development and, above all, creating quality jobs.  In this debate, it is important that we focus on such important issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156">We are also at a crossroads.  There is much debate and focus on the economy in general.  Are we turning our backs on the question of whether we are a society, a country or an economy?  This legislation gives us the opportunity to deal with such issues in a most comprehensive manner.  I agree with the Minister that it is a quite technical and complex Bill.  I hope that the reforms outlined have been carefully drafted in consultation with industry, legal experts, the Financial Regulator and the Parliamentary Counsel.  These issues are extremely important as well as very technical.  We also have a chance to consider the ongoing effectiveness of an important sector of the financial services industry and the wider economic activity that it underpins.  It is a crucial issue because we seem to be obsessed with economic development.  We are all in favour of developing the economy but we must also ensure that our economic resources are distributed fairly to society at large.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">Ireland was once known as the island of saints and scholars but today, sadly, it is better known as the land of scandals and tribunals.  Politics, banking, the church, business, medicine, the law and the Garda Síochána have all suffered from an erosion of public confidence.  Moreover, Ireland has undergone rapid social, economic and political change over the past decade, which has had a profound impact on our value systems.  At the beginning of the 21st century, the country is fairly prosperous yet this situation can create dilemmas of its own.  Difficult decisions about the distribution of our resources raise awkward questions for society.  This brings us to the recent outbreak of auction politics.  How is the balance between individual rights and the overall good of society to be resolved?  To whom do we look for guidance?  The credibility of the church, the banking sector, the political elite, the medical and legal professions, and business leaders, has been seriously damaged.  We have an opportunity today to examine and debate these issues, rather than sticking our heads in the sand.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">The purpose of the Bill is to introduce some necessary technical changes to the Asset Covered Securities Act 2001, to provide greater legal clarity and facilitate greater flexibility in operating some provisions of the original Act.  The Bill also includes some new provisions aimed at developing the Irish covered bonds statutory and legal framework in light of changes made in other jurisdictions or in EU legislation.  It introduces a new kind of designated credit institution — a designated commercial mortgage credit institution — whose activities will be focused on commercial mortgage lending.  These are the issues that fall within the remit of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159">This debate provides us with an opportunity to highlight the problems facing young people who seek mortgages and other loans.  Many young people currently find it very difficult to get on the housing ladder.  It is a major problem for many people, particularly those on low and middle incomes who are finding it virtually impossible to buy a small apartment or a three-bedroom semi-detached house, especially in Dublin.  Many constituents have phoned me about the supply of mortgages and housing, which is a crucial part of a decent and fair society.  If people are unable to obtain home loans it is damaging for the country.  At the same time, however, many wealthy individuals seem to own several houses and have plenty of personal investments.  Members of this House have been involved in this kind of carry on, while young couples cannot afford to buy their first home.  It is important to highlight this matter, although I am not a lone voice in doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1160">Last Friday, these matters were raised on the "Late Late Show" by George Lee.  It is time for a wake-up call to consider where this country is going.  There is nothing wrong in challenging the <i>status quo</i> and proposing new ideas on finance, mortgages and banking.  Neither is there anything wrong with challenging those who have misled consumers and, in many cases, ripped them off.  I challenge the Minister of State and his Government colleagues on these important matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161">In discussing the development of the economy, we must wake up and smell the coffee when it comes to the issue of jobs.  In recent weeks, we have seen job losses in companies that are moving their operations from this State to countries with low-wage economies.  As a nation, we must plan for the future in order to deal with such developments.  I do not want to see us in a situation where low pay is back on the agenda again.  When we are doing our research on developing the economy, including banking and the financial sector generally, we must have creative new ideas to achieve such development.  We cannot afford to lose thousands of jobs every month.  This is the stark reality that many people are worried about.  Members of the House have concerns about big industries in their own constituencies, so it is right and proper to highlight these matters before the situation gets worse.  This is not about political point scoring, it is a question of caring about economic investment and the direction of society in general.  It is important to support our young people, and young couples in particular, when it comes to dealing with these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162">I welcome the debate on this Bill, which is important technical legislation.  I also welcome any new ideas from any Members on creating jobs and promoting investment.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_1163">I thank all the Deputies who have contributed to the debate.  As they know, the House is currently coping with a significant volume of urgent legislation and I am grateful they appreciate the need to make progress on this highly technical Bill, which is devoted to a specialised but strategically important niche sector of our financial services industry.  I appreciate what Deputy Finian McGrath said.  He has been eloquent in his support of jobs but I would remind him that the financial services sector accounts for more than 19,000 jobs.  In addition to all the PAYE revenue that arises from that sector, it also accounts for more than €1 billion in corporation tax.  Despite the Deputy's other concerns therefore that sector is a major contributor in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164">I do not agree with his comments on the island of saints and scholars.  I have just returned from South Africa where I represented our country.  All they can talk about there is the magic of our Celtic economy, how it was arrived at, and how they could possibly copy our model.  Having spoken with other ministerial colleagues who travelled abroad recently, I know that the success of our economy is the talk of the economic world.  Therefore, I do not accept the derogatory terms used by Deputy Finian McGrath, which relate to a myth.</p>

          <p eId="para_1166">I have explained the reality as it is regarded outside the country.  The Deputy can raise those issues but it is not how the country is seen from abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_1167">I wish to deal with some of the other issues that were raised during the debate.  Deputy Bruton certainly recognises the importance of cherishing and nourishing the financial services sector.  While Deputy Burton raised some caveats, she is also quite supportive of the legislation.  I assure Deputies that the sector is constantly dynamic and innovative.  The original Act was introduced six years ago in 2001.  Due to its innovative nature, some elements did not work as smoothly as expected, so that is why I am proposing these technical amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168">The EC capital requirements directive was passed in June 2006, so it is important for us to move quickly in this competitive area.  Moving early to make such amendments will allow our financial services sector to remain competitive internationally.  That is what the Bill is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169">Deputy Boyle raised the concerns of Irish property owners but they will not be adversely affected.  The loan-to-value limits on assets in the pool are conservative at 80% of LTV on aggregate.  This gives a wide margin of safety to bond holders should the property market slow down.  We do not have any concerns in that regard.  The amendments we are making are technical in nature, falling into line with the new EU directives.  It is all a matter of common sense.  Likewise, the amendments have been drafted with the close involvement of the financial regulator.  We have received the best legal and technical advice.  In addition, the amendments have been vetted and cleared by the ECB which has confirmed that it has no problem with them at all.  As Deputy Boyle said, the Irish banking industry has welcomed the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1178">Regarding the definition of the terms, can the Minister tell us what was the role of the Financial Regulator?  My question was legitimate and I felt deserved a legitimate answer so the Minister of State might give an explanation in this regard relating to the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1180">What does that mean?  Did the Financial Regulator help to draft the Bill or what was its role?  One of the biggest difficulties in the financial services sector in recent years arose in the area of reinsurance.  The securitisation of mortgages is a parallel activity and many references are made to bonds in the Bill and in some jurisdictions the words bonds and junk are often not far removed.  As Deputy Boyle pointed out, hedge funds and derivatives are a sophisticated form of gambling on the financial securities market.  We have not had the benefit of a detailed briefing from the Department so I feel our questions are legitimate.</p>

Schedule 3 is inserted in the Act by section 60.

          <p eId="para_1206">The amendment seeks to delete the requirements for the order to be notified in <i>Iris Oifigiúil </i>and instead provide in amendment No. 6 to section 61 that the order under section 59, new section 107 of the Act, and any order made under section 61(3) bringing this Bill into operation, must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The laying of orders before both Houses is catered for in section 93(1) of the principal Act which provides that every order made by the Minister under the Act is laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as practicable after it is made.

Last year, the Minister opened a brand new €12.5 million Garda station in Bantry, a new station is being built in Schull — a hobby horse of mine for a long time — major refurbishment has taken place at Castletownbere Garda station and we have a new Garda headquarters in Bandon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208">In Dunmanway, the six gardaí stationed in the town are housed in a building rented by the Office of Public Works to facilitate gardaí in carrying out their duties.  The old station in Dunmanway is almost derelict and has experienced problems for a number of years.  A debate is taking place on whether it should be refurbished.  Approximately six years ago, while a Senator, I received a letter gleefully announcing that the station would be refurbished and that a sum of around €160,000 had been allocated for this purpose.  Subsequently a problem arose concerning access and a legal wrangle which has dragged on for many years ensued.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">The community in Dunmanway is irate and the town's gardaí are not happy that they are housed in temporary accommodation without cell facilities.  In the event that a prisoner must be kept overnight, he or she must be brought by gardaí to Bandon or Clonakilty.  The community which the Garda supports is concerned about the unprecedented delay in either refurbishing the old station or providing a new station.  When a greenfield site across the road from the old barracks was put up for sale many people believed it should have been purchased and a new station built thereon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1210">It is clear that action is needed regarding the Garda station in Dunmanway.  The Garda Representative Association is angry — the word "militant" may be too strong — that its members are using a substandard station with the result that the community they serve in the Dunmanway area is not receiving the service it deserves.  This issue has been a hobby horse of mine and I have discussed it repeatedly with the relevant Ministers, including the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, and officials from the Office of Public Works.  I hope urgent action will be taken to provide the facilities the gardaí and members of the community in Dunmanway deserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_1211">I have put the problem in a nutshell and hope the Minister will be able to clarify the current position for me and people in west Cork.  The community in the Dunmanway area is law abiding but there is a considerable anger that a commitment given many years ago either to build a new Garda station or refurbish the old one has not been acted on.  With these few brief words, I rest my case in the hope that moneys will be provided to refurbish the old Garda station and a resolution will be found to legal difficulties, primarily concerning a right of access to the rear of the Garda station.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1212">I thank Deputy Donovan for raising this issue and affording me the opportunity to explain the position regarding Dunmanway Garda station.  I am responding on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell.  The Minister visited the station in October 2005 on foot of the Deputy's request and made contact with local gardaí in the temporary station.  The Minister was shown the old station, which had been vacated for some time, and it was abundantly clear that major works are required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1213">In order for the building works to proceed, the Office of Public Works must purchase land at the rear of the station.  The Chief State Solicitor's office is acting for the board in this matter.  I understand financial terms have been agreed with the vendors and that the legal process is finally nearing conclusion, with key title documents to be produced by the vendors' solicitor to permit the transaction to go through.  The matter is being dealt with at a most senior level in the Chief State Solicitor's office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1214">The Minister welcomes these developments and looks forward to the commencement of the building works.  Everyone is deeply frustrated with the pace of progress in this matter, but I assure the Deputy that everything that can be done is being done to bring the matter to finality.  As a contingency, the Office of Public Works advertised recently for the purchase of a new site for the station.  I hope it will not be necessary to invoke this contingency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1215">The building works will commence as soon as possible after conclusion of the legal formalities.  The Office of Public Works has advanced matters as far as possible and will be ready to start work within a matter of weeks of the closure of the sale.  A detailed brief of requirements has been prepared by the Garda Síochána and a sketch scheme has been prepared by the Office of Public Works and approved by Garda management.  The Garda representative bodies were consulted at each step of the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1216">The last time the Minister spoke on an Adjournment debate on this matter, he indicated that he would look at the roles of the various parties in the Garda building programme to streamline processes wherever possible.  Since then, the introduction of various sections of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 has enabled this restructuring to take place.  The Garda Commissioner has, since 14 July last, been made Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote.  Accordingly, appropriate administrative procedures have been put in place to enable direct communications and business to be carried out between the Office of Public Works and the Garda authorities without the need to channel such communications through the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In addition, as part of the major civilianisation drive for the force, a new civilian accommodation manager with the requisite skills in this area has been appointed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1217">While the delays in Dunmanway have been protracted, this should not detract from the overall investment in the Garda building programme.  Between 2005 and the end of this year, the Office of Public Works will spend €112 million on the Garda building programme.  Under the National Development Plan 2007-2013, funding of €260 million is provided towards refurbishment of Garda premises and is included in the capital provisions of the Office of Public Works.  This capital funding is in addition to the Garda budget, which across all areas for 2007 is more than €1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1218">In addition, the Garda building maintenance budget has been increased this year by €2.1 million to €8.36 million.  A major refurbishment and replacement programme of Garda accommodation is under way.  Throughout the State, stations large and small that are in most need of attention are prioritised and proactively replaced or renovated under a range of different schemes.  These are unprecedented levels of funding and are making a lasting impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_1219">I assure the Deputy that the matter is receiving attention at the highest level both within the Office of Public Works and the Chief State Solicitor's office to bring it to a successful conclusion.</p>

            <from>Ms Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1220">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue.  I was disturbed and shocked to learn that the waiting list in the urology unit at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown, Dublin 15, now exceeds two years and that the unit plans to close its doors to all but emergency cases.  This is a shocking state of affairs.  It is of particular concern at a time when such prominence is given to men's health and the provision of health services for men through public advertising to encourage them to avail of regular screening for the detection of prostate cancer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1221">On the one hand, the HSE is encouraging men to seek early diagnosis and assistance through screening programmes.  On the other hand, however, those men who need to avail of urology services at Connolly Hospital will find it is unable to cope with the extra demand.  The Taoiseach said today that there is an easy solution to such problems because those with private health insurance will be able to avail of new private hospital facilities.  Under the Fianna Fáil model of health provision, it seems patients will be instructed to turn one way for the public service, only to find no service is available, and the other for private hospital services, if they are appropriately insured.</p>
            <p eId="para_1222">Patients in Dublin 15 will have to go elsewhere for urology services, most likely to the Mater or Beaumont.  Last year, there were 1,200 trips by inpatients in Blanchardstown to Beaumont and the Mater for diagnosis and screening, including MRI and CT scans, at an average cost per patient of more than €400.  It seems the same will now happen with urology services.  The round trip to the Mater from Blanchardstown, assuming that the traffic is relatively good, is at least two hours.  This does not take into account the time spent at the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1223">This situation underlines yet again the Government's lack of commitment to the long-term development of Connolly Hospital.  The sole policy in regard to the hospital seems to be to promote the development of a private hospital by selling or leasing off some of the grounds of the public hospital.  While I was Minister of State in the rainbow coalition, €72 million was set aside in 1996 for Connolly Hospital and left as a dowry to the incoming Government.  Ten years later, however, only phase 1 has been developed.  Phase 2 was commenced only because the general election is on its way.  The hospital does not even have a CT or MRI scanner even though it serves a very large population across the Dublin 15 area, Cabra, Finglas and a significant part of Meath.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224">The long-serving and hard-working staff in Connolly Hospital provide excellent care to patients but it is difficult to see how they will not be demoralised.  Although several additional consultants have been appointed, they lack the facilities and equipment to do their job.  The hospital has put forward a request for additional urology consultants to be appointed but nothing has been done so far.</p>
            <p eId="para_1225">I raise this as a matter of urgency.  As with education and policing, as far as this Government is concerned, Dublin West is far down the list of priorities.  Connolly Hospital seems to be further down the list than most issues.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_481" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1226">I will take this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  Services at Connolly Hospital are provided by the Health Service Executive.  The hospital is one of three providers of adult urology services on the north side of the city, the others being Beaumont and the Mater.</p>
            <p eId="para_1227">The HSE has advised that the current urology service at Connolly Hospital is provided by one consultant urologist with a four session commitment each week.  It further advises that all emergency and follow-up outpatient services are provided.  Urgent prostate referrals are seen within one to two weeks.  Due to an increase in clinical workload, no routine first-visit outpatient appointments are being allocated at present.  The HSE will ensure there is no interruption to urgent urology services and that any reduction in routine services will be in the short term only.</p>
            <p eId="para_1228">The Department of Health and Children is advised that in light of these urology service pressures, Connolly Hospital plans, in conjunction with Beaumont Hospital, to recruit an additional consultant urologist.  The intention is to provide the service by way of locum cover pending the filling of the post on a permanent basis.  The Department is advised by the HSE that the necessary funding is available for this post and that it is expected to be filled within a matter of months.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_482">
            <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_1229">There has been systematic neglect of the acute hospital system in the north east.  Louth County Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital are under extreme pressure for funding and staff.  One year ago, Chris Lyons, hospitals network manager for the north east, said there was inadequate support in the budget for the increase in service demands experienced in 2005 and 2006.  Grave concern has been expressed by local managers in this regard.  There is unparalleled growth in the region's population, which increased by 13% since 1996.  There is the possibility of significant closures of services, major patient safety issues, increased clinical risk and longer waiting lists.  What did the HSE decide in its wisdom?  It decided, because of its budgetary cutbacks, that with immediate effect all pending and new development posts would be put on hold in order to bring a reduction in recruitment costs of approximately €100,000.  Patrick Kinder, head of the maternity services taskforce, wrote about Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in October last year.  He said a serious risk obtained in the maternity unit there due to the increased levels of overtime, that the working of overtime at the levels indicated was not sustainable for any length of time and there was a critical need to review the recruitment process to avoid unnecessary delays in filling posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1230">An advertisement from the HSE will appear in tomorrow's newspapers seeking to fill 25 new midwifery posts approved for the hospital, but the reality is these posts were needed a year ago.  Due to lack of funding from the Government, the hospital is in a state of crisis.  It is unacceptable that expectant mothers must wait for up to 20 weeks for their first appointment with their consultant.  This is a shame and an utter disgrace.  I call on the HSE and the Minister to publish the correspondence on the matter, particularly that between Mr. Patrick Kinder and the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">The number of unfunded posts in the northern area HSE was 322, or 9% of all of those employed, in April 2006.  Some 92% of the unfunded staff are employed in frontline services.  The accident and emergency unit in Drogheda currently has 30 unfunded posts.  The advertisement in tomorrow's newspapers states that a new 25-bay emergency department in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital will be up and running in early 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1232">The facts, as illustrated by the response I received to a freedom of information request, show that the accident and emergency unit was due to commence in autumn 2006 and be ready in 2007 and that any delay in that schedule would compromise patient safety based on the known risks.  The accident and emergency unit in the hospital at that time was overrun and it was essential the new unit would begin as soon as possible to ensure continuity of services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1233">We have a HSE in crisis, a hospital system which is totally underfunded and problems with regard to anaesthetists in the hospital.  Advertisements for three new anaesthetist posts have been placed, but these probably will not be filled for six months.  These are serious issues of concern.  I call on the Minister and the HSE to publish the truth about the issues surrounding anaesthetists in the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">I am also deeply concerned about cancer care.  Patients should and are entitled to receive chemotherapy in the hospital.  However, I know a patient who had to travel from Drogheda by taxi to a Dublin hospital yesterday and return in the evening only to have to get up again at 6 a.m. this morning to get to the hospital by 8 a.m. for another session of chemotherapy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">The acute hospital system is in crisis, but the Government is doing nothing about it.  We do not accept the Minister deserves to be in office.  She should be run out of office for the shameful way in which she runs Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and the Louth County Hospital.  There is no excuse for the situation.  Never was there so much money available in the country to look after our sick and elderly, but never did a Government do so little.  Never were administrators, nurses, midwives and consultants so up in arms over the lack of funding and resources.  They are entitled to these resources because of population increases in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">The Minister stands condemned in the court of public opinion.  She has run these hospitals into the ground.  It appears from what the Taoiseach said today with regard to not being able to keep hospitals open, that all the Minister seems to have on her mind is the closure of acute hospitals in the north east.</p>

            <p eId="para_1237">I will take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1238">Both the Government and the Health Service Executive are committed to continuing to improve and expand services at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and Louth County Hospital in the short and medium term.  In the longer term, a new state-of-the-art regional hospital will be built in the north east.</p>
            <p eId="para_1239">Over the past five years, the level of revenue funding allocated to both Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and Louth County Hospital has increased significantly.  The current revenue funding for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital has increased from €36 million to €115 million, an increase of 219%, and in the case of Louth County Hospital, from €10 million to €28 million, an increase of 180%.  Over the same period, staffing numbers across the two hospitals have increased by 225.</p>
            <p eId="para_1240">In the case of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, a new three-storey development approved by the HSE is scheduled to be fully completed by April 2009.  This development will allow for a 25-bed accident and emergency assessment area and a further two floors will be utilised to provide some additional facilities and space for critical care, general medicine and general surgical departments.  The 25-bay accident and emergency facility is scheduled by the HSE to be fully operational by April of next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1241">With regard to maternity services at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, the HSE has advised that it has approved 22 new midwife posts and two specialist nurse posts as well as three new consultant anaesthetist posts.  The HSE will continue to monitor staffing levels within the maternity services unit at the hospital relative to demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242">Urgent care facilities will be developed at Dundalk.  It is intended when the new regional hospital is established, that Louth County Hospital will retain this urgent care service providing a significant service to a large proportion of patients from Dundalk.  Extensive electrical work has been carried out at the hospital to facilitate the installation of a new CT scanner which will be operational next month.  Two new modular theatres are also due to open next month.  Investment in Louth County Hospital will continue in order to provide the best and most appropriate service to the people of the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">Since October 2005, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and Louth County Hospital have been managed under a single general management structure.  These close working arrangements have facilitated a reduction in patient waiting times and have resulted in improved care and clinical outcomes for patients.  In advance of the development of the new regional hospital, ambulance and emergency services will be developed to a high standard in the north east.  This will include the training of advanced paramedics and nurse practitioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1244">It should be emphasised that the HSE has given the Minister for Health and Children an assurance that in progressing the reorganisation of services in the north east, there will be no discontinuation of existing services until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place.</p>

          <speech by="#ShaneMcEntee" eId="spk_484">
            <from>Mr. McEntee</from>
            <p eId="para_1245">I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on this issue and thank the Minister for Education and Science for her attendance.  No doubt, like myself she is puzzled by what is involved.  That said, nobody is more puzzled than the people of Laytown and Bettystown by what has taken place over the past two years with regard to this issue.  I am only two years in politics and one of the first issues that came to my attention was the announcement of a new school for Laytown during the by-election.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">Last summer, all the politicians of the area were called together in the first week of August to discuss what would be done in September for the 75 or 80 children with no school to go to.  Deputies put their party allegiances to the side and mounted a campaign together to remove objections.  The teachers of both existing schools were put under pressure and children were finally allowed admission to school, although their classroom was in a gymnasium to which toilets were added at the side, but without lighting.  All those involved, particularly parents, then set out to find a solution to the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">On 6 October 2006, the Minister announced that a site for a new school had been secured.  It was confirmed that officials from the Department had concluded a deal to purchase a school campus site for Laytown.  Everybody hoped everything would go well, but last week it transpired the Department had applied for planning permission for a site it did not own.  It had never even asked the owner of the land in question whether it could apply for planning permission for that site.</p>
            <p eId="para_1248">The Minister has stated that despite the announcement in 2006 that lands had been purchased, the purchase did not happen.  Six months after the Department's announcement, it emerged the sale of the four-acre site for the school had not been completed.  In a statement, the Minister for Education and Science admitted to difficulties with regard to the land for the temporary school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1249">I am not raising this matter for my benefit but on behalf of parents.  I want to know what is going on.  Who got us into this mess?  How could the Department apply for planning permission for lands it did not own without the permission of the landowner?  How could the Department say it had concluded a deal, but six months later say no deal was completed?  The authority has been given the go-ahead to apply for planning permission on another site.  Have those lands been bought?  Is there a deal on the Minister's table that has not been signed since last October?  A total of 107 children in Laytown and Bettystown will have nowhere to go next September.  What has gone wrong?  What are the plans for the future?  Can we be given a guarantee that if there is a contract on the table and planning permission is granted, as everybody hopes, the Department will build a temporary school for these children to attend in September?</p>
            <p eId="para_1250">These people are well-educated.  They do not want to see any politician, me included, any more.  They believe nobody.  I put aside my allegiance to my party and worked with the Minister's party colleague night after night to remove objections to the development.  The Department was responsible for building the school.  The Minister announced that a deal had been done but it has not been done.</p>
            <p eId="para_1251">The teachers, Maurice Daly and MaryCarpenter, were under serious pressure to get those children into the gym.  The school of 600 had no room to move all winter but they succeeded.  It was for the Department to set matters right.  I know plans can run into difficulty and how hard the Department officials in Tullamore work.  They have been courteous to everybody.  We know that 2,300 classrooms need to be built.  These people want to know what to plan for and where they are going.  If planning permission is granted, for which the Department has applied, will the contracts be signed?  Will the contracts which the Taoiseach announced on a visit a couple of weeks ago when he spoke of 1,000 new post-primary places for Laytown, be fulfilled?  There is no site.  The Department applied for planning permission on a site that it did not own.  This put the livelihood of a local businessman, his wife and three children in jeopardy as they were seen as black sheep.  The Department owes that man an apology.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_485" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1252">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to reiterate the Government's commitment to delivering new schools for Laytown on schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_1253">Prior to the 2005-06 school year there was only one primary school in the Laytown-Bettystown region, catering for children from junior infants to sixth class.  Due to demand for increased school places, my Department sanctioned the provisional recognition of a second primary school, Scoil Oilibhéir Naofa, from 1 September 2005.  We also agreed to a local proposal that the new school would be a junior school, catering for pupils from junior infants to second class, with the existing school, Scoil an Spioraid Naoimh, operating as a senior school catering for pupils from third to sixth class.  Both schools are expected to grow to 24 classrooms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1254">Scoil Oilibhéir Naofa is housed in temporary accommodation on the campus of the senior school and has an enrolment for the 2006-07 school year of 181 pupils.  The Department is working at a senior level with Meath County Council and the relevant authorities of the schools in Laytown to deal with the accommodation needs for September 2007 and onwards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1255">Meath County Council reserved a site of approximately 15.5 acres in the Laytown local area plan for educational provision.  The land is owned by two individuals.  In October 2006 I announced that departmental officials had agreed terms for the acquisition of the larger part of this site.  My Department's relations with this landowner have been amicable and he has stated publicly that he is "very happy" with the deal agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">Terms were agreed for the purchase of the second smaller piece of land in December 2006.  This second parcel was intended to be home to the temporary accommodation in the short term and then to provide access between the existing primary school and the permanent new school building.  Difficulties have arisen, however, since the terms were originally agreed for this second piece of land, which could conceivably have delayed the provision of temporary accommodation.  As a result my Department has now put a contingency plan in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1257">This process involves a new planning application, lodged last Friday, for temporary accommodation for September 2007 on the much larger second parcel of land.  The owner of this land has given his written consent to the planning application.  Meath County Council has agreed that the planning application will be dealt with speedily, and provided we have a smooth run through the planning phase, we aim to start construction on the temporary school and temporary road in May.  This will enable the primary school to open in September on this land and the permanent building for the school to be in place in September 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1258">The land in question is zoned for educational use.  It is also of sufficient size to accommodate the new primary and post-primary schools.  It should be noted that it is a condition laid down by Meath County Council that no further development can happen in this area until a primary school has been provided.  The 16 classroom temporary school is sized to cater for the existing enrolment in Scoil Oilibhéir Naofa and its September 2007 intake.  It will ensure that there are enough mainstream classes and ancillary accommodation to meet the school's needs until the new permanent building is available in September 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259">The Department has appointed a firm of project managers to oversee and devise a masterplan for the project to provide an education campus for Laytown-Bettystown.  The education campus will provide for a 24-classroom primary school and for a 1,000 pupil post-primary school, under the auspices of County Meath Vocational Education Committee and shared community and sports facilities.  Meath County Council planning department approved the masterplan for the campus.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">The new permanent 24-classroom junior school will be delivered under a design and build contract and the design and procurement phases of the programme are proceeding in tandem with the site acquisition.  Departmental officials have briefed the two primary schools on the masterplan and project timescales.</p>

            <p eId="para_1263">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that interest relief is available to an individual or company borrowing money where that money is employed in the purchase, improvement or repair of a property which is let for residential purposes. The relief cannot be claimed until the property is let. The interest paid is treated as an expense deductible from the rental income arising from the property. Where the amount of interest paid in respect of a property exceeds the rental income received from the property, giving rise to a net rental loss for the property for a particular year, that loss can be set against any other Irish rental income which the person may have in that year. Any remaining loss can be carried forward and set against Irish rental income arising in subsequent years until such time as it is used up. It cannot be set against foreign rental income or against other income such as income from a trade or profession.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that figures on loan interest in respect of borrowings employed for the purchase, improvement or repair of rented residential properties are not separately identified in tax statistics and it is not, therefore, possible to provide the information requested by the Deputy either in relation to the overall amount of relief granted or the other breakdowns sought.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_487">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1266">The legal framework governing the regulation of credit unions is provided by the Credit Union Act, 1997.  The Act has served credit unions well providing stability and legal certainty during a period of substantial development and growth in the assets of the movement.  As a result of this development and changes in the financial environment generally, the need for some modernisation of the legislative and regulatory framework for credit unions has became evident over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1267">The recent announcement of my intention to legislate for increased lending limits for credit union loans referred to in the Deputy's question is one of several initiatives that I have taken to update and modernise the regulatory framework for credit unions. On 9 March last, I introduced Regulations enabling Credit Unions to provide Personal Retirement Savings Accounts to their members.  This is an important measure both developing the role of credit unions and also supporting the important public policy objective of increasing personal pension coverage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1268">In February, I published the report of the Review Group on longer-term lending limits in credit unions which recommended that the limits on longer-term lending under Section 35 of the Credit Union Act, 1997 should be increased.  This addresses an issue which has been identified by the credit union movement as a significant obstacle to meeting their members' borrowing needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1269">Last year my Department drawing on the advice of the Credit Union Advisory Committee — the expert statutory advisory body on credit union matters — assisted the Financial Regulator and the representative bodies for credit unions in agreeing revised investment guidelines for credit unions which were issued by the Registrar of Credit Unions in October 2006.  These guidelines will help support prudent and responsible investment behaviour by credit unions.  In addition, in August 2006, I introduced Regulations to increase the maximum level of shares and deposits that can be saved in a credit union.  This change introduced with the approval of the Financial Regulator was required to update the limits included in the 1997 Act to take account of growth in the economy over the preceding decade and help maintain the attractiveness of credit unions for members' savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1270">I have highlighted the importance of the reform of savings protection arrangements for credit unions to the modernisation and change process for credit unions.  In this context, a detailed set of proposals to reform the existing Savings Protection Scheme (SPS) for credit unions was submitted to me by the Irish League of Credit Unions in January 2006 and furnished by my Department to the Financial Regulator in March 2006.  The Financial Regulator is currently examining the specific changes which may be needed in the proposals which could allow the reformed SPS to be approved with a view to finalising this matter shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1271">As far as the broader modernisation of the legislative framework for credit unions is concerned, my Department has also asked the Registrar and Credit Unions to agree a set of principles with the representative bodies for credit unions that can help guide the development of the regulatory approach for credit unions to support the long-term sustainability of the credit union movement in Ireland.  All of these issues have been advanced on the basis of consultation and dialogue with the representative bodies for credit unions and the Financial Regulator.  The progress achieved demonstrates my commitment to the success and the long-term development of credit unions in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_1275">Section 86 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003, subject to conditions, grants exemption from Capital Acquisitions Tax in respect of a house comprised in a gift or an inheritance.   One of the conditions is that the donee or successor must occupy the house for the period of 3 years ending with the date of the gift or inheritance.   Where that house has replaced other property, the beneficiary must have resided either in that house and the other property for periods which together amounted to at least 3 years in the 4-year period prior to the date of the gift or inheritance.   Another condition is that the donee or successor, if under the age of 55, must continue to occupy the house as his or her only or main residence for a further period of 6 years.   However, there is provision to allow for a replacement house in that period and for situations where the individual concerned is not in occupation of the house because of work obligations abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1276">Amendments to this section are being made in the current Finance Bill which is due before the Seanad next week.   These amendments are as a result of Revenue's experience in administering and auditing claims under this section, including taking issues before the Appeal Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1277">Firstly, relief will not be available where a donee lives in the principal private residence of the donor where that residence is gifted unless the donor is compelled by reason of old age or infirmity to depend on the services of the donee.   This is to counter the argument that where a child is gifted a house by a parent having up until then lived in the parental home, that the 3 year period of occupancy of the gifted house is satisfied.  The second change will require that the gifted house, and any house that it replaced, be owned by the donor during the 3-year period even if they were not his or her principal private residence.    This is to counter a claim for relief where an individual sells his principal private residence to his parents for full value and then it is gifted back by the parent.    It also counters the use of family trusts in gifting houses to children.</p>

            <p eId="para_1279">The National Development Plan/Community Support Framework (NDP/ CSF) 2000-2006 is an integrated investment plan and strategy for economic and social development for Ireland.  It involved significant investment in infrastructure — such as roads, public transport, water and waste services, health services, social housing, education, industry and rural development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">The NDP/CSF 2000-2006 is implemented through seven Operational Programmes.  Performance indicators at programme and priority level are included in the Operational Programme documents and at measure (and sub-measure) level in the programme complement documents.  Investment under the plan can continue until 2008 in accordance with EU Rules.  The NDP/CSF Monitoring Committee set up by my Department to monitor progress in implementation of the Plan, examines physical and financial progress at programme and priority level with reference to these indicators.  The Committee's most recent progress reports (December 2006) indicate that physical implementation is progressing well with some priorities exceeding their end programme targets already.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">The data reported indicates that some €54 billion has been spent on the NDP/CSF 2000-2006 to the end December 2006. This represents 95% of original profile for the life of the Plan.  The Exchequer &amp; EU contribution to the plan for the same period amounts to almost €46 billion which represents 104% of original profiled Exchequer and EU expenditure for the lifetime of the Plan.   The final Exchequer and EU expenditure is expected to cover a lower than expected take-up from the private sector.  These figures also indicate that all demands for expenditure are being met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">The ESRI in its ex-ante assessment of investment priorities for NDP 2007-2013 concluded that "The current NDP has greatly enhanced the economic and social infrastructure of the State with major benefits to economic development throughout all regions".  My Department has also recently published a progress review entitled NDP/CSF 2000-2006 — Review which highlights some of the key features of the investment under the Plan.  This review is available on the NDP website www.ndp.ie.</p>

            <p eId="para_1284">The Budget 2007 forecast increases in tax revenues for 2008 and 2009 are 7.3% and 6.9% respectively. Employment is projected to increase by 2.1% and 1.6% in 2008 and 2009 respectively.  New house price increases are assumed to be modest in both 2008 and 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1285">There are no reliable macro economic indicators currently available which detail activity in the second-hand housing market, from which the bulk of residential property related Stamp duty receipts are derived. Accordingly, the forecast changes in the volume and price of new house activity are used as a general proxy for the change in the level and value of stamp duty liable transactions for second-hand houses. Added to this is an adjustment for the consequential movement into the higher stamp duty bands brought about by the projected increase in new house prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1286">Clearly, such forecasts are susceptible to a far greater margin of error than other economic variables such as forecasts of employment, income and consumption.</p>

            <p eId="para_1288">Chapter 3 of the recently launched National Development Plan 2007-2013 sets out a strong framework for the promotion of regional development with a particular focus on investment in the National Spatial Strategy (NSS) Gateway centres. Five of the nine Gateways — Dundalk, Letterkenny/Derry, Midlands, Galway and Sligo — are in the Border, Midland and Western Region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289">The Plan also points out that, in addition to the specific Gateway projects mentioned, "there will be many additional programmes and projects funded under the Plan which will play an important role in the economic and social development of the Gateway Regions, including the Hubs, county towns and rural areas of the Regions". The projects listed are undoubtedly key ones not only for the Gateway centres but also to improve linkages within the regions and between the regions. There is also a Chapter of the Plan dedicated to the Rural Economy and much of the investment aimed at promoting the development of rural areas will help the BMW Region. Finally, it can be expected that the BMW Region will benefit directly from the consolidated and enhanced framework for all-island cooperation set out in the Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290">The Plan also provides for the establishment of a Gateways Innovation Fund of some €300 million of Exchequer funding for the period 2008-2010. The purpose of this fund is to leverage matching private and other public funding for projects that give added value to Gateway development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">The implementation of NDP programmes and projects is the responsibility of the relevant Government Departments and Agencies. Departments and Agencies will roll out public investment in line with the investment framework set out in the NDP. I am confident that the regional development strategy, in tandem with the supports for the development of the rural economy and the prospect of enhanced all-island cooperation, will help promote the economic development of the BMW Region as well as promoting a better quality of life in the Region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">A key feature of the monitoring template for the Plan will be to measure the impact of investment on regional development. Accordingly the Annual Report on NDP implementation will detail the following, in particular:</p>
            <p eId="para_1293">Projects and programmes, planned and being implemented, above a specified threshold in each of the 8 Regional Authority areas;</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">Projected impact of projects and programmes — planned and under way; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1295">High level socio-economic indicators for each Regional Authority area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1296">In relation to the NDP/CSF 2000-2006, the figures reported at the NDP/CSF Monitoring Committee meeting in December 2006 indicate that some €11.8 billion of Exchequer and EU expenditure has been incurred by the end of June 2006.  The original Exchequer and EU forecast for the BMW Region for the lifetime of the Plan is €14.6 billion.  Accordingly, this is a healthy implementation rate in view of the slow start up in some areas at the very beginning, the relatively disappointing response in certain demand-led schemes and the fact that Exchequer spending in relation to Structural Fund Measures for the 2000-2006 period will in fact continue up to 2008 in accordance with EU Regulations.  Based on the most recent information available to me from Monitoring Committee reports, including their assessments of continuing expenditure, I expect that by the end of the programme period, aggregate Exchequer and EU NDP spending in the BMW region will be in the region of €14 billion.</p>

            <p eId="para_1298">My department examines trends across all major tax heads, including stamp duty, on an ongoing basis.  At end February 2007 stamp duties for the year to date were up 22% year on year. They are currently running at 16% ahead of the same time last year (16 March).</p>
            <p eId="para_1299">It is very difficult to draw conclusions from tax receipts over a period as short as 3 months and to determine if the figures represent a trend that is set to continue. However, evidence for the property market suggests that Stamp Duty receipts, although still strong, will not continue to grow at the rate of recent years. This moderation has been expected for some time.  I have pointed out on several occasions in the past we have taken care not to plan the public finances around an assumption that receipts from stamps and Capital Gains Tax will continue to grow in future years as they have in the recent past.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300">I assume that the second part of the Deputy's question refers to residential property. In this regard, anecdotal evidence suggests that the volume of house sales has eased. Hard data is not yet available but the standard leading indicators (planning permissions etc) suggest an easing in the market.  In terms of price developments, the latest data show that the rate of house price inflation has slowed since the middle of last year.  Moreover, these data show that on a month-on-month basis, prices have been more or less flat since October.</p>

            <p eId="para_1327">A major programme of work to upgrade the computer systems for RCT to the standard that is available for other business taxes was undertaken in recent years by Revenue so that RCT is now fully integrated within the Revenue Integrated Taxation Systems. Every RCT case is now the subject of active compliance management in the same way as for any other business tax. In that regard, in conjunction with the enhancement of its computer systems Revenue also prioritised its compliance focus on the monthly return and payment required of those registered for RCT. Compliance rates improved very significantly in 2006 — most notably for the biggest cases, where the average rate increased by 7% in the year. Indeed current compliance for the biggest cases was 88% in December last compared with 61% at the start of last year. Across the full customer base, current compliance for RCT increased by 2% in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1328">In relation to the annual return [RCT 35] filing compliance also increased in 2006. Return filing increased by almost 7% to 88% in 2006. The biggest improvement was for the largest cases where the improvement was 10%.  Compliance activity by Revenue is and will continue to increase further in 2007 as Revenue continues it's focus on construction. This will include an earlier start to Revenue's compliance campaign for the RCT35.</p>

            <p eId="para_1330">Inflation, as measured by the CPI fell to 4.8 per cent in February from 5.2 per cent in January 2007. On a HICP basis inflation fell to 2.6 per cent in February from 2.9 per cent in January. The rate of CPI inflation has increased in the past year; this is mainly due to ECB interest rate increases which are outside of Government control.</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">Maintaining a moderate rate of inflation remains a key priority of economic policy because of its importance in restoring competitiveness. The Government is focusing on areas it can control and taking positive actions to contain inflation by implementing responsible fiscal policies. For example, we have not increased excise duties for the last three years, apart from tobacco excise, which was done for sound health policy reasons. We are promoting greater price competition through various measures. We are also investing in public infrastructure, as evidenced by the recently announced National Development Plan, which will enhance our ability to produce more goods and services and, by improving the economy's efficiency, keep inflation down.</p>
            <p eId="para_1332">In addition, we recognise that services sector inflation is a cause for concern and this highlights the need for more competition in the economy as well as for pay and profit restraint in all sectors in order to keep our cost base down. We must ensure that the wage increases granted under the Social Partnership agreement, Towards 2016, are reflected in productivity gains.</p>

            <p eId="para_1334">While income tax, capital gains tax and excise duties were slightly below profile at end-February, total tax receipts were 12.8 per cent ahead of the same period last year and 2.4 per cent ahead of profile. Income tax receipts were up 8.1 per cent compared to the same period in 2006, capital gains tax receipts were up 27.4 per cent and excise duties were up 2.8 per cent. The other main tax-heads — VAT, corporation tax and stamp duty — were also well up on last year and ahead of profile.</p>
            <p eId="para_1335">This data does not betoken a slowdown but it is always unwise to attempt to draw conclusions about the performance of the economy based on tax receipts at this early stage. The latest available economic estimates for 2006 show that the economy continues to perform well. In Budget 2007 in December, my Department estimated that real GDP growth in 2006 was 5.4 per cent while in GNP terms the growth rate in 2006 was estimated at 5.7 per cent.</p>

            <p eId="para_1337">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, as the Deputy will appreciate, the amount of arrears of tax and duty is constantly fluctuating.  Accordingly for accounting and auditing purposes, and to enable comparisons over time, the debt is calculated and analysed as at 31 March each year.  At 31 March 2006 the arrears of tax and duty amounted to €1,085m. The debt for the equivalent time as at 31st March 2005 amounted to €1,217m, representing a reduction of €132m or 11% in the year. I am advised that the tax debt figure as at 31 March 2007 will be analysed and published in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1338">Of the debt of €1,085m as at 31st March 2006, €184m was being actively managed, generally through an agreed instalment arrangement where the taxpayer was given additional time to pay; €435m was under active collection, while €213m was the subject of enforcement action.  In summary a total of €832m was under active collection/enforcement or under control. The balance of €253m was under appeal and not therefore available for collection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1339">As the Deputy will be aware, the collectible debt is a constantly changing figure.  Additional debt can arise and can also reduce when taxpayers make returns, activity by Revenue results in debt being collected; new debt can arise when Revenue issue assessments, payments by taxpayers result in debt being reduced — and so on. Revenue estimate that the collectible debt of €832m for 2006 plus any additional debts that subsequently arise for the same period, will be reduced by up to 97% over a five-year period. The remaining balance will be under control, under appeal or at enforcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1340">Revenue have stated in their Statement of Strategy 2005-2007, that all debt on record should be less than five years old or the subject of active enforcement or Court proceedings. Revenue have emphasised that the strategies and methodologies adopted to achieve a reduction over a five year period are subject to annual review and evaluation that is carried out within the context of the business planning process.  Revenue's Debt management programme is also subject to annual audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and is reported on in his report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1341">I would point out that the Revenue debt as a percentage of gross collection is now one of the lowest of any tax administration, standing at less than 2% of gross collection. I am satisfied that the measures being taken by Revenue are highly effective in ensuring the collection of tax debts. Beyond the on-going review and evaluation of collection strategies and methodologies by Revenue I have no plans for new measures in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1384">It should be noted that in the case of the married two-earner couple, an income split of 65%:35% between the two spouses is assumed.  A different income split could give rise to different take home pay figures for the married two-earner couple.  The difference in take home pay between a married one-earner couple and a married two-earner couple arises due to a number of factors including band structure, differing entitlement to personal credits and the application of conditions which apply in the health levy and PRSI systems.</p>

            <p eId="para_1386">VAT like all taxes is reviewed each year in the context of each Budget and Finance Bill. However, the VAT regime and indeed the rating of all goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. However, it is possible to move existing zero rated items to either the reduced rate or the standard rate depending on the item in question. However, once moved, it would not be possible to revert them to the zero rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">Member States may have up to two reduced VAT rates of not less than 5 per cent for a specified number of goods or services which are set out in Annex III of the EU VAT Directive. The goods and services in Annex III include certain foods, non-oral medicines, supply, construction and alteration of housing provided as part of a social policy, and newspapers and periodicals. Goods and services at the reduced rate may be moved to the standard rate, but only those listed in Annex III may be reverted from the standard rate to the reduced rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">In addition, Member States have the option of maintaining, at a reduced rate of not less than 12 per cent, any items not listed in Annex III, provided they carried the reduced rate on 1 January 1991. These items are considered to be ‘parked' and Ireland's parked rate is the same as our reduced rate of 13.5%. Domestic fuels, restaurant services and labour intensive services are examples of parked items.  Member States must therefore apply the standard VAT rate to those goods and services that are not subject to VAT at the zero rate and which are not listed in Annex III of the Sixth VAT Directive.</p>

The VAT treatment of heating oil is based on the fact that on 1 January 1991 it was taxed at the reduced rate. Under EU law Member States can continue to apply reduced rates in such cases provided the rate is not below 12%.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1426">While the promotion of biofuel is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in Finance Act 2006 I provided for significant tax measures to promote biofuels in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">This scheme, which received the necessary EU State Aid approval, commenced in November 2006 and will:</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">provide for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum;</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">cost over €200m over 5 years;</p>
            <p eId="para_1430">when fully operational, result in CO2 savings of over 250,000 tonnes per annum;</p>
            <p eId="para_1431">contribute towards meeting a target of 5.75% transport fuel market penetration by biofuels by 2009;</p>
            <p eId="para_1432">help reduce our dependency on conventional fossil fuels, and</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">stimulate activity in the agricultural sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">As a complementary measure, I provided in Finance Act 2006 for a new 50% VRT relief to promote new flexible fuel vehicles (cars designed to operate on biofuels) for an initial period of two years, and extended the existing VRT relief for hybrid cars by a further year to end 2007. I am also providing in Finance Bill 2007 for the introduction of a VRT relief of 50% for electric cars — cars which can be propelled by a rechargeable battery — on a pilot one year basis with effect from 1 January, 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">In addition I announced in the Budget the commencement of a public consultation process on adjusting VRT to take greater account of CO2 emissions of vehicles. A similar exercise is under way in the area of motor tax. Any changes will have effect from a target date of 1 January 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">The overall level of excise relief available for biofuels under the above mentioned Scheme is that which had been proposed by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in advance of Budget 2006.  It is regarded as a level which is sufficient to match Ireland's output potential in relation to renewable energy crops for motor fuels over the coming years. These fiscal incentives were designed to kick start the domestic biofuels industry and the evidence suggests that this is happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_1437">The Deputy might wish to note that there are additional non-fiscal measures that can be used to promote biofuels and reach the targets referred to. To provide further market certainty and encourage projects of scale, the Government recently announced its intention to move to a Biofuels Obligation by 2009, with targets for market penetration for biofuels of 5.75% in 2009 and 10% by 2020.</p>

            <p eId="para_1439">Over ten thousand six hundred civil and public servants have applied to relocate under the Programme. Of these, approximately 5,600 or 53% are currently based in Dublin. The Central Applications Facility remains open and continues to receive applications.  Discussions have concluded on a number of human resource and industrial relations matters and are being progressed on other issues.  At the end of December 2006, over 2,400 staff had been assigned to decentralising posts.  Approximately 800 of these are currently in place, in 17 new locations, while the remainder are being trained in advance of decentralisation to a new location, as soon as accommodation becomes available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1440">It is envisaged that by the end of 2007 public services will be delivered from 36 of the decentralisation towns with approximately 2,000 staff transferred. The precise numbers moving within that time frame will depend on the availability of property as well as timeframes for completion of fit out and installation of necessary ICT (information communications technology) and telecommunication cabling and equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1441">Across the public service, recruitment and promotion practices generally are being managed in a way which facilitates the achievement of the Decentralisation Programme in an efficient manner.  Agreement has been reached with the Civil Service unions representing general service staff that all interdepartmental promotions will be made on the basis of the appointee agreeing to move to a post in a decentralising unit, Department or Office. Where an organisation is moving in full, all internal promotions will include a decentralisation condition in the 52 week period prior to the move.  Where an organisation is moving in part, 50% of all internal promotions will include a decentralisation condition in the 52 week period prior to the move taking place.  These arrangements allow for a proportion of all promotions arising in Civil Service general service posts in the normal course to have a decentralisation condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1442">Discussions are ongoing with the unions representing professional &amp; technical staff in the Civil Service on the range of industrial relations issues arising, including promotion arrangements and placing of staff who wish to remain in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1443">The position in relation to the State Agencies is of course more complex.  The Government has always said that this is a voluntary Programme.  Any staff member wishing to remain in Dublin will be accommodated with a public service job in Dublin.  However, there is a need to balance the business needs of the organisation in furthering its relocation objective with the needs of staff remaining in Dublin.  In these circumstances promotions policy must take account of the reality of Decentralisation.  It is my strong view that these issues can be resolved through dialogue and negotiations.</p>

        <b>Mr. Boyle</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
         his views on the Danish system of refunding VAT paid by charities. 
        [10148/07]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_503">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1445">The position is that charities and non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT under the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply. This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group (ICTRG) appears to accept that charities can not be granted VAT refunds through the tax system. However, they are still seeking the introduction of a grant or subsidy in lieu of the VAT charities pay on their business inputs and estimate that this would cost €18 million per annum in respect of the bodies they represent. However, given that Exchequer funding is made available to very many charitable organisations this is in effect already happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447">The 140 bodies represented by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group already acknowledge that they receive some €9 million in funding either directly or indirectly from the Exchequer. However, there are approximately 7,000 charities registered with the Revenue Commissioners. It is therefore likely that the introduction of a scheme along the lines proposed by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group would cost the Exchequer significantly more than the €18 million estimate put forward by the group in respect of the bodies they represent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">I understand that the only EU Member State to introduce a scheme providing partial compensation for a limited number of charities for VAT incurred on input costs is Denmark. To be eligible under the Danish scheme charities must already be approved bodies under the Danish equivalent of our tax relief on donations scheme. My Department understands that some 750 charities in Denmark could benefit as a result. In comparison, over 1,900 organisations have to date been approved under the Irish donations relief scheme. It also understands that under the Danish scheme educational institutions are not eligible for compensation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">It is likely, therefore, the introduction of any grant system in lieu of VAT paid by registered charities in Ireland would undoubtedly lead to other exempt bodies such as schools, hospitals and sporting organisations, many of which are already registered as charities, seeking to benefit from such a system of refunds. These exempt bodies are already receiving considerable Exchequer funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_1450">The tax code already treats charities in a favourable manner. The tax code currently provides exemption for charities from Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Deposit Interest Retention Tax, Capital Acquisitions Tax, Stamp Duty, Probate Tax, Dividend Withholding Tax and the uniform scheme of tax relief for donations. While no overall definitive figures are available on the cost to the Exchequer of charitable tax exemption status, Revenue estimated in 2005 that the cost of the various tax exemptions and tax reliefs, including the tax relief on donations scheme, in place for bodies conferred with charitable status could be as high as €190m annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_1451">In addition to tax exemptions and reliefs, charities, voluntary and community groups, sporting bodies benefit significantly from grants schemes administered by a number of Government Departments. Finally, even if funds were available for grant-aiding charities and other voluntary groups, I am not sure that the most appropriate use of the funds would be to relieve them of the VAT paid on inputs as opposed to grant-aiding their activities using other criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_1453">The Deputy will be aware that office holders and members of the Dáil and the Seanad may accept a gift in only limited circumstances.  The Taoiseach and Tánaiste announced in October that the Ethics legislation would be amended to require an office holder or member, before accepting a significant gift or loan, to seek the opinion of the Standards in Public Office Commission that acceptance of it would not be likely to compromise the recipient in the discharge of his or her official duties, and to abide by the Commission's opinion.  A Bill to this effect is currently being drafted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454">The key provisions of the Bill will be as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">to require office holders, members of the Oireachtas and the Attorney General, if offered a gift or gifts, or a loan or loans of money, worth 2,000 euro or more in any calendar year from a friend for personal reasons, to seek the opinion of the Standards in Public Office Commission as to whether acceptance would be likely to compromise the recipient in the performance of his or her official duties, and to abide by the Commission's opinion;</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">this requirement will also apply to property lent or services supplied for less than the commercial price by 2,000 euro or more;</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">to update the monetary thresholds for registerable interests in the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995;</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">to provide that consulting the Standards Commission will be a confidential process and that the opinion of the Standards Commission will also be confidential.  However, all office holders, Oireachtas members and the Attorney General will be required to furnish a statement to the Standards Commission each year that they are in compliance with the new requirement, as part of their annual returns; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1459">to provide that if an office holder, Oireachtas member or Attorney General fails to seek the opinion of the Standards Commission or fails to abide by its opinion, he or she can be the subject of an investigation by the Standards Commission, on the lines currently provided for in the Ethics legislation, which will result in a report or decision of the Standards Commission on the matter being laid before the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1460">I wrote last week to the Chairmen of the Select Committees on Members' Interests of the Dáil and the Seanad setting out the key provisions and asking the Committees to give their views on them as soon as possible.  The Government intends to introduce the Bill in the current session.</p>

            <p eId="para_1462">Activity in the housing sector impacts primarily on VAT, Stamp duty and Capital gains tax. Housing market activity also impacts on Income tax and PRSI receipts and Corporation tax from construction sector company profits.  While revenues from housing market activity such as Stamp duty and Capital gains tax have made an increasing contribution to the Exchequer in recent years, we are not overly reliant on receipts from these sources. For example, taken together the Stamp duty and Capital Gains tax tax-heads are forecast to contribute just under 15 per cent of total targeted tax revenues in 2007 and it is worth noting that a significant proportion of receipts from these tax-heads come from sources other than residential property.</p>
            <p eId="para_1463">In contrast, the 4 main tax-heads — VAT, Income tax, Corporation tax and Excise duty are forecast to account for 84 per cent of tax receipts this year, even allowing for the lower than usual corporation tax forecast which is due to the cash-flow reduction arising from the ending of the transitional payment arrangements.  Care has been taken not to plan the public finances around an assumption that receipts from Stamp duty and Capital gains tax will continue to grow in future years as they have in the recent past.  This is a prudent and sensible approach to take and it has been endorsed by the IMF and other commentators.</p>

            <p eId="para_1468">Inflation, as measured by the CPI fell to 4.8 per cent in February from 5.2 per cent in January 2007. On a HICP basis inflation fell to 2.6 per cent in February from 2.9 per cent in January. The rate of CPI inflation has increased in the past year; this is mainly due to ECB interest rate increases which are outside of Government control. If mortgage interest was removed, CPI inflation would have measured 2.5 per cent in February.</p>
            <p eId="para_1469">Maintaining a moderate rate of inflation remains a key priority of economic policy because of its importance in restoring competitiveness. The Government is focusing on areas it can control and taking positive actions to contain inflation by implementing responsible fiscal policies. For example, we have not increased excise duties for the last three years, apart from tobacco excise, which was done for sound health policy reasons. We are promoting greater price competition through various measures. We are also investing in public infrastructure, as evidenced by the recently announced National Development Plan, which will enhance our ability to produce more goods and services and, by improving the economy's efficiency, keep inflation down.</p>
            <p eId="para_1470">In addition, we recognise that services sector inflation is a cause for concern and this highlights the need for more competition in the economy as well as for pay and profit restraint in all sectors in order to keep our cost base down.

            <p eId="para_1472">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Customs control of airports has to be looked at in the context of the Internal Market and the principle of freedom of movement within the European Union.  Routine and systematic Customs checks on goods and passengers moving within any part of the EU have been abolished, as have Customs controls on the baggage of intra-Community passengers other than anti-smuggling checks. This is particularly relevant in the case of Knock Airport where passenger traffic is predominantly intra-Community. In this context, Revenue's approach must of necessity be to balance the freedom of movement principle in regard to people and goods with the need to control smuggling and enforce prohibitions and restrictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1473">Detection dogs have been used at Knock Airport for a number of years. Attendance is risk based and targeted using analysis and evaluation of general seizure trends, traffic frequency, route and similar risk indicators. These attendances cover the full range of flights times and are kept under constant review in particular to take account of emerging smuggling trends and any traffic increase at the airport.  I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that the level of use of detection dogs at Knock is adequate to address the risks.</p>

            <p eId="para_1477">Under the EU Insurance Mediation Directive, travel agents who sell insurance only as part of a holiday package are specifically exempt from financial regulation. These agents are therefore not authorised and regulated as financial services providers by the Financial Regulator and do not come within the scope of the Consumer Protection Codes recently introduced by the Financial Regulator.  The Financial Regulator does, however, publish information and advice on travel insurance for the benefit of consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1478">The Package Holidays and Travel Trade Act 1995 covers the holiday package but not the travel insurance that may be sold with it. The Financial Services Ombudsman has powers to deal with complaints which concern the conduct of the underwriting insurance company, in relation to claims about the actual policies themselves, but not the sales process of travel agents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1479">Any travel agent selling travel insurance that is not part of a package holiday, must be registered with the Financial Regulator as an insurance intermediary. I understand that such insurance is widely available, whether through travel agents or other providers and I would urge consumers to examine carefully the benefits of this option.</p>
            <p eId="para_1480">Under the Package Holidays and Travel Trade Act it is the Director of Consumer Affairs who has direct responsibility for enforcing consumer protection provisions dealing with information provided to the consumer before conclusion of a package holiday contract. There is an obligation under section 12(1)(c) of the Act for the travel organiser/retailer to provide the consumer with information on the minimum level of travel insurance cover where such insurance cover is compulsory under the holiday contract. If such insurance is not compulsory under the contract, section 12(4) also provides that the travel organiser will inform the consumer about the optional conclusion of an insurance policy to cover certain risks. Under the Consumer Protection Bill 2007, which was recently published by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, it is proposed to transfer the functions of the Director of Consumer Affairs to the new National Consumer Agency.</p>

An invitation for expressions of interest from lending intermediaries is expected to issue shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1502">The €25m funding made available by the banks for the Initiative represents a very substantial increase over the resources currently devoted to social finance lending. I believe this level of seed funding is sufficient to meet initial requirements for the implementation of the Initiative. Looking to the future, as I indicated when I announced the Initiative in Budget 2006, the door is also open for other sectors and indeed private individuals to participate. I see the launch of the Foundation as a catalyst for deeper participation by private finance in the area of local and community development and social enterprise, providing a long-term sustainable funding stream for suitable social finance projects, over and above the significant seed funding contributed by the banks.</p>

            <p eId="para_1504">The Government has over the last number of years, followed a policy under which growth in public service employment has slowed overall. The Government will continue to control and regulate numbers employed in the public service within agreed ceilings.  The number employed is kept under constant review given the importance of striking an appropriate balance between the need, on the one hand, to provide resources to improve front-line services and cater for demographic pressures and the need, on the other, to control and regulate overall numbers in the context of providing value for money for the public expenditure involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1505">This strategy will govern decisions about employment in public services over the period in question. It is a matter for each Minister and Department to manage their employment levels within this strategy.  The table shows the latest figures available for the number of staff serving in the public sector; these are whole-time equivalents at end-December 2006.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#TomParlonPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_516">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
            <p eId="para_1527">The Government is committed to the full implementation of the Decentralisation Programme announced in Budget 2004, involving some 10,300 civil and public service jobs in more than 56 locations across some 60 Government Departments/Offices and Agencies.  My Office is in the process of procuring appropriate properties in the designated locations for the Departments and Agencies involved, with much progress having been made to date.  Property acquisition negotiations are completed or are significantly advanced at 37 locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">The prevailing property market conditions in each geographical area have a significant bearing on the cost of acquiring sites.  As the acquisition process is still in progress, it is not possible at this stage to provide a precise estimate of the cost of the site acquisition programme.  However, and for working purposes only, an indicative figure of €75 to €100 million (excluding VAT) is being used by the OPW.</p>
            <p eId="para_1529">As the Deputy will know the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) in its report of November 2004 announced the names of the Departments and organisations selected as ‘early movers' and set out a timetable for provision of accommodation.  At the same time the Group published a Report on the Procurement and Financial aspects of decentralisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1530">In June 2005 the DIG published a further Report updating the timetable announced in November 2004; this timetable was revised in September 2006.  The Report includes a timetable for the balance of organisations comprehended by the decentralisation programme, and sets out commencement and completion dates for accommodation ranging from the final quarter of 2005 to end of 2009.  I am confident that this programme will be successfully implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_1531">In relation to the Public Private Partnership approach recommended by the DIG my Office has been developing a comprehensive risk-adjusted costing of project elements to measure the value-for-money of future PPP bids.  Expressions of Interest have been received and evaluated in respect of 3 locations (Portlaoise, Mullingar and Carlow) with very significant interest being shown.  I expect that tenders will be invited in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">Although property solutions will include leasing and fitting-out of existing buildings, it is anticipated that, in the majority of cases, the accommodation facilities will be provided by the construction of new office buildings and cost estimation can be approached on that basis.  However, in advance of actual market testing of any procurement methodology, it is possible, at this time, only to assign the most general measurements of cost to such a large-scale, diverse and complex programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1533">It is estimated that approximately 210,000 sq. m of office space will be required to accommodate the total numbers included in the programme.  OPW cost norms (April 2005, being updated by April 2007) in respect of offices would indicate an average build-cost to fit-out standard, in the range of €1,800 to €2,200 per square metre for suburban/rural locations and €2,500 to €3,000 per square metre in city/town centre locations.  Such figures exclude VAT, professional fees and inflation.  In addition the cost of equipping the accommodation to standard office equipment levels could be estimated at c.€4,000 per person.  This would exclude the cost of Information and Communication Technology and specialised equipment requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1534">Such general measurements of cost do not include specialised facility and equipment requirements and other variables which would arise from the spread of possible procurement methodologies.  In addition general cost indicators of this type show a snapshot in time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1535">It is self-evident that a firmer scale of costs for the decentralisation programme will only emerge on foot of actual cost proposals being received from the market.  It will be some months yet before sufficient data can be extracted from a suitable range of tender competitions to provide a basis on which more robust estimates of the overall cost of the programme can be made.  Nevertheless it can be estimated that, generally-speaking, the cost of providing accommodation in provincial, compared to central Dublin locations should yield considerable cost savings to the State over time in terms of site costs, capital build costs and indeed maintenance costs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1537">The rise in personal indebtedness must be seen in the context of buoyant economic conditions in recent years, which have been associated with very strong employment growth, increases in wages and reductions in direct taxation. A large part of the increase in personal sector indebtedness also reflects the accumulation of housing assets on the part of households. Moreover, the level of public indebtedness as a percentage of national income has fallen in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">Therefore, provided that the economy and the public finances remain strong, the current level of personal indebtedness should have no significant implications at the macroeconomic level.  This highlights the importance of remaining competitive and of adhering to prudent budgetary policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1539">As I have pointed out before, both borrowers and lenders need to be aware that interest rates are still low by historical standards.  Borrowers need to factor the prospective impact of changes to interest rates into their financial planning. I fully support the vigilance of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator on the issue of private sector credit and in reminding borrowers and lenders of the need for responsible behaviour. The Government, for its part, will continue to contribute to economic and financial stability by pursuing a prudent fiscal policy.</p>

Policy with regard to all taxes, including stamp duty, is reviewed every year in the context of the annual Budget. In the most recent Budget I abolished stamp duty on mortgage deeds, assisted sporting bodies wishing to purchase land for the purpose of promoting sports and introduced a new stamp duty relief for stock market intermediaries which better reflects modern share dealing practices.</p>

            <p eId="para_1601">I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 171 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1602">The main consumption related taxes are VAT and excise duty. Taken together these two tax-heads are forecast to account for almost €21 billion or 43 per cent of total tax revenues in 2007 compared to the 44 per cent and 46 per cent of actual taxes they accounted for in 1997 and 1987 respectively.  Construction impacts on a number of tax-heads, most notably capital taxes such as stamp duty and capital gains tax but also VAT and to a lesser extent income tax, PRSI receipts and corporation tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_1603">While revenues from construction related taxes such as stamp duty and capital gains tax have made an increasing contribution to the Exchequer in recent years, we are not overly reliant on receipts from these sources. For example, taken together the stamp duty and capital gains tax tax-heads are forecast to contribute around 15 per cent of total targeted tax revenues in 2007. In contrast, the 4 main tax-heads — VAT, income tax, corporation tax and excise duty are forecast to account for 84 per cent of tax receipts this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1604">Care has been taken not to plan the public finances around an assumption that receipts from stamp duty and capital gains tax will continue to grow in future years as they have in the recent past.  This is a prudent and sensible approach to take and it has been endorsed by the IMF and other commentators.</p>

            <p eId="para_1606">Exports of goods and services are estimated to have increased, in real terms, by an annual average of 4.1% in the last 4 years. Export growth in recent years has been concentrated in the services sector rather than in traditional manufacturing sectors.  Between Q4 2002 and Q4 2006 the numbers employed in manufacturing declined by 13,700, or 4.5%. However, this decline in employment in the manufacturing sector has taken place over a period when total employment increased by 282,500, or 15.8%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1607">The changes in the composition of exports indicate that some of the decline in manufacturing employment can be seen as part of a process of structural change in the economy. While manufacturing jobs are being lost, many jobs in high value added sectors such as financial services are being created. It is also the case that losses in competitiveness over the last number of years are placing pressure on manufacturing firms. It is for this reason that we must remain focused on restoring and enhancing competitiveness going forward, if Ireland is to continue growing strongly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1608">In the medium term, the outlook for Irish export performance remains broadly positive. Our existing strong export base, particularly in pharmaceuticals, food, medical devices, software and financial services, allied with our pro-business environment and skilled workforce, are factors which provide good grounds to expect a continued solid export performance from the Irish economy over the medium term.  To ensure that our export sector remains strong, the Government is adhering to prudent fiscal policies as well as investing in infrastructure, education and skills development.</p>

I established the Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit in my Department in June 2006 with the appointment of a Head of Unit and assignment of appropriately qualified staff. The Unit's initial phase of operations included the development of a work programme and running a recruitment process for appropriately skilled expenditure evaluators. Two evaluators have recently been appointed from this competition.  In addition, my Department currently has four participants in the Masters Programme in Policy Analysis delivered by the Institute of Public Administration in association with the Faculty of Commerce, UCD. Upon completion of the programme, they will be assigned as expenditure evaluators to the Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit, two in mid 2007 and two in mid 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1611">The Unit's work programme for the next twelve months will focus on checking compliance with the capital expenditure VFM frameworks, including undertaking its own programme of spot checks of individual capital projects; overseeing roll out by Departments of the programme of reviews under the Value for Money and Policy Review initiative and development and roll out of a scheme of programme evaluation under the new National Development Plan (2007-2013).</p>
            <p eId="para_1612">Spot checks of capital projects are in the first instance the responsibility of each spending Department, who are required to put a system in place to carry out spot checks of projects to ensure compliance with the VFM framework and to report the findings of their spot checks annually to my Department.  The Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit in my Department will review these spot check reports and may also directly undertake its own spot checks of individual capital projects either as part of this review process or on its own initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1613">As part of its work programme for 2007, the Unit will be undertaking its own series of spot checks of individual capital projects.  This programme of spot checks has commenced with the examination of a number of projects in the transport sector.  Activity in this area will be expanded over the coming months following the recent appointment of new staff members to the Unit.</p>

            <p eId="para_1631">The banking industry has proposed the development of a universal bank account enabling all citizens to make and receive payments electronically — whether in the form of salary, benefit or welfare. The Deputy may wish to note that there are a number of important issues to be considered in progressing such a proposal such as the fees to be associated, who would have right of access to such an account and also the underlying need for such a product. For example, at the National Payments Conference in December 2006, hosted jointly by the Department of the Taoiseach and the Irish Payments Services Organisation, data was presented which suggested that this is a less widespread issue than has been thought hitherto. More detailed study is therefore necessary in advance of the formulation of any policy initiative in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1632">It must also be remembered that the credit union movement has been a key provider of savings and loans since its inception and has a particular role to play in supporting savings by persons on low incomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1633">My responsibility as Minister for Finance is to bring forward proposals for a legislative framework for the regulation of the financial services sector from a prudential, systemic and consumer protection perspective. In general the operational responsibility for implementation of that framework lies with the Financial Regulator.  As far as I am aware the legislative and regulatory framework provides no obstacle to access. There are 7,000 or so financial services providers authorised by the Financial Regulator and the range and scope of the services they provide is primarily a commercial decision in which neither the Financial Regulator nor I have any direct function.</p>
            <p eId="para_1634">As part of its consumer mandate the Financial Regulator has taken a number of specific initiatives to help consumers in the framework of the Financial Regulator's "It's Your Money" campaign.  These have involved publishing consumer guides and cost surveys on credit and other financial products, and fact sheets, including a fact sheet entitled "How to Open a Bank or Building Society Account" all of which are intended to assist consumers in making the most appropriate financial decisions.  The Financial Regulator has commissioned independent research into this matter with a view to further possible initiatives or policy proposals to address any problems identified. This research includes the report entitled ‘Financial Exclusion in Ireland — An Explanatory Study and Policy Review' which was launched by the Financial Regulator on 11 December 2006. The Financial Regulator has also included in its Consumer Protection Code a requirement that any measures adopted in relation to identification of customers should not deny a person access to financial services solely on the grounds that they do not possess certain specified identification documentation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1636">I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that for taxation purposes single farm payments can be accounted for on either a receipts basis or an annual basis. In cases where farmers make tax returns on a receipts basis the single farm payment is recognised as a receipt pertaining to the date the cheque issues from the Department of Agriculture and Food and is therefore liable to income tax in the tax year during which the payment issued. Where farmers make returns on an annual basis, the single farm payment is recognised by Revenue as a receipt accrued over the year in respect of which the payment was made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1637">The Revenue Commissioners accept farmers treating  income received in respect of single farm payments on  either the receipt basis or the annual basis provided that this treatment is carried out on a consistent basis and that the election for one or other of the methods of making returns was made either from the date of commencement of farming or the year 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_1641">The official opening of my Department's new offices in Tullamore took place on the 6th of October, 2006. Currently, my Department has decentralised one hundred and eighteen (118) staff to Tullamore and a further six (6) staff have accepted offers of decentralisation.  The new offices in the Central Business Park in Tullamore is a modern, state of the art building comprising three floors, with a total floor area of approximately 3,400 sq metres on a site of 2.8 acres.  The Office of Public Works (OPW) paid for the purchase and fit out of the building which cost €11,315,670.39.  Other costs associated with the move to Tullamore to end 2006 amount to €491,810.77.</p>
            <p eId="para_1642">My Department together with the OPW is currently examining possibilities for permanent accommodation in Kildare to accommodate circa 30 ICT posts, which will also be moved under the decentralisation programme.  Pending the identification of a suitable permanent accommodation solution, interim accommodation options in County Kildare are being examined, with a view to having an advance move commenced later this year.  The cost of the provision of accommodation will be paid by the OPW.  To date my Department has not incurred any costs associated with the move to Kildare.</p>
            <p eId="para_1643">Revenue Commissioners</p>
            <p eId="para_1644">As part of the decentralisation programme it is intended that Revenue will decentralise 50 staff to Newcastlewest, 50 staff to Kilrush, 50 staff to Listowel, 250 staff to Athy, 100 staff to Navan and 380 staff to Kildare. In the case of Newcastle West — Forty six (46) staff of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners have decentralised to temporary accommodation in Estuary House, Limerick, in preparation for the move to Newcastle West.  When the decentralisation move to Newcastle West takes place, a further five (5) officers will move to the location.  An accommodation solution is being progressed and it is expected that this will be complete by early 2008, subject to planning issues being resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1645">In the case of Kilrush, fifty four (54) officers have accepted decentralisation offers and the current  projection is that building and accommodation works in Kilrush will finish in May 2007 with occupation to follow shortly afterwards. Similar progress is being made in relation to Listowel,  forty eight (48) officers have accepted decentralisation offers for Listowel and the current projection is that building and accommodation work will finish in late May 2007 with occupation to follow shortly afterwards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1646">Fifty four (54) Revenue staff have accepted decentralisation offers for Athy, and a further thirty seven (37) officers have submitted applications through Central Applications Facility.  A number of possibilities for permanent accommodation are being examined by the Office of Public Works, and it is hoped to have an advance party move to Athy in advance of a permanent accommodation solution being finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1647">To date, eighty (80) staff have accepted decentralisation offers for Navan, and a further fifty one (51) staff have priority applications for Navan on CAF.  A lease for suitable accommodation is being negotiated by the Office of Public Works and the current projection is that Revenue will be in occupation in the third quarter 2007.  One hundred and sixteen (116) people have indicated an interest in decentralising to Kildare with Revenue.  The Office of Public Works are in the process of identifying a suitable location.</p>

            <p eId="para_1650">As part of the decentralisation programme it is intended that OPW will decentralise 330 staff to Trim (future OPW HQ); 150 staff to Claremorris and 100 staff to Kanturk.  To date three hundred and forty two (342) staff have applied for places in Trim under the CAF process, one hundred and fifty two (152) have applied for places in Claremorris and eighty eight (88) staff applied for places in Kanturk.</p>
            <p eId="para_1651">OPW has acquired the site in Trim and planning for the new building has been secured and arrangements are being made currently for the Contractor / Developer to move on site shortly.   The current target for completion is Q4 2008. It is proposed to manage the move to Claremorris in two phases.  The first phase deals with the setting up of an advance office in Claremorris for up to forty (40) staff.   In this regard, OPW has identified accommodation suitable for use, subject to fitting out works.   Tenders are currently being evaluated for these works and it is expected that work will commence shortly with a view to having the accommodation ready for occupation in the second quarter of 2007.   The second phase of this project will be the construction of a permanent office for up to one hundred and fifty (150) staff.   The indicative timeframe at this stage for the completion of the construction is early 2009. A site in Kanturk has been identified as suitable for use and its acquisition is being pursued.</p>

Cork and there have been twenty two (22) applications to-date on the CAF.  It is also intended that 100 staff of the Public Appointments Service (PAS) will be decentralised to Youghal, and eighty seven (87) staff have applied on the CAF to decentralise with the PAS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1654">While neither the Valuation Office or PAS are on the early-movers list, the Office of Public Works (OPW) has identified a suitable site for the decentralised Offices in close proximity to the town centre of Youghal.  The OPW has advised that, following negotiation with the vendor, agreement in principle has been reached for the acquisition of the site and completion of construction is envisaged in mid 2009.  To date, the Valuation Office has not incurred any costs associated with the move to Youghal while the costs incurred by PAS amount to €4,500 (not including staff costs or spending on CAF).</p>

OSI has a presence in six regional offices where a further 100 staff are located in: Kilkenny, Cork, Ennis, Tuam, Sligo and Longford.  These offices will not be relocating to Dungarvan. Applications to decentralise with OSI have been made by forty nine (49) civil and public servants as well as sixteen (16) existing OSI staff based in Dublin.  In addition, fifty four (54) OSI staff have been assigned to Dungarvan as a result of recruitment or promotions under the decentralisation programme since its commencement in December 2003.  Arrangements for decentralisation are proceeding in accordance with the OSI implementation plan and a site has been acquired in Dungarvan by the Office of Public Works (OPW).  To date the OSI has not incurred any financial costs in relation to the decentralisation move.</p>

            <p eId="para_1659">I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that 402 cases were selected for random audit as part of their 2006 programme.  To date, 167 audits have been concluded.  43 cases yielded  €233,721. There were no recoveries from 124 cases (74%).  235 cases are still ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1660">I am advised that 410 cases were selected for random audit under Revenue's 2005 programme.  60 cases did not proceed to final audit due to the particular circumstances of the taxpayer, e.g. trading had discontinued, the taxpayer was deceased or the case had been very recently audited.  111 cases yielded €1,224,528.  There were no recoveries from 231 cases (68%).  Eight cases are still ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1661">I am informed that Revenue's approach to random auditing changed significantly for their 2005 programme. The new approach introduced both better design and delivery of the programme and improved statistical rigour. Accordingly any comparisons with previous years must bear this in mind.  The traditional random audit programme was not carried out in 2004 due to the change in Revenue's approach following a review of the programme.  However, 25 cases selected under the programme for previous years were completed in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1662">I am advised that 274 random audits were completed in 2003.  122 cases yielded €3.4m and 152 cases (55%) were nil yielding.  However, for this year the selection was not purely random as Revenue Districts narrowed down the initial random selection based on risk criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_1663">In relation to 2007, I understand that the random audit programme will commence by the end of March. 400 cases have been randomly selected.  Internationally a sample in the order of 400 cases is regarded as an appropriate sample for the size of the population being measured.</p>

            <p eId="para_1668">The Government have already made clear that renewable energy will be a critical and growing component of Irish energy supply to 2020 and beyond.  Renewable energy is an integral part of our climate change strategy and sustainability objectives.

            <p eId="para_1669">The recently published Government White Paper Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland outlines a range of measures to incentivise the development and deployment of renewable sources of energy.

            <p eId="para_1670">While the promotion of renewable energy is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, as I have stated previously the taxation system, in conjunction with other policy measures, can play a part in attaining environmental objectives including the development and deployment of renewable sources of energy.

            <p eId="para_1671">a five year excise relief scheme for biofuels, costing over €200 million, which commenced in November 2006. The scheme provides for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum;</p>

            <p eId="para_1674">extending to 31 December 2013 and enhancing the Business Expansion Scheme and the Seed Capital Scheme which can, among manufacturing other areas, be used for investment in companies engaged in renewable energy generation and recycling;</p>

However, it is intended that  the OPW will commence the decentralisation of an advance party  of up to forty staff to Claremorris  later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1743">The State encourages individuals to supplement the social welfare pension arrangements with private pension arrangements by offering tax relief on private pension provision. The tax relief arrangements for private pension provision are long-standing and have helped a significant proportion of the workforce to provide for supplementary pensions for their retirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1744">Tax relief is provided at an individual's marginal income tax rate on amounts contributed to pension schemes (subject to limits). The amount of profits and gains generated by the investments held by the pension schemes are tax exempt subject to certain ceilings. Pension benefits payable on retirement are taxable subject to an entitlement to take a tax-free lump-sum cash benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1745">Over half of all people in employment are covered by voluntary private pensions and, while this proportion has not changed hugely in recent years, the absolute numbers covered have increased, for example, from over 500,000 in 1995 to close to 1 million in 2004. In the 2006 Budget and Finance Act, I introduced some changes which were designed to encourage older people and those on lower incomes to commence or improve their voluntary pension arrangements. These changes involve:</p>
            <p eId="para_1746">A Pension Incentive Tax Credit to encourage SSIA holders on lower incomes to put some or all of the proceeds of their SSIA accounts on maturity into a pension product. For each €3 invested in a pension product, the Exchequer will contribute €1 (to a max. of €2,500) together with a proportion of the exit tax deducted from the SSIA on maturity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1747">An increase in the rate of age-based tax relief for pensions contributions to all pension products for contributors aged 55 years or over (i.e. from 30% to 35% of net relevant earnings/remuneration for those aged 55 or over but under 60; and from 30% to 40% of net relevant earnings/remuneration for those aged 60 or over).</p>
            <p eId="para_1748">At the same time, I introduced other changes the purpose of which was to limit the cost to the Exchequer of tax relief provided to higher income earners. These changes are:</p>
            <p eId="para_1749">A cap on the value of a pension fund allowable for tax purposes of €5 million (or, if higher, the value of the fund on 7 December 2005).</p>
            <p eId="para_1750">A cap on the maximum value of the tax-free lump sum of €1.25 million which is 25% of the new maximum pension fund amount of €5 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1751">In the same Budget I introduced, for the first time ever, a general restriction on the use by high earners of special tax reliefs of one type or another and I delivered what in real terms was described by the ESRI as a "highly progressive" Budget. Tax equity, both in relation to pensions and more generally, was therefore a major feature of that Budget.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_541">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1766">In Budget 2006 I announced the introduction of a limit, with effect from 1 January 2007, on the use of tax reliefs, including certain exemptions, by some high-income individuals.  Section 17 of Finance Act 2006 gave effect to this announcement. This measure was designed to address the issue of a small number of individuals with high incomes who, up to now, mainly by means of the cumulative use of various tax incentive reliefs, have been able to reduce their income tax liability to a very low level or to zero. Such individuals are no longer able to do so. This provision will ensure that such individuals who use tax incentive schemes will have an effective rate of income tax for each year of not less than about 20 per cent on the income sheltered by such schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1767">The method used to increase the tax rates at which these high income individuals pay tax effectively addresses the equity concerns raised over the past number of years while, at the same time, ensuring that the intended incentive effects of tax schemes will continue to be delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1768">Broadly, the reliefs restricted are those reliefs that have primarily been used by high income individuals to significantly reduce their tax liability. These are:</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">the various sectoral and area based property tax incentives,</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">certain exemptions including artistic income and patent royalties,</p>
            <p eId="para_1771">the reliefs for donations, and</p>
            <p eId="para_1772">certain investment incentive reliefs such as the Business Expansion Scheme, film relief and interest relief for investment in companies and partnerships.</p>
            <p eId="para_1773">The more usual items claimed by taxpayers such as medical expenses, trade union subscriptions, the personal tax credits and exemptions such as that for child benefit are not restricted. In addition, normal business expenses and deductions for capital allowances on plant and machinery, genuine business related trading losses and genuine losses from a rental business have not been restricted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1774">Finally, I would like to advise the Deputy, that I introduced a number of technical amendments to the restriction in Finance Bill 2007 which will help to ensure that the measure will work as intended. Included in these are provisions to enable the Revenue Commissioners to seek whatever information may be necessary from individuals affected by the restriction, so as to ensure that Revenue are in a position to monitor and assess the impact of the restriction in terms of numbers affected, the additional tax paid and the nature of the reliefs restricted.</p>

            <p eId="para_1776">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that for the tax year 2003 and earlier years claims for capital allowances for the construction of private hospitals were aggregated in tax returns with other claims and could not be distinguished from other reliefs claimed. Accordingly, the specific information on costs for 2003 and earlier years are not available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1777">Information on the scheme of tax relief for private hospitals was for the first time specified and separately included in personal income tax returns for the tax year 2004, the latest year available, and were filed in October, 2005. Based on the information that has been received and collated for the tax year 2004, a total of €4.5 million was included in 37 claims for capital allowances for the construction of private hospitals. This figure would correspond to a maximum Exchequer cost of the order of €1.9 million for these returns in terms of income tax foregone.</p>
            <p eId="para_1778">I should point out, however, that Revenue were concerned at preliminary indications that in some instances the new, separately categorised data on exempt income and property incentives may not have been correctly entered on the 2004 Income Tax returns. Revenue has engaged with the tax practitioner bodies in order to ensure that this situation is rectified for future years.  Corresponding data based on 2005 returns is in the process of being compiled and should be available shortly.  Data for the tax year 2006 is not yet available as the income tax returns for that year are not due for filing until October 2007.</p>

         the position of the Irish Government in responding to the call of the German Government for greater international regulation of hedge funds. 
        [10151/07]

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1780">Firstly, I might just explain to the Deputy that there is no specific definition of what a hedge fund is. Funds with the characteristics commonly associated with hedge funds generally invest in the same asset classes as other investment funds, namely, in equities, bonds, foreign exchange and so on. The main difference with hedge funds is that they are more flexible in terms of investment options than traditional collective investment schemes and they may use financial leverage, including derivatives, to magnify their investment returns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1781">In Ireland, hedge funds are authorised by the Financial Regulator. As they are a more risky investment than traditional funds, they are reserved for institutional investors and wealthy individuals. They cannot be sold to retail clients, although such clients might have some exposure through funds of hedge funds and through pension funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1782">As the Deputy may be aware, the German Presidency raised the issue as to how greater transparency might be achieved as regards hedge funds' activities and this issue has been discussed in various EU forums. As this is an international matter, the issue was also discussed at the G8. The general consensus is that there is no immediate need to design a set of transparency requirements for hedge funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1783">Many hedge funds are legally domiciled in offshore financial centres and, accordingly, the EU cannot subject them to mandatory disclosure requirements. However, many of the investment managers and prime brokers associated with hedge funds are based in EU countries and are subject to authorisation and supervision in those Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">Moreover, EU rules on the disclosure of significant stakes in companies are now in place. The Transparency Directive provides for the mandatory reporting of major holdings of voting rights, once 5% of voting rights are acquired. Some Member States apply even lower notification thresholds. Other regulatory safeguards also apply. EU rules on market abuse and insider trading (the Market Abuse Directive) apply fully to EU hedge fund managers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1785">As regards the risk to financial stability from hedge funds, from a systemic perspective this issue concerns the ability of lending institutions to withstand failure of their hedge fund creditors. Exposures to hedge funds by banks are monitored by EU banking regulators and the ECB. The recently introduced Capital Requirements Directive regulates the buffer of capital that banks and investment firms must hold against banking-book and trading-book exposures to all counterparties, including hedge funds.  The European Commission and the ECB are continuing to closely monitor the hedge fund sector. The general view is that there is no obvious regulatory gap that needs to be completed at EU level at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_1787">A special Interdepartmental Review Group reviewed the operation of the Disabled Drivers Scheme.  The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1788">The Group's Report, published on my Department's website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme.  It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries.  The Report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, referring respectively to the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1789">In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration.  For this reason, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme. This consideration is undertaken on a regular basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_1791">The scheme of capital allowances for the construction of private hospitals was reviewed by Indecon Economic Consultants as part of the overall review of property tax incentives in 2005. Indecon consulted widely in the course of their review, including consultations with the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive. Their report was published on 6 February 2006 and is available on the Department of Finance's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1792">The review recommended that this scheme should continue as there was a need for on-going investment in private hospitals.  The consultants observed that the construction of private hospitals could free beds in public hospitals used by private patients. It should also be noted that the consultants observed that the Government's plan for private hospitals in the grounds of public hospitals is designed to be a cost effective way of expanding supply and if properly managed will increase supply and competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1793">The summary of the main findings from Indecon's analysis is as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1794">‘There has been an overall increase in planning applications and approvals for private hospitals since 2000 but most have not proceeded to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1795">Most of the extra investment in the sector would either not have been undertaken, or would have taken longer to come on-line in the absence of the tax incentive scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1796">While it is too early to provide detailed estimates of the impact of the scheme on the supply and on the costs of hospital beds, Indecon believes the scheme has the potential to address supply shortages in the sector and to reduce costs.'</p>
            <p eId="para_1797">In all of the circumstances, I have no plans at this time to terminate the scheme of capital allowances for the construction of private hospitals.</p>

            <p eId="para_2054">As the Deputy will be aware, approximately 1,000 of the 7,200 Civil Service posts covered by the Decentralisation Programme or 10% of the overall programme is composed of professional and technical posts. While the take up from the professional and technical staff has been low to date, in the region of 130 professional and technical personnel have already been assigned to posts that are decentralising.</p>
            <p eId="para_2055">The Decentralisation Implementation Group, which was established in 2003 to drive the decentralisation process forward, has acknowledged in their latest report dated September 2006  that challenging issues remain in relation to the decentralisation of professional and technical grades including the filling of posts in under-subscribed locations, the placing of staff remaining in Dublin and promotions. While these issues also arise in relation to general service grades, addressing them in the context of professional and technical grades is complicated by the challenges associated with transferring between different organisations or streams.</p>
            <p eId="para_2056">The Group has asked my Department to explore all appropriate avenues, in consultation with the relevant union representatives, to overcome these difficulties and to come to a conclusion on these issues as soon as possible. In that regard, discussions have been ongoing with the staff representatives and proposals have been tabled in relation to options for staff remaining in Dublin and in relation to promotion arrangements for the professional and technical grades. In addition, staff have been assured of the voluntary nature of the programme.  Those wishing to remain in Dublin will be absorbed into posts in the civil service or, alternatively, in other public service bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2057">As the Deputy will be aware, in addition to the professional and technical grades, specialist posts within the State Agencies are due to decentralise under the Decentralisation Programme. The Decentralisation Implementation Group noted in its latest Report that while progress has been made by some State agencies, there has been a marked lack of action in some other agencies. The Group is currently meeting with CEOs from a number of State agencies to get an overview of progress to date and to identify the challenges remaining in implementing the Government policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2058">The main issues facing the State agencies are those relating to the filling of posts in under-subscribed locations, the placing of staff choosing to remain in Dublin and promotion arrangements.  These issues are further complicated by the absence of any tradition of or agreement on inter-changeability between Public Service organisations and between the Public Service and the Civil Service. The Group is of the view that resolution of the outstanding issues is central to the overall implementation process in the State Agencies.  The Group has asked my Department to pursue directly with ICTU proposals for getting central discussions under way on the full range of industrial relations issues relating to the decentralisation of State agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2059">An approach based on negotiations and agreement has enabled significant progress to be made in relation to the Civil Service moves and it is the intention to continue with this policy in relation to the professional and technical grades and the State Agency sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_2061">My function as the Minister for Finance is to provide an appropriate and robust legislative framework for regulation of the financial services sector with a particular focus on the consumer.  I am satisfied that, since the establishment of the Financial Regulator and the Financial Services Ombudsman, such a framework is in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2062">The provision of consumer credit in Ireland is regulated by the Consumer Credit Act, 1995.  The Consumer Credit Act, 1995, which is administered by the Financial Regulator, obliges credit providers to include specific information in all credit agreements in relation to such matters as the total cost of credit, the amount of each repayment instalment and the number of instalments.  Additionally, in the case of housing loans, the Act specifically obliges mortgage providers to inform borrowers of the effect on their repayment of a 1% increase in interest rates in the first year of their mortgages.  The purpose of obliging credit providers to provide this information is to ensure that consumers can make informed choices when making credit decisions in relation to any credit agreement they are entering into and in particular in relation to the effect that servicing a loan will have on the consumer's household budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_2063">In addition, the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code requires that before providing a product or service to a consumer, a regulated entity must gather and record sufficient information from the consumer to enable it to provide a recommendation or a product or service appropriate to that consumer.  Under the Code, when a credit institution is changing its interest rates, it must state the effective date of the new rate. It must also update the interest rate details on its information services as soon as the change comes into effect. Credit card limits cannot be increased unless requested by the consumer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2064">The Financial Regulator has prioritised the provision of information for consumers about the potential risk of excessive debt. Cost surveys have been undertaken by the Financial Regulator and are available to help consumers choose the loan product or credit card that best suits their needs. The Financial Regulator recommends in particular that consumers take on the right type of credit for the right purpose.  The Financial Regulator also issues information to help people who have problems with credit card debt. This information is available through its publications, help-line and website.</p>

            <p eId="para_2066">Under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission controls and is responsible for the investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund. The NPRF joined a group of the world's largest institutional investment funds in signing the UN-sponsored Principles for Responsible Investment when they were launched in April 2006. The aim of the Principles is to integrate consideration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into investment decision-making and ownership practices and, thereby, to improve long-term returns for investors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2067">The Principles reflect the fiduciary duty of investors to their stakeholders as their first responsibility and deliberately do not call for screening or avoiding stocks. Instead, they promote a policy of engagement with companies where shareholders regard themselves as long-term owners of companies and raise concerns directly with company management.</p>
            <p eId="para_2068">The NPRF is taking specific measures to implement the Principles.  Actions it is currently taking include the development and implementation of a comprehensive proxy voting policy and development of an engagement capacity with investee companies on ESG issues.  The NPRF has decided to contract third-party service providers to deliver these services within NPRF policy guidelines.  It expects that the proxy voting and engagement services will be put in place during the second quarter of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2071">I propose to take Questions Nos. 163 and 173 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2072">The issues surrounding savings and borrowings for people on low incomes are not uniform as they can vary from person to person and over the lifetime of the individual. Persons on low incomes can encounter obstacles in accessing financial services from mainstream financial services providers. The cost and availability of credit for people on low incomes and the barriers they face in accessing mainstream and affordable forms of credit can add to the challenges individuals on low incomes encounter in managing their finances. Building up savings, where possible, can mitigate these difficulties both by reducing the need to borrow and by establishing a relationship with a mainstream credit provider.</p>
            <p eId="para_2073">The credit union movement has been a key provider of savings and loans since its inception and has a particular role to play in supporting savings by persons on low incomes. There are currently 427 credit unions registered with the Financial Regulator with around 2.5 million members and assets of around EUR13 billion. Since 1995 credit unions have grown significantly with an increase in savings from EUR2 billion to around EUR13 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2074">The banking industry has proposed the development of a universal bank account which would provide basic access to the Irish payments system, enabling citizens to make and receive payments electronically and assisting those on lower incomes to build up savings. However, there are a number of issues to be considered in progressing such a proposal such as the fees to be associated, who would have right of access to such an account and also the actual need for such a product, particularly in the light of the reduction or elimination of bank charges on many standard accounts in recent years and the increased competition in the banking sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2075">The Financial Regulator commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency to conduct research on the nature and the extent of financial exclusion in Ireland and the barriers faced by people on low incomes in accessing a wide range of financial services.  The report, which I welcomed, and to which the Deputy refers, was entitled ‘Financial Exclusion in Ireland — An Exploratory Study and Policy Review' and was launched by the Financial Regulator on 11 December 2006.  The Financial Regulator and my Department, together with other interested parties, are currently considering how the report's findings and recommendations can be addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_2083">The Deputy may wish to note that my function as the Minister for Finance is to provide an appropriate and robust legislative framework for regulation of the financial services sector.  I am satisfied that, since the establishment of the Financial Regulator and the Financial Services Ombudsman, with a particular focus on the consumer, we have such a framework in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2084">I have no statutory function in setting the interest rates offered by credit institutions — they are based on commercial criteria in the light of market conditions.  Since 1992, the Irish banking market has been open to competition from credit institutions authorised in any EU/EEA Member State. Hence, new entrants to the market have helped stimulate increased competition in, for example, the mortgage market and the market for personal deposits.  In addition, the Financial Integration Monitor, published by the European Commission to assess major trends in the pan-European financial market, indicates that the cross border competition inherent in the single market has contributed to convergence in interest rates across the euro area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2085">The Financial Regulator has drawn attention to the need for consumers to choose the right type of financial product for their needs.  The Consumer Director in the Financial Regulator has statutory obligations in relation to monitoring and reporting on the extent to which competition exists in the Irish financial services market, as it affects customers.  The Consumer Director reports on this area in the Annual Report of the Financial Regulator and it is also reflected in the priorities of the Financial Regulator set out in its Strategic Plan.  Furthermore, the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code requires that financial service providers, in all their dealings with customers, act fairly and honestly in the best interests of customers and make full disclosure of all relevant material information, including all charges.  Also, when a credit institution is changing its interest rates, it must state the effective date of the new rate. It must also update the interest rate details on its information services as soon as the change comes into effect.  The Consumer Credit Act, 1995, obliges credit providers to include specific information on the cost of all credit agreements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2086">The September 2005 Competition Authority report on banking focused on two markets — personal current accounts and SME lending. It suggested measures aimed at promoting more active competition, but found no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour by banks. The Authority recommended steps to make switching of accounts easier, and this recommendation has now been implemented both in respect of personal and business accounts among domestic financial institutions.</p>

         asked the

         the Government’s view on the potential for taxation to play a role in promoting energy efficiency and emissions reductions.

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_560">

            <p eId="para_2090">As I have stated previously taxation, in conjunction with other policy measures, can play a part in attaining environment objectives which includes promoting energy efficiency and reducing emissions. Essentially this approach uses the tax system to provide incentives for certain behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_2091">Such incentives include capital allowances for corporate investment in renewable energy projects which have been available since 1998, and the significant Biofuels excise relief scheme which I provided for in Finance Act 2006. This latter Scheme will</p>
            <p eId="para_2092">provide for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum;</p>
            <p eId="para_2093">cost over €200m over 5 years;</p>
            <p eId="para_2094">result in CO2 savings of over 250,000 tonnes per annum;</p>
            <p eId="para_2095">contribute towards meeting a target of 5.75% transport fuel market   penetration by biofuels by 2009,</p>
            <p eId="para_2096">help reduce our dependency on conventional fossil fuels, and</p>
            <p eId="para_2097">stimulate activity in the agricultural sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2098">As a complementary measure, I provided in Finance Act 2006 for a new 50% VRT relief to promote new flexible fuel vehicles (cars designed to operate on biofuels) for an initial period of 2 years, and also extended the existing VRT relief for hybrid cars by a further year to end 2007. I am also providing in Finance Bill 2007 for the introduction of a VRT relief of 50% for electric cars — cars which can be propelled by a rechargeable battery — on a pilot one year basis with effect from 1 January, 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2099">In addition I announced in the Budget the commencement of a public consultation process on adjusting VRT to take account of CO2 emissions of vehicles. A similar exercise is under way in the area of motor tax. Any changes will have effect from a target date of 1 January 2008.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_2101">My function as the Minister for Finance is to provide an appropriate and robust legislative framework for regulation of the financial services sector with a particular focus on the consumer.  I am satisfied that, since the establishment of the Financial Regulator and the Financial Services Ombudsman, such a framework is in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2102">The Financial Regulator has prioritised the provision of information for consumers about the potential risk of excessive credit card debt. Credit card cost surveys have been undertaken by the Financial Regulator and are available to help consumers choose the credit card that best suits their needs. The Financial Regulator recommends in particular that consumers take on the right type of credit for the right purpose; credit cards are not suitable for long-term debt as the rates are considerably higher than other forms of credit. The Financial Regulator also issues information to help people who have problems with credit card debt. This information is available through its publications, help-line and website.</p>
            <p eId="para_2103">All credit card providers must comply with the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code. This requires financial services providers to ensure that any financial products provided are suitable for the needs of the consumer. When a credit institution is changing its interest rates, it must state the effective date of the new rate. It must also update the interest rate details on its information services as soon as the change comes into effect. Credit card limits cannot be increased unless requested by the consumer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2104">The Deputy may wish to note that credit card debt represents less than 2% of personal sector credit, and less than 1% of overall private sector credit (PSC). In addition, credit card data refers to debt outstanding on all credit cards at end-month and includes balances that may be paid in full at the payment due date. The increase in the number of credit cards issued and the amount of debt outstanding is in line with a general trend of increased market penetration in the EU and a move towards electronic retail payment methods. The Deputy may further wish to note that, unlike interest rate increases in variable-rate mortgage products, interest rates on credit cards tend to remain relatively stable over longer periods of time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2105">The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, is a national, free, confidential and independent service for people in debt or in danger of getting into debt.  Very substantial additional resources have been provided to MABS to support it in its work of reaching out to people in debt and helping them to regain control of their finances and budgets for the future.  From 2006 to 2007, the budget for MABS has increased by30%, from 13.57 million Euro to 17.67 million Euro.</p>

My Department, together with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which is the lead Department with immediate responsibility for the construction industry, examined this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_2108">As Chapter 1 of the Plan indicates, current tender price inflation, employment and tendering patterns suggest that the construction industry is operating well at its present level of activity and that it has the capability to grow without generating significant additional inflationary pressures. Recent trends in tender prices in civil engineering contracts indicate that:</p>
            <p eId="para_2109">Tender prices for civil engineering projects in the sector have remained competitive;</p>
            <p eId="para_2110">Despite increased activity and opportunity for construction firms, the number of tenderers for individual projects has remained healthy with no discernible fall-off; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2111">Foreign firms and partnerships between Irish and foreign firms competing for business is increasingly becoming a feature of large projects with  contracts awarded to such consortia in a number of cases including major road, water and waste water projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2112">The Government's view is that the construction industry has the capacity to produce the additional output under the NDP.  Our open labour market and greater participation from foreign construction firms support this view.  In addition, if the level of new housing output begins to ease, this will free up resources for other construction projects, including those under the NDP. Leading indicators of construction activity and developments in the industry generally will, of course, continue to be monitored over the period of the NDP.</p>

         his plans to introduce a subvention scheme for charities in respect of VAT payments along the lines of that operated in Denmark; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_2116">The position is that charities and non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT under the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply. This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_2117">The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group (ICTRG) appears to accept that charities can not be granted VAT refunds through the tax system. However, they are still seeking the introduction of a grant or subsidy in lieu of the VAT charities pay on their business inputs and estimate that this would cost €18 million per annum in respect of the bodies they represent. However, given that Exchequer funding is made available to very many charitable organisations this is in effect already happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_2118">The 140 bodies represented by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group already acknowledge that they receive some €9 million in funding either directly or indirectly from the Exchequer. However, there are approximately 7,000 charities registered with the Revenue Commissioners. It is therefore likely that the introduction of a scheme along the lines proposed by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group would cost the Exchequer significantly more than the €18 million estimate put forward by the group in respect of the bodies they represent.</p>
            <p eId="para_2119">I understand that the only EU Member State to introduce a scheme providing partial compensation for a limited number of charities for VAT incurred on input costs is Denmark. To be eligible under the Danish scheme charities must already be approved bodies under the Danish equivalent of our tax relief on donations scheme. My Department understands that some 750 charities in Denmark could benefit as a result. In comparison, over 1,900 organisations have to date been approved under the Irish donations relief scheme. It also understands that under the Danish scheme educational institutions are not eligible for compensation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2120">It is likely, therefore, the introduction of any grant system in lieu of VAT paid by registered charities in Ireland would undoubtedly lead to other exempt bodies such as schools, hospitals and sporting organisations, many of which are already registered as charities, seeking to benefit from such a system of refunds. These exempt bodies are already receiving considerable Exchequer funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_2121">The tax code already treats charities in a favourable manner. The tax code currently provides exemption for charities from Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Deposit Interest Retention Tax, Capital Acquisitions Tax, Stamp Duty, Probate Tax, Dividend Withholding Tax and the uniform scheme of tax relief for donations.  While no overall definitive figures are available on the cost to the Exchequer of charitable tax exemption status, Revenue estimated in 2005 that the cost of the various tax exemptions and tax reliefs, including the tax relief on donations scheme, in place for bodies conferred with charitable status could be as high as €190m annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_2122">In addition to tax exemptions and reliefs, charities, voluntary and community groups, sporting bodies benefit significantly from grants schemes administered by a number of Government Departments. Finally, even if funds were available for grant-aiding charities and other voluntary groups, I am not sure that the most appropriate use of the funds would be to relieve them of the VAT paid on inputs as opposed to grant-aiding their activities using other criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_2127">The Central Statistics Office employed a field force comprising 6 Census Liaison Officers, 40 Regional Supervisors, 400 Field Supervisors and 4,400 Enumerators to carry out the census field operation. During the four weeks before Census Day the enumerators entered details in respect of 1.8 million private residences and communal establishments in their enumerator record books. They simultaneously delivered blank census forms to 1.5 million of these dwellings that were expected to be occupied on Census Night — 23 April 2006. Of the remaining 300,000 residences, 270,000 were vacant at the time of the census while in the remaining 30,000 cases the household was either enumerated elsewhere or temporarily absent from the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2128">While the census field management reporting system provided ongoing information about forms being delivered and collected during the course of the census field work these were not collated on a county basis because the census field operation was not organised on strict county lines.  During the course of the nine week field campaign it is estimated that about 3,500 households with about 6,000 residents may have evaded contact. Operating under strict guidelines, the enumerators were instructed to impute basic demographic information such as age, sex and nationality for the occupants of these households.</p>
            <p eId="para_2129">The Principal Demographic Results to be published on 29 March will contain a table analysing permanent housing units on a county basis according to whether they were occupied or vacant on census night.</p>

            <p eId="para_2133">Labour market estimates are derived from data collected through the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) which forms part of the EU wide (Community) Labour Force Survey. The primary classification used for the labour market status of an individual is the internationally agreed International Labour Office (ILO) labour force classification. The ILO classification distinguishes the following main subgroups:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2134">In Employment: Persons who worked in the week before the survey for one hour or more for payment or profit, including work on the family farm or business and all persons who had a job but were not at work because of illness, holidays etc. in the week.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2135">Unemployed: Persons who, in the week before the survey, were without work and available for work within the next two weeks, and had taken specific steps, in the preceding four weeks, to find work. The specific definition to be applied by all EU member states for the measurement of the unemployed is detailed in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1897/2000.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2136">Inactive Population (not in labour force): All other persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_2137">An individual's status from an unemployment perspective is not determined by their activity within the schemes or courses provided by the various Government Departments or other public bodies but rather by their situation vis-à-vis the three criteria outlined in the definition of the unemployed outlined above.  For example persons signing on for credits will only be considered as unemployed on an ILO basis if they satisfy the three criteria outlined above.</p>
            <p eId="para_2138">The Live Register which includes all claimants for jobseekers benefit (excluding systematic short-time workers), jobseekers assistance (excluding smallholders/farm assists and other self-employed persons) and other registrants including applicants for credited Social Welfare contributions but excluding those directly involved in an industrial dispute, treats the three groups outlined in the question as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_2139">Those who are signing on for credits would be included in the Live Register figures;</p>
            <p eId="para_2140">Those on FÁS courses who retain their jobseekers payment are not included in the Live Register figures;</p>
            <p eId="para_2141">Those who no longer sign on having exhausted all of their benefits (rather than credits) and who are not eligible for jobseekers allowance would sign-on for credits and be included in the Live Register figures.</p>

            <p eId="para_2885">Every effort is being made by the centre to ensure that illegally dumped material is cleared from its lands.  The centre has been in contact with the local authority seeking assistance and has informed it regarding the steps the centre has undertaken in this regard.  The centre has been monitoring the area and has on more than one occasion cleaned up material which was deposited on its lands by persons unknown.  The Director and management  of the centre has indicated to the Irish Youth Justice Service that they will continue to monitor the situation and would welcome the opportunity to discuss the matter with the residents committee.</p>

            <p eId="para_2887">Public sector employers provide 3 days paid paternity leave for civil servants, teachers, health service workers, Gardaí, prison officers and the Defence Forces, while some private sector employers and semi-state bodies provide a short period of paid paternity leave. There is currently no statutory entitlement to paternity leave.</p>
            <p eId="para_2888">The question of paid paternity leave was considered by the Working Group on the Review of the Parental Leave Act 1998, which reported in April 2002. The Working Group which comprised the social partners, relevant Government Departments and the Equality Authority, could not reach consensus on this issue. The employers' organisations could not agree to the introduction of a statutory entitlement to paternity leave paid for by employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2889">I have no objection, in principle, to the introduction of a statutory entitlement to a short period of paid paternity leave. However, before doing so I think it desirable to secure consensus among the social partners on the issue. In this connection, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the commitment in the Partnership Agreement "Towards 2016" that the level of provision of maternity/paternity leave would be reviewed again before end 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2890">I am not in a position at this stage to estimate the annual cost to the Exchequer of introducing a week's paid paternity leave since the cost would depend on the model involved, for example, whether it would be PRSI based, the take-up and whether it would be at full pay or whether there would be a contribution.</p>

            <p eId="para_2892">The position is that section 2 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978, which prevents the creation of new leases reserving ground rents on dwellings, does not apply to separate and self-contained dwelling units in developments containing two or more such units.  As regards the legal framework applicable to such developments, the position is that the Law Reform Commission published a Consultation Paper on Multi-Unit Developments in December last. A consultation process is currently under way in relation to the draft recommendations set out in the Paper and the Commission intends to publish a Report containing its definitive recommendations later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2896">In Ireland, the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956-86 cover gaming and lotteries other than the National Lottery, which is covered by the National Lottery Act 1986, with the Betting Act, 1931 governing all matters relating to betting.  In general, all forms of gaming are illegal in this jurisdiction except where specifically permitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_2897">Sections 21, 26 and 34 of the 1956 Gaming and Lotteries Act disallow the promotion and purchase in this country of tickets for a foreign lottery.  This restriction applies to all lotteries in any country outside of the Irish State.  With regard to the supervision and monitoring of the operation of foreign lotteries, I have been informed by An Garda Síochána, that when information is received by them concerning the running of illegal lotteries in this jurisdiction enquiries are conducted by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation (GBFI) and any evidence found in support of such allegations is passed through the appropriate channels to the relevant authorities where the lottery purports to originate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2898">In respect of the details supplied by Deputy Carey, information about that lottery has been passed to the Spanish authorities.  When the Garda Síochána receive information, usually from an injured party, concerning information relating to a bogus lottery win they are advised by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation not to provide any personal details, including bank account numbers etc.  Unfortunately persons contacted by such fraudsters usually only make contact with An Garda Síochána after money has been sent abroad.  However in such cases the Bureau requests that all records relating to the transaction be forwarded to the GBFI.  This information is then passed to Interpol for the attention of the country from which the bogus lottery has emanated.  Efforts are also made to trace the money sent abroad, however I am informed by the Garda authorities that the details supplied are frequently false.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_2905">I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 to 194, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2906">Protection of children from the inappropriate use of multimedia activities is a very broad and encompassing term, but I take it that the Deputy is referring particularly to the internet, video games and mobile phones.  I have no function in the regulation of broadcast media or phones but I can inform him as to the child protection arrangements in place in respect of a number of other media formats.  As the Deputy will be aware by its very nature, the internet lends itself to being used for a wide range of criminal activities. This can include illegal pornography, racist or hate materials, financial fraud, intimidation or any other criminal activity carried out via the internet. Combatting such illegal, harmful and predatory use of the internet requires a response at national, EU and wider international levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_2907">The internet is an international and world-wide phenomenon with no borders and no single organisation controlling it.  Measures to combat illegal materials and activities on the internet are, therefore, hampered by a multiplicity of jurisdictions, differing legal systems, and differing societal norms.  Furthermore, new developments in communications technologies allowing for internet access by new means are a regular occurrence.  These are largely positive developments but also bring particular challenges for those charged with protecting against the downsides of the internet. A combination of responses, and the co-operation of all the stakeholders, at both national and international level — legislators, law enforcement, schools, child protection practitioners, parents and guardians — are essential.</p>
            <p eId="para_2908">In terms of legislation, in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998, Ireland has one of the most robust pieces of legislation anywhere. Under the Act, the possession, distribution, importation and exportation or sale of all forms of child pornography — films, video or material in written or auditory form including material produced or transmitted via the internet — are offences with penalties of up to 14 years' imprisonment. Mere possession of child pornography can be punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.  Using a child or allowing a child to be used for the production of child pornography is also punishable by up to 14 years' imprisonment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2909">The EU Council adopted a Framework Decision on Combating the Sexual Exploitation of Children and Child Pornography on 22 December 2003.  While the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 is a particularly robust legislative measure, this Framework Decision requires some relatively minor amendments to our legislation and these are contained in the Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill which is at present being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  Among the provisions of the Bill is one that prohibits the sale of children, including through a computer system, for the purpose of the sexual or labour exploitation of a child.</p>
            <p eId="para_2910">In addition, a new offence of meeting a child following sexual grooming, on the internet or otherwise, was included in the recently enacted Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Act 2007.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that they monitor child pornography on the internet and where evidence is available action is taken in accordance with legislation.  Other incidents of child pornography coming to the attention of An Garda Síochána are fully investigated and where there is evidence to support a prosecution criminal proceedings are commenced, as directed by the Law Officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2911">I am also informed by the Garda Authorities that staff from the Computer Crime Investigation Unit (CCIU) in the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation participate in numerous fora where crime prevention advice is given to companies and members of the public on the safe use of the internet.  The Unit provides support to the many operations by other national and local units in targeting paedophiles and others suspected of downloading child pornography in Ireland.  Members of An Garda Síochána attached to the National Bureau of Investigation augment these units as the volume of work requires. Computer forensics are carried out by the members attached to the Domestic and Sexual Assault Unit and also by members attached to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation utilising up-to-date forensic software.  I understand that An Garda Síochána, in conjunction with its EU colleagues, is currently examining new methods of preventing the production and distribution of child pornography on the internet.</p>
            <p eId="para_2912">On the structural side, the Government established a working Group in 1997 to examine and report on the whole question of the illegal and harmful use of the internet with particular reference to child pornography.  The Report of the Working Group on the Illegal and Harmful Use of the Internet was published in July 1998. The main recommendation of the Report was for a system of self-regulation by the Internet Service Provider industry and the components of such a system were to include: an Internet Advisory Board (IAB) — established Feb 2000 — to promote awareness of Internet downside issues, co-ordinate efforts to combat child pornography on the Internet and monitor the progress of self regulation by the Internet Service Provider industry; a Public Hotline for reporting child pornography (established 1999 and funded by the industry); an industry Code of Practice and Ethics setting out the duties and responsibilities of each Internet Service Provider (agreed February 2002 and reviewed in 2004)</p>
            <p eId="para_2913">The Internet Advisory Board (IAB) as well as overseeing a self-regulatory regime for the Irish Internet Service Providers, encourages best practice procedures, provides advice and facilitates research in Internet-related issues including child safety.  My Department provides secretarial and other supports for the Board's work.  The IAB in its role of encouraging best practice, procedures and formulating advice on Internet downside issues is currently evaluating electronic technology which can be used to block access to websites on the internet and is preparing a report on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2914">The Hotline (www.hotline.ie), is funded by the Internet Service Providers' Association of Ireland with support from the EU Safer Internet Action Plan.  It accepts and investigates reports from the public in relation to child pornography and other illegal material on the internet and attempts to identify the source.  If the material is hosted in Ireland, it will request the relevant Internet Service Provider (ISP) to remove it, in accordance with their Code of Practise and Ethics.  Special protocols operate between the Gardaí and the Hotline that maximise co-operation on law enforcement issues so that offences in the area of child pornography can be detected and prosecuted.  The Hotline works closely with, and is a founding member of, the international INHOPE Association (www.inhope.org), a network of European hotlines which is expanding to all parts of the world. The INHOPE Association develops procedures and shares information on the best practices for the tracing and tracking of illegal child pornography.  International co-operation is a vital part of the fight against pornography on the internet, and Ireland is fully committed to playing its part. The Deputy may be aware that the European Union has taken a strong line on combating child pornography and other illegal and harmful uses of the internet.  Since 1999, under the Safer Internet Action Plan, the EU has provided financial and other supports for measures in the member states to combat illegal and harmful uses of the internet, with particular emphasis on protecting children.  A new EU action plan — Safer Internet Plus — covering the period 2005 to 2008, and with a budget of €45m, was agreed under the Irish presidency in June 2004 and is now in operation.  My Department is represented on the management committee for the programme.  In September 2001, the Council of Europe approved the first international Convention on Cybercrime. Ireland signed up to the Convention in June 2002.  The main objective of the Convention is to foster international co-operation in protecting society against cybercrime. The Convention deals specifically with the distribution of child pornography on the internet, infringements of copyright, computer related fraud and violations of network security.  On 15 September 2006, I announced that Government approval had been obtained for the drafting of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  This Bill is being used to give effect to a number of international instruments including the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_2915">With regard to video games, the position is that Ireland is a member of the Pan European Games Information (PEGI) system.  Video games are classified by age appropriateness at the following levels; 3+: 7+ 12+; 15+ and 18+.  The categorisation is then indicated on product packaging.  Under these arrangements, video games are categorised according to a robust and consistent system and subject to independent non-industry verification.</p>
            <p eId="para_2916">A key component of video game arrangements is that the classification systems are designed to provide useful information as to the content of the product.  In particular, the intention is to assist parents in making informed choices concerning the media they acquire for their children or which they permit their children to use.</p>
            <p eId="para_2917">In so far as films and videos/DVDs are concerned, the position is that these must be classified by the Irish Film Censor for sale, exhibition or rental.  The age appropriateness of each work is then displayed in cinema and all video/DVD works must carry the age classification on the packaging and video/DVD.  My Department is fully committed to co-operating with and promoting measures both nationally, at EU level and in the wider international fora with regard to child protection.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         if his attention has been drawn to the problems in the Ranelagh area being caused by a group of young adults, who smash bottles, leave rubbish on the ground and make it difficult for people to sleep at night; the steps he has taken to ensure this behaviour ceases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2919">I am informed by the Garda authorities that the area referred to is regularly patrolled by uniform and plain clothes Gardaí from the Donnybrook and Terenure Garda Districts with a view to ensuring a concentrated and visible Garda presence in the area.  These patrols are backed up by  District Detective and Drug Units, Community Policing personnel, the District Mountain Bike Units as well as the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel. During weekends there are also dedicated public order patrols specifically targeting public disorder and anti-social behaviour in the Garda Districts referred to and, where appropriate, powers under the Litter Pollution Act are also enforced.</p>
            <p eId="para_2920">I am further informed by the Garda authorities that current policing plans in the area are predicated on  the prevention of anti-social and public order offences; the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents. This strategy will continue to be central to the delivery of a policing service to the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_2922">I have honoured my commitment to abolish the use of old style padded cells with the introduction of newly designed and improved cells.  Information relating to the instances of placement of prisoners in close supervision and special observation cells are set out in the following table.  These figures are composite in nature and include placement in both types of cells.  On occasion, it is a matter of practical necessity to put some prisoners in a place of safety within the prison system when they prove difficult to manage in the general prison population or where authorised by a Prison Doctor for medical observation or for the prisoner's own protection if he/she has suicidal tendencies.</p>

            <p eId="para_2965">An Garda Síochána invokes a number of broad strategic responses in combating the drugs trade. These include the following: identifying, targeting and dismantling national and international drug trafficking networks which supply and distribute illegal drugs within this state; conducting intelligence driven operations focusing on all aspects of the illicit drugs trade including commodity, logistics, distribution and financing, working with other national and international law enforcement agencies on joint actions designed to reduce the availability of drugs and the proceeds derived from the drugs trade; working in partnership with statutory, community and voluntary groups to reduce both the supply and demand for drugs within society.</p>
            <p eId="para_2966">Tackling organised crime and drug trafficking is primarily achieved through the use of specialist units and targeted intelligence led operations. National Units, such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation all have specific roles in reducing drug supply and the material benefits which accrue from drug trafficking. All of these units operate under the direction of an Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services.  The Organised Crime Unit, established in November 2005, in conjunction with the Garda National Drugs Unit and local Gardaí, continue to implement initiatives such as Operations Anvil and Oak which target criminals involved in the trafficking of drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2967">These operations,  which are ongoing, continue to dismantle drug trafficking networks and have led to the arrest in recent times of major criminals both based here and abroad who are involved in the drugs trade and significant drug seizures continue to be made as a result of this work.</p>
            <p eId="para_2968">The record level of resources, both in financial and personnel terms, being made available to An Garda Síochána this year is proof of the Government's commitment and determination to ensure that the Garda authorities will continue to implement targeted, intelligence and high intensity operations against organised crime with a special focus on drugs crime. This commitment is further evidenced by the fact that the allocation for the Garda Vote for 2007 is up by €135.3m to €1.445 billion — an increase of 10% on this year's allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2969">Furthermore we are ensuring that our law enforcement agencies have a strong legislative platform from which to operate in their work tackling those involved in such criminal activity.  I am informed by An Garda Síochána that the personnel strength (all ranks) of the District Drugs Units within the Dublin Metropolitan Region as on the 8th March 2007 is as set out hereunder.</p>

            <p eId="para_3037">The Sex Offenders Act which commenced on 27 September 2001 sets out the obligations on persons convicted of a range of sexual offences against both children and adults.  A convicted sex offender must notify his/her name(s), date of birth and current home address to An Garda Síochána within seven days of the conviction for the sexual offence concerned or, where the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, from the date of full release from prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_3038">Thereafter, the offender must notify the Gardaí of any change of name or address within seven days of that change.  Notification of any address where the offender spends either as much as seven days or two or more periods amounting to seven days in any twelve month period must also be given to the Gardaí.</p>
            <p eId="para_3039">If the offender intends to leave the State for a period of seven days or more s/he must inform the Gardaí of this fact and the address at which s/he intends to stay and also notify the Gardaí of his/her return. If s/he did not intend to stay away for more than seven days but did, s/he must inform the Gardaí within a further seven days.  The provisions of the Act extend to any sex offenders entering this jurisdiction from abroad who have an obligation to register in their own countries or who have been convicted abroad of an offence comparable to one covered by the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_3040">Part 4 of the Sex Offenders Act 2001 provides that it is an offence for convicted sex offenders to apply for, or to accept, work or to offer services, a necessary and regular part of which consists mainly of unsupervised access to, or contact with, children or mentally impaired persons, without informing the employer or organisation of his/her conviction for a qualifying sexual offence.  It is an offence to fail to comply with the notification requirements. The penalty is imprisonment for up to 12 months or a fine of €1,900 or both.  The courts can also sentence an offender who has been found guilty of an offence under the schedule of offences in the Act to a period of statutory supervision under the Probation Service on their release from prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_3041">Before an offender is released from prison, the Prison Service must inform him/her that he  or she is subject to the notification requirement of the Act. Ten days before the date of release, the Prison Service must inform An Garda Síochána that s/he is being released.  An Garda Síochána has in place a system for the monitoring of persons subject to these requirements.  The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Unit monitor and manage the notification provisions.  The information on persons who are subject to the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001 is maintained on the PULSE computer system.</p>

It is my intention that the Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill, which is currently being drafted, will contain provisions to strengthen the monitoring of registered sex offenders. Among these are raising the penalty for failure to register from 12 months to five years imprisonment, thus making it an arrestable offence, and giving probation officers power to prosecute offenders who fail to comply with the terms of a post release supervision order. Other provisions in the Bill will relate to risk assessment of sex offenders.</p>

            <p eId="para_3076">I am  advised that on the 16th March, 2007, there were 166 persons on temporary release, a figure that represents about 4.5% of the total prison population.  This small number on temporary release is due in large measure to the expansion in our prison accommodation over the last number of years and stands in stark contrast to the unacceptable level of temporary release back  in 1996, when on 9 December 1996 we had 552 persons on temporary release, about 20% of the prison population.</p>
            <p eId="para_3077">The overriding issue in considering any application for temporary release of a prisoner is the safety of the public. In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to his or her Garda Station.  Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Gardaí.</p>
            <p eId="para_3078">Temporary release arrangements operate similarly to a system of parole, which is a feature of prison systems worldwide.  They are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way. The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community would be reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence.  Each case is examined on its own merits and as already stated the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made on temporary release applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_3079">Prisoners are considered for temporary release in various circumstances, for example, release under the direct supervision of the Probation Service; to employment or training programmes; on compassionate release because of ill health or family related circumstances; or for reintegration purposes because they are nearing the end of their sentence.</p>

            <p eId="para_3084">Section 6 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 created an offence of soliciting or importuning a person for the commission of an act which would constitute an offence under section 3, 4 or 5 of that Act or section 1 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935.  The maximum penalty on summary conviction was €1270 and/or 12 months imprisonment.  Section 7 of the 1993 Act recreated in modern format the offence of soliciting or importuning a person for the purpose of prostitution.  The maximum penalty on summary conviction, for a third or subsequent offence, was €635 and/or 4 weeks imprisonment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3085">The preparation of the child protection provisions of the Children Act 2001 provided an opportunity to increase the maximum penalty for soliciting or importuning a child or mentally impaired person for the purpose of prostitution.  Prior to that, the law did not differentiate between soliciting or importuning a child or adult for the purpose of prostitution.  The drafting method used was to substitute a new section 6 into the 1993 Act which, in effect, provided within that section a means of prosecuting the soliciting or importuning of a child or mentally impaired person for the purpose of prostitution with a maximum penalty of €1905 and/or 12 months imprisonment.  This contrasted to the considerably lower penalty provided under section 7 of the 1993 Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_3086">I am informed by the Garda Síochána that there is no confusion as to the nature or purpose of section 250 of the Children Act. There have been no convictions under section 6 of the 1993 Act in the years 2001 to 2005 inclusive while there were 34 convictions in 2000.  However in the 5 years prior to 2000, the year 1998 was the only year in which there were a significant number of convictions under section 6 with 86 convictions that year.  There were no convictions in 1996 and 1997, one conviction in 1995 and 3 convictions in 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_3087">The changes made in the Children Act to the criminal laws governing prostitution were not designed as a permanent solution to the offence of child prostitution. Instead, they were meant as a temporary initiative until an opportunity arose for a more in depth examination of the law in this respect.  The Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill which is at present being drafted provides a new offence of soliciting or importuning a child, or paying, offering or promising to pay, a child or another person for the purpose of sexually exploiting the child.  Sexual exploitation in this context is defined widely to include the prostitution of the child, production of child pornography or any sexual activity which would be an offence under any enactment.</p>

A letter dated 14 August 2006 was issued to the Garda Síochána on his behalf stating that there was reason to believe that a person or persons who had received a draft of the report pursuant to section 34 of the Commissions of Investigation Act, 2004 had disclosed material contrary to section 37 of that Act.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_3096">Last August, the Secretary General of my Department contacted me while I was on a family holiday and said that it appeared probable that a draft report of the Birmingham Commission of Investigation had been disclosed by a statutory recipient. He told me that he intended to report the alleged disclosure by the statutory recipient to the Garda Síochána.  It was clear to me that it was to be a complaint about a suspected breach of the criminal law by a statutory recipient and not a complaint about the publication of the material or the work of a journalist who was not a statutory recipient.</p>
            <p eId="para_3097">I was aware that under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 such recipients, being  persons named in the draft report, could seek amendments or apply to court to ensure that their constitutional rights were not infringed.  I was further aware that they were not empowered to seek to publicise the draft for their own purposes — whether nefarious or otherwise.  This applies whether the disclosure covers material relating to themselves or material relating to others who might be impugned and who might be in the process of making their own representations.  It was also the case under the legislation that I, as specified Minister, was obliged to publish the final report as soon as possible after I received it and that arrangements were in train within my Department to do so at the end of the month. It should be borne in mind that unauthorised disclosure of a draft report by a statutory recipient constitutes a criminal offence even if such disclosure takes place after the final report has been published.  In other words  it is a permanent rather than a temporary prohibition.</p>
            <p eId="para_3098">The Bermingham Report on the Dean Lyons case was the first report prepared under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 which was intended to provide a speedier and more cost effective inquiry mechanism than Tribunals of Inquiry.  The Secretary General was greatly concerned that there was a real danger that if the provisions of the Act were to be flouted without sanction, the new mechanism could be fatally undermined on its first outing.</p>
            <p eId="para_3099">Mr. George Bermingham, who was out of the country at the time, was contacted and confirmed that he had not given any written consent to disclosure of the draft report.  The Commission staff had also informed the statutory recipients that it was a criminal offence to make a draft report public.  However, under section 43 of the Act of 2004, the Commission had been legally dissolved on the submission of its final Report to the Minister on 28 July 2006 and therefore the Commission itself could not pursue the matter. Nonetheless Mr. Bermingham who had been the sole member of the Commission indicated to the Department that he favoured a criminal investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3100">In these circumstances, the Secretary General of my Department decided to make a formal complaint seeking an investigation by the Garda Síochána into the matter and the purpose of his call was to advise me of his intention to do this.  He made it clear to me that his decision was not being submitted to me for any form of approval or consent.  He further advised that it would be both unnecessary and inappropriate for me to be involved in any way in this decision.  The Secretary General contacted a Deputy Commissioner of An Garda Síochána to make the complaint verbally.  This was followed up by a formal letter issued on 14 August 2006 setting out the situation insofar as it was known to the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_3110">I presume that the Deputy's question refers to administrative civil servants working in my Department and its Agencies.  I have set out, in the table under, this information insofar as it relates to my Department and those Agencies whose staff are staff of the Department.  It does not include Bodies which recruit their own staff (Courts Service, Legal Aid Board, Property Registration Authority, Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Síochána) and I have requested the information from those Bodies and will provide it to the Deputy when it comes to hand.</p>
            <p eId="para_3111">Before dealing with my Department's figures, it is worth noting that recruitment of staff to the Civil Service is conducted in the main by the Public Appointments Service, and that staff are recruited in accordance with the equality legislation and assigned to Departments as vacancies occur.  Having said that, my Department is acutely aware of the need for greater gender balance and significant progress has been made in recent years.  At the key middle management grade of Assistant Principal, there are now almost equal numbers of men and women, significantly exceeding the civil service target for women of 33%.  Assistant Principal is a key gateway grade to higher levels in the Civil Service and I am confident that this breakthrough will lead to greater numbers of women progressing to the more senior positions in the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3112">It is also worth noting that a significant number of the Heads of Agency within my Department's remit are women, viz. the Chief Inspector of the Garda Inspectorate, the National Director of the Irish Youth Justice Service, the Chief Executive of the Private Security Authority, the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Director of the Equality Tribunal, the Director of the National Disability Authority, the Chief Executive of the Property Registration Authority, the State Pathologist, and the Director of the Forensic Science Laboratory.</p>
            <p eId="para_3113">I will shortly be publishing the National Women's Strategy which will, <i>inter alia</i>, be addressing the issue of Women in Decision Making.  It is my view that notwithstanding the significant progress that has been made in recent years, there is more that all of us can do to ensure that women take their rightful place in key positions across the public and private sectors.</p>

The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency.  This particular long term permission does not exempt the person from employment permit requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_3161">Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.  While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.  An application for long term residence from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in August 2006.  I understand that applications received in June 2006 are currently being dealt with.  As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.</p>

            <p eId="para_3172">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 13,178 following the attestation of 273 new members on Wednesday 14 March, 2007.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) on 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,476 (or over 23%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training on 14 March, 2007 was 14,258.  Furthermore, I should say that on 19 December, 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000.  The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_3173">I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of the Donegal Division by station on 31 December, 1997, 2002, 2006 and 15 March, 2007 was as set out in the table.</p>

            <p eId="para_3410">The Deputy should appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day, personnel strengths of individual stations and units may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.  Resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), other specialised units and the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB), all of which have had increased resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_3411">I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs.  Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         the strength of the Garda force and community gardaí employed in Crumlin, Kevin Street and Terenure Garda stations; the increase in Garda numbers in these stations between 1997, 2002 and 31 December 2006 and in which Garda stations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3432">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 13,178 following the attestation of 273 new members on Wednesday 14 March, 2007.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) on 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,476 (or over 23%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training on 14 March, 2007 was 14,258.  Furthermore, I should say that on 19 December, 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000.  The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met.  The Garda Budget now stands at €1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</p>

            <p eId="para_3464">All Gardaí have responsibility, <i>inter alia</i>, to deal with Community Policing issues as they arise.  The Deputy should appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day, personnel strengths of individual stations and units may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3465">Resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), other specialised units and the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB), all of which have had increased resources.  I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>

            <p eId="para_3557">The Deputy should appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day, personnel strengths of individual stations and units may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.  Resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), other specialised units and the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB), all of which have had increased resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_3558">I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs.  Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_3560">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 13,178 following the attestation of 273 new members on Wednesday 14 March, 2007.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) on 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,476 (or over 23%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training on 14 March, 2007 was 14,258.  Furthermore, I should say that on 19 December, 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000.  The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_3561">I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of Malahide, Swords, Balbriggan, Skerries, Lusk, Rush and Garristown Garda Stations on 31 December, 1997, 2002, 2006 and 15 March, 2007 was as set out in the table.</p>

I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_3621">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 13,178 following the attestation of 273 new members on Wednesday 14 March, 2007. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,476 (or over 23%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training as at 14 March, 2007 was 14,258. Furthermore, I should say that on 19 December, 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_3622">I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that the Traffic Corps in the DMR West Division, dedicated to the enforcement of road traffic and transport legislation, is made up of one Inspector, three Sergeants and eighteen Gardaí.  Members of the Regional Traffic Corps also conduct regular patrols and checkpoints in this Division.</p>
            <p eId="para_3623">I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that at present there are ten (10) hand-held speed detection devices allocated to the Division for use by members to detect speeding offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_3624">Garda Management also state that one static camera for the detection of speeding offences is located in the DMR West on the N4 at Lucan. GATSO vans are regularly allocated at various locations within this Division to detect speeding offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_3625">Following the enactment of the Road Traffic Act, 2006, the procurement procedure for the provision and operation of safety cameras by a service provider was initiated.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is intended that the service provider will be required to provide all resources including personnel to collect and process all data on speeding obtained by the mobile and fixed safety cameras used.  The service provider will also be required to process data collected by the safety cameras currently operated by An Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_3626">In parallel with this process, work is ongoing with the Garda Síochána and the National Roads Authority on identifying locations that either have a speed related collision history or are of a type where a higher than expected frequency of collisions may be expected to occur.  Monitoring of driver speeds by the outsourced service provider will focus on these locations.</p>

            <p eId="para_3671">As I informed the House on 31 January the Government approved the drafting of the Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill 2006 last July. It is at present being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</p>
            <p eId="para_3672">The Bill is criminal law legislation which will implement the criminal law aspects of EU, UN and Council of Europe instruments on trafficking by creating offences of recruiting, transporting, transferring to another person, harbouring or knowingly arranging or facilitating:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3673">(a) the entry into, travel within or departure from, the State of a person, or</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3674">(b) the provision of accommodation or employment in the State for that person, for the purpose of that person's exploitation. The term "exploitation" in the Bill is defined as meaning sexual or labour exploitation or the removal of a person's organs for the purpose of transplanting into another person.  A copy of the draft Bill as approved by Government is available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_3675">The UN Protocol to prevent and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, was signed by Ireland in December 2000 and I recently announced my intention to ask the Government to sign the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings.  I also stated that it is intended, as part of the new immigration policy framework to provide a clear policy statement setting out how these cases will be managed once it is established that trafficking has taken place.  I would reiterate, however, that the lack of a specific legislative provision on the victims of trafficking has in no way reduced Ireland's commitment to dealing with cases sympathetically as they arise.</p>

At present this process does not involve a two-way mirror.</p>
            <p eId="para_3682">The current procedure used by An Garda Síochána was introduced following advice from the Law Officers.  In order to ensure that  there is no doubt as to the person the victim or witness has identified, it is necessary that a clear identification is made.  This may be done in a number of ways, including pointing to or stating the position of a person on the line-up or stating a number assigned to them.  Prior to this the procedure necessitated the witness or victim placing their hand on the shoulder of the person as part of the identification process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3683">The conduct of identification parades generally is an issue I am reviewing at present with a view to seeing what improvements, if any, might be made, including the possibility of making the procedure less traumatic for victims or witnesses.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_3687">I wish to state at the outset that at no time was a commitment made by me to pay the costs of independent forensic tests in this case.  My understanding is that agreement was reached under the auspices of the Coroner between the Garda Síochána, the Forensic Science Laboratory and solicitors for the Wheelock family to allow experts appointed by the Wheelock family to attend the Laboratory and carry out an examination of certain exhibits.  A Coroner's Inquest is an independent inquisitorial process and it would have been wholly improper for me to attempt to play any role in this agreement. Consequently the agreement did not represent an implicit undertaking on the part of State to pay for the independent analysis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3688">However, I did offer the family an ex gratia payment for their representation as a unit at the Inquest.  That offer of legal assistance was to cover costs relating to the provision of oral and written legal advice, along with representation by a solicitor or barrister at the Inquest. The offer was expressed to be subject to the then maximum Government approved rates for representation at Tribunals of Inquiry — i.e. €800 per day for a solicitor, €744 per day for a junior counsel or €1116 per day for a senior counsel.</p>
            <p eId="para_3689">When the issue of payment for independent forensic analysis was raised with me by the family solicitors I gave the matter due consideration. Unlike a criminal trial an Inquest is not an adversarial process. The person who decides who gives evidence is the Coroner. I ascertained from the Coroner that he had not directed that an independent forensic analysis be commissioned and that  evidence of a third party expert would not be admissible at the Inquest.</p>
            <p eId="para_3690">Given the nature of the process and the fact that there is already independent evidence available to the Coroner, I was not prepared to meet the costs relating to the engagement of independent experts to facilitate forensic examination where the only purpose would be to act as private advisors to Counsel as distinct from giving evidence.  This decision was conveyed to the family's solicitor on the 1 August 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_3731">As the Deputy is aware I launched the Community Based CCTV Scheme in June 2005 in response to the demonstrated demand from local communities across Ireland for the provision of CCTV systems.  This Scheme is designed to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems.  This Scheme offers two types of funding:</p>
            <p eId="para_3732">Stage 1 offers a pre-development grant of up to €5,000 to enable qualifying applicants investigate the need for CCTV in their area and to complete a detailed proposal, for submission under Stage 2.  Stage 2 is a direct Application Process for organisations who consider that they can develop and deliver a CCTV Programme immediately.  It enables communities to avail of grant aid funding of up to €100,000 from this Department to install a CCTV system in their area.  In addition, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has given a commitment to provide successful applications from RAPID areas with a further grant to a maximum of €100,000 subject to the total grant-aid from both Departments not exceeding €200,000 or 100% of the capital costs of the project, whichever is the lesser.</p>
            <p eId="para_3733">I have been informed by Pobal, who have been engaged to administer the Scheme on behalf of my Department, that in the areas referred to by the Deputy, the following applications have been received: Dublin City Council — (Liberties Area, Oliver Bond complex) — applied for Stage 1 (pre-development grant) and received €5,000.  Pobal invited all groups who received Stage 1 grants to apply for stage 2 funding.  The group applied within the closing date of the end of January 2007 for stage 2 funding and Pobal are now carrying out evaluations of this and other applications received under this round of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3734">When the scheme was first launched, The Base, Ballyfermot and the Islamic Foundation (South Circular Road) both applied for Stage 2 funding in September, 2005.  Following a thorough assessment of their applications both groups application for funding was deemed not to reach a high enough standard to be granted funding.   Pobal have provided direct feedback to the unsuccessful applicants under the Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3735">A new round of funding under the Community Based CCTV Scheme was advertised on 1 December 2006.  The closing date for applications was 28 February 2007.   I have been informed by Pobal that under this round an application for Stage 2 funding has been received from Dublin City Council (St. Teresa's Gardens Youth Project). This application will be evaluated by Pobal and recommendations will be made by end May 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_3774">The persons in question entered the state on 18 September 1999 and applied for asylum.  They were unsuccessful in their claim at initial stage with the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and at appeal before the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, both of which are statutory independent bodies. They where informed of the decision to refuse to grant them refugee status by the Minister on 01/05/2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_3775">These applicants challenged the decision through the medium of judicial review on three separate occasions. This delayed finalising their case.

As part of this plan members of An Garda Síochána are detailed for duty on the main thoroughfares and at licensed premises surrounding the venue.  Specific areas which have been identified as prone to incidents of public disorder or anti-social behaviour are the subject of particular Garda attention in order to ensure a concentrated and visible Garda presence.  Dedicated public order patrols are also on duty in the surrounding areas and proactively target the types of incidents referred to by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3806">I understand that local Garda management is aware of the specific complaints referred to by the Deputy. The area referred to is closely monitored by the Garda authorities and is subject to regular Garda patrols by uniform and plain-clothes personnel on the days where events are held at the venue referred to.  Members of the local Community Policing Unit attend community meetings and record and report to local Garda management any concerns or issues from local residents which may have occurred when events take place. The Garda authorities take account of concerns expressed and policing plans for future events are amended accordingly.  I am assured by the Garda authorities that they will continue to give the matter their ongoing attention.</p>

            <p eId="para_3810">Garda Youth Diversion Projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved (or further involved) in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, and promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects.  By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda/community relations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3811">There are currently 84 Garda Youth Diversion Projects  funded and administered through the Community Relations Section of An Garda Síochána. The allocation of funding for these Projects (along with 7 Local Drug Task Force Projects) in 2007 is just over €9.8 million, which is an increase of 48% on 2006. It is my intention to ensure that 100 projects will be established nationwide before the end of 2007.   The projects are particularly targeted at 10-18 year old "at risk" youths in communities where a specific need has been identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_3812">I am informed by the Garda Authorities that there is a total of five Garda Youth Diversion Projects operating in the areas of Clondalkin/Lucan/Ballyfermot.  There are currently 178 young people taking part in these projects.  In addition to the Garda Youth Diversion Projects, the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme provides an opportunity to divert juvenile offenders from criminal activity.  It operates on a nationwide basis under the supervision and direction of the Garda National Juvenile Office, Harcourt Square, Dublin 2.  The Programme provides that, in certain circumstances, a young person under 18 years of age, who freely accepts responsibility for a criminal incident, may be cautioned as an alternative to prosecution.</p>
            <p eId="para_3813">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the operation of the Programme that the number of young people from the Clondalkin and Lucan areas referred to the juvenile diversion programme for the years 2004, 2005, 2006 and to date in 2007 are as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_3832">The Employment Equality Act 1998, as amended by the Equality Act 2004, deals comprehensively with all areas relevant to employment, including access to employment, conditions of employment, remuneration, promotion and vocational training.  This Act provides for a review of its operation with a view to assessing whether there is need to add to the discriminatory grounds set out in the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_3833">This review commenced in 2001 and included a Round Table conference involving the social partners, relevant Government Departments, the Equality Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the Labour Court.  It was argued by some interest groups that the Employment Equality Act should be amended to include the following new grounds socio-economic status (including social origin), trade union membership, criminal conviction/ex-prisoner/ex-offender and political opinion. It was also acknowledged, however, that the legislation, which has led to new challenges for enforcement bodies, employers and Government, is relatively new and that the practical implications of extending its scope to include the proposed new grounds would require detailed examination and debate.  As part of the process UCC Law Department was commissioned to carry out a comparative review of the international experience of employment legislation prohibiting discrimination on some of the grounds suggested.  Following completion of this review Government has decided not to add to the existing nine grounds contained in the Employment Equality Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_3834">The Equal Status Act 2000 also provides for a review of its operation to assess whether there is need to add to the discriminatory grounds covered by the Act.  This review, which is a commitment under the Programme for Government and had been postponed pending completion of the review of the operation of the Employment Equality Acts, will now commence in April 2007 with a view to finalising a recommendation to Government in September 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3835">The Deputy will note that the list of grounds on which discrimination is outlawed already includes race, ethnic origin, nationality, colour, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, marital status, family status, religious belief and membership of the Traveller community.</p>

In this latter regard, a major project to enhance the content and accessibility of the Department's website is currently at an advanced stage.  Particular emphasis will be placed on making available comprehensive FAQ and Application Forms sections on the website, so as to reduce the necessity to make oral contact with the Department for routine enquiries or information requests.

            <p eId="para_3843">The disability criteria for eligibility for the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.

The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3851">The Group's Report, published on my Department's website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme.

            <p eId="para_3852">In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration.

The position is that the VAT regime and indeed the rating of all goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under EU VAT law we are precluded from extending the zero VAT rating regime.  However, VAT registered fishermen can claim recovery of VAT suffered on boats of 15 tons or less and on their other business inputs in the normal way on their VAT returns.</p>
            <p eId="para_3856">An unregistered fisherman may claim repayment of any VAT incurred on the purchase, intra-Community acquisition, importation, hire, maintenance and repair of sea-fishing vessels of a gross tonnage of not more than 15 tons, provided the fishing vessel concerned has been the subject of a grant or loan from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  In addition, unregistered fisherman may claim repayment of VAT on the purchase, intra-Community acquisition, importation, hire, maintenance and repair of specified fishing equipment for use in such vessels. The following are specified fishing equipment: anchors, autopilots, bilge and deck pumps, buoys and floats, compasses, cranes, echo graphs, echo sounders, electrical generating sets, fish boxes, fish finders, fishing baskets, life boats and life rafts, marine lights, marine engines, net drums, net hauliers, net sounders, radar apparatus, radio navigational aid apparatus, radio telephones, refrigeration plant, trawl doors, trawl gallows and winches.</p>
            <p eId="para_3857">Application for repayments by unregistered fishermen should be made on Form VAT 58A to the Central Repayments Office, Revenue Commissioners, The Plantation, Monaghan (Telephone 047-81425). Applications for repayment must be submitted within four years from the end of the taxable period to which the claim relates.</p>

            <p eId="para_3886">The SSIA scheme was introduced in the 2001 Finance Act and gives a credit to all SSIA investors of 25%, or €1 for every €4 saved.  The aim of the SSIA scheme was to encourage savings.  This aim has been successfully achieved with over 1.1 million persons availing of the special scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3887">The exit tax on matured SSIA accounts is calculated at 23% of the gain or interest earned on the account over the 5 year period.  For illustrative purposes, where a person has received interest on an SSIA account that amounts to 10% of their overall savings, the exit tax liable on the account at maturity would amount to around 2% of total funds in the account.  In contrast, the Government top-up on SSIA accounts amounts to 25% of savings.  In this respect, although all SSIA accounts are subject to an exit tax, it should be noted that the SSIA scheme represented a very good deal for all of those taking it up.</p>
            <p eId="para_3888">It is widely acknowledged that one of the reasons for the success of the SSIA scheme was its simplicity.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_3902">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the tax implications, where a parent of a first-time buyer is involved in the purchase of a home for the first-time buyer, will depend on the nature of the parent's involvement in the purchase.  I will deal with the different taxes in turn.</p>
            <p eId="para_3903">Stamp Duty</p>
            <p eId="para_3904">Where the parent makes a cash gift to a child of all or part of the purchase monies to enable the child to purchase a house, there is no stamp duty liability on this gift.  The stamp duty relief for first-time buyers would apply where the monies gifted are used by the child in purchasing a house in his own name provided the child had not previously purchased or received a gift of another house.</p>
            <p eId="para_3905">Where a house is purchased by a parent and subsequently gifted to a child who is a first-time buyer, a liability to stamp duty would arise in the first place on the purchase of the house by the parent.  The subsequent gift of the house by the parent to the child would qualify for first-time buyer relief where the child had not previously purchased or received a gift of another house.</p>
            <p eId="para_3906">Where a house is purchased in the joint names of a parent and a child, the first-time buyer relief is only available where each of the purchasers is a first-time buyer.  Therefore, the relief would not be available where the parent had previously purchased another house.</p>
            <p eId="para_3907">Capital Acquisitions Tax (Gift and Inheritance Tax)</p>
            <p eId="para_3908">Whether gift tax arises when a parent purchases a home or a substantial portion of the home for a child depends on the circumstances. The Finance Act 2000 introduced a package of measures specifically designed to reduce the impact of gift/inheritance tax for certain dwelling houses. The purpose of this exemption was to benefit individuals who had been living in a house for a period prior to taking the benefit, either by way of gift or inheritance. The main conditions attaching to the exemption are that the beneficiary of the dwelling house must have resided in the house for a minimum of 3 years prior to the gift/inheritance and must not have an interest in any other dwelling house. Also, the recipient or recipients must continue to occupy that dwelling house as his/her only or main residence for a period of 6 years commencing on the date of the gift/inheritance. Therefore, a parent can purchase a home or portion of a home in the parent's own name and subsequently transfer that home or their interest in that home to the child and, if the child, at the date of the transfer of the home to them, satisfies the above conditions, the transfer of the home to the child is exempt from Capital Acquisitions Tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_3909">If this exemption does not apply, depending on the circumstances of the case, then the normal Capital Acquisitions Tax computational rules set out below will apply to the gift of the dwelling house or alternatively to the gift of any purchase monies gifted to the child to enable the child to purchase the property directly in the child's own name in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3910">For the purpose of both Gift and Inheritance Tax, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum tax-free threshold- known as the "Group threshold".</p>
            <p eId="para_3911">The indexed Group threshold applying to a gift or inheritance received by a child from their parents is the Group A threshold and for 2007 this Group A threshold is €496,824.</p>
            <p eId="para_3912">Any other gifts/inheritances that might have been received by the beneficiary from within the same Group A threshold (i.e. from parents) since 5 December 1991 will also be taken into account when applying the threshold for the purposes of calculating the gift/inheritance tax. If the total value of all gifts and inheritances received by the beneficiary since this date from within this Group is above the threshold figure of €496,824, then a 20% rate of gift/inheritance tax will apply on the difference.</p>
            <p eId="para_3913">Capital gains tax (CGT)</p>
            <p eId="para_3914">CGT is chargeable on a transfer of ownership in an asset whether by way of sale, gift or otherwise. Cash is not an asset for CGT purposes. The subsequent disposal by a parent of a house or an interest in a house, which was purchased for a child, whether by way of a transfer to that child or a sale to a third party, is a chargeable event for CGT purposes. To the extent that the gain is attributable to the parent, main residence relief wouldn't apply. Where the house is wholly or partially owned by the child, any gain attributable to the child on a sale would be exempt from CGT provided he/she occupied the house as an only or main residence throughout the period of ownership or occupied it to within 12 months of sale.</p>

            <p eId="para_3918">A person who holds a credit card account with a credit card provider pays stamp duty on that credit card account once for each 12 month period ending on 1 April each year.  Where a person cancels a credit card account within a 12 month period he/she pays the charge at the time of cancellation.  This means that, in respect of any credit card account, an individual will only pay once for the year ending on the following 1 April.  Where the individual closes a credit card after 1 April in any year, a stamp duty charge of €40 will arise, as the account has been maintained by the financial institution during the year ending on the following 1 April. This is consistent with applying a stamp duty charge for a year or part of a year for which the credit card account is held.</p>
            <p eId="para_3919">However, Section 128 of the Finance Act 2005 contained measures to eliminate a double stamp duty charge for the same year on the switching of financial cards.  Where a credit card account is closed in the tax year the financial institution will issue a Letter of Closure to the holder of the account stating that the stamp duty has been paid for that year.  Where the individual opens a new credit card account at any point in that tax year, the new financial institution, upon receipt of the Letter of Closure, will provide that the stamp duty on the new credit card, normally charged in the following April, will not be applied.</p>

            <p eId="para_3923">As the Deputy may be aware, under Section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, tax relief is available on donations to eligible charities and other approved bodies, including bodies which come under the category "Advancement of Education".  Any school teaching children with special needs, for example, would be entitled to apply to the Revenue Commissioners for charitable tax exemption.</p>
            <p eId="para_3924">The minimum qualifying donation for relief purposes to an eligible charity or approved body is €250 per annum and there is no upper limit on the amount which can be donated.  Donations for any one year can be on a cumulative basis.  Thus, a weekly donation of €5 per week can qualify for the relief.  The relief on the donation is at an individual's marginal rate of tax. The arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations depends on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer or an individual on self-assessment or a company. For a PAYE taxpayer, the relief is given at the donor's marginal rate of income tax and is given on a grossed-up basis to the charity.  This means the tax refund goes to the charity. In the case of a donation made by an individual who is self-assessed, the individual claims the relief and there is no grossing-up arrangement. Similarly, in the case of companies, they can claim deductions for donations as if they were a trading expense.  In Budget 2006 I extended the scheme to cover the donation of publicly quoted securities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3925">Given the existing donations schemes, I have no plans to introduce any special tax reliefs for donations towards the care of children with special needs.  I would point out, however, that in recent years the Government has increased significantly the supports available through the direct expenditure system for children with disabilities.</p>

            <p eId="para_3933">I propose to take Questions Nos. 301 and 303 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3934">My decision to extend the Business Expansion Scheme (BES) and the Seed Capital Scheme (SCS) was based on a thorough review of the scheme that was carried out by my Department during Summer 2006 in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment and the Revenue Commissioners.  It included a survey of firms which had benefited from the BES.  The 2006 Review has been published on my Department's website at http://www.finance.gov.ie/documents/publications/Reports/BESSCSReport.pdf. The 2006 Review took account of the findings of the Report of the Small Business Forum, Small Business is Big Business, the Survey of SME Finance/Equity carried out by Forfás, and the PWC Report Strategic Advisory Services — Enterprise Ireland Seed and Venture Capital Funds Programme 2006, as well as a range of submissions from interested parties. In addition, the extension of the scheme was considered by the Tax Strategy Group in the context of Budget 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3935">On the basis of all of this I concluded that there was a strong case for extending the schemes given the clear market failure in providing equity capital for small firms in their start up and early development phase, the evidence of how vital the schemes have been in the past for such firms and the continuing needs in this regard, the potential return to the economy from indigenous Irish companies, and the clear support for continuation from a large number of representative and other bodies in the public and private sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_3936">Both the BES and SCS have been the subject of regular review and monitoring by my Department as well as the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the relevant development agencies since the schemes were first introduced, as is detailed in the 2006 Review.  Each time, the main conclusion has been the same — a significant market failure exists due to the high risk associated with start-up business and this results in persistent difficulties in securing early stage capital; this market failure justifies continuing fiscal support.</p>
            <p eId="para_3937">The information the Deputy requests on the methodology used, the response rate and the factors assessed in the survey, together with the performance of companies participating in the scheme, is all contained in the above-mentioned review.</p>

        <b>Mr. Eamon Ryan</b>
         asked the

         if, in view of recent research findings that companies may be laundering profits through Ireland to avoid American tax, there are difficulties in the way multinational companies declare their profits here; and the role the agencies under his aegis have in preventing same.

            <p eId="para_3939">I am not aware of any difficulties with the way that companies declare their profits for Irish tax purposes.  The structure of the Irish tax regime corresponds to the international norm.  A company that is resident in the State is taxed on its worldwide income.  A company that is not resident in the State but which carries on a trade through a branch or agency in the State is taxed on its trading income arising through or from that branch or agency and any income from property or rights used by, or held by, the branch or agency.  Returns of profits made in an accounting period by a company that is within the charge to tax here are required to be made to the Revenue Commissioners within 9 months after the end of the accounting period.</p>
            <p eId="para_3940">The Irish tax regime applies a 12.5% corporation tax rate to trading income generally. A wide base is used in calculating the trading income concerned.  This rate applies both to companies that are resident in the State and to those that carry on a trade here through a branch or agency.  This is an up-front transparent regime.</p>
            <p eId="para_3941">Locating in Ireland does not protect a multinational group from taxation in its "home" country.  Where a subsidiary located in Ireland pays a dividend to its foreign parent company, the parent company will be taxed on the dividend but will be entitled to a credit against the tax on the dividend for any Irish tax paid on the profits out of which the dividend is paid.  The US and other parent company jurisdictions have sophisticated rules to prevent their companies from availing of tax deferral in low tax jurisdictions where this is not considered appropriate, such as in the case of passive income.  Such deferral is only possible for genuine business activities.</p>

            <p eId="para_4301">The Finance Bill 2007 amendment referred to by the Deputy ensured that the supply of fruit juices and vegetable juices continues to be taxable at the standard VAT rate of 21%.  Indeed, all fruit juices, soft drinks and bottled water have been subject to the standard rated since 1992.</p>
            <p eId="para_4302">This amendment was necessary following a recent ruling by the Appeal Commissioner that a certain fruit/vegetable juice product qualified for zero-rating.  The outcome of the appeal has led to uncertainty in relation to the VAT treatment of other drinkable products made from fruit and vegetables. In this regard, it should be noted that fruit and vegetables are also the main ingredients of most soft drinks which are also subject to the standard VAT rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_4303">Not ensuring that the supply of fruit and vegetable juices continued to be taxable at the standard VAT rate would have resulted in a possible distortion of competition between producers of what could be considered similar products.  It should also be borne in mind that the scope of the zero rate on food and drink is challenged regularly by producers and suppliers, which meant it was necessary to re-establish a level playing field in this market to ensure that a more favourable tax treatment does not apply to one product.</p>

However, a body with an almost identical name, which it is assumed is the intended subject of the Deputy's question, applied for charitable tax exemption in 1993 and 2001.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_4309">I wish to advise the Deputy that there are no grants or financial incentives available for adapting diesel cars in order that they can use biofuels.  In relation to VAT, the position is that the VAT regime and indeed the rating of all goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. While we can retain the zero rating provisions which were in existence on 1 January 1991, we cannot introduce any new ones.  Therefore, it is not possible to apply a zero rate to the supply of goods used to modify cars to use low carbon dioxide emission biofuels.</p>
            <p eId="para_4310">In addition, while a reduced rate can be applied to certain goods and services, there is no mechanism which would allow for the reduced rating of alternative fuel consumption systems for cars.  The VAT Directive does not make any distinction between different types of fuels or methods of production of energy. The supply of all fuel consumption systems, including environmentally friendly ones, is therefore chargeable at the standard VAT rate of 21%. Any change in the standard rate would apply to the sale of all fuel consumption systems and indeed products at the standard VAT rate. A reduction in the standard VAT of 1% would cost the Exchequer in excess of €440 million and have little or no effect on price.</p>
            <p eId="para_4311">However, under the VAT system, VAT registered businesses can claim a deduction for all other types of fuel e.g. diesel, LPG or bio-fuels except petrol. In addition, the conversion of a vehicle is allowable as a deduction provided the conversion is an expense suffered in the course or furtherance of business and used for a taxable activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_4312">The Deputy will also be aware, I introduced a provision in the Finance Act of 2006 which enables the Revenue Commissioners to grant a 50% vehicle registration tax (VRT) relief on the registration of flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) in the State. The purpose of this scheme is to encourage the development of new technology that is used in the manufacture of vehicles that use engines and fuel systems that are capable of running on E85-bioethanol (a combination of ethanol and petrol) which benefits the environment by producing lower pollutant emissions than conventional vehicles fuelled exclusively by petrol or diesel.</p>

            <p eId="para_4335">There are eight EU Directives awaiting either transposition into Irish law, or formal notification of completion of transposition to the European Commission,  by my Department at the current time.</p>
            <p eId="para_4336">Directive 2005/60/EC is intended to strengthen legal measures to prevent the use of the financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing.  Deadline for transposition is December 2007. The Department of Finance together with the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform has conducted an extensive consultation with interested parties.  It is intended that transposition will be effected by means of a Criminal Justice Bill to amend or replace relevant provision of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.</p>
            <p eId="para_4337">The Reinsurance Directive (2005/68) has been partially transposed and notified to the Commission on the 30th August 2006. The deadline for full transposition is December 2007.  The remaining articles will be transposed shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_4338">Directive 2006/79/EC was agreed in October 2006. Following consultation with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, it has been decided that it is appropriate to legislate in respect of this Directive and this will be done by way of a Statutory Instrument before end 2007.   There is no deadline by which this Directive must be transposed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4339">Council Directive 2006/112/EC: Deadline for transposition is 1 January 2007. SI No. 663 of 2006 was enacted to cater for the recast of the Sixth VAT Directive.  On the advice of Parliamentary Counsel, this instrument is now being revoked in favour of its inclusion in Finance Bill 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_4340">Council Directive 2006/138/EC (19 Dec 06). Transposition is not required as the Directive is already provided for under Irish VAT Law.  Arrangements are being made to notify the Commission formally in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_4341">Council Directive 2006/98/EC (20 Nov 06) and Commission Directive 2006/84/EC (23 Oct 06) adapt a number of taxation directives to allow for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania and as such have a deadline of 1 January 2007. The Directives, which were published in the Official Journal in late December, are being actively examined by my officials. SIs are currently being prepared to cater for those aspects that require transposition. I expect that the draft SIs will be sent to the Parliamentary Counsel's Office in the coming days.</p>
            <p eId="para_4342">Council Directive 2006/97/EC (20 Nov 2006): Deadline for transposition is 1 Jan 2007.  This Directive adapts certain Public Procurement Directives in the field of free movement of goods, by reason of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.  An investigation is ongoing to ascertain whether this directive needs to be transposed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4343">Directive 2006/138/EC does not need to be transposed as it is already provided for under Irish VAT law, but the European Commission must be formally notified of this. Four directives (2006/112, 2006/98, 2006/84, 2006/97) are overdue for transposition since 1st January 2007.  I can assure the Deputy that strong efforts are being made to complete the transposition and formal notification to the European Commission of these overdue directives at the earliest possible date.</p>
            <p eId="para_4344">I am informed regularly by senior management about the up-to-date position with regard to European Directives under the responsibility of my Department awaiting transposition.  In addition, my Department reports monthly to the Interdepartmental Committee on European Affairs, chaired by Minister of State Noel Treacy, on the status of outstanding directives.  Every effort is being made in my Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, to ensure that Directives are transposed on time.</p>

            <p eId="para_4354">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, under Section 114 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, employees have a statutory entitlement to claim a tax deduction in respect of expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of their employment.  This, therefore, is the statutory basis for granting tax relief in respect of expenses to employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_4355">I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, instead of each employee submitting his/her claims for tax relief in respect of allowable expenses, there is a long standing practice going back over 40 years under which Revenue and staff representatives bodies, including trade unions, agree the amount of expenses that are tax deductible for a category or group of employees.  Such agreed rates have become known as "flat rate expenses".  Such arrangement has a number of advantages for employees.  For example, they can be assured that they are represented as regards their claim and they do not have to submit individual claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_4356">As regards ensuring the more recent occupations are treated equitably, this is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.

This would be of benefit to people at the top end of the market.  However, the demand for property at the lower end of the market would increase as the older person trading down sought a smaller house and this would adversely affect first-time buyers in particular, who would have to compete for such houses with a larger number of purchasers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4362">Anyone that sells their principal private residence is exempt from capital gains tax.  If the house has been occupied for the full period of ownership, full exemption applies.

            <p eId="para_4371">Lifetime Mortgages are regulated under the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  In addition, the Financial Regulator has included specific provisions in the Consumer Protection Code relating to Lifetime Mortgages.  The Code provides that consumers are fully advised of the consequences of releasing equity from their home and that the financial service provider obtains sufficient information from the client to ensure that a suitable product is provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_4372">Equity release schemes are not currently a regulated financial service.  They involve a part sale of the consumer's property and such transactions are of course subject to the general law in relation to contract and sale of property.</p>
            <p eId="para_4373">The Consumer Protection Bill 2007 currently before this House will further enhance consumer protection.  The Bill provides for the establishment of the National Consumer Agency with an extensive remit including enforcement powers in relation to unfair commercial practices and unfair terms in consumer contracts.  The Bill also provides that the functions of the Agency in relation to these matters may be exercised by the Financial Regulator in the case of regulated financial service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4374">In addition to the above my Department together with the Financial Regulator and the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is undertaking a review to establish whether or not home reversion products and/or their providers should be further regulated.</p>
            <p eId="para_4375">Participation in equity release products is at the discretion of the consumer.  However such participation involves the granting of certain rights in relation to the property which will crystallise on the death of the homeowner.  I understand therefore that some providers may insist on the making of a will or on other related formalities.  The availability of a will clearly expressing the homeowner's intentions will facilitate the administration of the estate in a speedy and efficient manner to the benefit of all parties involved. Indeed this is generally true whether or not the home owner has availed of equity release or home reversion services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4376">At the launch on 6 February 2007 of the Financial Regulator's publication entitled "Equity release-using your home to get a cash sum" the Consumer Director  issued the following advice to the potential purchasers of equity release products: "ask plenty of questions before you enter into any agreement; discuss the issue with your immediate family before you enter into an agreement; consider alternatives that may be available to you; take independent legal advice."  I would recommend that anyone considering one of these products should heed that advice.</p>

            <p eId="para_4383">The 1997 Finance Act made provisions for a scheme of tax relief for areas adjacent to regional airports along the same lines as the relief then available under the Enterprise Areas Scheme.  The scheme provided for accelerated capital allowances and double rent relief for lessees of qualified buildings.  The position is that the scheme as originally announced was submitted to the European Commission for approval in 1997.  However, the ensuing approval in 1998 imposed certain specific conditions i.e. that the qualifying period should end on 31 December 1999 in order to conform with the end of the then existing general regional aid framework throughout the European Union.  In addition, the European Commission ruled out double rent relief in respect of any of the proposed enterprise areas adjacent to the regional airports.</p>
            <p eId="para_4384">The Commission also requested the Irish authorities to submit details of such airport projects to the Commission for approval by them.  A total of two such projects were submitted to this Department for referral to the Commission.  The first, a business park at Cork Airport was approved on 7 July 1999 and the second, a cargo handling operation at Knock Airport was approved on 26 October 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_4385">Informal approval for a one year extension to 31 December 2000 in respect of capital allowances for both projects was subsequently obtained.  This was on the strict understanding that no further extensions to the scheme would be sought by the Irish authorities.  This understanding and recent experience of a much more rigorous examination of fiscal State aids by the Commission emphasises that it is not feasible to pursue any further extension in duration or scope of the scheme for Knock Airport with the Commission.</p>

            <p eId="para_4388">The reason for selecting the mid-Shannon region is that from a tourism perspective, the inner core of the country remains relatively underdeveloped.

This scheme aims to help redress this regional imbalance and for this reason it is important that the geographical scope of the scheme should be confined to this limited area.

            <p eId="para_4390">The position is that charities and non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT under the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase.  Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_4391">The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group (ICTRG) appears to accept that charities cannot be granted VAT refunds through the tax system.  However, they are still seeking the introduction of a grant or subsidy in lieu of the VAT charities pay on their business inputs and estimate that this would cost €18 million per annum in respect of the bodies they represent.  However, given that Exchequer funding is made available to very many charitable organisations this is in effect already happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_4392">The 140 bodies represented by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group already acknowledge that they receive some €9 million in funding either directly or indirectly from the Exchequer.  However, there are approximately 7,000 charities registered with the Revenue Commissioners.  It is therefore likely that the introduction of a scheme along the lines proposed by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group would cost the Exchequer significantly more than the €18 million estimate put forward by the group in respect of the bodies they represent.</p>
            <p eId="para_4393">I understand that the only EU Member State to introduce a scheme providing partial compensation for a limited number of charities for VAT incurred on input costs is Denmark.  To be eligible under the Danish scheme charities must already be approved bodies under the Danish equivalent of our tax relief on donations scheme.  My Department understands that some 750 charities in Denmark could benefit as a result.  In comparison, over 1,900 organisations have to date been approved under the Irish donations relief scheme.  It also understands that under the Danish scheme educational institutions are not eligible for compensation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4394">It is likely, therefore, the introduction of any grant system in lieu of VAT paid by registered charities in Ireland would undoubtedly lead to other exempt bodies such as schools, hospitals and sporting organisations, many of which are already registered as charities, seeking to benefit from such a system of refunds.  These exempt bodies are already receiving considerable Exchequer funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_4395">The tax code already treats charities in a favourable manner.  The tax code currently provides exemption for charities from Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Deposit Interest Retention Tax, Capital Acquisitions Tax, Stamp Duty, Probate Tax, Dividend Withholding Tax and the uniform scheme of tax relief for donations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4396">While no overall definitive figures are available on the cost to the Exchequer of charitable tax exemption status, Revenue estimated in 2005 that the cost of the various tax exemptions and tax reliefs, including the tax relief on donations scheme, in place for bodies conferred with charitable status could be as high as €190m annually.  In addition to tax exemptions and reliefs, charities, voluntary and community groups, and sporting bodies benefit significantly from grants schemes administered by a number of Government Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_4397">Finally, even if funds were available for grant-aiding charities and other voluntary groups, I am not sure that the most appropriate use of the funds would be to relieve them of the VAT paid on inputs as opposed to grant-aiding their activities using other criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_4404">A special Interdepartmental Review Group reviewed the operation of the Disabled Drivers Scheme.

            <p eId="para_4408">There is strong co-ordination of measures to deter money laundering in the financial system at EU level.  A Third Money Laundering Directive was adopted in 2005 and is due to come into effect shortly and requires to be transposed into domestic legislation in each Member State by December 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_4409">The Third Money Laundering Directive will replace and update the 1991 and 2001 Money Laundering Directives which imposed obligations on financial institutions and, more recently, on lawyers, accountants and auctioneers to identify their clients and report suspicious transactions to the police authorities.  The new Directive reflects the 2003 revision of the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) — the main international anti-money laundering organisation.  One of its central features is to strengthen the obligation on financial institutions, and others, to identify the beneficial ownership of legal entities.  It will also impose an obligation on financial institutions and others to pay particular attention to "politically exposed persons", from other Member States and from third countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_4410">The directive also brings Terrorist Funding into the money laundering framework and introduces the concept of a risk-based approach to the implementation of its requirements.  The Directive requires amendment of our domestic legislation in relation to money laundering and the relevant legislative proposals will be brought forward by the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4411">Ireland also participates in work to ensure that the EU legal frameworks are adapted to the FATF's special recommendations on terrorist financing.  For example, a proposal to tighten controls of money transfers in order to cut off funding sources for terrorists and other criminals were adopted in 2006 in line with FATF recommendations.  The relevant Regulation requires that money transfers be accompanied by the identity of the sender, ensuring that this information will be immediately available to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4412">The issues of money laundering and criminality generally are, of course, also regularly discussed at the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council of the EU.  As regards operational matters, there is ongoing cooperation and exchange of information between the relevant supervisory and police authorities within the EU.</p>

            <p eId="para_4415">I propose to take Questions Nos. 339 and 340 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4416">The Government is firmly committed to the development of biofuels generally in Ireland.  The promotion of biofuel is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, however, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in Finance Act 2006 I provided for significant tax measures to promote biofuels in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_4417">This scheme, which received the necessary EU State Aid approval, commenced in November 2006 and will provide for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum; cost over €200m over 5 years; when fully operational, result in CO2 savings of over 250,000 tonnes per annum; contribute towards meeting a target of 5.75% transport fuel market penetration by biofuels by 2009; help reduce our dependency on conventional fossil fuels; and stimulate activity in the agricultural sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_4418">I have received representations requesting an increase in the amount of biofuels qualifying for excise duty relief, including pure plant oil.  However, I should point out that the overall level of excise relief available for biofuels, which is subject to EU State Aid approval, — and the breakdown of the relief between each of the alternative fuels — is that which had been proposed by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in advance of Budget 2006.  It is regarded as a level which is sufficient to match Ireland's output potential in relation to renewable energy crops for motor fuels over the coming years.  Any extension in the amount of relief which formed part of that Budget announcement is not envisaged at this stage.  These fiscal incentives were designed to kick-start the domestic biofuels industry and the evidence suggests that this is happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_4419">To provide further market certainty and encourage projects of scale, the Government recently announced its intention to move to a Biofuels Obligation by 2009, with targets for market penetration for biofuels of 5.75% in 2009 and 10% by 2020.</p>

            <p eId="para_4421">Maintaining a moderate rate of inflation remains a key priority of economic policy because of its importance in restoring competitiveness to all sectors, including the manufacturing sector.  The Government is focusing on areas it can control and taking positive actions to contain inflation by implementing responsible fiscal policies.  For example, we have not increased excise duties for the last three years, apart from tobacco excise, which was done for sound health policy reasons.</p>
            <p eId="para_4422">We are promoting greater price competition through various measures.  We are also investing in public infrastructure, as evidenced by the recently announced National Development Plan, which will enhance our ability to produce more goods and services and, by improving the economy's efficiency, keep inflation down. In addition, we recognise that services sector inflation is a cause for concern and this highlights the need for more competition in the economy as well as for pay and profit restraint in all sectors in order to keep our cost base down.  We must ensure that the wage increases granted under the Social Partnership agreement, Towards 2016, are reflected in productivity gains.</p>

On a HICP basis inflation fell to 2.6 per cent in February from 2.9 per cent in January.  The rate of CPI inflation has increased in the past year; this is mainly due to ECB interest rate increases which are outside of Government control.  If mortgage interest was removed, CPI inflation would have measured 2.5 per cent in February.  Annual goods inflation was unchanged in February but annual services sector inflation is currently running at 9.1 per cent and this is a cause for concern.

            <p eId="para_4433">The programme of Decentralisation is being implemented through the transfer of staff on a voluntary basis.  The potential benefits of decentralisation are significant.  Existing Civil and Public Servants seeking to leave Dublin, for example, to return to family and friends back home, or to acquire an affordable and comfortable family home within easy reach of their workplace, have a broad range of options.  There will also be a wider range of work and career opportunities for Public and Civil Servants already working outside Dublin.  Present and future Civil and Public Servants who aspire to senior management positions will no longer have to necessarily migrate to the capital, although many will continue to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_4434">On a broader note, the dispersal of jobs from Dublin has obvious advantages for securing a better regional balance.  It will help the economic and social development of the chosen centres and their catchment areas.  Decentralisation can provide high-quality jobs for regions that have not benefited as much as Dublin from recent economic success.  It can provide a further boost to the provision of infrastructure in the regions.  It can also attract other investment and services and act as an incentive to entrepreneurs to develop businesses in the regions thus creating a positive domino effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_4435">The Deputy may also wish to note that as a contribution towards the expenses of staff during training, a Decentralisation Training Allowance is payable for officers from locations outside Dublin who are required to come to Dublin (or another suitable provincial location) for an initial training period prior to taking up duty at new decentralised locations.  My Department will be issuing a circular to departments on this matter shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_4438">Over ten thousand six hundred civil and public servants have made applications under the CAF system at this stage.  At the end of December 2006, over 2,400 staff had been assigned to decentralising posts.  Approximately 800 of these are currently in place, in 17 new locations, while the remainder are being trained in advance of decentralisation to a new location, as soon as accommodation becomes available.</p>
            <p eId="para_4439">It is envisaged that by the end of 2007 public services will be delivered from 36 of the decentralisation towns with approximately 2,000 staff transferred.  The precise numbers moving within that time frame will depend on the availability of property as well as timeframes for completion of fit out and installation of necessary ICT (information communications technology) and telecommunication cabling and equipment.</p>

This Report was commissioned by the former Health Boards Executive and submitted to my Department in 2004.  It recommended that cervical screening be managed as a national call/recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction in terms of policy, quality assurance, accountability and value for money.  It is my objective to have such a programme rolled out, beginning late this year, based on an affordable model.  For that purpose, on 1 January 2007, I established a National Cancer Screening Service which amalgamates BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme.</p>

Significant preparatory work is well under way involving the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality assurance training and the preparation of a national population register.  All elements of the programme — call/recall, smear taking, laboratories, colposcopy and treatment services — will be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated service.  An effective national cervical screening programme will result in a substantial reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer.</p>

            <p eId="para_4557">The statutory position governing the eligibility of children to dental treatment under the Health Service Executive (HSE) service is Section 66 of the Health Act, 1970, the Health (Amendment) Act 1994 and the Health (Dental Services for Children) Regulations, 2000 (S.I.

The screening provided in second, fourth and sixth classes ensures that follow up appointments for examination, treatment or orthodontic review are made, as necessary, with the Dental Surgeon in the clinic designated for the particular school(s).  Children who have attended national school retain eligibility to dental treatment up to their 16th birthday.</p>
            <p eId="para_4559">The Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2006, contains provision for the amendment of Section 66 of the Health Act, 1970 to provide for a health examination and treatment service for pupils attending any primary school.

            <p eId="para_4565">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_4566">Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs.  In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_4567">As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

            <p eId="para_4575">A new programme of staffing grants under the NCIP is expected to be announced in 2007 and will be informed by the outcome of a Value for Money Review of the EOCP which is currently in progress.

            <p eId="para_4576">With regard to the Group in question I understand, as stated previously, that they were approved €19,046 under the EOCP in December 2001 towards staffing costs for one year.  However, they were not recommended staffing grant assistance towards their second and third year as the service had not met the original conditions of funding, the targets set or reporting requirements.  Furthermore it was not demonstrated that the service was facilitating parents to access employment, education or training.  The original decision was upheld by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children following a review of application earlier this year.

            <p eId="para_4610">The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides a clear legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long-term residential care.  All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive will have their charges repaid in full.  The estates of all those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged for publicly funded long-term residential care and died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full.  The scheme does not allow for repayments to the estates of those who died prior to that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_4611">Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or charges for in-patient services only, raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.  The repayment scheme was launched publicly by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the scheme administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald in August 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_4612">In relation to dates of repayments to applicants, the HSE has informed the Department that over 26,000 forms have been submitted to the scheme administrator applying for repayments and these applications are being processed at present. The timeframe for repayment is predicated primarily on whether the applicant is alive or whether the application is being made by the estate of a deceased person. Living people who were wrongly charged will be the first to receive payments under the scheme. It is estimated that there are now in the region of 14,000 people within this category. Queries in relation to individual applications should be referred to the scheme administrator.</p>
            <p eId="para_4613">Offers of repayment commenced in late 2006 and over 1,000 payments have already issued with further payments continuing on an ongoing basis. The HSE has indicated that over €22 million has been repaid to date.  It is expected that the bulk of payments to estates will commence later in the year.   Provision has been made for applications to be received up to 1 January 2008. It is anticipated that the majority of repayments will be made by mid 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4614">A dedicated website <i>www.repay.ie</i>, an information phone line 1890 886 886 and an e-mail facility queries@repay.ie have been established by the scheme administrator to assist the public in accessing claim forms and general information on the scheme.  The information line operates between the hours of 9.00 am and 6.00 pm from Monday to Friday.</p>

            <p eId="para_4618">The aim of the National Cancer Control Strategy, which was published in June 2006, is to reduce our cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality rates relative to other Member States of the European Union.  This Government is committed to investing significantly in the implementation of the Strategy.  The Health Service Executive (HSE), at my Department's request, is conducting a national needs assessment for cancer control which will set out priorities in the medium term.</p>
            <p eId="para_4619">I have made available an additional €20.5m this year for cancer control.  This is an increase of 74% on the comparable 2006 investment and includes €3.5m to support the initial implementation of the HSE National Cancer Control Programme.  The Programme will manage, organise and deliver cancer control on a whole population basis.  It will have a strong emphasis on prevention and early detection, integrated across primary, hospital, supportive and palliative care.  The Service Plan of the HSE for this year sets out the detailed deliverables of the Programme.  This includes the establishment of the leadership team to implement the Programme, including the Director of the Programme and key medical leaders at network level.</p>
            <p eId="para_4620">I have allocated an additional €3.25m this year to support the implementation of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology.  This will support the appointment of additional Consultant Radiation Oncologists, Specialist Registrars and support staff.   The National Cancer Registry has been allocated an additional €0.4m this year and €0.35m has been allocated to the Health Research Board for All-Ireland-NCI Cancer Consortium activities, including a cancer bio-banking initiative and further support for the clinical trials initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_4621">Evidence based population based screening programmes are an essential element of the Strategy.  I established a National Cancer Screening Service Board on 1 January this year.  The total allocation to the new Service is €33m, a 71% increase on the funding available in 2006.  This includes €8m which has been allocated this year for the roll out of the national breast-screening programme and €5m to commence the roll out of a national cervical screening programme later this year.  The Service will also advise on the implementation of a national colorectal screening programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4635">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_4636">Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_4637">As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>

Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.</p>

            <p eId="para_4655">An effective national cervical screening programme will result in a substantial reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer.  It is my objective to have such a programme rolled out, beginning late this year, based on an affordable model.  For that purpose, on 1 January 2007, I established a National Cancer Screening Service which amalgamates BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme at the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4656">The total allocation to the new Service is €33m; this is a 71% increase on the 2006 allocation to the Programmes.  This includes additional funding of €5m for 2007 to the Service to commence roll out of the Cervical Screening Programme.  I will make available adequate resources for the programme in future years which will be included in the annual Estimates process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4657">Significant preparatory work is well under way involving the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality assurance training and the preparation of a national population register.  The plan is to have cervical screening managed as a national call/recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.  All elements of the programme, call/recall, smear taking, laboratories, colposcopy and treatment services will be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated national programme.  Accordingly, the Service is not planning to roll out the programme incrementally on a regional basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_4678">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_4679">Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_4680">As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

            <p eId="para_4782">The HSE has established a Steering Group and a Project Group to oversee a programme designed to improve safety and standards across the acute hospital network in the North East Region. The decision was taken having regard to the issues raised in the report prepared for the HSE by Teamwork Management Services — "Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards — An Action Plan for Health Services in the North East".</p>
            <p eId="para_4783">The Teamwork Report included a number of recommendations to improve patient care in the region.  It particularly highlighted the need to develop a high quality, responsive emergency and planned service, in line with international standards.  It recommended that there be one major regional hospital in the North East, supported by five local hospitals.  The new hospital is to provide emergency and trauma services on a 24 hour basis and also provide planned specialist procedures that are complex and require the facilities of a large regional hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_4784">The hospital reconfiguration process is being overseen by the HSE Steering Group which is leading the project.  No decision has been made to date on the location of the new hospital. A sub-committee of the Steering Group has been established to progress the issue of site selection.  A tender for consultancy is to be awarded shortly for an independent site location study. The study will take account of various criteria including demographics, access, planning and development considerations and interdependencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_4785">The HSE has given me an assurance that, in progressing the implementation of this report, there will be no discontinuation of existing services until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_4789">Over 120,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the health care needs of the population into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_4790">A particular priority for my Department and the Department of Education and Science in recent years has been the expansion of the supply of therapy graduates, including speech and language therapists. In response to concerns regarding labour shortages, my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions to 2015 in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists (Bacon Report).</p>
            <p eId="para_4791">The report was published in 2001 and arising from its recommendations additional courses in speech and language therapy providing 75 places were established in three universities. UCC, NUIG and UL each established courses in speech and language therapy with 25 places on each of the 3 courses.  The first cohort of graduates from the UL masters level course in speech and language therapy graduated in 2005 and the first cohort from the bachelor degree programmes in UCC and NUIG will graduate this year. This investment represents an increase in training capacity of 300% in speech and language therapy.  The total number of speech and language therapy training places now stands at 100, the level at which the Bacon Report recommended as being sufficient to meet current and future demand to 2015 for speech and language therapists.</p>
            <p eId="para_4792">An issue has recently come to my attention whereby physiotherapy graduates have had some difficulties in finding employment.  I want to ensure that the combination of factors which have led to this situation are addressed urgently and do not impact on the other therapy professions.  My Department is addressing this situation in a proactive manner and is working closely with the HSE to tackle the various factors which are contributing to this situation.  A working group made up of the Department, the HSE and the profession themselves, including nominees from the unions, is continuing to work to tackle this situation in preparation for the 2007 graduates.</p>
            <p eId="para_4793">Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>

The registered Adoption Society, PACT, has also received significant additional funding to allow them to expand their inter-country adoption services.</p>

These Directives are being transposed by way of four draft Regulations to be made under the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, rather than under the European Communities Act 1973 as is normally the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_4849">As these draft Regulations update and replace national legislation it was necessary to notify them to Member States under the provisions of Directive 98/34/EC concerning the prevention of technical barriers to trade. The three month notification period required expires on June 6th 2007.  No objections to the draft Regulations are anticipated from Member States and it is expected that the Regulations will be finalised thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_4850">2006/81/EC — adapting Directive 95/17/EC as regards the non-inclusion of one or more ingredients on the list used for the labelling of cosmetic products and Directive 2005/78/EC as regards the measures to be taken against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from engines for use in vehicles, by reason of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania — due 01/01/2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_4902">Over 120,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the health care needs of the population into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_4903">Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.

            <p eId="para_4907">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_4908">Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_4909">As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

BreastCheck appointed the Clinical Directors for the South and West last November and has recently appointed three Consultant Radiologists, two Consultant Surgeons and two Consultant Histopathologists, all with a special interest in breast disease.  The recruitment of Radiographers and other staff is under way.  I have also made available an additional €26.7m capital funding for the construction of two new clinical units and the provision of five additional mobile units and state of the art digital equipment.

            <p eId="para_4932">An effective national cervical screening programme will result in a substantial reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer.  It is my objective to have such a programme rolled out nationally, beginning late this year, based on an affordable model.  For that purpose, on 1 January 2007, I established a National Cancer Screening Service which amalgamates BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme.  The total allocation to the new Service is €33m; this is a 71% increase on the 2006 allocation to the Programmes.  This includes additional funding of €5m for 2007 to the Service to commence roll out of the Cervical Screening Programme at the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4933">Significant preparatory work is well under way involving the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality assurance training and the preparation of a national population register.  The plan is to have cervical screening managed as a national call/recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.  All elements of the programme, call/recall, smear taking, laboratories, colposcopy and treatment services will be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated national programme.  Accordingly, the Service is not planning to roll out the programme incrementally on a regional basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_4939">I propose to take Questions Nos. 486 to 488, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4940">The Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005 have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges may be levied. These regulations were signed by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children on 14 January 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_4941">Class 1 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of €120 or the weekly income of that person less €35, whichever is the lesser.</p>
            <p eId="para_4942">Class 2 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this situation, a weekly charge can be levied of €90, or the weekly income of that person less €55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.</p>
            <p eId="para_4943">These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on either class of person. The HSE issued revised guidelines for the implementation of the charges in July 2006.  No further distinctions are made in terms of the classes of persons to which charges apply, and I do not have plans to introduce any.</p>
            <p eId="para_4944">The HSE has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of "undue hardship". Under Section 1 (b) of the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005, the HSE can examine a person's overall financial situation in view of the person's reasonable expenditure in relation to themselves or their dependants, if any.</p>
            <p eId="para_4945">I welcome the decision by my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, to grant the full disability allowance to all persons in institutional residential care who prior to that were not eligible for this allowance.  The net impact of granting the full disability allowance, in the context of long stay charges, is that the individuals will continue to receive the same level of service as before but will have increased income which they will be able to retain for their personal use.</p>

            <p eId="para_4947">Over 120,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the health care needs of the population into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_4948">Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_4950">I am in favour of the use of smart cards and other information systems and technologies to make it easier for people to avail of health and personal social services and to reduce the administrative workload involved. Such developments must of course, as far as possible, be examined and progressed in a co-ordinated manner across the public service. I understand that the Departments of Finance and Social and Family Affairs are managing a programme of work to develop a Public Service Card framework. One of the objectives of the programme is to facilitate convergence over time of existing cards and other tokens under a single branded scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4952">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_4953">Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_4954">As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_4960">I propose to take Questions Nos. 493 and 494 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4961">It is understood that the figure quoted in the question of 250 annual deaths in Irish hospitals is an extrapolation of United Kingdom data.  This figure relates to Health Care Associated Infection, HCAI, generally, of which MRSA would be one element only.  I should add that this does not mean that patients died from a health care associated infection but simply that it was present at the time of death.</p>
            <p eId="para_4962">The Third Prevalence Survey of Healthcare-Associated Infections in Acute Hospitals was carried out by the UK and Ireland Hospital Infection Society between February and May 2006 and noted that Ireland has emerged with the lowest rate of health care associated infections of the countries studied.</p>
            <p eId="para_4963">Over 7,500 patients were surveyed in 44 acute Irish hospitals with the overall figure of MRSA infection emerging as under 0.5% — lower than their UK level of 1.5%.  The overall rate of Health Care Associated Infection, HCAI, which included MRSA related infection, was significantly lower in Irish hospitals.  While the UK hospitals recorded an overall figure of 7.6%, Irish hospitals recorded an overall figure of 4.9%.  The 4.9% varied depending on the type of hospital surveyed: from 6% in regional/tertiary hospitals, to 4.2% in general hospitals and 2% in specialist hospitals.  This variation can in part be explained by the type of activity or the profile of the patients treated by each type of hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_4964">Comparing with other countries, Ireland's overall HCAI figure of 4.9% compares favourably: Australia 6%; France 6-10%; Norway7%; Netherlands 7%; Spain 8%; USA 5-10%; and Denmark 8%.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has recently published an Infection Control Plan including governance and performance management, clear outcome targets for all hospitals, clear hygiene and infection control standards, an improved physical environment, initiatives on reducing antibiotics and education of the public and of health professionals.</p>
            <p eId="para_4965">The HSE has agreed as a matter of priority to implement this plan so that patients can be assured that their chances of contracting an infection will be at the lowest level possible.  There must be a corporate commitment throughout the HSE, and health services generally, evidence-based guidelines, clear responsibility and accountability and a full recognition that patients and their families have a definite role to play in preventing HCAI.  My Department will be closely monitoring and evaluating the progress made by the HSE in the management and control of HCAI and MRSA.</p>
            <p eId="para_4966">In regard to patient safety, I established the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance last January.  A key objective of the Commission is to develop clear and practical recommendations to ensure that quality and safety of care for patients is paramount within the health care system.  The Commission is chaired by Dr. Deirdre Madden BL and will report back to me within 18 months.</p>

            <p eId="para_4986">The Government is firmly committed to the development of an Irish biofuels market and to the increased development of bio-energy generally in Ireland. A range of initiatives is in place to support the development of a biofuels sector in Ireland. The Minister for Finance has made it clear that any extension in the amount of relief which formed part of the Budget 2006 announcement is not envisaged at this stage citing non-fiscal measures that can be used to promote Biofuels. In this regard on 12th February I signalled my intention to introduce a Biofuels Obligation by 2009, which will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales.</p>
            <p eId="para_4987">In announcing the obligation, I have also committed to achieving 5.75% market penetration of biofuels by 2009, in advance of the date proposed for such a target in the EU Biofuels Directive. I have also committed to achieving 10% market penetration of biofuels in Ireland by 2020.  The introduction of the Biofuels Obligation will build on the success of the two biofuels excise relief schemes which were rolled out in 2005 and 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_4988">On 4 March I published the Bioenergy Action Plan which sets out a series of cross-Governmental and inter-agency actions to support the deployment of bio-energy in Ireland. In formulating the plan, it was agreed that while excise relief is an effective short-term measure to stimulate the biofuels market, other policy initiatives, such as a renewables obligation, would be beneficial in the longer-term. The obligation will also give all market players the necessary long-term certainty to make appropriate investment decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4989">The Bioenergy Action Plan also provides a series of measures aimed at encouraging farmers to grow energy crops.</p>
            <p eId="para_4990">The move to a biofuels obligation, together with the relevant agricultural incentives will provide new opportunities for the farming community to diversify into energy crops. I am confident that this will facilitate increased participation by growers in the emerging bio-energy market.</p>

The study is addressing the nature and extent of erosion and flooding at various locations and different types of coastline in Ireland and is seeking to identify the most effective means, technically, financially and environmentally, in responding to particular instances and types of erosion and flooding. It is expected that when this study is completed a more targeted approach to programme delivery will result and will enable a greater level of efficiency to be achieved.</p>

The proposal involves an offer from the marina developer to accommodate small boats/punts on the inside of the new marina and building a new floating berth to accommodate other fishing boats such as chartered angling boats. The proposal caters for all types of boats other than fixed keel yachts. The marina developer stated at the December meeting that marina berths would be available for fixed keel yachts at the normal berthing rates.</p>

            <p eId="para_5167">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.</p>
            <p eId="para_5168">The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit in the regions by building high-speed, open access, carrier neutral Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase One of this Programme has so far delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country. This Programme has been extended to more than 90 additional towns nationwide and these MANs are due for completion during 2007 and 2008. These Metropolitan Area Networks will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5169">Complementary to the MAN networks, the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) has funded over 120 projects specifically aimed at smaller communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5170">However, despite Government and private investment in broadband I am aware that there are still some parts of the country, including areas in County Wexford where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. A Steering Group comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently finalising a proposed scheme which will address the question of availability of broadband to unserved areas. The National Broadband Scheme, when it is fully rolled out, will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in these unserved areas are met. Work on the design of an appropriate tender is under way. Indicative maps are being prepared to help inform the tendering process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5171">My Department's website www.broadband.gov.ie gives full details of broadband availability in all areas, including ADSL, cable, fibre, satellite and fixed wireless.

        <b>Mr. G. Mitchell</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</b>
         the cost of energy used running his Department in the year 2002; the cost of doing so in 2006; the quantity of energy used in each of these years to which this cost relates; and his plans to reduce this usage as a contribution to meeting concerns regarding climate change.

            <p eId="para_5175">The energy cost of running my Department in 2002 was €158,257, and in 2006 it was €574,160.  2002 was the year of a significant reorganisation of my Department's functions and divisions. For reference the energy cost for the Department in 2003 was €313,486. A considerable amount of responsibilities transferred into and out of the remit of the Department and this, allied to the fact the Department acquired additional accommodation in the interim, accounts for the significant variation in costs over the years in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_5176">In 2006 my Department launched the 'Power of One' campaign, which, while concentrating on domestic use in the initial stage, will target energy-using sectors including the Public Service. This campaign will build on the Office of Public Works' (OPW) initiatives in this field.</p>
            <p eId="para_5177">The OPW are rolling out a staff energy awareness pilot study in 15 large State buildings, which will act as a template for a major staff energy awareness campaign in all State buildings in early 2007. OPW are also installing Web based energy monitoring units in large State buildings, including those occupied by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_5654">Ireland, along with our European Union partners, monitors and regularly discusses with the Mexican authorities the human rights situation in Mexico and the fulfilment of their obligations under international law.</p>
            <p eId="para_5655">The European Union is committed to the respect of human rights, applying a positive and cooperative approach in relation to third countries in this regard. Since 2002, Mexico has been one of the focus countries for European Commission cooperation in the area of human rights through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR). The 2006 EU-Latin America and Caribbean Summit Declaration stressed that democracy, development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing, and are basic principles of the strategic bi-regional partnership.</p>
            <p eId="para_5656">The issue of Human Rights is one of the pillars of the EU-Mexico Association Agreement and such issues are regularly addressed in the context of the EU-Mexico Joint Committee. Both Mexico and EU Member States, including Ireland, are fully aware of the fundamental importance of respecting human rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_5657">However, while Mexico has taken significant steps in promoting respect for human rights, considerable challenges remain to be addressed, in particular at state level.

        <b>Mr. F. McGrath</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
         his views regarding President Uribe, Columbia and his relationship with paramilitary groups and the increasing arrests of Government employees and his political allies in Congress; and if he will support those in Columbia who are developing the peace process. 
        [9864/07]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_909">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_5731">I am aware that a number of arrests have been made in Colombia in connection with the alleged association of members of Congress and Government officials with paramilitary groups. Any association between elected representatives and officials and paramilitary groups is a matter of serious concern. I understand that the charges levelled at those allegedly involved are being taken forward through the appropriate judicial channels.</p>
            <p eId="para_5732">The Government of Colombia has repeatedly stated its commitment to bringing to an end all terrorism in Colombia within the framework of the Justice and Peace Law. This Law, passed in 2005, provides an overall legal framework for the demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of illegal armed groups into Colombian society.</p>
            <p eId="para_5733">Since the process of peace negotiations between the Colombian Government and the right-wing paramilitary group, Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC), began in 2003, between 30,000 and 40,000 combatants have been demobilized. The Government of Colombia is currently engaging in dialogue with the left-wing guerrilla group known as the Ejército de Liberación Nacional de Colombia (ELN) in pursuit of a negotiated peace agreement. Negotiations between the major left-wing guerrilla group, the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), and the Government have not yet commenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_5734">International support is crucial to underpinning the success of the peace process in Colombia at this critical political phase. In support of the peace process, Ireland, along with a number of other European Union Member States, has given financial support to initiatives aimed at ensuring the effective and transparent implementation of the Justice and Peace Law. Ireland undertook in June 2005 a commitment to contribute €390,000 over a three year period to the Organization of Ameri can States' Mission to Support the Peace Process in Colombia (OAS/MAPP). The mission's mandate is to provide comprehensive support to the Colombian peace process, with a focus both on the demobilisation process and on the strengthening of institutions concerned with the rule of law. In accordance with our commitment, Ireland has provided a total of €260,000 to the OAS mission to date, with the f inal tranche of €130,000 due to be made available later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5735">I also attach the highest priority to the humanitarian and human rights dimension of the OAS mission's role. With this in mind, an additional €130,000 was donated to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in December 2005 for the independent monitoring of human rights issues in support of the OAS mission. Following a review of the IACHR's progress report, a further €127,000 was provided in support of IACHR activities related to human rights aspects of the implementation of the Justice and Peace Law in late 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_5736">My Department continues to monitor the situation in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico City, which is accredited to Colombia, as well as in cooperation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country.</p>

            <p eId="para_5738">An application for a Certificat de Coutume, confirming that the person to whom the Deputy has referred is free to marry abroad, was received by the Department.  It is not possible to approve the application as the Department is not satisfied that the applicant's divorce would be recognised under Irish law and that, consequently, she would be free to marry again. While I have every sympathy with the plight of the applicant, the legal advice I have been given is that the requirement that the person's divorce be recognised under Irish law cannot be overlooked.</p>
            <p eId="para_5739">The Department has written to the applicant, explaining why her application cannot be approved on the basis of the documentation submitted, and suggesting that she seek independent legal advice with a view to obtaining a declaration from the courts in accordance with Section 29 of the Family Law Act, 1995 in relation to the recognition of her divorce under Irish law. I can assure the Deputy that if the necessary declaration is obtained; the Department will issue a Certificat de Coutume in this case and will do so as a matter of urgency.</p>

            <p eId="para_5757">The Irish Sports Council was set up as a statutory body in July 1999 with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards.

            <p eId="para_5758">The Sports Council provides funding to recognised National Governing Bodies (NGBs) including the Irish Canoe Union (ICU).

            <p eId="para_5759">Since 1999, the ICU has received almost €4.5 million in funding from the Irish Sports Council with grants of €686,107 in 2007.  Of the money allocated to the ICU in 2007, €345,000 was specifically targeted at high performance and €94,000 under the International Carding Scheme, which provides direct support in terms of grant-aid and indirect support in terms of sport science and medical backup to elite and top aspiring athletes.</p>

        <b>Mr. Carey</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</b>
         his plans to introduce a scheme of grants which would assist with the refurbishment of privately owned swimming pools such as a pool (details supplied) in Dublin 11; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5762">The Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, which is administered by my Department provides grant aid to local authorities towards the capital costs of a new or replacement public swimming pool or the refurbishment of an existing pool.  The programme provides for a maximum grant level of 80% of eligible costs (90% in the case of disadvantaged areas) subject to a maximum of €3.8 million.  Where a project is being undertaken by an organisation other than a local authority, the proposal must be considered, supported and submitted by the relevant local authority.  Before supporting a project, the local authority would have to be satisfied that the proposal is viable, that the balance of funding required to complete the project is available and that the project, when completed, would have a suitable level of public access.  Under the current round of the programme, swimming pools within the education sector are not eligible.</p>
            <p eId="para_5763">The Programme is currently closed to new applications.  The closing date for receipt of applications under the current round of the programme was 31 July 2000.  The Department is completing an Expenditure Review of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme at present.  The Review is examining, among other things, how the programme has worked to date and what changes, if any, are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery.  The Review is currently being finalised and it is hoped that it will be completed shortly.  Following consideration of the recommendations in the review it is my intention to launch a new round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.  If the Programme is re-opened, it will be open to all local authorities to submit applications under the terms that will apply.I will also consider the question of allowing swimming pools traditionally regarded as being within the education sector, such as St. Vincent's Glasnevin  to apply for grant aid on the grounds of significant public access at that stage.</p>

I must inform the Deputy, however, that no application was received in the name of the organisation in question.</p>

            <p eId="para_6493">As my Department was not established until mid 2002 the costs  of energy used in 2002 are not comparable with the costs incurred in 2006. Furthermore, in 2002, the National Museum of Ireland, the National Library of Ireland and the National Archives were an integral part of the Department and their energy costs were paid from the same subhead as those of the core Department. In 2006 the National Museum and Library were separate legal entities, with responsibility for all their own costs, having been established as statutory bodies in May 2005. It is not possible to separate out the costs in 2002 for the two bodies in the time available.</p>
            <p eId="para_6494">My core Department has offices located at 23 Kildare Street, Dublin 2 and Frederick Building, South Frederick Street, Dublin 2 but is not the main tenant in either building. The utility bills for the Kildare Street building are in the name of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The utility bills for Frederick Building are in the name of the Department of Foreign Affairs. In each case my Department pays an agreed percentage of the utility bills corresponding to the amount of floor space occupied. The cost is paid directly to the main tenant and not to the energy supplier. In 2006, a sum of  €13,964 was paid to the Department of Foreign Affairs and a sum of  €13,218 to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in respect of electricity charges.  My Department shares the cost of central heating with the Houses of the Oireachtas and some other Government Departments on a pro rata basis.  This cost amounted to €24,693 in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_6495">My Department opened new temporary decentralised premises in Fossa, Co Kerry on the 4th of September 2006. New accounts were opened at this time with the ESB and Calor Teoranta.  At the end of 2006, a sum of  €8,225 was paid to ESB and €844 to Calor Teoranta.</p>
            <p eId="para_6496">The National Archives, which is part of my Department, has accounts with the ESB and Bord Gáis.  In 2006 an amount of €93,529 was paid to the ESB while an amount of  €33,510 was paid to Bord Gáis.</p>
            <p eId="para_6497">I am very conscious of the need to conserve energy and to keep costs at a reasonable level. Data relating to the quantity of energy consumed was not kept up to 2006 but such records are being kept for 2007. Furthermore, the question of energy conservation was discussed at a recent meeting of my Department's Partnership Committee and a sub-committee has been established to consider the matter and to make recommendations.</p>

            <p eId="para_6598">The Deputy will be aware that animal health and welfare is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  Equestrian sports funded by the Irish Sports Council are subject to these animal health and welfare requirements and to the rules and regulations of the national and international federations responsible for the various disciplines involved.  Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon are the statutory bodies responsible for the horse and greyhound racing industries respectively.  I have been assured by both bodies that there is appropriate veterinary support at all race meetings.</p>
            <p eId="para_6599">While the Irish Coursing Club, which is the controlling authority for the breeding and coursing of greyhounds, subject to the general control and direction of Bord na gCon, does not receive funding from my Department or Bord na gCon for coursing, my Department oversees a Monitoring Committee on coursing.  This committee comprises of a veterinary inspector, representatives of the National Parks and Wildlife Service now part of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Irish Coursing Club. The veterinary inspector attends 20% of all coursing meetings on behalf of the Department. Wildlife Rangers from the National Parks and Wildlife Services attend approximately 50% of coursing meetings. The Monitoring Committee meets annually — usually in advance of the start of the coursing season and considers any issues arising from the previous season.</p>

            <p eId="para_6631">The Rights Commissioner Service operates as a service of the Labour Relations Commission.  The Labour Relations Commission is an independent statutory body.  It acts independently in the carrying out of its day-to-day functions and the Commission is solely responsible for the allocation of its resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_6632">The Labour Relations Commission has its headquarters in Dublin, but rights commissioners hear cases in all parts of the country.   Of the nine rights commissioners, two have been designated to hear cases in the Munster region.  One of these has been serving the Munster region since 1996 and the second was appointed in 2006.  Other rights commissioners hear cases in the Munster region as required.  It would not be practical to appoint a commissioner to deal with cases from just one county.</p>
            <p eId="para_6633">It is the stated commitment of the Labour Relations Commission to provide speedy arrangements for the adjudication and resolution of cases.  Delays in the processing of cases are regrettable and the Commission endeavours at all times to keep delays to a minimum.</p>
            <p eId="para_6634">Cases referred to a rights commissioner are normally dealt with within 6 months.  Cases that take nine months to be heard, as referred to in the Deputy's question, are rare and this extra delay would be the result of requests for adjournments by the employer or employee or other unique factors.  Significant additional resources have been allocated to the Rights Commissioner Service to assist it in dealing with its 6-month backlog of cases.  For example, the number of rights commissioners increased from six to eight in 2004 and a ninth rights commissioner was appointed in 2006.  This represents a 50% increase in the number of rights commissioners in the last 3 years.  The number of support staff also increased and significant financial resources were allocated to the development of a new case management system.  To ensure that the Commission can continue to deal with its increasing caseload, the Government has committed itself in Towards 2016 to the appointment of five additional rights commissioners, increasing, as necessary, in line with the commissioners' caseload.</p>

            <p eId="para_6638">IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions.  The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</p>
            <p eId="para_6639">In the period from March 2006 to March 2007, IDA Ireland has hosted a total of 8 site visits by potential investors to Counties Laois and Offaly, 7 of which were to Portlaoise while 1 was to Tullamore.  The visits to Portlaoise took place in May, July, September and October, 2006 and February, 2007 while the visit to Tullamore took place in March 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_6640">In line with the National Spatial Strategy (NSS), a key goal for IDA Ireland is the achievement of balanced regional development.  Counties Laois and Offaly form part of the IDA Midlands Region together with Counties, Longford, Westmeath and Roscommon.  The locations of emphasis for IDA in this region are the NSS Gateway towns of Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar.  In addition, the agency actively promotes the county towns of Portlaoise, Longford and Roscommon.  The region will also benefit from the ongoing investment in transport, energy and utilities set out in the new National Development Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_6641">IDA Ireland is actively marketing the Midlands Region through its network of overseas offices.  In addition, the agency is working closely with educational institutions in the Region, in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment.  The agency is also working with FAS to provide guidance in developing the skill sets needed by those already in the workforce who are interested in upskilling.</p>
            <p eId="para_6642">IDA Ireland has invested a considerable amount in the physical infrastructure required to attract today's FDI to the Midlands.  The agency has invested €3.2 m in the development of a flagship Business and Technology Park in Portlaoise and spent circa €3m in upgrading the IDA Srah Park in Tullamore to Business &amp; Technology Park standard. In this latter Park, the construction of a 465 sq. mtr. Advance Technology Unit has been completed and is currently being actively marketed by IDA, while a 2,415 sq. mtr. Advance Technology Building will be constructed during 2007.  Ultimately decisions regarding where to locate, including what sites to visit as potential locations are taken by the investor.</p>

            <p eId="para_6644">The facilitation of site visits by Enterprise Ireland is a day-to-day matter for the agency itself, and not one in which I am directly involved.  However, I understand that site visits from potential investors normally relate to projects which are mobile and, more often than not, are from overseas. The Enterprise Ireland portfolio of indigenous client companies is, of its nature, not very mobile, and therefore the number of such site visits arranged by E.I. only relates to a small number of companies. Most overseas site visits generated by Enterprise Ireland are primarily from companies operating in the natural resources sector and take into account their special location requirements such as to access to raw materials, infrastructure and skills needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_6645">EI facilitated three visits to Portlaoise in County Laois and one to Clara in County Offaly during 2006.  Enterprise Ireland provides an extensive range of supports such as strategy development, production and operations, marketing, human resource development, finance and research and development. These are available to all qualifying clients in counties Laois and Offaly. The preliminary Forfás Employment Survey for 2006 indicates that there are currently 132 plants employing 3,833 people in Laois and Offaly.</p>

            <p eId="para_6652">At the end of 2006, there were a total of 2,022 people working in 13 IDA supported companies in County Wexford, a slight increase on the figures for 2005.  The County has a strong base of manufacturing companies, with the majority performing well in a challenging environment.  IDA Ireland continues to be actively engaged with its existing base of manufacturing companies in Wexford, highlighting the importance of upskilling and the need to add high-value activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_6653">Over the last number of years IDA Ireland has been actively working to attract overseas companies in newer high-value sectors to Wexford and the profile of clients has been changing with Lake Region and Waters Corporation (Medical Technologies) and PFPC and Equifax (International Services) now firmly established in the county.  The agency is committed to continue marketing Wexford as a location for knowledge-intensive industries.  In addition, the agency is actively working with local partners such as Wexford County Council, Wexford Chamber of Commerce and the Wexford campus of Carlow Institute of Technology to develop the necessary infrastructure to attract industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_6763">I have noted the contents of the letter referred to in the Deputy's question.  I understand that statutory redundancy entitlements have been paid to the workers in the factory named in the letter.  Additional ex gratia payments are a matter for negotiation between the company concerned and the workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_6764">The State has established a number of institutions, including the Labour Court, to assist in the resolution of trade disputes between employers and workers such as the ongoing dispute in this case. The Labour Court conducts hearings on trade disputes and then issues recommendations setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it should be settled.  However, the system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature.  The law on industrial relations disputes does not generally seek to impose a solution on the parties to a dispute but rather seeks to assist them in arriving at a solution.  The Labour Court cannot compel a company to comply with its recommendations.  As it is a Court of last resort in the industrial relations process, it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to give serious consideration to the Court's recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_6765">Recommendations of the Labour Court are not legally binding, however, and ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties to the dispute.</p>

In order to accommodate staff who wish to move earlier than the projected building completion date of late 2009, officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units, are progressing an earlier move to Carlow.

            <p eId="para_7454">The back to education allowance or BTEA is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.</p>
            <p eId="para_7455">To qualify for participation in the BTEA scheme an applicant must be, inter alia, in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, in the case of people wishing to complete a second level course, or twelve months in the case of people wishing to pursue third level qualifications.  The twelve month requirement is reduced to nine in the case of people who wish to attend a third level course and who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan process.</p>
            <p eId="para_7456">In 2002 the Government appointed an independent Estimates Review Committee to consider the Estimates proposals received in the Department of Finance from Departments and Offices.  In its report to Government that Committee recommended discontinuation of the practice of paying the back to education allowance over the summer period to people who were formerly on the live register.  The Committee concluded that people on the scheme during the academic year should be able to take up paid employment during the summer break.  If they could not find employment, they would be entitled to jobseekers allowance or jobseekers benefit, subject to satisfying the usual conditions and, therefore, no hardship would occur.</p>
            <p eId="para_7457">Payment is made under the scheme for the duration of the academic year in the case of people on unemployment payments prior to taking up this scheme. People in this situation may qualify for unemployment payments during the holiday period. It is important that the resources available under the scheme are directed at the most vulnerable in society.  I will continue to monitor the scheme but I believe that, overall, the current arrangements ensure that my Department's back to education allowance scheme continues to support effectively those people who are most distant from the labour market.</p>

            <p eId="para_7459">The supplementary  welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on behalf of my Department by the Health Service Executive and  provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible persons in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_7460">The Executive has advised that the weekly rate of €65 rent supplement in payment to the person concerned since 4th September, 2006, is the maximum rate of supplement appropriate to his circumstances, having regard to the level of rent in his case.  When previously living at another address, a higher rate of rent supplement was in payment to the person because a higher level of rent was charged at that address. He received two payments of €130, one in September 2006 and the other in December 2006.  These were fortnightly payments comprising 2 weekly payments of rent supplement of €65.</p>

            <p eId="para_7463">The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, which is administered by the Community Welfare Division of the Health Service Executive (HSE), is designed to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. Under the legislation governing the scheme, the Health Service Executive (HSE) may make an exceptional needs payment to people on social welfare or health board payments. This is a once-off payment to meet an unforeseen or special need that cannot be met from a person's basic income.</p>
            <p eId="para_7464">Assistance in the form of an Urgent Needs Payment (UNP) can be also made to persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA, to assist, for example in cases of flood damage, with immediate needs, such as food, clothing, fuel, household goods and perhaps shelter. Assistance can be provided in cash or in kind.</p>
            <p eId="para_7465">My Department's response to the recent flooding primarily involved supporting the community welfare service in the provision of ENP and UNP funding in the short term and other supports where applicable to cater for the long term effects of the flooding. Support given relates to damage to a person's home or loss of essential items. It does not extend to business or commercial losses.</p>
            <p eId="para_7466">My Department, working through the HSE, has a role in providing immediate humanitarian aid in response to serious flooding incidents. It has no role in providing compensation for losses arising from such incidents. Local community welfare officers are available to provide assistance on an individual basis where that is warranted. If any person is experiencing hardship as a result of the recent flooding, they should contact their local Community Welfare Officer in the first instance.</p>

            <p eId="para_7469">The policy of the Government over the past number of years has been to substantially increase the amount spent on child benefit for all families.  Commitment to this policy is reflected in the significant resources invested in the scheme since 2001, increasing monthly payments to €160.00 for each of the first two children and €195.00 for the third and subsequent children from April 2007.

            <p eId="para_7473">I propose to take Questions Nos. 591 and 600 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7474">In the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2007, which is currently before the Oireachtas, I have provided for new arrangements whereby people in receipt of a social welfare payment, who are also providing full time care and attention, will be able to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which will be equivalent to a half rate carer's allowance.  A person currently in receipt of a carer's allowance, who may have an underlying entitlement to another social welfare payment, will be able to transfer to that payment and receive up to a half rate carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_7475">These new arrangements will apply to almost all weekly social welfare payments including state pension contributory and non-contributory and to people in receipt of qualified adult allowances.  Recipients of jobseeker's allowance or benefit will not be eligible for the new arrangements, given the nature of these payments.   This is in line with the arrangements which currently apply to receipt of the respite care grant. It is estimated that approximately 18,000 carers will benefit from this measure at cost of some €57 million in a full year.</p>
            <p eId="para_7476">There are significant administrative issues which must be addressed before such a reform can be implemented.   The new arrangements will apply from September 2007 and financial provision has been made on that basis.  In Budget 2007 I increased the rates of carer's allowance so that the maximum rate for a person aged under 66 is now €200 per week, while the maximum rate for a person aged over 66 in receipt of carer's allowance is higher at €218 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_7477">Towards 2016 commits the Government to continuing to review the scope for further development of the carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant.  I am committed to working for, and with, carers to deliver increased benefits, supports, and services for them and their families.</p>

            <p eId="para_7479">In 2006, I announced a wide range of important reforms for non-contributory pensioners in conjunction with the introduction of the State Pension (non-contributory).  As part of these reforms, I also announced a specific additional disregard of €100 per week where the pensioner and/or spouse is in employment.  This new disregard allows a State Pensioner to earn additional income through employment without effecting their full pension entitlements.  It is intended to facilitate non-contributory pensioners who wish to continue working, or to re-enter the workforce.   In Budget 2007, I decided to further increase the disregard to €200 per week, effective from last January.   The earnings disregard is now equivalent to €10,400 a year.</p>

            <p eId="para_7488">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to the introduction of a scheme of all-Ireland free travel for pensioners resident in all parts of the island of Ireland. I have recently announced the implementation of the all-Ireland free travel scheme commencing from April 2 which will enable pensioners resident here and in Northern Ireland to travel free of charge on all eligible transport services on the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_7489">The scheme will extend the existing cross-border free travel arrangements by allowing pensioners over the age of 66 and resident here to travel free of charge on all bus and rail services in Northern Ireland. Likewise, pensioners in Northern Ireland will travel free of charge on transport services in this State.</p>
            <p eId="para_7490">The All-Ireland Free Travel scheme is based on the criteria for entitlement to free travel North and South for pensioners over 66 and applies only to this category. Some 600,000 customers are in receipt of free travel in the Republic of Ireland, of which 430,000 are aged over 66 years. The balance of 170,000 free travel recipients are under the age of 66 and so do not qualify for the new scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7491">The extension of the scheme to an all Ireland free service for over 66s represents a significant expansion in travel opportunities. I will continue to examine any opportunities to further improve and expand on what will, from April 2nd, be a very comprehensive, seamless free travel scheme. Any such additional developments would have to be worked out in conjunction with the authorities in Northern Ireland.  The existing cross-border free travel scheme, introduced in July 1995, continues to apply to all Free Travel Pass holders, to enable them make journeys from a point in the Republic of Ireland to a destination in Northern Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_7493">The back to education allowance (BTEA) is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.  It is essentially a social welfare replacement income which is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7494">Eligibility to participate in the scheme is dependent on the applicant being in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period of time and satisfying a lower age condition prior to commencing an approved course of education.</p>
            <p eId="para_7495">To qualify for participation an applicant must, inter alia, be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment and at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study.  Persons in receipt of disability related payments may access the scheme at 18 years of age.  Similarly, lone parents and persons in receipt of unemployment payments can qualify at 18 years of age provided they are out of formal education for at least 2 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_7496">The eligibility criteria for participation in the scheme are considered reasonable and targeted in order to ensure that resources reach those most in need of support.  If a person is in receipt of BTEA prior to reaching pension age, the annual cost of education allowance, which is currently €400, continues in payment beyond pension age during the remainder of the course of study.</p>
            <p eId="para_7497">I will continue to monitor the scheme but overall it appears that, the current arrangements ensure that my Department's back to education allowance scheme continues to support those people who are most distant from the labour market and whose need is greatest.</p>

            <p eId="para_7507">Supply contracts for my Department's electricity, gas and oil requirements are negotiated by the Office of Public Works (OPW) through the Government Supplies Agency.  The total energy cost in 2002 amounted to €1,518,923.  The total energy cost in 2006 amounted to €2,715,144.  Figures in relation to the exact quantities of energy that these figures represent are not readily available.</p>
            <p eId="para_7508">While overall responsibility for technical matters and energy audits are a matter for the OPW, the Department is conscious of the need to reduce energy usage, both for economic and environmental reasons.  In this context, last month, in conjunction with the OPW, a pilot energy audit and conservation programme commenced at five of the Department's offices.  OPW estimates that this will achieve a reduction of 10% in energy usage and it is intended to extend the project to cover all of the Department's offices.</p>

            <p eId="para_7729">The administration of the Family and Community Services Resource Centre (FRC) Programme is one of the key functions of the Family Support Agency.  The aim of the FRC Programme is essentially to help combat disadvantage by improving the function of the family unit.  FRCs empower disadvantaged people by involving them in decisions which affect them and in using and developing their own skills, knowledge and experience.  The centres focus on developing the skill levels and capacities of their local communities, including training for voluntary management committees, to encourage communities to become self reliant and self directed.</p>
            <p eId="para_7730">The emphasis is on the involvement of local communities in developing approaches to tackle the problems they face and on creating successful partnerships between the voluntary and statutory agencies in the areas concerned.  The services provided and activities supported by the resource centres are designed to meet the needs of the local community and include the provision of training, information, advice and support to target groups and families in the area; the provision of education courses, child care facilities to those attending such courses and the running of after-school clubs.</p>
            <p eId="para_7731">Priority in funding is given to centres which serve those areas where communities are contending with multiple disadvantages and where families are facing significant challenges in trying to rear their children and securing positive futures for them.  Family Resource Centres are an example of the kind of community initiative which the Government is keen to develop, focusing as they do on family support and social inclusion.  For this reason I am pleased to say that the target set by the Government under the 2000-2006 National Development Plan of including 100 Family Resource Centres in the FRC Programme nationwide by the end of 2006 has been fully achieved.  Funding under the programme has increased substantially from €317,500 in 1994 to over €18.8 million in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_7732">The Family Support Agency received an application for inclusion in the FRC programme on 6 March 2007 from a group from the Moneymore area of Drogheda, County Louth.  The National Development Plan (NDP) 2007-2013 has provided funding for the expansion of the Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme over the lifetime of the plan.  Funding has been received for six new centres in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_7733">At present the Family Support Agency has 20 applications on hand seeking inclusion in the programme and as only six new centres can be included this year, some applications will not be successful in 2007.  This application will be considered under the relevant criteria of the scheme and a decision made in due course.  This is the first application that has been received by the Family Support Agency from a group in County Louth seeking inclusion in the programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_7735">The living alone increase is an additional payment of €7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone.  It is also available to people who are under 66 years of age who are living alone and who receive payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes.  The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_7736">The policy in relation to support for pensioners has been, for many years, to give priority to increasing the personal rates of pension rather than focusing on payments such as the living alone increase.  This approach ensures that resources are used to improve the position of all pensioners and is subject to regular review.  It was decided in the context of budget 2007 to continue this policy with maximum increases of €16 and €18 per week granted on personal rates giving a maximum rate of the State pension (contributory) of €209.30 per week and a maximum non-contributory pension of €200 per week.  Taking account of the increases in the budget, since 1996 pensions have increased by almost 119% or about 57% in real terms.</p>

            <p eId="para_7738">The national fuel scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive (HSE) payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season and adjoining months.  Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April and are included in the recipient's weekly payment during this period.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.</p>
            <p eId="para_7739">The fuel allowance scheme has been improved and expanded over recent years.  The range of improvements made to the scheme include an easing of the means test, extending the duration of payment from 26 to 29 weeks and an increase of €5 in the rate of payment in the 2006 budget.  In budget 2007, I provided for a number of further improvements in the fuel allowance scheme.  These comprise an increase in the weekly rate of fuel allowance of €4 from €14 to €18 (€21.90 in designated smokeless areas) and an increase in the income threshold for eligibility to fuel allowance by €49 from €51 to €100 above the State pension (contributory) rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_7740">Some 274,000 people benefited from the fuel allowance in 2006 at an estimated annual cost of some €125 million.  As a consequence of the increase in rate and the increase in the income threshold for eligibility as announced in the recent Budget, annual expenditure on the scheme in 2007 will increase by an estimated €36.4 million.  The total annual cost in 2007 is estimated at over €161 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_7741">Fuel allowances are incorporated in the recipient's weekly social welfare payment.  The Government's objective is to ensure that the recipient's total weekly income, including the fuel allowance, is sufficient to meet all of their income needs, including heating costs.   Budget resources are concentrated on providing significant real increases over and above inflation each year in all primary social welfare pension, benefit and assistance rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_7742">The increases of €16 and €18 per week in the rates of payment for contributory and non-contributory pensions respectively announced in the recent budget are a continuation of this policy.  This approach delivers a better outcome for pensioners and others by substantially increasing their income in real terms over the whole year, to better assist them in meeting their normal basic living costs, including heating.</p>
            <p eId="para_7743">Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs.  If a recipient of a social welfare or Health Service Executive payment has exceptional heating costs due to ill health, infirmity or a medical condition which he/she is unable to meet out of household income, it is open to him/her to apply to the local community welfare officer for a special heating supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7744">Any further extensions or improvements to the fuel allowance scheme would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in a budget context and in the light of the resources available for improvements in social welfare generally.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_7748">I propose to take Questions Nos. 607 to 609, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7749">Occupational pensions schemes in Ireland are organised on a trust basis and trustees are required to, at all times, act in the best interests of the scheme members.  The operation of pensions schemes is governed by the provisions of the Pensions Act 1990 which specifies that the trustees must provide for the proper investment of the resources of the scheme in accordance with the rules of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7750">Usually trustees can, and do, delegate the actual conduct of the scheme's investments to a professional investment manager.  Nevertheless, the responsibility for monitoring the conduct of the investment manager and the performance of the assets rest finally with the trustees.  More recently, Ireland implemented the EU Directive 2003/41/EC on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision (IORPS), which sets out a framework for the operation and supervision of occupational pension schemes in all EU Member States.  In relation to investment, the directive establishes the "prudent person approach" as the underlying principle for investment.  This principle was already firmly established in Ireland under law.</p>
            <p eId="para_7751">The Occupational Pension Schemes (Investment) Regulations (SI 294 of 2006), which were signed into law pursuant to the implementation of the IORPs Directive, lay down the investment principles of that Directive.  Article 5 of the regulations requires that trustees of pension schemes, with 100 members or more, prepare a statement of investment policy principles (SIPP).  The information required in a SIPP includes investment objectives, investment risk measurement methods, risk management processes used, and the strategic asset allocation implemented with respect to the nature and duration of pension liabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_7752">The investment regulations also specify the investment duties of trustees of pension schemes in detail.  For all schemes, other than one-member arrangements, the regulations stipulate that pension scheme assets must be invested in a way which ensures security, quality, liquidity and profitability of the portfolio as a whole, so far as is appropriate, having regard to the nature and duration of the expected liabilities of the scheme.  The regulations require that the funds of a pension scheme must be invested predominantly in regulated markets (EU or otherwise) and be properly diversified in order to avoid risk to the whole portfolio.</p>

            <p eId="para_7765">Entitlement to a widow's or widower's pension depends, in the first instance, on the status in law of the relationship between the parties prior to the death of one of them. If the parties, at the date of death, were married within the meaning of the laws of the State, then the survivor of that marriage is a widow or widower for the purposes of the social welfare legislation relating to widow's and widower's pensions. However, a marriage that consists of a church ceremony only does not constitute a legal marriage under the laws of the State. The survivor of that relationship is therefore not regarded as a widow/er of the deceased and it is therefore not considered appropriate to extend the widow's or widower's pension to a person in this situation. The position will be kept under review in the context of any change in the general laws of the State in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_7767">My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all of its customers.  Applications are processed and decisions on entitlement are issued as quickly as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_7768">Most claims for State Pension Transition (SPT) and State Pension Contributory (SCP) are paid within four weeks of the person reaching pension age.  However, there have been some delays in processing claims in recent months, due to a number of factors.  There has been an increase in the numbers of new claims being received, an unusually high level of staff turnover in the office in Sligo and some delays of a temporary nature arose following the implementation of a new program to upgrade the Pension computer system associated with changes in work organization.  This is a multi-annual programme involving business, organizational and computer technology changes, with the long-term aim of improving service to customers across all the Departments schemes, increasing efficiency and enhancing controls.</p>
            <p eId="para_7769">At present there are some 12,000 new claims for SPT and SPC at various stages of processing of which some 2,500 have not yet been examined.  Some 3,700 claims are in the process for one-three months, 2,400 for four-six months and 3,300 for over six months.  In general, further information, such as documentation, insurance contribution history etc is required from the customer or a third party before these claims can be decided.</p>
            <p eId="para_7770">The periods for which a claim is in process is not indicative of delays in receiving payment, as many customers apply for their pension in advance of reaching pension age.  The target times set by my Department for processing SPT/C new claims are as follows: State Pension Transition, 80% within five weeks; and State Pension Contributory, 55% within six weeks.  These targets, which were set some number of years ago are based on lower average claim loads than are currently being experienced.  While the targets are not currently being met, action is being taken to ensure that improvements in claim processing times will be attained in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_7771">A number of initiatives are currently under way to improve processing times for new claims.  Claims where the person is close to or has passed his or her 65th/66th birthday are prioritised.  Staff are redeployed to focus resources on the areas where there are delays and overtime is employed where necessary.  Temporary staff are also being deployed to assist with the work.  Progress is being made in dealing with the claims backlog and it is expected that processing times for new claims will continue to improve.</p>

            <p eId="para_7794">The back to education programmes operated by my Department take cognisance of the fact that the more structured full-time second or third level courses of study that are approved under the back to education allowance scheme may not suit people who have been out of the education system for some time.</p>
            <p eId="para_7795">In recognition of this, in Budget 2007, I extended the €32 weekly out of pocket expenses payment to people in receipt of certain social welfare payments who agree to attend specified short-term courses of education, training or development that are organised by my Department's Facilitators.  A broad range of courses may be pursued, including personal development courses, basic education e.g. literacy and numeracy classes, general training courses and the acquisition of specific job skills.  The out of pocket expenses is a payment towards costs i.e. meal and travel, that persons may incur as a result of participation in one of these courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_7796">The number of people who attended courses of education, training and development and who availed of out of pocket expenses in the year ending December 2006 was 490.  Unlike the other options within the back to education programmes, applicants for out of pocket expenses do not have to satisfy any specific eligibility criteria other than be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment.  Currently, the relevant social welfare payments that qualify are job-seekers allowance, job-seekers benefit and one parent family payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_7797">I have extended this provision to a wider range of other social welfare recipients including farm assist, deserted wife's allowance, deserted wife's benefit, widow's/widower's contributory and non-contributory pension, prisoners wife's allowance, disability allowance, illness benefit, invalidity pension, blind pension, incapacity supplement, carer's allowance and the qualified adult dependant increase for a person in receipt of one of the aforementioned relevant payments.  The qualified adult dependant of a person in receipt of job-seekers allowance or job-seekers benefit can also avail of this provision.  This change will come into effect from May this year.</p>

A facility for persons with a hearing disability, who wish to telephone my Department, is in operation on a trial basis in the Disability Allowance section since October 2006.  This facility can be used to communicate directly with customers with compatible equipment using a standard telephone line.  It allows the caller to type in a message that is then transmitted to the receiver's display screen, with messages being relayed back in the same manner.  This service will be monitored and if successful will be made available in due course in other offices.</p>

            <p eId="para_7806">I propose to take Questions Nos. 624 and 640 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7807">I refer to my reply to question 8659/07 on 6 March 2007.  The Department of Transport has recently funded a scheme to convert 50 selected vehicles to run on pure plant oil (PPO), which is being carried out under the aegis of the German-Irish Chamber of Industry and Commerce.  The cost to the Department is €227,000 and provides for 75% of the cost of engine modification.</p>
            <p eId="para_7808">Decisions about successful applications are being made in April with the view to obtaining a diverse mix of transport operators.  It is expected that this scheme will be complementary to the Minerals Oil Tax Relief (MOTR) Scheme II, which aims to place 163 million litres of biofuels on the market at a cost of €200 million, and will help develop a sustainable indigenous network of localized PPO supply chains in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_7809">However, this scheme does not apply to private cars as it is targeted at hauliers or captive fleets maintained by local authorities or public organizations.  In Budget 2006, the Minister for Finance provided for a 50% VRT relief on flexi-fuelled vehicles (FFV), which are capable of operating on 85% blend, for 2006 and 2007.  In addition, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (DCMNR) announced obligatory 5% fuel blending by 2009, which will help to achieve the indicative target of 5.75% set out in the Biofuels Directive 2003/30/EC.</p>

            <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_7811">The focus of the penalty points system is on driver behaviour that impacts on road safety.  The only parking offence that is included in the system is the serious offence of dangerous parking.  It is considered that it would not be appropriate to extend the system to include drivers who illegally park in a disabled persons parking bay.</p>
            <p eId="para_7812">A number of measures have already been initiated on other fronts to impose a deterrent against such illegal parking, for example, last year I prescribed a fixed charge of €80 to apply to illegal parking in a disabled person's designated parking space from 3 April 2006.  The amount of the fixed charge increases by 50% to €120 if it is not paid within 28 days.  This level of fixed charge is double the level that applies to any other illegal parking offence.  If no payment is received within that 56-day period, a court prosecution is initiated.  Where a person does not pay the charge is subsequently convicted in court of the said offence he or she is liable to a fine.</p>
            <p eId="para_7813">Provision was made in the Road Traffic Act 2006 to increase the level of maximum monetary fine that a court can impose in respect of a range of offences.  I made a Commencement Order earlier this month in relation to that statutory provision and, as a result, a person convicted of illegal parking is liable, from 5 March 2007, to receive a fine not exceeding €1,000 for a first offence, a fine not exceeding €2,000 for a second or subsequent offence and in the case of a third or subsequent offence committed within a twelve month period, a fine up to €2,000 and/or a prison sentence of up to 3 months.  The level of fine to be imposed in any instance is at the discretion of the court.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
            <p eId="para_7815">There is no EU Directive on the manning of regular passenger and ferry services operating between member states, in force or being considered by member states.  If the Commission were to initiate a proposal it would be given careful consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_7816">In 1998 there was an EU Commission proposal: Commission communication on a common policy on manning of regular passenger and ferry services operating in and between Member States (COM/98/0251).  A key provision of the Commission's draft Directive was its Article 2.2: ‘If the vessel used is not registered in a Member State, the terms and conditions referred to shall be those applicable to the residents of one of the Member States between whose ports the service is provided and with which the service has the closest connection. The closest connection shall be determined on the basis of the place from which the service is effectively managed.'</p>
            <p eId="para_7817">The European Parliament approved the proposal in March 1999.  The Commission issued a revised proposal in 2000 (COM/2000/0437).  However, no final agreement was reached in the Council of Ministers in the matter, and the Commission formally withdrew the proposal in August 2004.  At the time the proposal was being considered, Ireland was concerned about the economics of providing ferry services for peripheral Community regions, particularly at off-peak seasons.  We were also concerned that the Commission's proposals excluded non-ferry vessels in direct competition with ferries, since freight traffic is now of more importance for jumbo ferry operations than the transport of passengers and their cars.</p>
            <p eId="para_7818">To facilitate consideration of the matter, Ireland was in favour of a study being undertaken to determine the implications of the proposals for peripheral Community regions.</p>

Subsequently, one of these runways was constructed to a length of 8,650 feet and opened for use in 1989.

            <p eId="para_7839">A copy of the report, which will be published on my Department's website,  has been issued to the Deputy on 12 March 2007.  This study was commissioned in March 2002, in relation to the feasibility of a ferry service linking Achill Island with the Erris Peninsula.  It was carried out by Tourism and Transport Consult International and the final cost of the study was €46,355.</p>
            <p eId="para_7840">The study found little evidence to support such a ferry service in terms of demand.  It found that the project would be non-viable without financial support for acquisition and for ongoing running costs.  The estimated overall cost of the project was between two and three million euro initially, with an annual operating cost of €455,000.  I have no plans to review the issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_8059">I am very pleased to say that I recently approved Exchequer grant aid amounting to €6.3 million for Galway Regional Airport under the Transport 21 capital expenditure grant scheme for the six regional airports which was launched by my Department last year.  The allocation for Galway includes €2.8 million in respect of projects aimed at providing enhanced levels of safety and security and a sum of €3.5 million for developmental works, subject to agreement with the airport on specific projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_8060">The approved allocations under the scheme followed a rigorous appraisal and prioritisation of the submissions received from all of the regional airports which was carried out with the assistance of expert advisers.  I believe that the financial assistance approved under the new scheme will enhance the potential of Galway Airport to attract inward investment and generate additional tourism business, thus boosting the contribution it makes to the development of its catchment area.</p>

            <p eId="para_8062">The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997 empower local authorities, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disabled Drivers Association, to grant a disabled person's parking permit to a person who is suffering from a disability that is of a nature that prevents him or her from walking or causes undue hardship to the person in walking.</p>
            <p eId="para_8063">A review of all aspects of the disabled person's parking permit is still ongoing in my Department.  The progress made to date has been in the area of strengthening the enforcement provisions. The first step to address this is through amendments made in the Road Traffic Act 2004 to strengthen the on-street enforcement against illegal use of permits.</p>
            <p eId="para_8064">Secondly, the fixed charge system that was introduced in April 2006 applies a level of fixed charge in respect of illegal parking in a designated disabled persons parking bay that is double the fixed charge that applies to any other illegal parking offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_8065">Thirdly, significant amendments were also made in section 20 of the Road Traffic Act 2006 in relation to the making of a false declaration in the application for a permit and in relation to forgery, alteration or other illegal use or lending of a permit. The 2006 Act also provided for increased maximum fines that the courts may impose on those convicted of offences, including illegal parking.  The latter provision was commenced earlier this month.  Further new legislative provisions in relation to the inspection of permits and the detention of permits that are invalid or being used illegally are being progressed at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_8066">Now that so much progress has been made in relation to enforcement and safeguarding against illegal use of permits, the next step is to complete the review in relation to eligibility for issue of a permit and it is intended that this process will be completed this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_8072">Last Thursday, March 15th, my colleague Pat the Cope Gallagher, T.D., Minister of State in my Department, announced his approval of the introduction by Bus Éireann of a number of new services and re-routing of existing services to serve Ireland West Airport Knock.</p>
            <p eId="para_8073">The Airport currently has a Bus Éireann air coach service to Charlestown, Co. Mayo which was launched in June 2004. The newly approved Bus Éireann routes via Ireland West Airport Knock include enhancing the existing Galway to Derry service to operate seven services Galway/Derry and six services Derry/Galway daily, all of which would operate via Ireland West Airport Knock.  Two new daily return services from Sligo will be introduced along with one additional daily return service from Sligo to Galway that will operate via Ireland West Airport Knock.  There will also be a daily 6.00am service from Letterkenny to Galway via the airport, and one daily return service from Westport.</p>
            <p eId="para_8074">In addition, this Government has provided substantial funds to improve road transport infrastructure in the region of Ireland West Airport since coming into office.   The 16km Knock-Claremorris scheme on the N17 was completed in 2002. The 8 km N5 Strokestown-Longford scheme was completed in 2004.  Phase one of the N26 Ballina-Bohola scheme (5km) was completed in December 2004.  The 18 km Charlestown Bypass, which joins onto the Swinford bypass, is due for completion this time next year. Under Transport 21, the Government also proposes the re-opening of the Western Rail Corridor from Ennis to Claremorris, providing additional opportunities for public transport linkage to Ireland West Airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_8075">Further improvements are planned under the National Development Plan 2007 – 2013, including significant funding for roads which serve the airports main catchment area including bypasses for Tuam and Claregalway and phase 2 of the N26 Ballina to Bohola scheme (18 km) which is at final design stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_8091">Arising from the joint ministerial initiative on the review of local and community development structures, the Government agreed a series of measures in January 2004 designed to improve arrangements under which community and local development initiatives are delivered.  The Deputy will be aware that the key principles governing the process are:</p>
            <p eId="para_8092">improving on the ground services, supports and impacts on local communities, from within existing levels of resources,</p>
            <p eId="para_8093">streamlining and rationalising structures so as to avoid overlaps, duplication and undue administrative overheads,</p>
            <p eId="para_8094">bringing transparency, co-ordination and improved control to the funding and operation of local/community development measures,</p>
            <p eId="para_8095">strengthening the democratic accountability of agencies and service providers in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_8096">The core objective of the cohesion process is the alignment of local, community and rural development structures to achieve full coverage within a given area. The intention is, that in 2007, there will be one company delivering services in any given area and fewer companies overall in the country.    This will lead to improved co-ordination of service delivery and maximise the impact of both rural development and social inclusion measures at a local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_8097">I believe that we are pursuing a proven model in that area already.  There are currently 12 LEADER/Partnership groups that deliver, inter alia, both local and rural development programmes in a way that respects the distinct ethos of the respective programmes.  This integrated model is being extended to all local development bodies in rural areas this year.  I will shortly be introducing new requirements in regard to the constitution, mandate and governance of these bodies.  These procedures will maintain the parity of esteem between rural development and social inclusion programmes and ensure that the scope for new synergies between these programmes is optimised.</p>

            <p eId="para_9096">At this stage of the year it is difficult to predict the final planting rate for 2007 but provision has been made in my Department's Estimates for 10,000 hectares of new planting.  An enhanced package is available this year, including increased grants and premiums, and a new Forest Environment Protection Scheme (FEPS) which provides an added incentive to REPS farmers to plant part of their land.</p>
            <p eId="para_9097">It is important that existing plantations be maintained if the optimum return is to be achieved. There are a number of controls in place to ensure that, where a plantation has been established with the help of grant-aid from my Department, it is properly maintained in subsequent years. Various incentives are also available to encourage proper management of the woodland resource.  Some of the key controls and incentives are as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_9098">25% of the establishment grant is only paid 4 years after the initial planting and when my Department is satisfied that the plantation has been successfully established.</p>
            <p eId="para_9099">Other inspections at later dates for premium purposes provide further information on the status of plantations.</p>
            <p eId="para_9100">10 years after planting a management plan is required by my Department which adds to the information on the status of the plantations and provides a secure basis for future maintenance.</p>
            <p eId="para_9101">My Department also operates schemes aimed at further developing the woodland resource e.g. pruning and shaping; forest road grants etc, and has encouraged initiatives from the sector in this area, such as the development of a thinning protocol for private plantations, which was published last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_9102">Teagasc and COFORD run courses and seminars in this area every year, dealing with particular aspects of forest management and promoting best practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_9103">In relation to markets, timber prices are currently good, particularly for large saw log.  Prices for small material have not increased pro rata but I would expect them to increase in line with the expected increase in demand for bio fuels.</p>

I agree that the inspection requirements linked to cross-compliance are complex and I am committed to negotiating significant changes in the context of the simplification exercise, which is currently underway in the Commission.  I think it needs to be made clear however that the inspection checklist on cross-compliance is not a document for completion by the farmer but is for the inspector of my own Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_9135">It is important also to bear in mind that the controls under the various direct payment schemes are set out in EU Regulations. Failure to ensure a satisfactory control environment leaves a member State open to serious financial penalty — a fact that cannot be lightly dismissed given the magnitude of annual payments of  €1.9 billion to Irish farmers under the Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and REPS. Nonetheless, I believe that the cross-compliance inspection requirements are overly demanding on farmers. It is my clearly held view that some practical amendments can be secured without in any way undermining the objectives of cross-compliance or putting accountability in the disbursement of EU and national funds at risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_9136">As I have made clear already, I have raised my concerns about the Single Payment Scheme — particularly the inspection arrangements and the need for advance notice  — with Commissioner Fischer Boel on a number of occasions. I have also discussed the problems with Minister Seehofer, the German President of the Agriculture Council and I am assured of his commitment to dealing with the issues over the next few months.</p>
            <p eId="para_9137">The Commission is at an advanced stage in finalising a review document on cross-compliance. I expect this to be cleared through the Commission before the end of March and it will then go to the Agriculture Council for discussion in April. With the commitment of the Presidency to progressing the dossier speedily, I am hopeful that changes can be agreed in time to apply to the 2007 inspection arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_9138">In tandem with this, my Department is carrying out a full review of the inspection arrangements and checklists for the Single Payment Scheme with a view to simplification of the arrangements (including paperwork) where possible while, at the same time, ensuring compliance with the regulatory requirements. The review of the inspection report forms together with the outcome of the Commission's review of the cross-compliance arrangements generally, will be fully discussed with the farming organisations before the Single Payment Scheme inspections for 2007 get under way.</p>

In exceptional circumstances, where farmers face severe financial difficulties, the Commission may, taking account of the budgetary situation, authorise advance payments of up to 50% prior to 1 December. In 2006 the Commission, following representations from me, agreed to allow an advance payment of 50% on 16th October. Commencing on 1st December balancing payments were issued to farmers.</p>

In the wake of MBM being banned as an animal feed, and in line with the practice across most EU Member States, the Exchequer supported the livestock and meat sectors by subsidizing the disposal of MBM for a period.  The costs of dealing with MBM have since been passed back to industry.   During that period, my Department established and chaired an Interdepartmental Committee on possible uses of MBM, the conclusion of which was that its most suitable use would be in energy co-generation and cement production area.</p>

            <p eId="para_9202">The Government is open to proposals to expand the REFIT (Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff) Scheme, as necessary, to facilitate the delivery of co-firing in peat stations of 30% by 2015. The REFIT Scheme was launched in 2006 as a new renewable energy support mechanism, to provide a fixed feed-in-tariff mechanism for electricity produced from renewable energy sources at new electricity generating stations. The guaranteed prices allow project developers to attract investors or access bank debt to source and fund the required capital investments.</p>

            <p eId="para_9217">Category B caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000- 2002. Investments can include purchase or long term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments in buildings etc leading to an increase in production.</p>
            <p eId="para_9218">The person named applied under Category B(iv) (investment in buildings).  He was deemed unsuccessful as the investment made did  not result in an increase in production for which a direct payment under the Livestock and/or Arable Aid Schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002.  The evidence provided suggested that the investment in question related to the provisions of a slurry tank and cattle crush which are not deemed as a qualifying investment.  A formal letter outlining my Department's decision issued to the person named.</p>
            <p eId="para_9219">The person named subsequently appealed this decision.    In all such cases, the procedure is that all contentions put forward in support of an appeal are first of all reviewed within my Department to see whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant any change to the original decision. In this case the documentation was examined by my Department but did not provide grounds for a change to the original decision. This process took some time to complete.  The case has since been forwarded to the Independent Single Payments Appeals Committee for their consideration.  The case is scheduled to be presented for decision at the Single Payment Appeals Committee meeting on the 5th April 2007.  The Committee will correspond directly with the person named following the outcome of their review.</p>

In general this condition can be satisfied by submitting a copy of the Land Registry Folio showing registered commonage shares, or copy of Land Registry Folio showing grazing rights held, Land Commission Vesting Order, certified copy of relevant estate papers from Land Commission records, grant by the freehold legal owner, grazing trust deed, or grant of deed by the original estate landlord.</p>

Any such affidavit shall be accompanied by a map of the Commonage, showing the total area, and documentation showing that the deponents have made every reasonable effort to establish a definitive list of shareholders relative to the entire area to which the affidavit refers.</p>

            <p eId="para_9524">The position is that the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme and my Department's commitment in the Charter of Rights for farmers to ensure maximum integration of inspections has resulted in a drop in annual on-farm inspection levels from 18,000 under the coupled regime to less than 8,000 in 2006. I agree that the inspection requirements linked to cross-compliance are complex and I am committed to negotiating significant changes in the context of the simplification exercise, which is currently underway in the Commission.  I think it needs to be made clear however that the inspection checklist on cross-compliance is not a document for completion by the farmer but for completion by my Department's inspector.</p>
            <p eId="para_9525">It is important also to bear in mind that the controls under the various direct payment schemes are set out in EU Regulations. Failure to ensure a satisfactory control environment leaves a member State open to serious financial penalty — a fact that cannot be lightly dismissed given the magnitude of annual payments of  €1.9 billion to Irish farmers under the Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and REPS. Nonetheless, I believe that the cross-compliance inspection requirements are overly demanding on farmers. It is my clearly held view that some practical amendments can be secured without in any way undermining the objectives of cross-compliance or putting accountability in the disbursement of EU and national funds at risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_9526">As I have made clear already, I have raised my concerns about the Single Payment Scheme — particularly the inspection arrangements and the need for advance notice  — with Commissioner Fischer Boel on a number of occasions. I have also discussed the problems with Minister Seehofer, the German President of the Agriculture Council and I am assured of his commitment to dealing with the issues over the next few months.</p>
            <p eId="para_9527">The Commission is at an advanced stage in finalising a review document on cross-compliance. I expect this to be cleared through the Commission before the end of March and it will then go to the Agriculture Council for discussion in April. With the commitment of the Presidency to progressing the dossier speedily, I am hopeful that changes can be agreed in time to apply to the 2007 inspection arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_9528">In tandem with this, my Department is carrying out a full review of the inspection arrangements and checklists for the Single Payment Scheme with a view to simplification of the arrangements (including paperwork) where possible while, at the same time, ensuring compliance with the regulatory requirements. The review of the inspection report forms together with the outcome of the Commission's review of the cross-compliance arrangements generally, will be fully discussed with the farming organisations before the Single Payment Scheme inspections for 2007 get underway.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_9530">The policy towards on-farm inspection has been to give advance notification of up to 48 hours in all cases. This policy of systematic pre-announcement of inspections was questioned by the European Commission in July 2006 and its unacceptability was conveyed to my Department in a formal communication in August.  As a result my Department was obliged to agree to a proportion of Single Payment Scheme inspections being carried out in 2006 without prior notification.  Some 650 farms out of 130,000 involved in the Single Payment Scheme were subsequently selected for unannounced inspection.  The balance of inspection cases, representing some 92% of the 7,514 farms selected for Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme inspection in 2006, were all pre-notified to the farmer.</p>
            <p eId="para_9531">The EU regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme would allow my Department to give pre-notification of inspection in all cases where certain elements of cross-compliance are involved e.g. the Nitrates Regulations.  However, my Department is committed, in the Charter of Rights for Farmers 2005-2007 to carrying out all Single Payment Scheme and Disadvantaged Area Scheme checks during one single farm visit in most cases.  This then obliges my Department to respect the advance notice requirements applicable to the most stringent element of the inspection regime viz. maximum of 48 hours notice but with no advance notice in a proportion of cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_9532">My Department believes that pre-notification of Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme inspections fits in with the practicalities of Irish agriculture where increasingly, farmers are also engaged in off-farm employment.  In a decoupled Single Payment Scheme system, the provision of advance notification of inspection to the farmer should not negatively impact on the effectiveness of the control.  However, as the EU regulations stand, my Department is obliged to carry out a proportion of inspections without prior notification and this is what was done in 2006.  My Department is seeking authority to allow advance notification in all inspection cases and I will continue to press this point in the CAP simplification process.</p>
            <p eId="para_9533">The Commission is at an advanced stage in finalising a review document on cross-compliance.  The review will include the question of advance notice of inspections. In tandem with this, my Department is carrying out a full review of the inspection arrangements and checklists for the Single Payment Scheme with a view to simplification of the arrangements (including paperwork) where possible while, at the same time, ensuring compliance with the regulatory requirements. The review of the inspection report forms together with the outcome of the Commission's review of the cross-compliance arrangements generally, will be fully discussed with the farming organisations before the Single Payment Scheme inspections for 2007 get underway.</p>

            <p eId="para_9537">The position is that my Department, in the context of delivering the Single Payment Scheme, is required to carry out on-the-spot inspections on a number of farms covering such issues as eligibility under the Scheme, compliance with EU legislation in the areas of the environment, food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health and ensuring that the farm is maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition (GAEC).</p>
            <p eId="para_9538">A minimum of 5% of Single Payment Scheme applicants are required to be inspected under the eligibility rule.  Up to two-thirds of these inspections are carried out without a farm visit and using the technique of remote sensing.</p>
            <p eId="para_9539">The rate of on-farm inspection required for cross-compliance is 1% of those farmers to whom the Statutory Management Requirements (including the Nitrates Directive) or GAEC apply. However at least 5% of producers must be inspected under the Bovine Animal Identification and Registration requirements as this level is prescribed under the relevant Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_9540">The position is that under the Charter of Rights for Farmers, my Department is committed to ensuring the maximum level of integration of inspections across all areas including inspections under the Single Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme. This integration means that control checks are carried out in relation to eligibility of land declared, identification and registration of animals on the holding, and compliance with the other 18 Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) under cross-compliance in one farm visit. On this basis, the overall number of annual inspections associated with the Single Payment Scheme is unlikely to exceed 7,200. This is a very significant reduction from the 18,000 inspections annually under the old coupled regime.</p>
            <p eId="para_9541">This approach minimises the level of inconvenience to farmers.  However, because of the integration of all inspections associated with the Single Payment Scheme, it is not possible to prescribe specific time limits for the completion of such inspections as the number of issues to be checked varies from farm to farm.</p>

Accordingly I do not have the discretion to raise this age threshold as I would wish to do in view of the major progress achieved here in relation to BSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_9544">I have been making repeated efforts to have the age thresholds for the various categories of animals changed, based on the results of surveillance carried out here.  Under the recently amended TSE regulation there is provision for a revision to Member States' monitoring programmes (including changes to the age at which healthy slaughtered animals for human consumption must be tested for BSE) on the basis of applications by Member States in response to their improved BSE situation.  Such applications will have to be assessed according to criteria for evaluating the improvement of the epidemiological situation that have yet to be laid down. The matter is currently under discussion at TSE working group level in Brussels and will take some time to finalise.</p>
            <p eId="para_9545">Any request for such changes would require to be approved by the European Commission and the other Member States within the framework of the Standing Committee on Animal Health and the Food Chain. I will, of course continue to press for a change in the age threshold at every opportunity.</p>

            <p eId="para_9547">The 30-day pre-movement test was introduced in 1998 to curtail the spread of Brucellosis following an upsurge in the disease. A range of other measures was also introduced in the late 1990s with the same objective.  These included the early removal of reactors, the rapid depopulation of herds, the taking of blood samples from cows at slaughter plants, the Milk Ring Test (MRT) (subsequently replaced by the Milk ELISA test), and the lime treatment of slurry on infected farms on all Brucellosis depopulated farms.</p>
            <p eId="para_9548">The veterinary advice at the time, which continues to apply, was that the movement/buying-in of cattle was a major contributory factor in the spread of the disease and the 30 day test has contributed significantly to the effort in reducing the incidence of the disease, particularly in that it reduces the movement of brucellosis susceptible animals.</p>
            <p eId="para_9549">The impact of these measures has been very positive and very substantial progress has been made since 1998 in reducing disease levels.   While there has been a significant reduction in the incidence of Brucellosis, we cannot become complacent about this highly contagious disease and the essential elements of the programme must be retained for the time being. Otherwise, we run the risk of losing the progress made in recent years. I am however keeping the various control measures under review taking account of the current low disease levels and the risks involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_9551">Under the EU Directive 64/432/EEC, which sets down the rules for trade in live animals, the testing requirements for TB in the case of Member States which have disease levels similar to Ireland are that all animals over 6 weeks of age being moved out of a holding or other land must be from a clear herd and must have a valid TB test which, in general, means that the animal has been tested during the 12 months immediately preceding the date of movement. There are no proposals at EU level to change these rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_9552">The 12 month testing regime forms part of our overall national strategy for the eradication of TB, which provides for a comprehensive range of measures, including the early removal of reactors, a wildlife programme involving the targeted removal of badgers where they are implicated in a TB outbreak, the use of the gamma Interferon test in problem herds as an adjunct to the tuberculin test and the depopulation of infected herds where the level or duration of infection indicates that this is necessary to clear the herd and/or protect the neighbourhood.</p>

            <p eId="para_9637">The Indemnity Agreement concluded between the State and religious congregations in June 2002 provided a fund of €12.7 million for educational programmes for former residents of institutions and their families. Pending the establishment of this fund on a statutory basis, my Department introduced an ad-hoc grants scheme, which was administered by the National Office for Victims of Abuse (NOVA) between 2003 and 2006. Some €2.5 million was paid in education grants under this scheme to former residents and their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_9638">The scheme was put on a statutory basis last year following the establishment of the Education Finance Board under the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Act 2005. The Board was formally established on 17th February 2006 and I appointed Mr Dick Langford, former CEO of City Of Cork VEC, as Chairperson along with eight other Board members, four of whom are former residents.</p>
            <p eId="para_9639">After deducting some €2.5 million expenditure incurred under the ad-hoc scheme and allowing for interest of €0.75 million accruing on the €12.7 million fund, the Board had a net fund of almost €11 million at its disposal on establishment. This fund is being managed by the National Treasury Management Agency and monies are drawn down from the fund to meet the ongoing costs of the Board in administering the grants scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_9640">The functions of the Education Finance Board are laid down in Section 25 of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Act 2005. The principal functions are:</p>
            <p eId="para_9641">to pay grants to former residents of institutions and their relatives to assist them in availing of educational services</p>
            <p eId="para_9642">to determine and publish the criteria by reference to which it will make decisions on applications for the payment of such grants, and</p>
            <p eId="para_9643">to provide information in relation to educational services in respect of which grants are payable.</p>
            <p eId="para_9644">In November 2006, the Board published new criteria for the provision of grants to former residents and their families. Eligible claimants can obtain grant assistance to support themselves in both formal and non-formal educational and personal development activities.  While the level of grant payable in each case will depend on the particular educational service being accessed, it will be possible for a former resident to receive up to €12,500 overall in assistance and for eligible family members to receive up to a further €12,500 in aggregate. The Adult Education Guidance service, located throughout the country, is available to eligible applicants to assist them in exploring possible educational/personal development opportunities under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_9645">The Board's offices are located at Frederick Court, 24/27 North Frederick Street, Dublin.

            <p eId="para_9664">An approved third level course for the purpose of the HEG and the VEC Scholarship Schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration and a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year's duration pursued in an approved institution. The Schemes outline the respective courses which are approved for grant purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_9665">In addition, my Department allocates funding each year to third level institutions under the Student Assistance Fund. This fund is available in order to assist students who may be experiencing difficulties in continuing their studies because of financial hardship. The disbursement of this funding is a matter for individual institutions in line with guidelines issued by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_9666">My Department has no plans to introduce an additional scheme of financial assistance, over and above the current provision, in relation to the training of teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_9667">However, my Department reviews the amount of grant payable under the schemes each year, taking into account the cost of living index and related factors.</p>

            <p eId="para_9669">The Schools Broadband Programme provides broadband internet access to Primary and Post Primary schools and includes Content Filtering as an integral part of the service. The Content Filtering service is designed to control the level of access from schools, via the broadband network, to the wider internet. It does this by categorising websites under various categories and providing content filtering ‘options' to schools which allow or block a combination of these website categories. Based on information and advice provided by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE), the schools themselves decide on which content filtering option is most appropriate to school needs and confirm this to the NCTE. This option is then set up for the school. Currently two options have been implemented for schools. However, this may change based on the feedback from schools and responding to schools requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_9670">No school is connected to the internet via the schools broadband network unless it has confirmed in writing: a) an Internet Acceptable Usage Policy in place and b) its Content Filtering option to the NCTE. Content Filtering is a technology based service that assists in the management of websites for schools. Along with education/awareness and supervision it forms the basis of implementing a safe environment for pupils in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_9671">The NCTE actively provides support and guidelines to schools regarding the use of the Information and Communication Technologies. Through its internet safety initiative the NCTE launched the "Webwise" website (www.webwise.ie), which creates awareness about new technologies and possible risks associated with their use by young people. The site offers advice and guidance to schools, pupils and parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_9672">The Internet Advisory Board is also working in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_9709">Under the provisions of the Education Act 1998 and the regulations of the Department of Education and Science, the Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school.</p>
            <p eId="para_9710">It is important that the management authorities of primary and post-primary schools request parents to ensure that the school is made aware of any medical condition suffered by any pupil attending. Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more pupils, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with the parents, teachers and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a pupil suffers from an illness requiring medication, that appropriate treatment is available. As the Deputy may be aware, the administration of medicines in the school is the subject of an agreement between the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the organisations representing school management at primary level. While this agreement specifies that no teacher can be required to administer medicine or drugs to pupils, it also sets out procedures that must be followed where a teacher or teachers agree to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_9711">It is my Department's experience that once the matter has been discussed in detail with the Board of Management and teachers of a school, and once all parties are clear as to the procedures to be followed, arrangements can normally be made to administer the type of medicine which may be required.</p>

In view of same,  I announced on the 17 February 2007, that a new additional model of Primary school patronage would be introduced on a pilot basis at a school to be built in Diswellstown, Co Dublin.  The proposed school will be community based and that the administrative framework of the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee would be used for the new model. The Department will begin a process of consultation with the relevant education partners to explore the detailed implementation measures that will be needed  to be put in place prior to the opening of the proposed new school.  This model will provide an additional patronage option and is not intended to serve as a replacement of the existing patron models.</p>

The development of proposals under this fund is now being advanced.  It is intended that this targeted fund will be linked with a Modular Accreditation Programme (MAP) which being developed by the Higher Education Authority. Modularisation is a key factor in higher education institutions meeting the education needs of part-time students with work commitments. Substantial progress has been made in developing the MAP and it is intended to bring forward proposals in relation to the targeted fund provided under Towards 2016 in the near future.</p>

While a forum has not been established, my Department hosted a conference on "Developing an Overall Strategic Approach to Disability in Further Education" in November 2006.

            <p eId="para_9748">The school in question has 22.5 hours under the general allocation system to provide for the educational needs of the pupils with high incidence special needs and those with learning support needs, such as the pupil in question. It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support. The school can use its professional judgement to decide how these hours are divided among the pupils in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met. As the pupil in question is within the high incidence disability category this pupil's needs should be catered for within the general allocation granted to the school.</p>

            <p eId="para_9785">Catchment boundaries have their origins in the establishment of free post-primary education in the late 1960's and were determined following consultation with local educational interests. For planning purposes the country was divided into geographic districts each with several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools. The intention was and continues to be that these defined districts facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_9786">A number of reviews have been carried out over the years where, for example, a new post-primary school is established in an area where previously there was none or, conversely, where a "sole provider" school closes due to declining enrolments. The Area Development Planning initiative, involving an extensive consultative process carried out by the Commission on School Accommodation, will also inform future revisions to catchment areas. An Area Development Plan takes account of demographic changes and projects future enrolments for existing schools and new schools if required. Catchment boundary changes will be made where the implementation of the recommendations in an Area Development Plan requires such adjustments.</p>
            <p eId="para_9787">Under the terms of my Department's Post Primary School Transport Scheme pupils who are eligible for transport to the education centre in the catchment area in which they reside may avail of ‘catchment boundary' transport to an education centre in another catchment area provided spare seats are available on the school bus. Eligibility for school transport is not determined by way of subject choice. In the circumstances, it is not proposed to change the catchment boundary in question.</p>

            <p eId="para_9813">An application was received in the Department, under the Small Schools Scheme 2007, from the school referred to by the Deputy. On 5 March 2007, I announced details of the schools to receive funding under this Scheme. Due to the volume of applications received in the Department it was not possible to allocate funding to all proposed projects and the school referred to by the Deputy was not successful in this instance. However, it is open to the school authority to apply for funding under the 2008 scheme, details of which will be announced later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_9834">I propose to take Questions Nos. 798 to 800, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_9835">Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now 5,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc. Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school. Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_9836">As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher. School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment).</p>
            <p eId="para_9837">In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum. A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06. The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_9838">About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes. I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_9846">The Deputy will be aware that all primary and post- primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>
            <p eId="para_9847">NEPS operates a regionally based service with eight regional directorates each responsible for the primary and post-primary schools within that region. Additionally each region bears national responsibility for specific cross-cutting operational areas within the organisation (e.g. Special Education Liaison, Litigation, Research, etc.).  NEPS service coverage within each regional is therefore governed by number of NEPS psychologists assigned, the number of schools in that region and the specific national responsibilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_9848">I can inform the Deputy that there has recently been some reordering of national responsibilities in the Eastern Regional Area, which includes parts of South Dublin and Co. Wicklow, which has resulted in some changes in school coverage from 1 March last. In addition a number of schools designated under the DEIS scheme not heretofore assigned to a NEPS psychologist were so assigned in this period. I attach for your information a list of schools in this region setting the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> NEPS service and an additional listing for the schools whose position has changed in this regard following this reorganisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_9849">I reiterate that schools which do not have a NEPs psychologist assigned to them have access to the SCPA process to service their assessment needs. In addition to psychological assessment NEPS provides assistance to all schools and school communities that experience critical incidents regardless of whether or not they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them and processes applications for Reasonable Accommodation in Certificate Examinations.  NEPS also provides a service to children with visual impairment irrespective of the school which they attend. Nonetheless should any school, not receiving coverage under the NEPS service have particular difficulties in accessing assessment I would advise that they contact the relevant NEPs Regional Director to discuss their issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_9850">Finally you will be aware that I have, building on the existing complement of 127 NEPS psychologists, announced an increase of 31 posts in 2007 of NEPS psychologist staff.  My Department is currently in discussions with the Public Appointments Service in an effort to recruiting of these individuals as soon as possible in this regard. It is envisaged that these appointments will allow for further expansion of coverage by NEPS psychologists across all regions. Additionally under the Towards 2016 Agreement commitments I have further announced that Neps psychologist number shall expand by some 35 posts in the following two years.</p>

            <p eId="para_11898">The school referred to by the Deputy has been approved for grant aid under the Small schools Scheme.  The purpose of this Scheme is to empower schools to carry out refurbishment/ extension works with minimum interaction with my Department. I do not propose to comment on the level of grant-aid approved for individual schools as to do so might compromise the tender process. Devolving funding to school management authorities allows them to have control of their projects, assists in moving projects more quickly to tender and construction and can also deliver better value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_11899">The two Devolved Schemes, the Small Schools Scheme and the Permanent Accommodation Scheme, were originally introduced in 2003 on a pilot basis and due to the positive feedback from schools and were extended to cover more schools in subsequent years. The Schemes are not structured on the basis that the Department funding must be supplemented by local fund-raising. They do however allow a school to supplement the funding from local resources if they so wish. The critical element is that with devolved authority the school must set the scope of works to match the funding allocated. The Department does not define the precise works to be carried out. A school can make choices within the budget allocated.</p>
            <p eId="para_11900">Setting the scope of works is the critical first step. Clearly where a school has a known level of resources apart from the Department funding or knows its capacity to raise additional resources it is open to that school to extend the scope of works to include additional facilities. However if the scope of works is not set appropriately from the outset based on the budget available there is a risk that the school will be faced with a funding gap when the project is at construction. The choices to be made within these devolved schemes rest with the school and that is the cornerstone of any policy of devolution. The school authority knows the budget and must decide what it is capable of building with that budget. The time to identify a problem is at the outset before entering any contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_11901">Schools can raise with my Department any site specific problems or unusual planning stipulations that impose additional costs and these will be examined. Otherwise schools must reduce the scope of intended works so as to remain within budget. A school does not have to accept the invitation to participate in a devolved scheme and instead be considered for inclusion in the mainstream school building programme in line with the project's priority band rating. I increased funding for the schemes in 2006 by an average of 20% for the Permanent Accommodation Scheme and by an average of 10% for the Small Schools Scheme. These increases follow-on from increases of up to 25% in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_11902">The feedback has in general been very positive, the number of schools participating has increased year on year and many schools are anxious to be included. In order to maintain this momentum I recently approved over 250 additional schools to participate in these schemes in 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_11917">In 2004, my Department issued a Circular (M20/04) on Educational Tours both inside and outside the State to all second level schools. Authorisation to grant approval for educational tours by school groups was devolved to the school board of management subject to certain criteria including, consultation with parents and the provision of adequate insurance cover. The objective of an educational tour should be that it should provide a significant benefit in the educational, intellectual, cultural and social development of the maximum number of pupils in the particular grade(s) taking part in the tour and which benefit cannot be provided by in-school activities alone. Responsibility for the appropriate supervision of students on school tours is a matter for the Board of Management.  A "Tour Template" is included in the Circular which prompts the Board to consider issues relating to insurance, numbers of adults accompanying the students, parental permission etc.</p>

Schools are allowed to charge a booking fee when considering applicants for enrolment, provided this is refundable following a decision on enrolment.  Booking fees are sometimes required by schools in order to avoid "double booking" of pupils in schools that could result in the loss of teachers.</p>

            <p eId="para_12818">The home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to facilitate the provision of education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early intervention for pre-school children with autism.</p>

         asked the

         her view on the desirability of specialist schools with their own curriculum being established to cater to the needs of that particular nationality; the way these schools are treated in terms of teacher allocation and language support; if her Department sets requirements in relation to the integration of these curricula with mainstream education here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_12821">I have no plans for specialist schools for particular nationalities. The national curriculum is an important cornerstone of our Irish education system which ensures that all students are exposed to a broad and balanced curriculum which is based on international best practice. There is provision for exemptions from the study of Irish for students who entered education after 11 years of age from abroad and for pupils with certain categories of special need.</p>
            <p eId="para_12822">My Department provides additional supports to schools in respect of pupils with an English language deficit. Schools with 14 or more newcomer pupils who do not have English as a first language and who are eligible for language support because they fall below a certain proficiency level are allowed to appoint a language support teacher. A second teacher may be appointed when the numbers reach 28. In September of 2006, the limit of two was effectively lifted as the Department allowed schools with large numbers to appoint a third teacher. I recently announced the allocation of 200 extra language resource teachers to bring the number solely teaching English to newcomer children to 1,450 in the current school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_12823">With regard to pupils' mother tongue and culture supports, the Department provides funds towards local community based initiatives to support pupils' mother tongue and culture on a limited basis. Immigrant groups can apply to the Department for funding towards the promotion of their language and culture. Such support may take place on the school premises by local agreement outside of school hours, usually at weekends.</p>
            <p eId="para_12824">Integrate Ireland Language Training Ltd monitors the delivery of such programmes and co-ordinates requests for funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_12825">The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has produced guidelines for schools on best practice in the promotion of intercultural education.</p>
            <p eId="para_12826">Within the Leaving Certificate examination, a range of languages are offered as part of the national curriculum including Irish, English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Arabic, Russian and Japanese. In addition, the State Examinations Commission also provides examinations in subjects which are not part of the curriculum where this is requested for candidates who are</p>
            <p eId="para_12827">from a member state of the European Union</p>

            <p eId="para_12829">Have followed a programme of study leading to the Leaving Certificate. In addition, the language in question must be a national language of an EU state.</p>
            <p eId="para_12830">In addition to the above, since 2004, pupils for whom neither Irish nor English is their mother tongue, may use bilingual translation dictionaries in examinations other than in Irish, English or their mother tongue.</p>

            <p eId="para_12832">The issue of road safety measures outside the vested site areas of schools, such as road signage, traffic calming measures etc., would be a matter that should be raised in the first instance with the relevant Local Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_12833">Local Authorities have the power to decide on road safety measures outside schools and should ensure that measures are in place to protect the safety of local school children.</p>
            <p eId="para_12834">Individual school authorities are responsible in the first instance for health and safety issues within the school site. Primary school authorities may use their minor works grant to deal with urgent issues. In November last I increased funding for the minor works grant by 44% on the previous year and around €27m was paid out to primary schools throughout the country to enable thousands of small scale works to be completed without the need to interact with my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_12835">Other avenues for grant-aid from my Department to provide improved health and safety measures include the Summer Works Scheme and Emergency Works Grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_12836">In 2007, of the €306 million available to improve infrastructure in primary schools, close to €58 million is allocated to the Summer Works Scheme, involving over 790 individual projects at 640 schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_12837">The school in question should contact the School Building Section of my Department regarding any on site health and safety work requiring significant funding.</p>

            <p eId="para_12839">The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC.

        <b>Mr. Lowry</b>
         asked the

         the average mainstream class size per county according to the most recent census of schools available.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_12842">The information requested by the Deputy is included in the table.  Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_12843">There are now 5,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_12844">Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</p>
            <p eId="para_12845">Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_12846">As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_12847">School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</p>
            <p eId="para_12848">A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</p>
            <p eId="para_12849">The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_12850">I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</p>

            <p eId="para_12998">The home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.</p>
            <p eId="para_12999">In 2006 a review of a number of applications for home tuition highlighted some cause for concern regarding the qualifications of proposed tuition providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_13000">Nominated tuition providers with qualifications other than teaching qualifications were accepted for the first school term to allow time to undertake the review.</p>
            <p eId="para_13001">Following the review of qualifications, which took place in consultation with my Department's Inspectorate, an extended list of qualifications acceptable under the scheme has been published. This list is available on my Department's website.  Aside from recognised teaching qualifications such as the Bachelor in Education and approved Montessori training, the list includes certain qualifications in autism and in applied approaches to teaching children with autism, such as ABA, PECS and TEACH. Third level qualifications in relevant areas such as psychology may also be appropriate depending on circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_13002">In cases where the tuition provider was not approved subsequent to the review a direction was given to parents concerned to recruit a tuition provider with suitable qualifications. However my Department is prepared to facilitate parents/guardians who experience difficulties in recruiting a tuition provider with suitable qualifications by extending the sanction with the current tuition provider until the end of the 2006/07 school year to facilitate the recruitment process.  An extension in this regard has been granted to the tutor in question.</p>

            <p eId="para_13005">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_13006">According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 197 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which will be issued to all primary schools shortly, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year will be a Principal and 7 mainstream class teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_13007">Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_13008">It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. They are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department's website. Hard copies of this circular will issue to primary schools as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_13009">It is proposed that the first meeting of the Appeal Board will be held in May, 2007. Further meetings will be held in July and October, 2007. The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 11 May, 22 June and 12 October respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_13010">Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_13011">The Appeal Board operates independently of the Minister and my Department and its decision is final.</p>
            <p eId="para_13012">I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent Appeal Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_13013">In August 2006 the school authority was given approval to rent a 1 x 80m2 mainstream classroom to alleviate accommodation difficulties at the school.  Should the school require additional temporary classrooms they should be advised to complete an application form (Form RTA) which is available on my Department's website and submit it to the School Planning Section of my Department for consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_13018">I propose to take Questions Nos. 835, 880, 887 and 888 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_13019">The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) was established under the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act (EPSEN) to improve the delivery of education services to persons with special educational needs arising from disabilities with particular emphasis on children.</p>
            <p eId="para_13020">Since it was established in 2005 NCSE is responsible for allocating resources for children with special educational needs.  The Council has a key role in the delivery of services and operates through a network of special educational needs organisers (SENOs) who act as a focal point of contact for schools and parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_13021">A pilot scheme funded directly through my Department has facilitated the establishment a number of stand-alone autism units using the Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) methodology.  The unit referred to by the Deputy is participating in this scheme.  SENOs do however provide a service to parents of children attending such units as they can provide information to parents on a range of issues including appropriate educational placements available on completion of a period in the ABA units.</p>
            <p eId="para_13022">Research is definitive in supporting early educational intervention to reduce the impact of autism on some children.  It has been found that many very young children respond well to early intervention, can develop communication and social skills and can graduate to mainstream schools with or without additional teaching supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_13023">My Department provides for an extensive early educational intervention through the home tuition programme which is currently funding individual educational intervention for in excess of 250 children from 2 ½ years to 5.  Up to 3 years of age, a child is funded for ten hours per week early intervention home based programme.  This increases to 20 hours per week once the child is 3 years of age.  In addition, the Department has established 16 pre-schools for younger children with autism.</p>

            <p eId="para_13094">Special fees for repeat candidates were introduced in 1987 on the basis that it is not unreasonable to expect those who have already benefitted from the normal course of second level education, and who wish to take an extra year, to make a contribution towards the cost of providing the necessary resources.  A course fee is also payable in respect of such candidates.</p>

The costs associated with the certificate examinations have been spiralling in recent years due to the introduction of new methods of assessment in various subjects and to continuing increases in special arrangements for students with special needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_13113">Under the EOCP programme, close to €500 million has been expended on childcare and places created will be in the region of 41,000 by the time the programme has been exhausted.  Investment of €575 million under the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 aims to create an additional 50,000 places.  10,000 of these places will be for pre-school children.  In relation to my Department's involvement with the provision of pre-school and the numbers and percentage attending, the main areas of provision at the present time are for children with special needs and children from a disadvantaged setting.</p>
            <p eId="para_13114">The Early Start pre-school project operates in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage offering provision to some 1,680 children across Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk. My Department also funds 46 pre-schools for Traveller children, catering for approximately 500 pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_13115">In the special needs sector, there are currently 16 pre-school classes for children with autism located throughout the country.  In addition to this, 12 stand-alone autism facilities that provide an applied behavioural analysis (ABA) model of response to children with autism cater for a number of children of pre-school age.  My Department sanctions home tuition grants for children with autism who are of pre-school age and for whom a home educational programme is considered appropriate — grants for some 200 such children are currently in payment.</p>

            <p eId="para_13121">On the appointment of the 7th mainstream class teacher the Principal becomes an Administrative Principal and no consequential additional teaching post is warranted.</p>

If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</p>

Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made.

            <p eId="para_13137">To date, good progress has been made in Ireland to develop the guidance service in schools. The National Centre for Guidance in Education (NCGE) was established in 1995 as an advisory body to DES to assist in the development of policy and resource materials to support guidance delivery in schools, and to act as a centre for the exchange of guidance information and practice at national and international level.</p>
            <p eId="para_13138">Since 2001 a number of changes that effect guidance in schools have taken place. The NCGE issued a document entitled Planning a School Guidance Programme in 2004. In 2005, DES published Guidelines for Second Level School on the Implication of Section 9(c) of the Education Act 1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_13139">Guidance counsellors are professionally trained and schools are provided with an ex-quota allocation of hours for the provision of guidance. In 2005, a revised circular on guidance provision was issued to schools Guidance Provision in Second Level Schools (CL PPT 12/05), which granted most schools an improved ex-quota allocation. Guidance is well integrated into schools' provision of curricula and supports for students.</p>
            <p eId="para_13140">Grants are available towards the purchase cost of test materials for use in second level schools by qualified guidance counsellors and/or learning support teachers based on the criteria set out in Circular 0008/2007.  For the 2006/07 school year, schools with less than 350 students may draw down €150 towards the cost of these materials.  Schools with more than 350 students may draw down €250. Schools newly establishing a guidance/learning support service may draw down an additional €150 in the first year in which the grant is sought.  Prior to the current school year and the issuing of Circular 0008/2007, schools were entitled to draw down between a minimum of €25.39 and a maximum of €203.16.</p>

        [10164/07]

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_1223">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_13155">I am conscious of the fact that Lucan is one of the fastest growing areas in the Country. In light of this, the Department has expanded capacity significantly at both primary and post primary level to cater for existing and newly emerging demands for pupil places.</p>
            <p eId="para_13156">There are eleven primary schools in the Lucan area including two new state of the art multi-denominational schools and a new Gaelscoil which commenced operation in September 2005. These developments together with a number of extensions to existing schools, the provision of temporary accommodation and the re-organisation of one school to enable the enrolment of an additional two junior infant classes has increased capacity significantly in the area. In addition, Scoil Mhuire, Archbishop Ryan JNS, St Thomas NS and Scoil Aine were recently given approval to commence the architectural planning process for major extensions and are to receive design team appointments shortly. Through a combination of these measures, the School Planning Section of the Department is satisfied that, between them, the schools have adequate accommodation to cater for current demand. The Department continues to monitor school needs in the Lucan area.</p>
            <p eId="para_13157">With regard to post primary capacity specifically, a new school for Coláiste Cois Life was recently completed. This will provide places for 600 pupils, some 400 additional places relative to its then existing capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_13158">In addition to this, capacity at Coláiste Phádraig was increased by 300 pupil places with the completion of a major extension project at that school. A further extension project at St. Joseph's College was completed in 2004. This is deemed sufficient to meet demand from pupils in its catchment area. In addition, Lucan Community College is to receive a design team appointment shortly to provide additional accommodation to increase its overall capacity to 1000 pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_13159">The Deputy will probably be aware that there is considerable vacant capacity at post primary level in areas adjacent to Lucan.  Given that it is practice, particularly in Dublin, for post-primary students to travel some distance to attend a post-primary school, it is not unreasonable that the Department should seek to optimise the use of existing surplus capacity at post-primary schools in the general vicinity of Lucan as part of its strategy to address any shortfall for post- primary places that may emerge.</p>
            <p eId="para_13160">The Department will continue to monitor the situation in Lucan to ensure that any future emerging needs are addressed in a timely manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_13162">Primary schools' running costs are met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants.  These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools including general maintenance costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_13163">My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes.  One scheme is the 1978/79 scheme for the employment of full-time secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary.  This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.  This scheme has been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme now referred to as the Ancillary Services grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_13164">The Ancillary Services grant scheme provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services.  The scheme is flexible by nature, giving Boards of Management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_13165">There have been significant improvements in the level of funding provided to primary schools in recent years.  Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level has been increased from €57.14 to €163.58 per pupil.  In the same period the Ancillary Services grant has increased from €38.09 per pupil to €145.50 per pupil at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_13166">These significant increases in the funding of primary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of primary schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_13168">Under the provisions of the Education Act 1998, the Board of Management or Single Manager is charged with the direct governance of a school, including issues relating to health and safety.  In general, the board has the responsibility to ensure that the school operates efficiently and effectively and also has responsibilities in relation to the action of its employees.  The Manager must manage the staff in the school and intervene when it considers it necessary to resolve matters relating to the actions of its employees.

            <p eId="para_13172">The Schools Broadband Programme provides broadband internet access to Primary and Post Primary schools and includes Content Filtering as an integral part of the service.  The Content Filtering service is designed to control the level of access from schools, via the broadband network, to the wider internet.  It does this by categorising websites under various categories and providing content filtering ‘options' to schools which allow or block a combination of these website categories.  Based on information and advice provided by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE), the schools themselves decide on which content filtering option is most appropriate to school needs and confirm this to the NCTE.  This option is then set up for the school.  Currently two options have been implemented for schools.  However, this may change based on the feedback from schools and responding to schools requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_13173">No school is connected to the internet via the schools broadband network unless it has confirmed in writing: a) an Internet Acceptable Usage Policy in place and b) its Content Filtering option to the NCTE. Content Filtering is a technology based service that assists in the management of websites for schools.  Along with education/awareness and supervision it forms the basis of implementing a safe environment for pupils in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_13174">My Department, through the NCTE, actively provides support and guidelines to schools regarding Information and Communication Technologies and the possible risks associated with their use by young people.  Through its internet safety initiative the NCTE developed the "Webwise" website (www.webwise.ie).  The site offers advice and guidance to schools, pupils and parents.  The site has materials and resources to assist children to develop safe online skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_13175">I recently launched the new "think b4 u click" internet safety campaign. This campaign seeks to raise awareness and promote safe, responsible practice by young people when online.</p>
            <p eId="para_13176">The campaign has a strong peer-to-peer perspective and centres on an interactive online service, www.watchyourspace.ie, developed by the NCTE.  This site offers practical tips and advice and supports teenagers who use the web. A key feature is the advice given by teenagers to teenagers on how to cope with the fall-out from abuses and misuse of social networking and picture-sharing websites.  This new initiative compliments the other NCTE safety activities that are already up and running successfully such as Webwise, SAFT and the Once projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_13177">Watch Your Space has presentations of the key findings from studies of teenagers' use of the Internet by other teenagers.

            <p eId="para_13184">It is a fundamental principle of the Free Post-Primary Education Scheme that no charge is made in respect of: instruction in any subject of my Department's programme for Secondary Schools; recreation or study facilities where all the pupils are expected to avail themselves of these as part of the school programme; any other activities in which all pupils are required to take part.</p>
            <p eId="para_13185">Schools are allowed to charge a booking fee when considering new applicants for enrolment, provided this is refundable following a decision on enrolment.  Booking fees are sometimes required by schools in order to avoid "double booking" of pupils in schools which could result in the loss of teaching posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_13186">Voluntary contributions by parents or charges for optional extras over and above what is provided for in the general school programme are permissible under the scheme, provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay, and, that in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition.</p>

            <p eId="para_13197">Devolving funding to school management authorities allows them to have control of their projects, assists in moving projects more quickly to tender and construction and can also deliver better value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_13198">The two Devolved Schemes, the Small Schools Scheme and the Permanent Accommodation Scheme, were originally introduced in 2003 on a pilot basis and due to the positive feedback from schools and were extended to cover more schools in subsequent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_13199">The Schemes are not structured on the basis that the Department funding must be supplemented by local fundraising.  They do however allow a school to supplement the funding from local resources if they so wish.  The critical element is that with devolved authority the school must set the scope of works to match the funding allocated.  The Department does not define the precise works to be carried out.  A school can make choices within the budget allocated.</p>
            <p eId="para_13200">Setting the scope of works is the critical first step. Clearly where a school has a known level of resources apart from the Department funding or knows its capacity to raise additional resources it is open to that school to extend the scope of works to include additional facilities.  However if the scope of works is not set appropriately from the outset based on the budget available there is a risk that the school will be faced with a funding gap when the project is at construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_13201">The choices to be made within these devolved schemes rest with the school and that is the cornerstone of any policy of devolution.  The school authority knows the budget and must decide what it is capable of building with that budget. The time to identify a problem is at the outset before entering any contract.  Schools can raise with my Department any site specific problems or unusual planning stipulations that impose additional costs and these will be examined.  Otherwise schools must reduce the scope of intended works so as to remain within budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_13202">A school does not have to accept the invitation to participate in a devolved scheme and instead be considered for inclusion in the mainstream school building programme in line with the project's priority band rating.</p>
            <p eId="para_13203">I increased funding for the schemes in 2006 by an average of 20% for the Permanent Accommodation Scheme and by an average of 10% for the Small Schools Scheme.  These increases follow-on from increases of up to 25% in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_13204">The feedback has in general been very positive, the number of schools participating has increased year on year and many schools are anxious to be included.  In order to maintain this momentum I approved over 250 additional schools to participate in these schemes in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_13205">The school referred to by the Deputy has been in contact with the School Building Section of my Department regarding increased funding for the project.  Supporting documentation regarding the request is to be provided by the school management and the matter will be reviewed and a decision will be conveyed as soon as possible after its receipt.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_1233">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_13207">As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has put in place a range of teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs, including those with Down Syndrome.  The professionally-assessed needs of the individual child determine the appropriate model of response in each case.</p>
            <p eId="para_13208">Children with Down Syndrome are entitled to additional provision in school, either under the terms of the general allocation system for children with high incidence special needs or through an allocation of additional resources if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need.</p>
            <p eId="para_13209">The general allocation system for primary schools was put in place in September 2005, so that children with high incidence special needs such as mild general learning disability could get resource teaching support at school without the need for an individual assessment in each case.  All schools have been allocated resource teaching hours, depending on their enrolment levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_13210">The new system has a number of benefits associated with it:</p>
            <p eId="para_13211">It puts resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels</p>
            <p eId="para_13212">It facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place when the child enrols;</p>
            <p eId="para_13213">It reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments; and</p>
            <p eId="para_13214">It allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources, leading to a more effective delivery of services.</p>
            <p eId="para_13215">The new system means that rather than each school having to make individual applications for resource hours for such pupils, an allocation of resource teaching hours is provided in advance to the school.  It is a matter then for the school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support.  With the thousands of resource teachers now in place in our schools, each school has enough general allocation hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_13216">The school can then use its professional judgement to decide how these hours are divided among the pupils in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_13217">This is a major improvement on the previous system, under which children with high incidence special needs required a psychological assessment before the Department allocated resource teaching hours.  This time-consuming process often led to delays in children getting the support they needed.  Learning support/resource teachers are now in place in all primary schools, so that children who need their assistance can get it straight away.  The general allocation system does not preclude the provision of one-to-one tuition to pupils who need such support.</p>
            <p eId="para_13218">It would appear that a significant percentage of children with Down Syndrome have been assessed as having a mild general learning disability which comes under the high incidence disability category.  Therefore, they are given extra teaching support from within the school's general allocation of learning support/resource teaching support.</p>
            <p eId="para_13219">In circumstances where a child with Down Syndrome has other associated needs and would fall into the low incidence disability categories, this may automatically attract an individual resource teaching allocation.  Applications for such support should be referred to the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) by the school.  The SENOs operate within my Department's policy parameters in considering these applications and convey decisions directly to the schools without recourse to my Department.  As the application process is administered by the SENOs, my Department does not hold information relating to the outcome of the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_13220">As the Deputy will be aware this Government has provided a dramatic expansion in special education supports: there are now 15,000 adults in our schools working solely with children with special needs — compared to just a fraction of this a few years back.  This includes more than 8,000 special needs assistants, whereas there were only 300 in 1998.  The system for accessing supports has also been improved with the establishment of the National Council for Special Education, with its network of 80 local Special Educational Needs Organisers.</p>
            <p eId="para_13221">Further improvements in services are on the way, with the roll-out of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  Over €820 million is being provided for special education in 2007- €180 million, or nearly 30%, more than what was provided in the 2006 Estimates.</p>
            <p eId="para_13222">I can confirm that the Department will continue to prioritise the issue of special needs education and, in co-operation with the National Council for Special Education and the education partners, ensure that all children with special needs, including those with Down Syndrome, have the supports they need to enable them to reach their full potential.</p>

            <p eId="para_13231">I am aware that many areas located within close proximity to Dublin, similar to those referred to by the Deputy, continue to experience population growth, a position that almost inevitably places some strain on existing educational provision.  In order to proactively plan for such areas of increased growth my Department is included among the prescribed authorities to whom local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development plans or proposed variations to development plans for comment.  As a matter of course meetings are arranged with local authorities to establish the location, scale and pace of any major proposed developments and their possible implications for school provision so as to ensure as far as possible the timely delivery of the required education infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_13232">The areas covered in the first phase of this approach to school planning include north Dublin, south Louth and mid Meath in one plan, which has recently been published, and a separate plan, published in May 2005, for the N4/M4 route running from Leixlip to Kilbeggan and including Maynooth, Celbridge, Kilcock, Edenderry and rapidly developing villages and towns on that route.</p>
            <p eId="para_13233">It is open to any school to apply to the Department for additional accommodation to meet its needs.  All applications for capital funding are assessed in accordance with the Department's published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects which were drawn up following consultation with the education partners.  Following this assessment, each application is assigned a band rating.  Progress on individual projects is consistent with that band rating.</p>
            <p eId="para_13234">In addition, where an immediate need for additional accommodation exists, Boards of Management can apply for the provision of temporary rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_13235">The School Planning Section of the Department has received applications for major capital funding from the management authorities of Johnstownbridge and Kilshanroe National Schools.  The applications have been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale projects.  Progress on the proposed works is being considered in the context of the School Building and Modernisation Programme from 2007 onwards.  In the meantime, an application for the rental of temporary accommodation has been approved to meet Kilshanroe's immediate accommodation needs from September 2007.  The Department has no record of any other applications from the relevant authorities of schools in the areas referred to by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_13239">The future needs for primary school accommodation in the Tramore  area are being assessed in the context of applications on hands for major capital funding from a number of schools.  In common with all such applications, the Department carries out a detailed examination of the demographics of an area together with planned housing developments etc. to ensure that any planned capital investment will meet the needs of an area as a whole for the foreseeable future.</p>
            <p eId="para_13240">Progress on individual projects is then subject to the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  Schools in rapidly developing areas are prioritised under these criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_13244">In 2006 I introduced, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, pension arrangements for caretaking staff employed under the 1979 Scheme.  These arrangements provide that membership of the pension scheme will be effective from 1 September 2001 in the case of eligible caretakers in service at that time.  The pension scheme will be a contributory, defined benefit scheme and will provide standard public service pension benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_13245">Deduction of ongoing contributions commenced from eligible personnel with effect from 7 March 2006.  Arrears of contributions are payable in respect of the period from 1 September 2001 to the date ongoing deductions commenced, or the date membership ended if earlier.  Eligible staff will be notified in due course of the arrears due in respect of that period.  In accordance with standard public service arrangements, there is also provision for reckoning service given prior to 1 September 2001 subject to verification of the service concerned and payment of the appropriate contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_13246">The specific case referred to by the Deputy is currently being examined. I will arrange to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy confirming the position.  I can however confirm, that the former Caretaker has received any arrears of pay owed to him under Benchmarking and General Pay Awards.</p>

Therefore, no Newbridge-bound staff have transferred to offices outside the Dublin region as yet, but staff currently working in the Dublin region are being transferred to this Department in preparation for the relocation to Newbridge.

            <p eId="para_13530">My Department does not operate any home improvement grant scheme specifically to assist people who suffer from electro-sensitivity.  The Disabled Persons Grant Scheme, which is administered by the local authorities, provides grant aid for the provision of additional accommodation or necessary works of adaptation to a dwelling to meet the needs of a disabled member of the household.</p>
            <p eId="para_13531">However, the advice received by my Department from the Department of Health and Children is that the consensus of scientific opinion to date is that there is no evidence of a causal relationship between exposure to electromagnetic fields and ill health. In addition, I understand that the World Health Organisation has assessed the many reviews carried out in this area and has indicated that exposures below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) in their 1998 Guidelines do not produce any known adverse health effects.  The ICNIRP guideline limits are implemented in Ireland. Accordingly, it is unlikely that electro-sensitivity would be deemed to constitute a disabling condition for the purposes of the Disabled Persons Grant scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_13560">I propose to take Questions Nos. 924, 940 and 942 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_13561">Details of the revised housing adaptation grant schemes for older people and people with a disability were announced recently as part of My Department's new housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.  The revised schemes are based on the outcome of the review of the Disabled Persons Grant scheme, which was recently completed within my Department.  The review also incorporated the conditions governing the Essential Repairs Grant scheme and the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly scheme. Arising out of the review, three new schemes will be introduced, a Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, a Mobility Aids Grant Scheme, and a scheme of Housing Aid for Older People.</p>
            <p eId="para_13562">The Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability will assist in the provision/adaptation of accommodation to meet the needs of people with a disability.  The grant will be increased from the current effective maximum of €20,320 to a maximum of €30,000, which may cover up to 95% of the cost of works.  Prioritisation of eligibility will be on the basis of medical and financial need with 95% of the approved cost of work available to those with annual household incomes of less than €30,000, tapering to 30% for those with annual household incomes of €54,001 to €65,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_13563">The Mobility Aids Grant Scheme will provide grants to cover a basic suite of works to address mobility problems, primarily but not exclusively, associated with ageing.  It will fast track limited grant aid to people on lower incomes (maximum annual household income threshold €30,000).  The maximum grant available will be €6,000 and may cover 100% of the cost of works.</p>
            <p eId="para_13564">The new Housing Aid for Older People scheme will amalgamate the provisions of the existing Essential Repairs and Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Schemes, with the aim of making habitable the homes of older people.  The maximum grant available will be €10,500 and may cover 100% of the cost of works for applicants with an annual household income of less than €30,000, tapering to 30% for those with annual household incomes of €54,001 to €65,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_13565">As matters stand at present, a decision on qualifying works under the Essential Repairs Grant scheme is a matter for the local authority concerned, subject to the broad framework laid down in the Housing (Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant) Regulations 2001. The types of work allowable under the scheme are general repairs such as repairs to roofs, chimneys, gables, repairs/replacement of window, drylining, rewiring, etc. My Department does not have available information on the number of local authorities who currently provide grant aid for rewiring under the scheme. Rewiring, window repairs and heating installation will be eligible for grant aid under the conditions of the new Housing Aid for Older People scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_13566">The revised schemes will become operational during 2007 and I intend to issue detailed administrative guidance later this year to all local authorities. This administrative guidance will make explicit precisely what types of works will be covered by each of the schemes.</p>

            <p eId="para_13602">The exemption in respect of solar panels provides for the installation of up to 12 sq. metres aperture area, or 50% of total roof area, whichever is less. This is subject to conditions that restrict the height of the panel to 15 cms above the plane of a pitched roof or to 50 cms above a flat roof. In addition, the panels must be more than 50 cm from the edge of the roof or wall on which it is mounted.</p>

            <p eId="para_13604">It should also be borne in mind that if householders wish to install solar panels of greater area than that allowed under the Regulations, then planning permission could be applied for in the normal way.

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_13621">I propose to take Questions Nos. 946 and 948 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_13622">As I indicated in reply to Question No. 89 of 27 February, 2007, my Department is fully committed to the effective management of our consumption of energy resources. This is a critical element of our ongoing accreditation to ISO 14001 which we achieved for our headquarters offices in 2003.  We are working towards achieving this certification for all our offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_13623">My Department's policy is to use a number of energy saving devices such as energy efficient lights, powersave function on electrical office equipment and photocopiers with duplex facilities.  This has led to energy consumption in the Department's headquarters decreasing from 982,000 kilo Watt hours in 2003 to just over 948,000 kilo Watt hours in 2005.  Details regarding the cost and quantity of energy used in my Department's main offices in 2006 are being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputies shortly. The information sought in relation to 2002 is not readily available and its compilation would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work.</p>
            <p eId="para_13624">My Department continues to promote energy conservation measures within the Department, including relevant measures set out in the recently launched "Power of One" campaign. The possibility of introducing further measures to reduce energy consumption is being taken up by my Department with the Office of Public Works who provide maintenance services to the Department's offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_13625">Ambitious targets for renewable energy in the electricity, transport and heating sectors are contained in the Government's recently published White Paper, Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland. The White Paper proposes that one third of electricity consumed in this economy will come from renewable sources by 2020.  In this regard, my Department is already committed to obtaining its electricity from renewable sources and, following a tender process, under the auspices of the Office of Public Works, a contract is now in place with Energia for the supply of electricity from renewable sources to the Department's main offices. In addition, my Department is converting its entire fleet of 153 vehicles of the National Parks and Wildlife Service to use biodiesel by end 2007, which will give effect to the requirement in the White Paper for the use of bio-fuels in State owned and public transport vehicles.</p>
            <p eId="para_13626">Under the Government's decentralisation programme, the bulk of my Department's Dublin based operations are being decentralised to four locations in the South East.  In collaboration with the OPW, my Department has set very high environmental specifications for its decentralised offices.  It is intended that the new offices will incorporate many of the latest developments in sustainable construction, energy conservation and use of renewable energy sources.</p>

        <b>Mr. Kehoe</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</b>
         if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there are quite a number of wind farm developments here whose planning permission is soon due to expire and that in virtually all cases the reason that these projects have not yet commenced is due to delays in grid connection offers; if he has proposals to deal with these particular cases; if he does when these proposals will be made known; if he proposes to immediately alert all planning authorities of such proposals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_13628">I am aware of concerns regarding sequencing difficulties between expiration of planning permissions and timing of grid connections.  Firstly, I should point out that, as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I am precluded, under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, from exercising any power or control in relation to any individual planning application or appeal with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála is or may be concerned. Secondly, the granting of grid connections is a matter for the Commissioner for Energy Regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_13629">Planning permissions are typically granted for a period of 5 years. I understand that a limited number of applications that received permission in recent years have been affected by the moratorium on grid connections imposed by the Commissioner for Energy Regulation in 2003-2004.  Where planning permissions expire, Section 42 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that developers may seek an extension of the appropriate period, subject to certain conditions, including a requirement that substantial works have been carried out by the time of expiration. It is a matter for planning authorities as to whether these conditions are met in individual circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_13630">However, Section 41 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 also provides that planning authorities may grant planning permission for a period longer than the normal 5 years. Last June I took steps, in the Guidelines on Wind Energy Development, to encourage planning authorities to use this provision when considering applications for wind energy development.</p>

            <p eId="para_14110">To address the issue of accumulated backlogs of farm plastic, designated facilities are being provided on a temporary, once-off basis by local authorities where farmers may deposit stockpiled farm film plastic and silage wrap.  These special arrangements operated on a pilot basis in the first instance in counties Clare, Galway, Mayo, Offaly and Waterford during June and July of last year.  The service was provided free to the farmer and funding to assist the local authorities is being made available from my Department through the Environment Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_14111">The collections were well supported by farmers in the counties participating in the pilot phase, leading to large quantities of plastic being deposited at designated sites.  A significant finding from the pilot scheme was that it is not possible to operate collections in a large number of counties at the same time due to capacity constraints on the part of recovery operators.  Accordingly, it was necessary to roll out the scheme to other areas on a staggered basis.  Arising from a comprehensive examination of the information available, I approved further collections of waste silage / bale wrap by Carlow, Leitrim, Longford, North Tipperary, Roscommon and Wicklow County Councils which concluded in January of this year.  It is estimated that in excess of 15,000 tonnes of plastics were recovered by the eleven local authorities that have operated collections to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_14112">Following a review of the outcome of the second round of collections, I have recently announced that collections of waste silage / bale wrap will now be put in place in a further 18 county council areas over the next 6 months.  When the final phase is completed, collections will have taken place in all 29 county council areas. This arrangement allows for phased collections while at the same time creating certainty in the minds of farmers as to when their backlog will be cleared.  It also allows local authorities and local farming organisations sufficient notice to agree and put in place the necessary arrangements for collections in their areas.</p>

         the measures he has proposed to deal with the issue of tyres; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that these are necessary to assist in the protection of silage and that there is a requirement for more than one per square metre; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_14193">My Department has had discussions with the Irish Tyre Industry Association (ITIA) with a view to establishing a Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI).  These discussions are continuing with the intention of concluding the necessary arrangements for such an initiative later this year.  Draft Regulations which will provide a regulatory framework for this PRI have been developed and were published for public consultation last week.  In preparing the draft Regulations the Department consulted with the tyre industry and the farming organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_14194">There is scope for the beneficial use of waste tyres on farms to anchor silage covers; waste tyres conserve natural resources by serving a useful purpose in replacing other materials which would have had to be used for that purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_14195">The draft Regulations provide for the quantity of waste tyres which farmers will be allowed hold for reuse on silage pits. The quantity allowed will depend on the size of the floor area of the silage pit and will be subject to a maximum of 5 tyres per sq metre.</p>
            <p eId="para_14196">I have publicly stated my concerns in relation to inappropriate practices in relation to the way waste tyres are managed.  It is imperative that waste tyres are not subject to unauthorised burning, uncontrolled disposal or the formation of indiscriminate stockpiles.  These practices are not acceptable as they can cause nuisance, pose both environmental and health hazards and infringe waste and other environmental legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_14197">The proposed regulatory regime provides for the establishment of an industry compliance scheme drawn up by the tyre industry through the Irish Tyre Industry Association of Ireland (ITIA) following discussions. The system to be known as TRACS will provide a verifiable audit trail for the proper management of used tyres.</p>
            <p eId="para_14198">It is important that a proper regulatory framework be put in place to track waste tyre flows and to encourage the recovery and recycling of this waste resource. I am confident that the new regulatory regime will accomplish that. The draft Regulations are now out for public consultation and written submissions can be made to my Department. The closing date for receipt of submissions is 26 April 2007.</p>

Galway City Council and Galway County Council have each adopted the Declaration. Implementation measures are a matter for the individual local authorities.  As required under the Disability Act 2005, my Department's sectoral plan was approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas in October 2006.  The plan, covering my Department, its partner bodies and local authorities, sets out national objectives and guidelines for access to public buildings, services, amenities, and information, as well as heritage sites and other facilities.  The plan provides for a range of positive measures, including improvements to Part M of the Building Regulations, the introduction of a new Disability Access Certificate and the development of a Housing Strategy for people with disabilities.  The implementation of these measures will promote and proactively encourage equal opportunities for persons with disabilities to participate in the economic, social and cultural life of the community.  The sectoral plan also requires each local authority to draw up an implementation plan, by July 2007, on the basis of a detailed accessibility audit.  The implementation plans, drawn up in consultation with organisations representing people with disabilities, will set out a programme of actions to give effect to the commitments and objectives contained in the 2005 Act and the sectoral plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_14220">Investment by local authorities to meet the needs of people with disabilities, and to fulfil their obligations under the 2005 Act, is being directed toward providing new or improved access to and within public buildings, amenities, streetscapes etc., including electronic equipment and adaptations, and towards training, accessibility audit work, improved access to information services, software etc.  I am providing €15 million in 2007 to help local authorities and other bodies under the aegis of my Department to implement the National Disability Strategy, as part of a multi-annual funding programme, begun in 2005, which will continue until 2009.</p>

While my Department maintains regular ongoing contact with local authorities on the delivery of the non-national roads programme, I am satisfied that this significant level of State funding, supplemented by Kildare County Council's own resources, provides appropriately for the Council's ongoing non-national road requirements in 2007.  Responsibility for national roads in County Kildare is a matter for Kildare County Council and the National Roads Authority which operates under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Transport.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</b>
         if the local government auditor has reported to him or his Department in regard to the amount of development moneys levied by the various local authorities throughout the country by way of condition on foot of planning permission in each of the past five years; the amount of such funding already spent and the purposes for which it has been used; if such use is in accordance with the conditions of the planning permissions in each case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_14351">Development contributions are levied as a condition of planning permission in accordance with development contribution schemes adopted by the elected members of planning authorities after a public consultation process.  Incomes accruing from development contributions schemes are ring-fenced, and it is ultimately a matter for each planning authority to determine the allocation of those incomes, having regard to the provisions of section 48 and 49 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The local government auditors do not report specifically to me on development levies.  In the course of their annual financial/regulatory audits of local authorities, local government auditors may issue audit reports to local authorities on matters arising during the course of the audit, including comments in relation to development levies.  I would point out, however, that local authority annual reports must contain details of monies paid or owing to it under section 50 of the Local Government Act 1991 and must indicate how such monies paid to it have been applied.  This includes charges under sections 48 and 49 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  In addition, Annual Financial Statements of local authorities in respect of 2005 and future years are required to include details of opening and closing balances on the development levies account together with the extent of movement in and out of the account during the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_14353">The Local Government Social Inclusion Steering Group was established in late 2004.  Its function is to promote and support the embedding of social inclusion in local government in the context of national policies.  The Group includes representatives of my Department, the Combat Poverty Agency, the Local Government Management Services Board, the County/City Managers Association, the Institute of Public Administration, the Office for Social Inclusion, and also more recently of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  It has met on 16 occasions in the past two years.  In line with the commitment in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016, the work of the Group will be further developed to support linkages between the national and local level promoting social inclusion at local government level and will report to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, as appropriate.</p>
