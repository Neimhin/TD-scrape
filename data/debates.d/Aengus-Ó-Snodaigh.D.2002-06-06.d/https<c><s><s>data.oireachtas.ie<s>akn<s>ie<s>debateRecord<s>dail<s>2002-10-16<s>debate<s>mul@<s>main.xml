Given that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has said that he is absolutely confident that when legal proceedings take place here, the Government's decision to publish will be vindicated and that the contracts already entered into between the FAI and Sky can be revoked, can something not be done today to restore goodwill with the FAI, to implement the Minister's assertion that the Government is right in what it is doing and to work to allow this match to be covered free to air this evening?

Will the Taoiseach give an assurance to the House that, notwithstanding the unqualified support the Murdoch press gave to the Fianna Fáil Party in the duplicitous general election of May last, there will be no question of the Irish taxpayers having to pay compensation for the breaking of a contract by legal means? This is what the Government, in effect, intends doing if and when Sky and the FAI go to court. If the courts find in their favour, the Irish taxpayer will have to pay for the incompetence of Fianna Fáil in breaking this contract by this Government decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the decision made on behalf of the Government yesterday by the Minister for Communication, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is legally sound and safe in respect of any such legal challenge? Will the Taoiseach give an undertaking that no additional funds will be given to the FAI as a result of this constitutional decision?</p>

          <p eId="para_23">The 1999 Act sets out the particular procedure that had to be followed. The sporting bodies vehemently opposed that Act because the Act stated that it was not a question, at least with some of the major sporting bodies at that time, that they wished to go elsewhere. The sporting bodies did not want their hands tied in negotiations with RTE and that was their objec tion. Those discussions went on for two years. The matter was brought to a head when the FAI made a deal with Sky, meaning that it was not a question of a battle between RTE and the sporting bodies. The Government decided in the summer to designate certain events.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">I can inform Deputy Kenny that the Minister will shortly introduce two amendments to the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act, which gives Governments the power to implement the EU television without frontiers directive. The first amendment will provide for an arbitration mechanism to determine fair market value for television rights to sporting events, where negotiations between a broadcaster and the organisers of a designated event have broken down. The Minister will designate the events, of course. This first amendment has been proposed on foot of the concern of sports organisations regarding negotiations with television companies. The second amendment will give qualifying broadcasters, RTE or TV3, the right to secure the broadcast rights for a designated event directly from the event's organisers in circumstances where exclusive rights to the event had already been sold to a non-qualifying broadcaster at the time of the original designation. It is understood that an exclusive contract is in place with a non-qualifying broadcaster in the case of Ireland's home qualifying games for the 2004 European Championships and the 2006 World Cup.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">In response to Deputy Quinn, I wish to clarify that the second amendment will remove any lingering uncertainty about the Government's legal right to retrospectively list events. I can also inform the Deputy that the Government cannot compensate any sporting organisation, such as the Football Association of Ireland, for loss of revenue.

According to this morning's newspapers, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is absolutely confident that the Government will win its case if this matter goes to the courts.

          <p eId="para_36">It is not possible to do anything about the matter today. I wish to restate the point, with which I am sure Deputy Kenny is familiar, that all the sporting bodies, including the FAI, the IRFU and the GAA, opposed this measure when it was proposed. It would not be true to suggest that they all wanted to sell their rights abroad, as the GAA indicated at its congress that it had no interest in such contracts, but the sporting bodies are concerned that they may be hindered by regulations when they negotiate with the television authorities. It may be popular to suggest that the sporting organisations do not have a point when they make such an argument, but I believe they have. It is a fact that the power of such organisations to argue their case when selling the rights to their games will be damaged by the new legislation. We have seen how successfully the remit of certain sports has been extended in negotiations. It is easy to complain about tonight, but the FAI has successfully made a deal. The power of organisations like the GAA to use the example of the FAI to strengthen their case has, in effect, been removed. Such difficulties will have to be addressed at a future date.</p>

Does the  Taoiseach know that Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta, the parent company of IFI, paid an incredible £188 million to banks in interest on a debt of £164 million, between 1987 and 1999? Does the Taoiseach agree, given that he was Minister for Finance during some of that time, that the figures I have outlined represent a scandalous outrage and merit investigation? Does he agree that if funds had been invested in the diversification of products, including natural fertilisers and compost alternatives, rather than allowing IFI and NET to be soaked by the bank, 620 workers would not be facing the appalling prospect of the dole, some of them for the rest of their lives? Why has the Government betrayed the IFI workers in this way? Is the hostility of the Progressive Democrats, and now Fianna Fáil, to State industry so great that the Government is prepared to allow 620 workers to lose their jobs in this fashion?</p>

Can the Taoiseach explain what happened to the workers' agreement to take a painful reduction in salary, which followed a meeting with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment some weeks ago? It appears that the company's plants will close, or else the company will have to endure a severe form of liquidation. If the decision announced yesterday is carried through to finality, can the Taoiseach indicate what form of protection or security will be put in place?</p>

          <p eId="para_41">I would like to ask the Taoiseach what action he took over the past five years in relation to the troubled conditions in which NET and IFI found themselves. Is he aware of the all-Ireland dimension to this problem, given that the third plant affected by the decision to liquidate is located in east Belfast, the heart of working class loyalism? During the past four or five years, has the Taoiseach discussed the company with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, whose palpable hatred for State enterprise has obstructed sensible decision-making in relation to the strategic survival of a troubled industry?</p>
          <p eId="para_42">I was responsible for this area for two years and I recognise that IFI is part of a complex and difficult international industry. I understand that there is an over-supply of fertiliser products and that capital investment is sometimes far in excess of returns. The problems caused by the closure of the plants will spread far beyond Arklow and south Wicklow, which will be devastated by the closure. People other than the 620 workers will be affected as a supply chain depends on NET-IFI. The freight section of CIE, for which the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, is responsible depends on regular custom from IFI.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">Let us be clear that the decision to liquidate IFI was made by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, through her proxies on the 51% of the board owned by the State. Her decision sends a clear signal to  workers in east Belfast, south Wicklow and Cork, as well as others who depend on this major industry. What has she been doing for the past five years? Why has she allowed the company to fold in such a manner? Can the Taoiseach tell the House about the discussions he had in recent years with the Tánaiste about this strategic industry, which happens to be one of the backbones of Irish agriculture?</p>

That is devastating news for the workforce, their families and the local communities involved.

          <p eId="para_47">The company operates, as Deputy Quinn acknowledged, in a volatile market which has experienced considerable difficulties in recent years as a result of low prices caused by overcapacity and high costs. Those problems were compounded by a reduction in usage by 10% and the costs of converting natural gas to ammonia and related difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">In the past year alone we have had endless discussions at Cabinet regarding this issue. IFI has recorded a loss of more than €30 million with further losses projected. A few years ago a sum of between £187 million and £190 million was transferred from IFI's balance sheet to the national debt to try to ease pressures on the company.

Unfortunately, despite efforts made by the company to take costs amounting to €30 million out of the business, it could not produce a viability plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">The company asked shareholders to underwrite a short-term survival plan and still projected a loss for the coming year. The survival plan was vulnerable to shocks and even relatively modest setbacks would have again left the company in an impossible position. This was acknowledged by the board and everybody else. The two shareholders could simply not provide support in such circumstances. The shareholders have been supportive to the company over the past two years. They have provided £34 million in addition to the sum transferred to the national debt through the National Treasury Management Agency.</p>

I am aware, having read many memoranda on this issue over many years, that it was always hoped circumstances would be turned around. However, when one looks back over the decades, the State has invested more than €750 million in the company and, unfortunately for the staff, it was not possible to achieve anything. I acknowledge the workers did their best. They were prepared to participate in the survival plan by taking wage cuts. They and their families have done all they can. Now it is up to us to reciprocate that help by assisting them in every way we can.</p>

However, as I indicated to your staff, I raised the issue on behalf of all workers who face redundancy and the inadequate levels of compensation for redundant workers under the legislation in place. With your permission, Sir, I would like to raise the matter again, not on behalf of the Irish Glass Bottle Company workers who still await a proper settlement or the workers at Peerless Rugs who still occupy their factory in Kildare, but to check out the sincerity factor of the Taoiseach's crocodile tears in respect of the NET-IFI workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">In the manifest and symbolic absence of the Tánaiste who has consistently refused to reform the legislation on redundancy payments, will the Taoiseach do something real instead of manifesting artificial sympathy for the IFI workers? Will he give a commitment that the Government, notwithstanding the lapdogs in the Progressive Democrats, will amend the redundancy legislation to effect a change for which John McDonnell called at SIPTU's conference in Killarney last week whereby the current conditions will be changed in order that workers who pay into the PRSI fund will receive three weeks pay for every year worked in compensation, irrespective of age, and that it will kick in following one year's employment? The reality is one year's employment is not demanding because most people work for companies which go bust for much longer.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Ms Hanafin)</from>
          <p eId="para_443">Ar son an Taoisigh agus an Árd-Aighne ba maith liomsa an Bille seo a chur os comhair na Dála.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">The purpose of this short Bill is to confer on the Attorney General power to make available versions of Acts of the Oireachtas in more readable form. These updated versions, to be known as restatements, will not in any way alter the substance of the law, but will make it easier to follow as a coherent narrative. Once a restatement has been certified by the Attorney General under this Bill it may be cited in court as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the legislation contained in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">The background to the Bill is the need to take steps to modernise the Statute Book. Every year some 50 to 60 Acts are enacted, many of which amend previous Acts, and users of statutes will be familiar with the problem of having to consult several Acts in order to identify a particular point of law. The continued amendment of Acts makes them difficult to follow and the restatement process is designed to ease the burden on users.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">The need to modernise the Statute Book was recognised by the Government in June 1999 in the document Reducing Red Tape – An Action Programme for Regulatory Reform in Ireland. This programme was based on the report of the strategic management initiative's working group on regulatory reform and is aimed at improving the quality of regulation through a process of consolidation, revision and repeal. The programme  required each Department and office to identify the scope for consolidation and repeal of primary and secondary legislation. The aim was to simplify, wherever possible, the process of doing business with Government and to make legislation more coherent and accessible. As a result of this report, consultations have taken place among the Department of the Taoiseach, the statute law revision unit in the Office of the Attorney General and Departments and offices to identify areas of statute in need of revision and consolidation. In addition, the recent OECD report entitled Regulatory Reform in Ireland stated that the enactment of the Statute Law (Restatement) Bill and its full application is an important step towards enhancing the Irish regulatory framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">The development of a comprehensive programme of statute revision and consolidation is a complex and time consuming process which will be facilitated by making restatements. The Law Reform Commission consultation paper, Statutory Drafting and Interpretation: Plain Language and the Law, provisionally recommended that priority should be given to the consolidation of statutes, in order to facilitate readability.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The commission also recommended that "attention should be given to the updating of older legislation, and its re-drafting in modern language and format". That theme was repeated in the final report of the Law Reform Commission, Statutory Drafting and Interpretation Plain Language and the Law, and there was a reference to the importance of consolidation to maintain accessibility of the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The problem of the untidy state of the Statute Book has not been addressed by the State. In other common law states there are policies to have regular revision with the result that the laws in Canada and Australia, for example, are made more accessible through regular programmes of revision. The need for a policy to modernise the Statute Book and make it more coherent and accessible was recognised also in the consultation document, Towards Better Regulation, which was issued by the Department of the Taoiseach in February of this year. As part of an initial programme to make statute law more accessible, the Attorney General advised the Government that it would be helpful to introduce legislation under which the Attorney General may prepare versions of Acts of the Oireachtas in a more readable form without altering their substance.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Variations on the restatement idea operate effectively in other common law jurisdictions such as the United States, Canada and Australia. The model proposed in the Bill is most closely analogous to the procedures in place in New South Wales since 1972 and Queensland since 1992. These procedures enable legislation which has been amended to be reprinted so that legislation can always be read as an updated, coherent narrative. What is proposed under this Bill is that the Attorney General will be able to publish a certified version of the text of an Act incorporat ing any amendments made by subsequent Acts into one up to date statement of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">The proposed process is most easily explained by reference to an example. The Sale of Goods Act, 1893, was amended by the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980. In order to understand the law relating to the sale of goods, two sources must be consulted. Once the Restatement Bill is enacted the Attorney General may publish the Sale of Goods Acts, 1893 and 1980 in a restated form so that one readable text may be consulted. Textual amendments, that is, amendments which replace text in the Act of 1893 with new text taken from the Act of 1989, will be set out so that the Act of 1893 may be read as amended. Where provisions are repealed, they will not appear but a brief note or explanation will be provided so that the reader of the Sale of Goods Acts, 1893 and 1980, will be able to read all the relevant statute law in the one text. In addition, where appropriate, statutory instruments may be included in a restatement. This exercise will then pave the way for the ultimate revision of statute law and the replacement of old Acts with new more readable formats.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">A policy of restatement will be useful for Acts that have been consolidated and subsequently amended. For example, the excellent work undertaken in relation to the consolidation of Income Tax Acts, Stamp Duties Acts and Capital Gains Taxes Acts and successive efforts to consolidate social welfare law will be supplemented by restatement so that consolidation Acts that are subsequently amended may be kept up to date. It is important to stress that a restatement will not amend existing legislation. For that reason the process of restatement will not require parliamentary scrutiny. The Attorney General, in consultation with the relevant Minister, will be empowered to reprint groups of Acts of the Oireachtas in a more accessible form. Section 4 expressly confirms that a restatement will not alter the substance of any Act or statutory instrument. However, to ensure that the Houses of the Oireachtas are aware of progress under the Act, restatements will be laid before the Houses when they are certified by the Attorney General.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Section 5 provides that, once certified by the Attorney General under this Bill, a restatement may be cited in court as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the legislation contained in it. Therefore, a court may take notice of a restatement without formal proof. This provision ensures that a restatement will be of practical use to the citizen. This initiative, together with regular updating of statute law on CD-ROM and making statutes available on the Internet, will go a long way towards providing a modern, user friendly Statute Book.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">Those are the main provisions in the Bill. The innovation provided for is important and timely. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_459">That is understood. I welcome the proposal to modernise the Statute Book. The legislation is technical and it will be more technical when it becomes operational. Anything which makes the law more understandable must be applauded. When I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts an evaluation was done of the interpretation of the law and of the language used in Acts. People, particularly those who do not have a legal mind, would need a great deal of time to figure out what is meant by certain phrases. I welcome the Bill which will make the law more understandable.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">I welcome the fact that gender proofing, which was previously resisted, is provided for in this legislation. I note the reference to "his" and "her". The word "her" did not exist at one time.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_134">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_462">The word "his" was used for "his" and "her". It did not matter how often we argued that point, we were always told it meant the same thing. We have now proven after all these years that "his" and "her" are two separate entities which are finally recognised in the legislation. That is a positive step which recognises the times in which we live. It is better than referring to the old statutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">I am worried about a couple of pitfalls. There will always be difficulties in any translation of languages or Acts. There will always be grounds for people to take a challenge. The Minister of State said and the Bill states that the interpretation will not have the force of law. However, it may be referred to and it may be noted in courts and debates. However, those who translate the legislation into the modern version could have a problem with its interpretation. The Attorney General shall have the right to delegate to various officers  the power to update the language in the legislation. However, regardless of how well qualified the person is, it will ultimately be subject to interpretation by the courts, including the High Court and the Supreme Court. If it is found that a gap exists between what was intended in the original legislation and the interpretation of the revised modern version, in other words, the readable version, the original Act will prevail. This area requires further clarification as it leaves room for a happy hunting ground for the legal eagles. While I do not blame the legal profession for exploiting such happy hunting grounds, they are already sufficient in number.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">The proposal makes the law more understandable for the general public and the people affected by it. I note the Minister of State's reference to the statutory instruments and regulations, which can dramatically affect the import and impact of a statute. I hope, therefore, that in all cases the modernised, readable version of the law will take into account the impact of the regulations and the fact that regulations are in many cases subject to change. Other than laying them before the House, such change often occurs without the approval of the Oireachtas being sought.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I agree with the theory underlying the decision by Canada and other countries to modernise their legislation. Some of our legislation dates back several centuries. Oddly, it still holds good, whereas some of our modern law appears to have run into difficulties. The Companies Act, 1990, which we spent 18 months examining on Committee Stage in order to fireproof it against all eventualities, is a case in point. It did not succeed and was found in light of subsequent events to be quite porous. While we may feel an Act covers all eventualities, this may not prove to be the case. The moral of this finding in terms of all updated and upcoming legislation is that the more complicated the legislation and the more avenues it attempts to cover, the more gaps it creates. Although that seems to be a contradiction, it is a fact. The simpler the Act, the more embracing it is. The danger is that legislation may prove to be punitive or harsh in certain circumstances. While this legislation is laudable in that it attempts to update and modernise old Acts, it could have a propensity to run into difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">The Minister alluded to the reference in the Bill to the certified version of the text. I presume this text will be similar in appearance to a Land Registry certification map and folio and will be quoted and used as if it were the original Act. Will it be allowed for conveyancing purposes? To what extent will it be acceptable to and used by the legal profession, having regard to the fact that while it can be noted in the courts, the original version will continue to have the force of law? Will the modern, updated version be assumed to have an identical meaning to that of the original Act, for example, for conveyancing purposes? I am sure my colleague, Deputy Ring, who has con siderable knowledge of the business of conveyancing, wishes to address this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">It would be great if we could modernise all our legislation, give it recent vintage and move it into the 21st century. Given the success of other countries in addressing this task, why can we not do it? I accept there are two sides to this story. The swings and roundabouts, its positives and negatives, lie in the fact that although one can improve some Acts, one can also damage previously sound law. I can recall several recent Acts where this has occurred. I ask that the appropriate commission consider the possibility of drawing up a list of Acts now in everyday use to ascertain the extent to which they can be modernised. As we are all aware, much of our legislation long predates the establishment of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_135">
          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_468">I welcome the Bill, the most important to come before the House. There are 166 Members of the House and unless one is a barrister or solicitor, professions which are making enough money as it is from the tribunals and other matters, one has difficulty understanding legislation. I often wondered why legislation was framed in legal language. I realise the reason is to make money for the boys and girls in the legal profession. They have acquired considerable wealth as a result of Acts enacted by this House for the simple reason that the general public and around 95% of Members do not understand their contents. As an Opposition spokesperson, who is neither a solicitor nor barrister, I must seek external, expert advice in order to understand legislation introduced in the House because Members are not provided with sufficient resources to do so internally. With just one secretary, no access to legal advice and no one to help me understand the contents of legislation, I am obviously very pleased with the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">At times, Members do not become aware of the contents of legislation until it is challenged in the courts or by people outside the House. It is only then that they realise what it is they have passed, by which time it is too late to contribute in the House on it. Perhaps Members, particular those on the Government benches, would even have refused to pass laws if they had known of their contents. While I welcome the Bill as a necessary step, I ask the Minister to go further.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">Every Member has encountered problems getting Ministers to answer parliamentary questions. Why can they not answer the question they are asked? Why do they use legal jargon to avoid answering questions? They do everything but answer the question they are asked. Many of them must be receiving training to appear on television. The first thing Ministers and civil servants are told when appointed is not to answer questions. If questions were answered, we would not have half the problems. Why do Ministers not want to give information? This is a democracy not a dictatorship. Why can civil servants when drafting questions for Ministers not tell it as it is, even  if it is unkind or unpleasant? People can take the good with the bad. Why should Deputies have to go through replies to parliamentary questions to check what, if anything, is being answered? Nine times out of ten Ministers do not answer the question asked. They throw out different versions in legal terms, which is not fair to Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">I welcome this Bill because there is nothing wrong with explaining the law. It is a good move and must be complimented. It will give the general public an understanding of the law and people will know what is being brought before the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">Legal eagles have made their money over the years out of legislation brought before this House, as much of this legislation was challenged and brought to the Supreme Court. Now that we will know what legislation will come before the House and have an understanding of it, the days of depending on the legal eagles to advise us on it will be over, which is a step in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">I hope the Minister of State will continue to move in this direction by ensuring that parliamentary questions will be answered. They should be answered all year round. The position in that regard this year was unfair to the staff of this House, particularly the staff in the questions office and the office of the Minister of State. The election was held on 17 May and called a number of weeks prior to that. The House was dissolved and we were not able to get answers to parliamentary questions until last week, which was outrageous. Parliamentary questions should be answered even when this House is not sitting. That would ensure that the staff of this House would not suffer as they suffered in recent weeks with the burden of work involved in every Member tabling a number of parliamentary questions, the answers to which they have had to await for months. Certain sections, which I will not name, go on holidays once the Dáil goes on holidays, and they will not answer any questions from Members. When the parliamentary questions are tabled two or three weeks prior to the Dáil resuming, we have action from all the Departments. That is another matter that should be examined. Parliamentary questions should be answered all year round. That would be a saving to the staff of these Houses. The current position is not fair to them. They do an excellent job under difficult circumstances, on which I must compliment them. If parliamentary questions were answered all year round, on the day the Dáil resumes, whether after the summer or some other recess, the staff would not have to deal with thousands of questions, as happened last week. It is not humanly possible for the staff to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">I am glad this and future legislation that will come before this House will be explained in lay person's language. I and, I am sure, the general public will welcome that. Constituents often ask for legislation that was passed and, on receiving it, they ring saying they do not understand it. That has happened over the years. Therefore, this legislation must be welcomed and I hope it will  work. I hope the Minister of State will take up with the other Whips at a future meeting the points I raised, particularly regarding parliamentary questions. I ask the Minister of State to tell civil servants and Ministers to answer the questions they are asked, to do so in lay person's language and not to try to avoid answering them. This is a democracy not a dictatorship.</p>

However, I cannot make the same assumption about the technical group. I am not being petty about this. I am interpreting the intention of the regulation.

          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_518">I have been referring to the Bill and will continue to do so. The Bill is innocuous in its aims. Who could object to legislation being made more readable, gender-proofed and more accessible in general? There are other questions that have not been raised or answered so far in the debate. What is the exact reason for the Bill being before us other than for giving employment to those who will be involved in the re-drafting or simplifying of legislation? I would not underestimate the employment that would give, but that is probably only one of a number of reasons and I would like to hear all of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">What will be the cost of following through on the enormous body of legislation? What is contemplated here is not just legislation which has gone through the Oireachtas since Independence, but legislation that was put on the Statute Book prior to that. I recently had reason to look at the Protection of Animals Act, 1911. The language is quaint and historic but it is ancient in its relevance to many of today's issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">This Bill anticipates an enormous body of legislation. Has a priority list been drawn up? There are many waiting lists for both new legislation and legislation to be amended. There is also a long waiting list for legislation that has yet to be translated, mainly from English to Irish. I know it has been difficult to find the resources to deal with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">Cuireann sé íonadh orm go bhfuilimid ag caint faoi tuilleadh oibre dá leithéid a dhéanamh nuair nach bhfuil an obair atá beartaithe a dhéanamh curtha i gcrích go fóill. An bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire Stáit an gcuirfidh an obair a bhéas le déanamh de bharr an Bhille seo isteach ar an obair atá le déanamh cheana le fada an lá agus nach bhfuil déanta go fóill.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">The Minister of State might indicate whether priority will be given to the type of legislation  which is effectively composite in the sense that they comprise principal Acts, amendments, repeal Acts and quite an amount of documentation pertaining to one area of law. For example, the liquor licensing laws are so multi-faceted that there is certainly a case for giving them priority, repealing the late opening hours in the process. That needs to be stated, otherwise there is a danger that another industry will be set up, perhaps as a section of the Attorney General's office, which will be academically interesting but may drain considerable resources from the work which should be taking place, as we in the Oireachtas are well aware. The speed at which legislation needs to come through and the necessary levels of translation facilities do not exist. What will be prioritised and what will suffer, if anything, through the enactment and implementation of this legislation?</p>
          <p eId="para_523">Ironically, this legislation is before us at a time when the public is trying to come to terms with legislation which they have no choice but to have some level of understanding of, namely, the amendments that are to take place to the Constitution to allow for the ratification, or otherwise, of the Nice treaty. Does the Minister of State see a role for this legislation in making EU legislation more readable? I find the Oireachtas legislation reasonably readable in so far as it gets to the point quickly. European Union legislation, however, generally includes a considerable number of pages using words such as "therefore", "thereafter", "heretofore" and other interesting grammatical gymnastics that are not user-friendly. Given that much of the legislation with which we now deal has its genesis in the European Commission, is there any level of co-operation between the Office of the Attorney General and the Commission? Although it has to be transposed into Irish law – making it an Irish law in itself – much of the legislative guidelines we follow are set down in legislation that has not been transposed into Irish law, either by way of European directives or other regulation. That should also be given attention. Perhaps there is a need to deal with this on a European Union basis. Does the Attorney General have any thoughts or proposals in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">Will the Minister of State also indicate whether the Comhairle organisation has been involved in the drafting or promotion of the legislation? It seems logical that it would be involved, given that it operates citizens' information centres where such readable legislation should be available for perusal. I hope there is a plan in place to ensure the new readable form of legislation, when the drafting process is complete, will be distributed. In my view citizens' information centres, libraries, etc., should, first and foremost, have access to the new formats when they become available. It will be interesting to discover if plans have been made in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">I may be playing devil's advocate but I must state that there is a risk of confusion arising if the  readable format becomes widely available and begins to take on an importance beyond the <i>prima facie</i> level of importance to which the legislation refers. What contingency plans have been put in place to ensure the readable formats do not cause confusion but instead confer enlightenment? I presume members of the legal profession would like to know the answer to that question, given that it is they who will have to decide which format will provide the basis of the ultimate interpretation of the legislation. I assume the principal Act will take precedence, but if there is a widely available readable format there may be instances where a difference of legal interpretation will arise. There may also be differences in interpretation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Irish and English formats. Clarification is required before there can be an overall endorsement of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">Those who use the Irish language format of legislation will also require clarification with regard to whether the readable format will be presented in bilingual form. I refer here to a format where the Irish and English language versions appear taobh le taobh, as opposed to there being an English language common use format and a separate Irish language use format kept in the GPO or the Attorney General's office and available only to people who go to the trouble of trying to find it. I ask the Minister of State to take on board this concern which, I imagine, is widespread among those of us who would like to be able to use Irish more often.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_547">The principle of the legislation is good but it begs the question, why can legislation not be written more clearly in the first place? That would help a great deal. All Members sometimes have difficulty understanding the language used in legislation but we do our best, as is our duty, to ensure legislation is as good as it can be and that appropriate amend ments are made by the time it is passed by the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, referred to the report, "Statutory Drafting and Interpretation: Plain Language and the Law", which also makes that point about language. It states:</p>
          <p eId="para_549">A major problem with present drafting practice is the use of sentence constructions that are unusual and not readily understandable. There have been several studies and recommendations made on this point over the years, generally to the effect that sentences should be direct and as close to common English usage as possible. The excessive use of conditional clauses and the passive voice, the preference for negative over positive expressions and the separation of subject and verb, are the most pronounced examples of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">Any Bill can offer examples of this problem. I am particularly aware of this when I give talks to schoolchildren. Members occasionally receive invitations to visit schools to talk to the pupils and I often bring copies of Bills with me. Everybody believes they could be written more plainly. It was pointed out in the Seanad debate on this Bill that pre-1922 legislation was, in many cases, clearer than contemporary legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">An Interpretation Bill was published in 2000 which, although it has not yet gone through the Houses, also addresses the issue of clarity in the language used in legislation. The Bill deals with how the courts should interpret legislation and determine what is the intention of the Oireachtas in the legislation. That is not the subject of today's debate but it is an indication that there are difficulties in understanding the wording of our law. I accept that the law must be precise and that it often requires references to subsections and the like and the use of long sentences. However, every effort should be made when drafting legislation to ensure the language is clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">I welcome the progress made on this legislation in the Seanad and I thank the Minister for accepting a number of changes recommended by my party. These amendments sought to prevent re-numbering or changing the form of the legislation. It was intended that the restatement should be allowed to change the numbers of sections in legislation and to change its form. The belief was that where legislation was being amalgamated and updated, the different references were not required. The counter argument, however, is that to ensure clarity when one is quoting from original legislation, one must have the same reference points in the restatement in order that there is no misunderstanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">Another issue addressed in the Seanad was gender, which was mentioned by earlier speakers. It was decided that it should not be left to the Attorney General's office to interpret the will of the Oireachtas with regard to gender. In some cases reference to the male gender encompasses reference to the female gender but in others there  might be specific references to women as distinct from men or <i>vice versa.</i> The primary issue is the will of the Oireachtas; it is not the role of the Attorney General to change the will of the Oireachtas in any way. The change in that regard has strengthened the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">In the Seanad an amendment was made to ensure the Bill is inclusive with regard to all legislation, including legislation passed before Independence. My colleagues in Sinn Féin will be particularly interested in that. In other words, the Bill has been strengthened to ensure no legislation has been omitted. Another amendment was made to provide that the date of the passing of the Act would always be included in the restatement so there would be no confusion about when the original legislation was passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">It is important that, resources permitting, all pre-1922 legislation should be codified or repealed. Indeed, that was the subject of a motion from the Labour Party lawyers at the last party conference. There are laws on the Statute Book which predate the existence of the State. I accept it will be a big job and that the Office of the Attorney General is already stretched but there was an indication earlier that the office now has extra staff. It is important that the relevant section in the Office of the Attorney General, the statute law reform and consolidation section, is given the resources to address the updating and clarification of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">One aspect of recent legislation which concerns me and which is appropriate to today's debate is the practice of substantially amending legislation with further legislation. There was an example of that recently in the context of legislation on immigration, refugees and so forth. I was a member of the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights which dealt with Committee Stage of the Immigration Bill. We had to deal with substantial amendments to the Refugee Act through the Immigration Bill. It was quite confusing dealing with amendments to amendments of another Act which was not the legislation under discussion. If it is confusing for legislators, it is probably twice as confusing for the general public and particularly the people directly concerned with the Refugee Act, who would not be familiar with this country and its practices anyway and who might have language difficulties as well. Incidentally, I support Deputy Sargent on the issue he raised. Aontaím gur cheart Billeanna a bheith ar fáil as Gaeilge agus as Béarla. We should endeavour, where possible, to deal with one Bill at a time rather than amending one Bill through another.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">It is essential that the Oireachtas is the supreme authority in deciding what the law is. The purpose of the courts is to interpret the law as passed. It is important that this should clearly be the case in this Bill. The restated Act is not the definitive Act, as it were, but the original primary legislation stands and has the force of law. During the Seanad debate the issue of Oireachtas scrutiny of the restatement was discussed, as were  amendments in that regard. The Seanad approved the provision in section 8, that any restatement must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for 21 days before it can be published by the Attorney General's office for use. That is the appropriate course to take. It means that each House can make its own decision on how to deal with restatement so that if there is a problem, it can be dealt with by the Houses in the appropriate way.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Some very good points were made in the Seanad debate about the importance of scrutiny by the Oireachtas. That debate, however, concerned how such scrutiny could be achieved. Perhaps we could discuss the modalities on Committee and Report Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">I welcome this legislation which will make the business of the Oireachtas more accessible to the general public. It will probably make things easier for us also. In dealing with specific legislation, party spokespersons have a general understanding of it but other Members may not have a detailed knowledge of what is involved. The Bill will help to improve relations between the Oireachtas and the public and I hope it will make the law clearer to people.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_191">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_560">I suppose the citizen is always perplexed in obtaining access to the law and, therefore, the perennial problem has been to cast the law in as intelligible a form as possible. In that way, the citizen may obtain legal instruction, and understand his or her rights, without recourse to professional legal advice. If we could do away with the lawyers it would be an ideal world but we cannot, of course, because problems of legal construction and application will always arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Historically, in republican theory there has always been a demand to make laws as intelligible and straightforward as possible. Clearly, this Bill is part of that process and as such it is to be welcomed. Napoleon Bonaparte shared that ambition and adopted the famous <i>code civil</i> in France at the beginning of the 19th century, which has always been admired as a masterpiece of legal prose. Some of the articles in the Napoleonic code have never been subject to judicial interpretation but, alas, many others have. Within a few months of the code's publication, Napoleon was invited to the launch of a book written by a commentator on the code. He was quite disgusted and said, “My code is lost because the lawyers and commentators have already clarified what I meant when I adopted it”. It is, therefore, a difficult thing to secure codification.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">When one looks back at the mass of material on the Statue Book there is no doubt that, while we have achieved much concerning consolidation and improvements, a lot more could be done. The Bill is part of that process but we should be clear where the process ends. We should be striving for two ideals in this respect. First, the Statute Book  should be codified and I cannot see why that should not be possible given the availability of modern computer techniques. In that way, the entire body of statute law could be restated with the force of law by the Oireachtas on a permanent basis. If such work is achieved swiftly by this legislation it will be possible to restate our laws comprehensively, including enactments of the Irish Free State and even Acts of the old Imperial Parliament, which have continued in force under Article 50 of the Constitution. In fact, some Acts of the old Irish Parliament are still in force from before the Act of Union in 1801.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">It should be possible to restate all this legislation in the format envisaged by the Bill and if that task is undertaken quickly it will be possible to examine the codification project. I welcome the Bill as a step towards the eventual codification of our laws. Codification is important for the citizen because, as legislators, we strive to help the public to understand the law on any given point. The greater the clarity and simplicity of the law's exposition, as stated here by the legislators, the easier it will be for the citizen to understand it.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">The other ideal to which we must pay attention – and, indeed, which the judgments of the superior courts require – is the provision of the law in both official languages. Over the years we have been somewhat remiss in this respect but we must recognise that enormous expenditure implications are involved. The restatement process, however, will help us to progress towards the provision of proper bilingual legislation. For example, we are currently envisaging the immediate consolidation of the sale of goods legislation which has never been translated comprehensively into the first national language, although the opportunity to do so will now arise. It is an important legislative item which sets the template for commercial dealings in the State, including most consumer transactions concerning basic contracts for the sale of goods and for many associated matters. If the restatement now proceeds under the aegis of this legislation, it will present an opportunity to translate legislation in its original form.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">Those are the two ideals for which we should strive but a great deal of effort and resources must go into realising them. Many Deputies may wonder why such legislation is necessary and why, for example, we cannot simply restate the legislation as an administrative measure. When one examines the Bill, the only provision that has an effect on the law in the strict sense is section 5(1), which states:</p>
          <p eId="para_566">A statement purporting to be certified under <i>section 2 </i>shall be <i>prima facie </i>evidence of the law contained in the provisions to which it relates of any statute or statutory instrument.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">At present, one must produce a Stationery Office copy of an Act of the Oireachtas to prove it in a court, which will take judicial notice of it. Under this legislation, a restatement can be produced in  court. I have a slight reservation about that, although I suppose I am not allowed to have such reservations nowadays. My reservation is that when a court construes legislation the sequence of the legislation may be important. If a court is interpreting a section, let us say, of the Sale of Goods Act, 1980, the court may have regard to the historical fact that the particular section was enacted in 1980, and that it amended a provision of 1893. Therefore, the history of the legislation becomes relevant when the court is faced with the task of interpreting a particular provision. If a restatement is used as evidence of the law in court, it would then be more difficult for a court to undertake that exercise. The court, however, can always have recourse to the original legislation in order to clarify the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">I cannot imagine that there will be much controversy about this legislation, although the matters to which I have referred will occasion some debate. I am sure both sides of the House would like to see a greater codification of our law. I take it, also, that everyone in the House would like to ensure the maximum accessibility of all legislation in both official languages.</p>

          <p eId="para_579">Conradh an-dheacair chun déileáil leis is ea conradh Nice.

          <p eId="para_582">Members will be well acquainted with Article 8.1º of the Constitution, which states:</p>

          <p eId="para_584">Members will also be aware of the provisions of Article 25.4.4º, which states:</p>
          <p eId="para_585">Where the President signs the text of a Bill in one only of the official languages, an official translation shall be issued in the other official language.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">Tá buairt orainn maidir le seo, nach bhfuil aon daingniú déanta ins an Bille chun a cinntiú go mbeidh fáil níos tapúla ag Gaeilgeoirí ar an téacs dleathúil ina dteanga féin. We are concerned that this Bill, as it stands, does nothing to safeguard or increase the access of Irish speaking people to legislative texts in their own language – the first official language. This reflects the ongoing neglect – some would say contempt – by legislators for the equal rights of the Irish language. Léiriú é seo ar neamháird leanúnach. Tá súil agam go mbeidh athrú air sin amach anseo toisc an Bille seo agus toisc leasaithe a bheidh ag teacht chun chinn.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">Bhí Sinn Féin chun tosaigh thar na blianta, mar aon lena lán daoine ins an Teach seo, ag déanamh iarracht cothramas a fháil do Ghaeilgeoirí ina dtír féin. Le blianta fada anuas, táimid ag iarraidh go mbeadh na Billí ar fad foilsithe ins an dá theanga  agus go mbeadh an reachtaíocht ar fad aistrithe go Gaeilge muna bhfuil sé déanta roimhe seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">We strongly believe that the laws of this State must be made available in both languages simultaneously, má tá sé chun a bheith clóbhuailte nó má tá sé i bhfoirm leictreonach. Ba cheart go mbeadh an leagan Gaeilge agus an leagan Béarla ar fáil do gach duine ins an Teach seo chomh luath agus atá Bille tairgthe agus go mbeadh sé ar fáil do gach uile dhuine ins an Stát chomh luath agus atá sé rite.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">Níl sé luaite go mbeidh an Bille seo umhail don "constitutional requirement" go mbeadh Billí rite sa dá theanga nó go mbeidh aistriúcháin ar a laghad ann ins an dá theanga. Is botún beag é. Níl sé chomh dáirire sin ach bheadh sé deas dá mbeadh sé ceartaithe amach anseo.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">There is currently a 20 year gap in the production of translations of Acts of the Oireachtas and of Statutory Instruments in Irish. The practice of simultaneous translation was eliminated after 1980. It was another victim of cost-cutting at the time. Indeed, since 1979, only a small number of statutes have been translated. Those few have been done haphazardly and often only in response to litigation or threats of litigation. This current state of affairs maidir leis an nGaeilge is an absolute disgrace. It constitutes nothing less than a gross dereliction of duty in relation to the constitutional requirement under Article 25.4.4º.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">The failure of the State to provide official Irish translations of law and important legal materials was roundly condemned last year by the Supreme Court in Ó Beoláin <i>v.</i> Fahy. In his judgment, Mr. Justice Hardiman found that the situation pertaining at present, where literally decades can elapse between the enacting of legislation in English and its translation into Irish, is “an offence to the letter and spirit of the Constitution”, and evidence of a “policy of inertia” with respect to the constitutional rights of Irish speakers. In her judgment, Ms Justice McGuinness concurred and further concluded that the State was simply unwilling to provide the resources to fulfil its clear constitutional duty, and that it was desirable for the court to publicly stress the mandatory nature of that duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Clearly there needs to be a concerted effort on the part of the State to rectify the problem highlighted by that Supreme Court judgment. Clearly there needs to be consistency in legislation on this point. Indeed, as the case of Ó Beoláin <i>v.</i> Fahy showed, it is utterly irresponsible on the part of the State to continue to leave Acts and legal instruments untranslated, as this situation can leave prosecutions open to constitutional challenges. This situation must end rapidly and this Bill affords us the opportunity to take a step in this direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">We were disappointed to say the least that no commitment to remedying this appeared in the programme for Government. However, it would be entirely appropriate for this legislation to play a positive role, together with the forthcoming  Official Languages Equality Bill, in rectifying this sorry state of affairs. Tá súil agam go ndéanfar sin agus go ndéanfar leasú caoi ar Chéim an Choiste nó ar Chéim na Tuarascála. Tá súil agam go mbeidh mo pháirtí in ann iomlán tacaíochta a thabhairt don mBille seo mar is Bille tábhachtach é a dhéanfaidh an daonlathas agus an córas dlí níos éasca agus níos oscailte don bpobal. Déanfaidh sé obair Bhaill an Oireachtais níos éasca chomh maith nuair atáimid ag déileáil le reachtaíocht sa Teach agus ag moladh leasaithe air.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">Sinn Féin would prefer to see an amendment to provide that any and all such restatements, whether in printed or electronic form be made available simultaneously in both official languages, in keeping with constitutional guarantees and respecting the equal rights of Irish speakers. Ní leor go mbeadh aistriúcháin ar fáil roinnt mí nó roinnt bliana ina dhiaidh ach go mbeidh an dá leagan le fáil ag an am gcéanna.</p>

          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_595">I welcome this Bill, which is designed to modernise the Statute Book or consolidate statutes in order to facilitate readability, as the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper, Statutary Drafting and Interpretation – Plain Language and the Law, recommended. The commission also saw the necessity to update older legislation and to redraft it in modern language and format. Between 50 and 60 Acts are enacted every year, many amending previous Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">We should simplify the process of identifying laws on a particular point. Acts of the Oireachtas will be updated in a more readable and comprehensible form, known as restatements, without the substance of the law being altered, thereby precluding the necessity for approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas. Nevertheless, there should be some form of parliamentary scrutiny of restatements in the interest of accountability, since restatements run closely parallel to the legislation they reflect and which itself emanated from the Oireachtas. Parliament should be consulted in the process before the restatement is finalised and takes effect. This process could be referred to one of the parliamentary committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">The parliamentary draftsmen deserve our highest praise for the work they have carried out. The degree of accuracy and discipline they bring to their work is an example to all.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The language of legislation is not always understandable to Members. This morning Deputy Ring stated that 95% of Members of the House do not understand the language of legislation and I can assure Members that I do not belong to the other 5%. Many of the 5% who understand the language of legislation are solicitors and I am sure their interpretations of it vary, as this is how the members of that profession make their money. One would sometimes think laws are designed to confuse people. Perhaps the parliamentary draftsman could arrange a seminar to help Members in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">Considerable research is necessary to check statutes quoted in legislation and this can prove  a protracted process. The Bill will be instrumental in simplifying legislation and bringing it into the new millennium. It will also make it possible to cite a restatement in court, once it has been clarified by the Attorney General as <i>prima facie </i>evidence of the legislation to which it refers, without the necessity for formal proof.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The updating of legislation on CD-ROM and its presentation on the Oireachtas Internet website will be of immense assistance in making it accessible to a greater audience than before. Most people now have access to computers and the Internet and will now be able to research Acts of the Oireachtas in Ireland and worldwide. There is no greater resource than the Internet for cross-referencing several Acts when one is conducting research into legislation. The site webmaster is to be commended on the consistently high standard of the site and its constant updating. It is a useful resource for Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Restatements will assist in making legislation more user and reader friendly and anything that makes legislation more understandable and accessible to the public is to be welcomed. The Bill is overdue and eminently desirable. The language of legislation should be clear, concise and easily readable. Restatements will be of immense assistance in achieving this. I commend this Bill.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Ms Hanafin)</from>
          <p eId="para_602">I welcome the reaction of Members to the Bill. While I believe everyone in the House welcomes it, a number of questions were raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">Aontaíonn gach éinne a labhair gur chóir go mbeadh reachtaíocht ar fáil i nGaeilge chomh luath agus is féidir, agus ní deich mbliana tar éis an chéad foilsiúcháin. Admháim go bhfuil bearna ann idir Bhille a rith tríd na Tithe agus é a fhoilsiú sa dá theanga. Admháim go bhfuil sin deacair do dhaoine atá ag dul os comhair na cúirteanna. Ainneoin nach bhfuil morán daoine i gceist, ba cheart go mbeadh a gcearta á fháil ag na daoine sin. Tá sé thar a bheith deacair daoine a fháil chun an obair seo a dhéanamh. Tá sé deacair daoine a fháil chun reachtaíocht a ullmhú i nGaeilge in Oifig an Ard Aighne agus uaireanta is gá saineolaithe a thabhairt isteach san oifig ón dtaobh amuigh. Sula ndéantar athráiteas i nGaeilge caithfear an bearna sin a líonadh agus reachtaíocht Béarla a aistriú go Gaeilge chomh luath agus is féidir. Glacaim leis an méid a dúradh agus aontaím go mór leis. Déanfaidh mé féin mo chuid chun féachaint go rachfar ar aghaidh leis sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">We all welcome the fact that the Bill will make legislation more accessible. It is an extraordinary admission of Deputy Ring's, albeit honest, that 95% of those of us who make legislation do not understand the language in it. I am not sure if this is a reflection on us as legislators or on those who draft the legislation. I would not wish to give the impression to the public that we do not understand the legislation we are passing. We study and investigate the minutiae of every word of legislation on Committee Stage and we understand  the principles, thoughts and ideas behind our legislation. Matters become technical when the courts interpret legislation or when officers of the court place various interpretations on it. Every piece of legislation which goes through these Houses is studied carefully, despite the fact that its language may be more technical than we are accustomed to.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">The Bill will make it easier to read Acts, particularly those which have been consolidated and which may be available in several parts, but this does not involve a dumbing down of legal language. Law is law and legal language is legal language. It is not always possible to simplify it for the sake of simplicity. Of course, making legislation more accessible is the aim of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">A number of questions were raised about the process of restatement. Deputy Durkan asked about certification. The Attorney General will certify each Act and we must then see how the restatements will be used. Some people may be suspicious of a restatement but if there is a question of interpretation the original Act will prevail, as Deputy Durkan suggested.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">Deputy Sargent asked which legislation will be dealt with first. Immediately on the passing of this Act the Attorney General will consult with each Department to decide those priorities. They are likely to be those Acts which are regularly in use and those which are spread out over a number of decades with a number of different amendments to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">Deputy Ring raised questions about the language, about Ministers answering questions and about parliamentary questions. There are many things proposed in the Bill, but it will not answer parliamentary questions and it will not change the way Ministers answer them. However, this is an issue the Whips have been discussing and, more importantly, it will be taken up with the issue of Dáil reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">Deputy Sargent asked the reasons for this Bill. It is not isolated legislation. Restatement is part of the wider agenda of public service modernisation. It is recognised by the OECD as an important element of improving the regulatory environment and will encourage people in other areas also. Costs will primarily be absorbed by the greater administrative efficiencies that will be put in place. It will be a strong investment and restatement will ensure that interpretation can be made by the person who is reading legislation rather than that person having to pay big legal fees, as has been mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">A valid question was raised on EU legislation, which Members recognise is written in a language that no individual member country can fully understand. I recall my time working in the European Parliament when everything seemed to include a "whereas", "wherefore" or "thereto" before one got to the nub of the motion. The EU could also take lessons from us on how to proceed. However, I know that at EU level efforts are being made to make legislation more accessible.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">More importantly, there was a welcome admission from Deputy Ó Snodaigh that there is a part of the Nice treaty that he welcomes. That is something the Government will highlight over the next couple of days and we will not confine ourselves to highlighting it only in the Irish language, as he did.</p>

          <p eId="para_615">It would cause mayhem. It was an interesting admission by Deputy Ó Snodaigh and I welcome it. Deputy Sargent asked about restatements and their availability to citizens. Anything that can help groups to understand legislation, as with community groups and residents' associations which wish to understand planning legislation, is helpful. That it will be available on the Internet will help the ordinary citizen to have a better understanding of what we do in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">It is important to note that restatement does not reinterpret or change any of the principles behind the initial Bill. Therefore, there is no need to come back before the Houses again, as Deputy Connolly suggested, because the initial legislation will have been fully understood when it was passed. This Bill is a form of cut and paste job on a variety of legislation. As a courtesy to the Houses, it has to be laid before the Houses by the Attorney General 21 days before it can be used.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">Deputy O'Sullivan acknowledged the amendments which I accepted in the Seanad earlier this year, where we had a very good debate on this. I acknowledge that there are many different issues in relation to legislation which must be addressed. The language of statutes and the attempt to make information, especially pre-1922 legislation, available electronically are difficult issues that will arise down the road but are not necessarily part of this legislation. Deputy Brian Lenihan talked about codifying all Irish law. That should be the ideal outcome of this restatement process.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">This legislation has passed through the Seanad and I hope it has a speedy passage through Committee Stage because, as Members will admit, this is something that is not only of interest to legal people and the courts system but it can also be of benefit to Members of the Houses and the ordinary citizen. I take on board Deputy Connolly's valuable suggestion that there might be a seminar at the parliamentary counsel's office, particularly for new Members and those of us who are here slightly longer and might pretend to know it all but do not. That would be invaluable and I will put it in motion.</p>

          <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_623">To be fair to Deputy Joe Higgins, I do not think that he had begun his contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">I commend the Minister for taking the initiative and introducing this legislation which is hugely important for the working of this House and the Seanad. The Minister mentioned the situation heretofore in which the Members' services committee members would go to his office formally once or twice per year, and informally on other occasions, seeking improvements in conditions in the Houses. All kinds of other approaches were made on behalf of Ministers. With the changes proposed in this Bill, that will not happen anymore and the budget of the Oireachtas will be controlled by Members on a three-year basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">I was chairman of the sub-committee in the last Dáil and I frequently made those journeys to the Minister's office, sometimes accompanied by other Members present in the House today. To be fair, in that Parliament those journeys frequently met with a modicum of success. New Members would be horrified if they were aware of the conditions under which Members operated ten years ago when I became a Member of the House, and they were much worse before that. The recent improvements have had an enormous impact on the efficacy of Parliament and the situation is much better than when resources were not applied to enable people to do the job they were supposed to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">I am glad it will not be necessary for future Members to make the journey to the Minister for Finance's office seeking funding for the running of Parliament. The Bill provides the commission with the necessary financial resources. An interesting provision is that the funding is for  three years. At the end of that time, a further Bill will have to be passed to enable the commission to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">In the course of the Minister's speech, he said that successive Ministers have been conscious of the constitutional independence of Parliament and that they have also been sympathetic to requests for better resources. I do not see much evidence that this was the case. If the Ministers were so conscious, there must also have been a very powerful force that was not because the resources made available to this Parliament and to individual Members compares very poorly with almost all other Parliaments we examined, certainly in Europe, when undertaking the study. It is not stretching the point too far to say that many of the tribunal difficulties which Parliament and the country has had to face and is facing are a direct result of the fact that this Parliament did not have the resources to hold the Executive to account. Many Members would say that those who have been before tribunals played a role in depressing pay and support systems for Members of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">The commission faces an enormous task on several fronts. It needs to carve out a strong role for itself in the area of resourcing the Parliament. It is important that the conflict between business and private funding of ongoing political activity and funding from public sources is resolved. It is entirely different from, and independent of, electoral law and the financing of elections. Many Members are subventing constituency office operations from private or business resources, or by fundraising. Almost every speaker in this debate has illustrated the burden of constituency work which entails enormous financial cost, as well as being quite time-consuming. It militates directly and fundamentally against the legislative and policy work of parliamentarians and it contributes to an ineffective Parliament. This may be the central area that the commission will have to address. The success of the commission in this respect may depend on the provisions of section 5 of the Bill, which I will discuss later.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">Some Members have complained about the impact of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. The level of expenses claimed by Deputies is frequently the subject of unbalanced media coverage. Media commentators never refer to the huge costs associated with operating a constituency office, for example. Rents can be quite high on such offices if they are located in the commercial areas of larger towns. Other costs, such as rates, electricity, insurance and telephone bills, should be taken into account. Perhaps the commission will examine a particular anomaly in relation to telephone costs. It may not be feasible to seek a reduction in the scope of the Freedom of Information Act, but I believe we should adopt the UK system of direct payment for telephone lines. I have five such lines in my office and I assume other Deputies have a similar number for telephones, fax machines and computers. One of the  commission's first undertakings should be to examine the possibility of direct payment for secretarial resources and other office costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">The costs I have mentioned add about €30,000 to the declared expenses of Members. Virtually all Members spend between €40,000 and €50,000 to provide those services for which they receive €30,000. We know that some individuals will misrepresent the facts to make political capital from the level of expenses we receive, but certain things should be done to address our problems. A direct payment system regarding the services I have mentioned is one such measure. It is entirely unsatisfactory that the Executive should have had control over the resources of Parliament. One of the primary duties of Parliament is to hold the Executive to account. I do not doubt that a lack of resources is the primary reason the Executive has not been held to account as effectively here as has been the case in other countries. This lack of resources is evident in terms of independent research support and the fact that there has been virtually no support for committees. The committees of the Houses have had to operate on a shoestring, depending on the goodwill and hard work of committee staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">Most Members have to rely on voluntary effort from those in our communities who are prepared to help us with our research. The fact that such work has not been done professionally is clearly seen in the failure of this Parliament in many respects. Undoubtedly, such failures can be attributed to the fact that Parliament has to depend on the Executive for resources. The international benchmarking review, commissioned from Deloitte &amp; Touche, confirmed that this Parliament is the worst resourced of those examined by a factor of three, four or five. A previous study from the IPA, referred to by Deputy Howlin, found similar results. Funding requirements for the three years of the initial operation of the commission will have to be carefully examined in the context of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report. Some Members are concerned that the three year review will give cause for negative publicity, but I am far less worried about that than I am about the figure in section 5 of the Bill. The commission will fail if the funding issue is not corrected <i>ab initio,</i> as it will not have the resources to succeed.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">I welcome the provision in section 13 of the Bill for an annual statement to the House by the commission. A membership of 11, as provided for in section 8, is workable. I do not share the concerns of Members who have difficulties with the fact that the Secretary General of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas will be a member of the commission. I see the role of the Secretary General as being more like a chief executive officer than a commission member. The Bill also provides that the Ceann Comhairle will be the chairman of the commission. I understand that one of the reasons for this provision is to avoid conflict between the role of Ceann Comhairle and the role of chairman, if they were separate. The commission is, in effect, administrative in  nature, while the Houses of the Oireachtas are regulated under Article 15.10 of the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">We encountered difficulties in the past when legal action was taken by, or on behalf of, the House, but this area will be addressed by the proposed legislation. The commission will be in a position to make legal advice available to Members. More importantly, it will have the right, with the permission of the Houses, to be a party to legal proceedings. The fact that the institutions of the Houses have not heretofore provided any entity, on behalf of Members, which could be a party to legal proceedings has been a great weakness. The Attorney General was in a position to do so on behalf of the Executive, but the Parliament had no such right. Apart from the resourcing issue, this may well become the most important element of this Bill. In my capacity as chairman of the working group of committee chairmen, I am familiar with the work of the existing office which advises Parliament on legal matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">During the last Dáil, the courts seriously circumscribed the role of Parliament. Indeed, the Parliament was not seen as a legal entity to the extent of being allowed to be a party to the proceedings. The courts have ruled, in effect, that the role of Parliament is confined to legislation and holding the Executive to account, but there is a significant grey area beyond that, as Deputies Howlin and Richard Bruton have pointed out in the course of this debate. This grey area is apparent when an attempt is made to examine the workings and efficacy of semi-State bodies, value for money, or financial and taxation issues. Such an attempt was made by the sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts, which examined revenue matters, including DIRT. I do not doubt that the sub-committee advanced substantially the role of Parliament and, particularly, led many people to believe that Parliament could have a central role in improving their lives. I hope the commission will study this grey area as a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">When this Dáil comes to an end, I hope we will not be lamenting the fact that we did not take this opportunity to flesh out the role of Parliament. It will be a shame if the commission fails to, or is prevented from, pushing out the boundaries. If we expand the role of Parliament as I have suggested, the next generation will not have to ask tribunals to investigate matters which occurred 20 or 30 years previously. The commission should have a proactive role in Dáil reform. The committees, for example, would be drawn into the legislative framework much sooner than is the case currently. There is no reason for a Minister not to appear before a committee following the drafting of the heads of a Bill. Neither is there a reason for professional lobbyists or lobby groups such as the IFA, IBEC and the trade unions not to conduct their business openly and transparently before Oireachtas committees. Reports on such proceedings should, consequently, become policy at some level or at a very mini mum the Minister to whom the committees report should be obliged to return to Parliament with a view on the policy set down and with initiatives, legislative or otherwise, that may be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">Deputy Richard Bruton stated in his contribution that Oireachtas committees are viewed with contempt by Departments and Ministers. I assume he knows what he is talking about given that he served as a Minister. Those of us who have put a great deal of effort into various aspects of committee work have been forced to come to the conclusion that most of it has been in vain because the reports are shelved or put away and not acted on. Perhaps when the new committees are established, some at least will pay tribute to their predecessors by examining the reports they prepared.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">Deputy Bruton also stated the Oireachtas is a second rate Parliament and we are suffering the contempt of the people. He is close enough to being correct and this could be addressed more pro-actively under the commission than has been the case heretofore. He also placed an onus on Government backbenchers to play the role of opposition. I do not know whether that is a compliment or whether it is his view of the capacity of his side of the House to provide opposition. However, he is correct to an extent and the Whips system has played a central role in reducing the efficacy of Parliament, particularly in making it less effective at holding the Executive to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">We need to move forward to create a good, functioning Parliament that can make changes for the better in people's lives. Even the era of partnership, which many people hold has pushed Parliament aside, could benefit from a Parliament with more authority which would certainly beget a Government with authority. Deputies Bruton and Howlin, who are both former Ministers, indicated in their contributions that Government wants to be as unaccountable as possible and it does not want a troublesome, questioning Parliament. I must take their word for it but, if that is the case, the onus is on Parliament to change that.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">Secondary legislation is one area in which the Houses have played virtually no role. Generally, such legislation has been churned through invisible bureaucracy in Europe or elsewhere, found its way to a Department where it frequently stays prisoner for an interminable period and, ultimately, is released into the Oireachtas Library before it is rubber-stamped in the House through a motion without debate. Secondary legislation has an enormous impact on people's lives and on the social, political and economic life of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">There is a proposal that Departments will in future prepare an information note which will be sent to committees so that, at the very least, they will be in a position to examine secondary legislation. That is to be welcomed, but such a proposal will also increase the burden on those Members who believe they have a parliamentary  role as well as a representative role. The more the burden is increased, the more difficult it is for them to carry it out effectively. The commission will need to be pro-active in this area. It would be a great mistake in the long-term if the commission was curtailed under the terms of the consultants' report. That would be a better starting point than where we are at now. However, I do not accept it will be the ideal point in terms of resources in a few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">Deputy Ring and others pointed out strongly that Members who contributed significantly to the previous Dáil in terms of legislation, policy and work on committees were not returned at the election because they were unable to fulfil both their parliamentary and representative roles. They did not have the time or resources to do so. If there is one monkey we need off our backs if we are interested in undertaking parliamentary work, it is constituency work, which takes up enormous time. The resources needed to address constituency work would not be expensive to provide if the Oireachtas accepted that Members have a dual role which they need to fulfil effectively. If they are to be returned to the House, they must look after constituency work. However, if we want an effective Parliament, Members must be in a position to attend to their legislative roles.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">Michael Gallagher, Michael Laver and Michael Marsh published an interesting report in 1997 through the Policy Institute, Trinity College, which examined the role of Oireachtas committees. The report was published, examined and not considered by anybody again. It is still relevant and, while I disagree strongly with two or three of its recommendations, I concur with most of them. The authors view the role of committees "as streamlining and improving the process of legislation, scrutinising Government Departments, advising on particular policy problems". They also stated the committee system "further needs to find a way to vindicate the increasingly important role of investigating matters of major public concern". It will fall to the commission to address that issue. The authors also state "committees should have both a right and an obligation to have time set aside to have their reports debated in the Dáil and Seanad. If a committee's report points to a need for Government action, the report should be forwarded to the appropriate Government Department with a requirement that a Minister report back to the Dáil on progress within a specified period".</p>
          <p eId="para_643">I welcome the establishment of the commission but I hope its role will be challenged by us so that it does not operate in a back room, invisible and ineffective in terms of the future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_209">
          <from>Mr. O'Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_644">I agree with much of the previous contribution. The legislation is welcome and the debate is important. The primary issues one must address when elected to the House is how efficient a service one can provide to one's constituents, how to deal with legislation as it is pro cessed and how the House can make the Government more accountable. The commission is a good concept as Members will no longer have to go cap in hand to Ministers seeking funding for essential services which are necessary but are currently not provided. Earlier in the debate many compliments were paid to the Minister for Finance for introducing the legislation and looking after the Members and I acknowledge that is his intention.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">I am most bothered by the question of the transparency of Government. Ministers come into the House with prepared scripts and Opposition Members must constructively challenge what they propose. The tools available to Members are inadequate but I acknowledge the first class service provided by staff in preparation for debates. The administrative staff in the Oireachtas and all other Departments are helpful and user friendly when one seeks information. The library staff are first class. They will always try to find requested material in time for a debate, often at short notice. This commission will empower the Dáil to employ more people in these areas. There must be proper research and policy development facilities in the Parliament. A significant increase, as proposed here, in the number of research staff in the library is essential. Those people should be available to all sides of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">The IT section has undergone significant improvements, particularly in the reference materials it has made available. Members have an on-line subscription to <i>The Irish Times</i> and <i>The Economist</i> and links to the European Parliament. The access we have through Lotus Notes to Oireachtas debates and parliamentary questions is worthwhile. It is impossible, however, for a Member to do everything on his own. As a Member of the Dáil who was formerly a Senator, I have gone from sharing a secretary to having my own, a tremendous improvement for me so I can work with that person six days a week, but it is still inadequate for the job in hand. The proposal of the report which states that Oireachtas Members should have an extra member of staff is the most important thing the Government could do to assist Members so they can do their job properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">The income for our secretaries is inadequate. Payments across Departments are related but we should be able to set our own salary scales for staff, independent of other Departments. The word "secretary" is a poor job title when one thinks of the work these people do. It includes acting as a personal assistant, researcher, policy officer and press officer. They do myriad jobs and should be much better paid than at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Committees will be starting shortly and they involve even more work. We might like to be in five places at one time but it is impossible for a Member to do a proper day's work without adequate staff. If the commission established by this Bill addresses these issues it will be very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">It is the task of the Opposition to put the Government through the hoops. Very few of us are lawyers and getting independent legal advice is difficult for the Opposition. The big guns are on the side of the Government of the day, with hundreds of civil servants and special advisors working for it. In Opposition there is no such capacity. We need legal advice on Bills where legislation requires specialist knowledge that a personal assistant might not have. Collective wisdom should be available to Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">Front Bench spokespersons are individuals who struggle with whole Departments. There should be specialist resources for those on the Front Benches. This is perhaps not fair to Independent Members but those who have to conduct research because of their Front Bench position should have adequate support.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">In a true democracy, the Opposition should be as well resourced as possible so it can deal with the issues of the day. Our Opposition does not have adequate resources but this Bill goes a long way towards addressing the issue. We must continue the scrutiny of Government decision making if it is to remain transparent. In the absence of this commission, we are not doing the job the people want us to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">We must give effective and efficient service in our constituencies but we need more resources to do so. Members receive a grant of €9,000 per annum for office rental but it is impossible to get an office on a main street with a shop front in any town for that amount. It must be increased. There is another €9,000 grant to help to install facilities such as PCs, desks and a public area and, again, this is inadequate. We must offer a modern, first class service to constituents. I hope that the Minister for Finance and the commission which will be set up under the Bill address that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">We must change the way we work, making use of better resources. This Bill is a step in the right direction.</p>

          <from>Mr. Dennehy</from>
          <p eId="para_654">The proposals in this Bill will lead to a radical change in the structure of this House and the Seanad. The commission will enhance the independence of the Houses of the Oireachtas and represent a watershed in our democracy. This is the first stage on the long road to redressing the adage "strong Government, weak Parliament". Some of us have seen many changes in procedure in various Dálaí and this commission will continue the process set in motion by the other welcome changes of the past ten years. I join in the tributes to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. Other Ministers have been involved in change – Deputy Cullen in his role at the Office of Public Works and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, when he was Government Chief Whip, but the Minister for Finance has been central to them all.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">It is easy to pay lip service to the need for Dáil reform.</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_211">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_684">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 28, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">On 25 June, I reported in detail to the House on my preparations for and attendance at the European Council in Seville, which included preparatory meetings at home and abroad with the Heads of Government of a number of member states. In the course of my statement I dealt at some length with the declarations made in Seville which have been laid before the House. While I do not propose to further take up the valuable time of the House in reiterating what I said on that occasion, it is worthwhile to restate the reasons the Government is calling for a "Yes" vote on Saturday. I have made it clear that I fully understand and respect the concerns which caused many people to vote "No" to the Nice treaty last year. There was a lack of information and fears on issues such as neutrality and many felt their concerns were not being taken seriously. Before we put the treaty to the people again, we set out honestly and to the best of our efforts to address these concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">During the general election campaign, we set out our intention to hold a second referendum and are now asking the people to reconsider their decision and vote "Yes". There are four key reasons for doing so. The Nice treaty is a good deal for Ireland. We continue to punch above our weight in terms of voting and membership of the Commission and this enlargement, as with every previous one, will be good for Irish business. Full engagement with Europe has allowed our generation to reap economic and social rewards undreamed of by our parents. The European Union is the space within which we have prospered and Nice, while in many ways a minor treaty, will enable Europe to grow and develop. It can only be in our interest to help it to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">We have radically changed the question posed in the referendum and the amendment put to the people will place a complete bar on Ireland taking part in a European common defence. There will now be a total constitutional protection against Ireland joining a European army. At Seville, every member state of the Union confirmed that our policy of military neutrality is unaffected by Nice or any other European treaty. The European Union is about peace not war and this amendment strengthens further Ireland's neutrality.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">A second "No" vote will prevent Europe enlarging as planned. Whether we like it, we will be blamed for the inevitable delay and confusion in the enlargement process. The applicant states have worked hard to get ready for the EU and will themselves have referenda on membership. Are we to deny them that choice? A second "No" carries enormous risks. It can only make Ireland less attractive to investors and lessen our influence when negotiating in Europe. This will damage Irish jobs, Irish farming and Irish society. I have asked again and again for the economic case for a "No" vote and I have not heard it. This decision is one of the most important we will ever make as a people and the younger generation, including my children, will have to deal with its consequences. I urge all who have a vote to exercise it. When we vote next Saturday we will be faced with a momentous decision. National, European and personal interests will be served by voting "Yes". The risks lie with a "No" vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">I attended the inaugural international convention of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, which was held in Dublin Castle on 28 and 29 August. It was a most worthwhile undertaking providing a forum for debate on all aspects of the European social model. In the course of my opening address to the forum, I indicated that Ireland is committed to a Europe that continues to develop and can respond to global challenges in an effective way. I stressed my strong belief that there must be no question of treating Europe purely as an economic entity. The social dimension is an absolute requirement for a Europe that works to the benefit of all its people.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">I met the Prime Minister of Finland, Mr. Paavo Lipponen, on 12 September last. We discussed a range of issues, including enlargement, and I was delighted to be able to brief him on the Government's campaign to ratify the Treaty of Nice. On 27 September I had a meeting with the Prime Minister of Slovenia whose visit was part of the intensive preparations for Slovenia's imminent membership of the European Union. The Prime Minister was also here to officially open the Slovenian Embassy in Dublin. We welcomed this as an opportunity to further strengthen diplomatic relations between our two countries and discussed Slovenia's preparations for membership of the European Union as we enter the final phase of the accession negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">I congratulated the Prime Minister on Slovenia's political and economic progress, noting that Slovenia is a leading candidate in the accession process. We discussed the Commission's proposals for transitional arrangements for the candidate countries, including the allocation of Structural Funds, and agreed to strengthen and develop bilateral economic relations to encourage investment between Ireland and Slovenia. I updated the Prime Minister on the Nice referendum campaign and welcomed the joint statement made by the ten main candidate countries on 25 September in Warsaw, which reiterated the importance of the Nice treaty in the accession process. The Prime Minister stressed that importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">The World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg was a ten year review of the 1992 Earth Summit. The purpose of the summit was to reinvigorate global commitment to sustainable development. I attended the summit from 2 to 4 September and addressed the plenary session on 3 September. I participated in a round table discussion, chaired by the Prime Minister of Sweden, on the implementation of new sustainable social, environmental and economic measures. The summit adopted a plan of implementation which is a detailed action programme covering all facets of sustainable development. It reaffirms existing UN commitments and other international agreements, particularly in relation to the eradication of poverty in developing countries, and brings economic, social and environmental actions together under one umbrella. It seeks to develop an institutional framework to monitor and promote its goals. New targets for access to sanitation and health care, more efficient use of chemicals and restoration of fish stock levels should help focus international action in these areas. From a developmental perspective, one of the most important achievements in the plan is the reaffirmation of the commitment of the international community to achieving the UN target of contributing 0.7% of GNP to overseas development assistance. I reiterated Ireland's commitment to reaching that target by 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">While in South Africa, I had the opportunity to launch a new Ireland Aid HIV and Aids regional initiative at Soul city, a local non-governmental organisation. I also met Irish missionaries and NGOs who are working in the region. I had a meeting with Kader Asmal, Minister for Education in the Government of South Africa, and we discussed a range of bilateral issues, including scope for educational exchanges. I also met the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan. In addition to our discussions on sustainable development, we reviewed a number of issues of current concern to the Security Council, including events in the Middle East, Iraq and Afghanistan. I also met the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, with whom I discussed issues pertaining to the summit. In view of the imminent end of her term  of office as High Commissioner, I took the opportunity to congratulate her on her exemplary term in office and I echoed the pride of the Irish people on her splendid achievements.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">I telephoned the President of the Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat, on 21 September at his compound in Ramallah where he was under siege. He described the prevailing conditions in the region and repeated his condemnation of the suicide bombings and attacks on Israeli civilians. I told him that Ireland would continue to work through the EU and the United Nations Security Council to relieve the present state of affairs. While Israeli forces have drawn back from their siege positions, their continuing occupation of the area remains a cause for concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">I attended the fourth Asia-Europe meeting in Copenhagen on 23 and 24 September. The summit was attended by leaders from ten Asian nations, the European Union member states and the President of the European Commission. It was divided into three main sessions covering political dialogue, economic co-operation and social, cultural and environmental issues and a copy of the chairman's statement on the summit's outcome has been laid before the House. Discussions in the first session focused on the international climate in the aftermath of 11 September and on new security issues to combat international terrorism and trans-national organised crime. Leaders agreed to issue a declaration on co-operation against international terrorism a copy of which has been laid before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">The second session discussed progress in economic co-operation between Asia and Europe. The leaders endorsed the outcome of the ASEM Economic Ministers meeting, which was held in Copenhagen prior to the summit. They agreed to use the ASEM process to increase consultation and dialogue in the run-up to the WTO ministerial meeting in Mexico in 2003. The Asian partners referred to the rehabilitation of their economies and the need for closer co-operation within their own region and between Europe and Asia on trade and investment. All participants expressed support for a strong and vibrant multilateral trading system.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">At the invitation of Prime Minister Rasmussen, I was the lead speaker on the European side at the third session on social, cultural and environmental issues. My contribution focused on the importance of lifelong learning at national and European level and the experience which could be shared with our Asian partners. I referred to the progress of the ASEM lifelong learning initiative undertaken by Denmark, Ireland, Singapore and Malaysia. The initiative must serve two purposes. First, to ensure employability and sustain economic growth and, second, to ensure active citizenship and reduce social exclusion. I place great importance on investing in this area in the broadest sense if we are to take advantage of the opportunities and minimise the problems presented by globalisation. There is a growing gap between developed and developing countries  in their access to information and communication technologies. This digital divide will only be bridged when the underlying causes, such as poor governance and the implementation of economic reform, are dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">As part of our overall Asia Strategy, Ireland agreed to support a number of initiatives endorsed at the summit through exchange of expertise. These included an ASEM workshop to be hosted by Germany in 2003 on employment and labour and an ASEM seminar to be hosted by Japan in 2003 on education exchange. There was also some discussion at the session on environmental initiatives in the follow up to the recent Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. The leaders endorsed an Italian offer to host a meeting of ASEM Environment Ministers in 2003. While my schedule did not permit any formal bilateral meetings, I spoke to several of the participants in the margins of the summit.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">On 10 October the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Czech Republic paid a courtesy call on me while on a visit to Dublin for substantive discussions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I will attend the European Council in Brussels on 24 and 25 October. The Presidency intends to limit the agenda primarily to enlargement, including related budgetary and financial issues and the situation regarding Kaliningrad. The Council will also hear a progress report on work in the Convention on the Future of Europe from its President, Mr. Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. There will also be a meeting with the President of the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">In preparation for the Council, Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark visited Dublin yesterday as part of his tour of capitals. We had a useful discussion on the agenda items. Enlargement and Saturday's referendum dominated our discussion. The Prime Minister was at pains to point out that while all the member and applicant states fully respect Ireland's right to make its own decision, approval of the Nice treaty is essential if enlargement is to take place on schedule. The Prime Minister also stressed to me and at our subsequent press conference that there is no so-called Plan B.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">As regards future plans, I will have a bi-lateral meeting with Prime Minister Simitis of Greece <i>en marge</i> of the Brussels Council. No other bi-laterals are planned, but they may arise if circumstances dictate.</p>

I join the Taoiseach in congratulating the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, who is a Mayo person, for the distinction with which she served and the courage she brought to bear during her tenure of office.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">As regards the Taoiseach's attendance at the Earth Summit in Johannesburg, who can we believe? The Taoiseach clearly outlined to the  summit, although the venue was not full at the time, that this country and his Government intended to increase its overseas budget to 0.7% of GDP. Given that the budget has been significantly slashed since then and that the borrowing requirement next year will be €1.7 billion, will the Taoiseach confirm to the House that the allocation for overseas aid in this year's budget will be increased to meet the target of 0.7% of GDP by 2007?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_704">The target is to reach 0.7%. Our economic growth was so great over the past five years we had to use more resources to achieve the interim target of 0.45%. We had to put in tens of millions of euros extra and we achieved that. Although it is a more difficult time, it is still the Government's aim to reach that target. Few countries have made the progress we have made in the past two years. Unlike other countries, our aid figure is not tied aid; it is straightforward. I am not claiming credit for that as that has been the position here for many years. Other countries quote figures which are tied aid. When that is analysed, one can clearly see the real figures. There is no need for me to go into detail as that has been done in recent articles. That is our commitment. We have given enormous resources over the past five years, although economic growth has made it more difficult. We will continue to do that.</p>

I look forward to that target being maintained. The people involved in this area are extremely concerned about what has happened to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">As regards talk about an invasion of Iraq and military action being taken by the United States, will the Dáil be consulted before any decision is taken given that we have a seat on the United Nations Security Council? This matter has been raised by Deputy Gay Mitchell on a number of occasions. There is genuine concern about what is happening. People strongly believe there should be discussion on this issue and that the Dáil should make a decision. Has the Government considered that people are concerned about refuelling facilities at Shannon? If the United States takes military action in Iraq without a UN mandate, will those facilities continue to be extended to the US?</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_215">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_707">This country is a strong advocate of the system of collective international security based on the United Nations charter. All the comments made by me and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs emphasise that the terms of the UN charter should be followed. The UN Security Council has primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace. All member states of the United Nations are bound by the  charter. Any decisions made on this matter should be made by the Security Council and no one else. We and our people have worked hard at the Security Council in recent weeks to ensure that the international consensus is that the Iraq regime poses a potential threat to regional security and that it has failed to meet its obligations under international law and the relevant Security Council resolutions. It is still our view that all the discussions should take place at a diplomatic level and within the Security Council and that we should continue to work within the Security Council. We have firmly tied ourselves in the past six weeks of intensive debate at the Security Council to supporting the position of Kofi Annan and we will continue to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">I hope the United States does not take any action on its own. It is better that this decision is made. Deputy Kenny is aware that the permanent members are coming to completion of their deliberations. It is likely that in the coming days – I do not know the precise date, although I was trying to find out last night – their work will come back to the Security Council for further discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">As regards the question about the overflight area, that decision is made under the Air Navigation and Transport Act. It is decided on a case by case basis, as it was last year and other years. That will not arise until we see what happens. It is better for Iraq, its neighbours, the region, the United States and the Security Council if this matter is dealt with diplomatically and if pressure is put on Iraq to fulfil the UN charter which is to comply with the inspectors and with all the relevant regulations. Depending on its terms, we will support a resolution which clarifies and stipulates how the inspectors should be allowed to do their job so it is fulfilled for the world to see.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_711">As the Taoiseach has answered 28 questions covering a diverse set of subjects, it is difficult to formulate a set of questions in response. Therefore, I will confine myself to two distinct questions. The first relates to the forthcoming referendum on which voting will take place on Saturday. Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that the Government has adopted three initiatives from the Labour Party, all of which we welcome? The first of these was the establishment of the National Forum on Europe which has been a great success and has helped commence a dialogue, which has long since been necessary, about our relationship with the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Does the Government accept that the European Union Bill, which has been passed by the House and is due to be passed by the Seanad, was a Labour Party Bill tabled and accepted on Second Stage in June last year? It was a Labour Party initiative to address the domestic democratic deficit, which was modified by this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">Does the Government accept that despite the advice of Iveagh House, it was absolutely essential, having regard to the IMS poll in <i>The Star,</i> that the issue of neutrality would be separated  and incorporated in our Constitution in the form in which it has been? In this context, I welcome the presence of the Minister for Defence. Does the Taoiseach agree that the Labour Party has played a constructive role in this House on an issue of major importance which crosses the partisan divide of the political parties, namely, our integrated and deeply involved membership of the European Union?</p>
          <p eId="para_714">This first set of questions is easy. All the Taoiseach has to do is say "Yes" to all three of its elements because they are all true. The members of the Government did not produce a single idea and we, in the Labour Party, rescued them. The Taoiseach knows this from the Gothenburg Summit.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">More importantly, I have adopted a view that I would never attack the Taoiseach while he was abroad representing the country. He has now returned from Johannesburg. The Taoiseach can con us because we have a way of getting back at him, namely, by voting him out of office, but he should not con the rest of the nations of the world on our behalf. I was going to use the word liar, but you barred its use last week, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>

The proposal was made in this House and I readily agreed to it. I also agree that the forum has proved to be enormously beneficial. Over the past 12 or 15 months it has extended into the communities the valuable work which had been done in a tight and closed way by other organisations. It was a good proposal and the forum, which has worked well, should continue. If the issue is given back to an intellectual group, it will not get out into the wider public arena. European issues have been debated the length and breadth of the country in the past 12 months and we have seen that they affect all the people in a very positive way, whether in training, environmental issues or other matters.

          <p eId="para_753">Two issues are worth reiterating with regard to the research the Deputy mentioned. We are in agreement on the matter. First, there is the declaration which was issued and signed by all 15 European Union members. It spells out very clearly that our neutrality is fully protected now and into the future. In the new declaration every other EU member state has confirmed full respect and support for our policy on neutrality and the fact that the Nice treaty and all other EU treaties do not affect our policy on neutrality. In the discussions we agreed that, while that is the case, we would insert a provision to this effect in the Constitution to put the matter beyond doubt now and until such time as the people so decide – if they ever do, which is their right – some time in the dim and distant future. We agreed to do that and anybody who cares about Irish military neutrality or Irish neutrality in any of its forms—</p>

This amendment is logical, particularly in terms of enlargement. It will improve the effectiveness of EU participation in trade negotiations without diminishing member states' involvement in them. It is particularly relevant in relation to the ongoing multilateral negotiations in the World Trade Organisation on the further liberalisation of world trade in goods and services.

          <p eId="para_799">On neutrality, I have been asked a fair question by the Deputy Higgins. He asked me to deal with the summary of the Nice treaty, which is the declaration, and what is in the constitutional referendum. I wish to make the following points. Membership of the European Union poses no threat to Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality. The EU is a partnership in which each member respects the traditions and priorities of the other. For Ireland, this means our military neutrality is respected by our EU partners and spelt out in the Seville Declaration. The Government recognise that neutrality is an important issue to the Irish people. That is why it made sure all the necessary safeguards protecting neutrality were included in the Nice treaty. This was made clear at the Seville Council in June when I secured the agreement of our EU partners to two declarations. In the national declaration the Government stated clearly that Ireland will  not participate in a European common defence unless the Irish people decide otherwise in a referendum nor will Ireland participate in a European army.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">The declaration also confirmed that Defence Forces can participate in a peace support mission only if there is UN authorisation, a government decision or the approval of Dáil Éireann, and this includes any future mission undertaken by the European Union. Furthermore, the Government will make its own sovereign decision to participate in any future mission on a case by case basis, the triplelock guarantee which I outlined many times. The Defence Forces have a long and respected experience of peacekeeping with the UN and the steps that the EU has taken to develop a capacity to undertake peace support operations is in full conformity with the tradition and with the UN's approach—</p>

How can the Taoiseach reconcile his very laudable comments made in  Johannesburg recently and the Government's decision to cut overseas development aid? The Taoiseach stated that the summit reaffirmed the need to increase ODA to the UN target of 0.7% of GNP and also placed emphasis on the importance of fighting AIDS. Is it not the case that ODA from the State has already been cut this year and that this makes it less likely that we will reach this target? Does the Taoiseach recognise that we would need to increase our commitment to overseas development aid annually in order to reach the UN target? Does he recognise that this is something the vast majority of people would want from this or any other Government?</p>

Surely they should be at one with each other rather than at odds. Can the Taoiseach acknowledge that in article 1.2, amending article 27, of the Nice treaty we are sweeping away the references to the Western European Union? That is an organisation we have not been prepared to join, which is understandable if we are to be neutral. Does that not present him with a dilemma in maintaining that we are still neutral?</p>
          <p eId="para_813">Will the Taoiseach allow a debate and vote in this House over the use of Shannon Airport by the American airforce? He did not answer that earlier. Interim targets for overseas development aid were part of the Government programme. They have now been set aside and the Taoiseach talks about the final 2007 target. Can the Taoiseach give us year-by-year interim targets for overseas development aid?

A substantial number of people in this country have had difficulties with the  transposition into Irish law of existing regulations and directives that have nothing to do with the Nice treaty. While I am not asking the Taoiseach to withdraw any of those, would he consider advising some of his Ministers to consider reviewing some of those applying common sense? Some of those transpositions have changed people's attitudes to the treaty. In view of all the misinformation peddled by the "No" campaign, will the Taoiseach confirm that all the applicant countries fully endorse the Nice treaty and fully recognise that it is essential for the process of enlargement to take place.</p>

          <p eId="para_818">I understand the point raised by Deputy Kenny on the issue of directives. The question of clarifying subsidiarity and devising treaties in a clearer way has already been raised in the European Convention. Whether or not that is achieved is another issue. The air navigation Acts are being looked at and various security committees are examining security at Shannon Airport and elsewhere. The applicant countries have all but pleaded for our support so that their own process can move ahead.</p>

          <p eId="para_821">Deputy McGrath asked a question on the Middle East. Since the discussions that I had at the Security Council we have succeeded in getting the support of other European countries on moving to try to alleviate the pressures. On one side we acknowledge the difficulties for the Israeli community with suicide bombers, but we also acknowledge the rights of the Palestinian people. We have already had resolutions on that but have not had much success.</p>

      <b>Mr. Naughten</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Transport</b>
      the plans he has in the short to medium term under the national development plan to address traffic congestion in Dublin city centre; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [18473/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_324">
          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</from>
          <p eId="para_834">Within the framework of the national development plan a wide range of initiatives have been taken to upgrade Dublin's transport infrastructure and services. These include major investment in the upgrading of the national road network. In the Dublin city and county areas alone, major road projects to a total value of approximately €1.4 billion are currently under construction. Major road projects critical to managing Dublin transport include: the Dublin Port tunnel, which will significantly reduce the number of heavy goods vehicles using the city centre; the south-eastern motorway, which forms the final part of the C-ring; the construction of a second bridge at the West Link, designed to alleviate congestion at this pressure point on the motorway, is also under way; and the Cloghran-Balbriggan section of the M1 northern motorway.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">Projects under way on the N11 – Glen of the Downs and Rathnew-Ashford bypasses – and N7 – Kildare bypass – will also assist in improving traffic flow in the Dublin area. These major improvements are vital for improved road  capacity and they will substantially complete the major road network around the city area.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">The national development plan also provides for investment of more than €3 billion in public transport and traffic management in the period to 2006. Of this, approximately €2 billion will be investment in the greater Dublin area. Since 1997, demonstrable improvements in public transport arrangements and services have been implemented: the Dublin Bus fleet has been expanded significantly through the purchase of more than 600 new buses; Bus Éireann has purchased 74 new buses to upgrade long distance commuter services in the greater Dublin area; there are now nine QBCs in place in Dublin and work is continuing on further routes; 160 kilometres of dedicated cycleways have been provided; traffic management and control systems have been upgraded; taxi numbers have increased significantly; major capacity improvements have been made to rail services including platform lengthening, the provision of additional DART and diesel rail cars, extension of the DART service to Greystones and Malahide and the completion of the Maynooth-Clonsilla rail line upgrade, and progress has been made on developing the new Luas system.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">Starting next month, Irish Rail will begin accepting delivery of 80 new diesel rail cars to further expand capacity on the outer suburban network around Dublin and Cork. Capacity improvements will flow from the improved signalling and track work on the approaches to Heuston Station, the provision of additional platforms, the allocation of additional rail cars and increasing train lengths during rush hour periods. Further DART capacity improvements are planned through re-signalling work at Connolly Station, the lengthening of platforms on the DART line to accommodate eight-car DARTs, upgrading the overhead power supply to accommodate the longer trains and the purchase of a further 40 DART cars.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"><i>Additional information</i>Funds are also being provided for the development of an integrated ticketing system for Dublin by 2005 as well as a real time passenger information system. In the meantime, I have asked my officials to discuss with CIE more innovative fare structures to facilitate transfer between bus and rail services using existing technologies.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">The measures implemented to date and the completion of the major projects in construction and planning will have a major beneficial impact on traffic flows in Dublin. The investment in public transport is providing a viable alternative to the private car for many commuters. The quality and quantity of public transport will continue to improve with the advent of Luas and the further rail and bus investment and service improvements I have outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">More remains to be done. The DTO policy document "A Platform for Change", sets out a comprehensive integrated strategy to respond to  the transportation needs of the greater Dublin area, GDA, in the period to 2016. It is providing the framework for the future development of Dublin's transport network. The Government has already formally approved the procurement process for a metro in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">This Government has been pro-active in responding to the challenge of traffic congestion and has demonstrated its commitment to transforming our transport infrastructure by providing unprecedented levels of investment since 1997. The establishment of an integrated Department of Transport will bring a renewed focus to our efforts to upgrade transport infrastructure and services in Dublin and throughout the country.</p>

        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_325">
          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_842">In his comprehensive reply, the Minister did not refer to the Dublin metro. Perhaps such a reference was made at the end of his reply and will only appear in the Official Report. The Dublin metro is obviously not at the top of his list of priorities. Given that the consultants' report has indicated that it will cost €20 billion and ten years to complete the Dublin metro, will the Government shelve the proposal and consider more feasible alternatives such as a heavy rail link to Dublin Airport or the opening of the Phoenix Park tunnel? I accept that Irish Rail is considering the long-term potential of the Phoenix Park tunnel, but what is the short-term alternative? Would it not be feasible to put in place a shuttle service between Heuston Station and Connolly Station which could relieve traffic on the quays?</p>

          <p eId="para_845">The Government has already approved the procurement process for a metro in Dublin. Approval has been given to proceed with planning of the system. It is no secret that funding has not been allocated for this project, which is still at the planning stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">The tunnel from Heuston to Connolly is one of a number of options being considered. The Deputy will agree that it is important that we should integrate the public transport system in the capital. If it was possible, both technically and financially, to proceed with the tunnel, I would be in favour of it.</p>

          <p eId="para_849">Yes, but the Minister stated that the Dublin Port tunnel is a major element of the  initiative to address traffic congestion in Dublin city. Given that 10% of vehicles – 53,000 – per annum will not be able to use the Dublin Port tunnel and will be forced to travel through the city centre, what does the Minister propose to do other than implementing the Taoiseach's proposal to ban these trucks from the city centre?</p>

          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_851">With respect, my initial question referred to plans to address traffic congestion in Dublin city centre. The Minister stated that one of the key elements in those plans is the Dublin Port tunnel, which will remove heavy goods vehicles from the city centre. What does he plan to do about the 10% of such vehicles which will not be able to use the tunnel, particularly given that a second ferry capable of carrying such vehicles is about to come on stream?</p>

          <p eId="para_853">I am not sure what to do. The Deputy's supplementary is proper to the next question but I would be happy to deal with it if I am permitted to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">The Dublin Port Company undertook a survey of all trucks exiting the port in June and July of this year which indicated that 98% of all trucks were less than 4.6 metres in height. The height restriction which applies to the tunnel, which has a clearance height of 4.9 metres, is 4.6 metres. It is higher than most European tunnels where height limits apply and it fully complies with an EU directive which requires that tunnels must be able to accommodate heavy goods vehicles up to four metres in height. Given that the tunnel will be able to cater for 98% of trucks and will operate well within the EU limit, I am satisfied that the issue has been dealt with.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_856">The design and construction of the Dublin Port tunnel is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, in co-operation with the relevant local authority. Dublin City Council and the National Roads Authority have developed the Dublin Port tunnel to the highest international standards in terms of safety, both as regards construction and operation. The project was the subject of a lengthy public inquiry during March-April 1999, when the safety aspects were thoroughly examined by the joint inspectors  appointed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who had responsibility in this regard at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">The Dublin Port tunnel has a construction contract value of almost €450 million. The project, while very costly in capital terms, will provide enormous benefits to the city of Dublin and to industry and the economy as a whole when completed in 2005.</p>

          <p eId="para_859">I have a number of questions about the Dublin Port tunnel, particularly with regard to safety, costs and the traffic plan. Is the Minister aware of the genuine and serious concerns of the people of Marino, Fairview and Santry about the Dublin Port tunnel project? Is he satisfied with the safety plan for an emergency response to a fire in the vicinity of the tunnel boring machine? Is he aware that tunnel trucks do not have automatic fire suppression systems and carry only fire extinguishers? Does he recall the Mont Blanc tunnel fire in which 60 lives were lost? Is he aware that there is major potential for a fire to break out in the Dublin Port tunnel and has the emergency lighting system been completed?</p>

          <p eId="para_862">I share the Deputy's concern about the safety of these projects. It is a priority for the Department of Transport and the National Roads Authority. I am assured that the Dublin Port tunnel meets the highest safety standards and I can forward the Deputy a list of the safety features. There are sophisticated detection systems, emergency telephones and fire stations every 125 metres, specialised ventilation and loudspeaker systems and a communications system which allows the tunnel operator to interrupt radio broadcasts on the radios of cars travelling through the tunnel. In the event of an emergency it facilitates communication with traffic in the tunnel. Obviously, the radios will have to be switched on but, presumably, if there were a problem, the motorists would switch on their radios. An emergency response plan will be developed prior to the tunnel being opened and that is now at an advanced stage. There is also a cross passage linking each of the tubes every 250 metres and there is closed circuit television coverage 24 hours a day. The primary safety feature is that the tunnel is uni-directional in nature. These features are in place. The Deputy is correct that we cannot be too careful but I have been assured  that the highest level of safety features are in place.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_863">Is it correct that the Dublin Port tunnel is three months behind schedule? Is the Minister satisfied with the fact that the project is now costing €450 million, nearly €150 million more than the original budget? Does the Minister recognise the seriously disturbing fact that despite the testing, boreholes and investigations that have been carried out, the company does not seem to know what it is doing under the ground? This tunnel could become a tunnel of death. Is the Minister aware of the miserly awards of compensation offered to the families directly affected? Can he use his power and authority to intervene and increase the offers to these families?</p>

That is the contract price. If one includes land acquisition and other costs, the figure is €650 million. I will look into the issue regarding the families. Many of these matters have probably already been decided by due process but I will make inquiries.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_866">The programme for Government includes a commitment that a three year road safety strategy will be developed. The areas that will be specifically targeted in the new strategy will be speeding, drink driving, seatbelt wearing and pedestrian safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">The immediate background to the development of the new road safety strategy will be a realisation of the achievements in meeting the targets set out in the current road safety strategy, a comprehensive review of that strategy, which is currently being pursued, and the evolving developments in relation to the proposed EU third road safety action plan. We are now approaching the end of the term of the road safety strategy 1998 to 2002. This represented the first occasion where a Government sponsored national integrated policy in relation to road safety was promulgated. Significant advances in road safety have been delivered during the period of the strategy, with a 13% reduction in road deaths between 1997 and 2001 and a 24% reduction in serious injuries in 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">The most essential prerequisite to the development of the next strategy is that a detailed inde pendent review of the results of the current strategy should be carried out. Accordingly, an international expert in the field of road safety has been engaged to carry out such a review of the current strategy based on specific terms of reference. A report is expected in that regard within a month.</p>

          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_869">In statements during the summer the Minister announced that he was not willing to set targets. In view of the carnage on the roads every weekend and the fact that in the year to date more than 310 people have died on our roads, is not his decision to abandon the setting of targets for road safety, road deaths and injuries reckless and irresponsible?</p>
          <p eId="para_870">There has been a series of reports dealing with accident blackspots and the number of drunk drivers. The Minister has produced half baked proposals for a manually recorded penalty points system. He has made about ten different statements, all in conflict with each other, about the introduction of a dedicated road traffic police corps. Most important, he has abandoned the notion of targeted reductions in road deaths and injuries even though such targets are the cornerstone of successful policies in Scandinavian countries and the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">Does the Minister regret abandoning, in his various interviews on RTE, the notion of a targeted reduction in the number of road deaths and injuries? He did not address this issue in his reply. He did not give the figures and targets for 2002. The figures are way above the targets set by the Government five years ago. This is the Government's sixth year in office and its failure on road safety is truly appalling.</p>

          <p eId="para_883">I have not and will not abandon targets. However, in drafting a new three year road strategy, I have asked my officials to set targets that make sense. There is something sinister about having an acceptable level of deaths on the roads. If the Deputy listened carefully to my interview, she would have heard me make the point that there is something eerie about saying the death of X number of people is acceptable. The only acceptable target is zero, that is, nobody killed or injured.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">I have asked that the new strategy look at targets that might make more sense. The EU, for example, has the primary goal of halving the number of road deaths in the EU between 2002 and 2010. There are other possible targets, such as reaching the bottom of the European league to ensure that Ireland is the best country in Europe for road safety. As I said on the radio and television, it does not sit easily with me to pick figures like 10%, 14% or 15% and say we are okay if we only kill 300 people next year instead of 600. That is the reason I raised this issue and I do not apologise for doing so. It was a valid issue to raise. We should set targets that are sensible, human and with which we are comfortable, as opposed to the cold statistical targets we have used until now.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">With regard to penalty points, I do not agree with the Deputy's assertion that they are half baked. When I came to office I was told that the penalty points system was 18 months away. I am happy to inform the House that we will start the penalty points on 31 October with speeding. Giving out penalty points for speeding from 31 October is not unimportant; it is critical. The largest single cause of deaths on our roads is speeding and the penalty points will have a direct impact in that regard. Implementation of the penalty points will be full-blooded from the first day. There will be nothing half baked about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">I would be interested to hear the Deputy's opinions on the traffic corps. I intend to move on that quickly. The issue is whether the gardaí operate it alone, whether it should be a mixture of gardaí and civilians or whether it should be solely civilian. They are issues upon which I would welcome the Deputy's opinion.</p>

      <b>Mr. P. Breen</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Transport</b>
      the plans he has for the future development and management of Shannon Airport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [18477/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_357">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_888">The programme for Government includes a commitment that, as part of the pro cess of transforming Aer Rianta, we will ensure that Shannon and Cork airports have greater autonomy and independence. A debate has now been stimulated by me, both within the Shannon and Cork regions and at a national level, on the best ownership structure for these two airports going forward in the context of continued State ownership. I visited both Shannon and Cork recently to further stimulate this discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">There is a genuine sense of goodwill towards the airports in the two regions on the part of local tourism and business interests, and views may differ on the best way forward. However, I will listen carefully to the views of all interested parties before framing proposals which I intend to bring to Government within the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">The new passenger terminal at Shannon, which opened in 2000, has effectively doubled the airport's capacity providing it with the capability of handling 4.5 million passengers per annum. Passenger throughput for this year is estimated at this stage to be in the region of 2.3 million. Shannon Airport is now well positioned to cater for future growth in air services.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">In recent days, Aer Rianta has announced its new incentive scheme at the State airports to encourage the development of new routes. This new scheme will run for five years at Shannon and Cork airports, and for three years at Dublin. At Shannon and Cork, airlines launching new routes will enjoy a 100% discount on airport charges in the first year, reducing to a 20% discount in the fifth year, and something similar at Dublin Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">I am intent on achieving a return to growth at Shannon where there has been a 4% decrease in passenger throughput for the first nine months of this year compared to the same period last year. The main reason for this is the continuing negative impact of the fall-off in travel on the transatlantic routes. As part of its new incentive scheme, Aer Rianta will give special consideration to promotional support for long haul routes, including North America, with a focus on increasing the number of inbound passengers. I believe these incentives will help Shannon Airport and I am confident that it has a strong future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_358">
          <from>Mr. P. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_893">If the Minister intends to break up the airport boards, on what basis will the new board be made up? Will he take heed of the various groups he met recently? I am referring to the members of Clare County Council and Limerick County Council, as well as travel agents, trade unions and the Mid-West Regional Authority. What type of budgeting and marketing does the Minister propose for Shannon Airport, given the airport's geographical disadvantage? Will the new board be made up of experts from the tourism and aviation sectors, rather than political appointees? It is important that that should be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">Ryanair recently offered to open up two new routes out of Shannon but the airport's local man agement had to turn down both proposals. Were those routes lost because the local airport's board had to seek permission from the board of Aer Rianta? I was under the impression that Shannon received a better deal than Dublin under the new incentive scheme, although the Minister now says that a similar scheme will be made available at Dublin Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">Two security breaches have occurred recently at Shannon Airport, although the Garda Síochána was there to deal with the most recent one last Saturday. Given the recent bombings at Kuta Beach and Denpasar on the hitherto tranquil island of Bali, people in Clare and the mid-west region generally are worried about what is happening at Shannon Airport. What steps does the Minister intend to take in order to increase security there?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_359">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_896">I am committed to the board of Shannon Airport being substantially autonomous. As I said on my visit to the region, we are still consulting people about the degree of autonomy involved to see whether it would be better for Shannon to have a totally autonomous board or whether some link should be retained with Aer Rianta. I have received interesting views from all sides in the region since my visit there and I look forward to finalising this matter in the weeks ahead. It is my intention that any such board would have strong local, national and international representation, which is important for any large airport. The board will have only one objective – to help Shannon Airport to grow. The airport is currently operating at probably half its potential capacity. With a demonstration of courage all round, I believe it could make a huge leap forward and see its business interests growing dramatically.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">The Deputy raised the question of marketing budgets, but I am assuming that Aer Rianta's marketing budget is an annual agreement between Shannon and Dublin. Shannon Development also has a role to play in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">I understand that talks are now taking place concerning the Ryanair offer and that the lost offer may be retrieved. Shannon Airport management is now discussing that offer with Ryanair to see if it can make it happen. I know that an offer was made, then rejected and subsequently was hauled back again, although I am not clear about the role of Dublin Airport in the offer.</p>

      <b>Mr. J. Breen</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Transport</b>
      the impact the loss of Aer Lingus flight EI-111, direct from New York to Shannon, will have on employment in the Shannon region; his estimate on the number of jobs which will be lost as a result; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [18476/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_364">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_905">Issues relating to flight schedules are day-to-day operational issues for Aer Lingus and I therefore have no function in these matters. However, I understand from the company that the schedule changes arose from a review of the Aer Lingus transatlantic schedule for winter 2002-03. This review took into account all the relevant issues including competitive pressures, the ongoing need to reduce costs and market requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">The company is continuing to offer its customers a direct New York-Shannon service. The only difference is that for the winter it will commence and terminate in Dublin rather than commencing and terminating in Shannon, as heretofore. The company has also advised that the dedicated Shannon-New York EI-111 service will return for summer 2003. Aer Lingus states that the revision of schedules has no job implications for its staff. Furthermore, Aer Lingus has recently indicated plans to recommence services on the Shannon-Baltimore route from March 2003, which were withdrawn following the events of 11 September 2001. Negotiations are ongoing with the necessary authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">I am confident that if these services receive the necessary support from local tourist and business sectors, they will contribute to the growth of the region as well as being profitable operations for Aer Lingus. It is important for the economy in general that we should have a strong and viable Aer Lingus. It is also extremely important for the future of Shannon Airport. In this regard, I am pleased to note that, barring some unforeseen events, Aer Lingus is on track to make a profit of around €40 million this year, compared to its original projection of losses of €27 million in the survival plan. The company's board, management and staff are to be commended for addressing the serious situation that faced the airline in 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">I must stress, however, that the competitive and changing nature of this industry requires the airline to continue to focus on cost reductions and efficiency improvements. These cost cuts range across all areas within the company and within all regions. In this regard, the airline has currently embarked on a further series of cost-cutting measures which are essential to its future performance. This effort must continue unabated, otherwise it will remain vulnerable to market for ces and particularly to unexpected economic and other external shocks.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">Given the new focus in the airline, combined with the lower cost-base and greater flexibility, I am optimistic that the airline will be in a position to respond to market opportunities which may arise.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesBreen" eId="spk_365">
          <from>Mr. J. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_910">I thank the Minister for his reply but the loss of the Aer Lingus Shannon-New York EI-111 service will create unemployment in the catering area and in the duty-free shop. Will the Minister explain how the national airline intends to slot in the extra Shannon flights required under the one-to-one US air agreement? Now that Aer Lingus has returned to profit and this route is no longer loss-making, I am asking the Minister to protect jobs in Clare and the west generally by allowing direct access to Shannon for this flight. The Minister has the power to do so. Coming from the west himself, the Minister knows how important Shannon Airport is to Clare and the west in general. I am asking the Minister not to allow anything detrimental to happen to the airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">I am delighted to hear that the Shannon-New York EI-111 service will return for summer 2003, but in the meantime it is clear that jobs will be lost, although the Minister has not indicated how many. I again appeal to the Minister to use his office to prevent this happening.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_366">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_912">Aer Lingus has indicated to me that the revision in schedules has no implications for its staff and, as I pointed out, it is re-commencing the Shannon to Baltimore route, which will be additional business for Shannon Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">I have stated time and again in the region that I am fully committed to the development of Shannon Airport. I genuinely hope to preside over the growth of Shannon Airport so that it can create more employment in the airport and through the airlines.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">A strong Aer Lingus is part of that strategy. Aer Lingus can only be strong if I support the viability plan, which I have supported. This means that I do not interfere in its day-to-day cost-cutting operations, and I do not really plan to interfere – that would not be appropriate.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Mr. J. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_915">Surely Aer Lingus has a commitment to Shannon Airport on a one-to-one basis. Under the bilateral agreement with the US, how will Aer Lingus honour that commitment?</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_368">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_916">There are no plans to amend the existing bilateral agreement with the US. The 50/50 rule, of which the Deputy is aware, is in place and I have no plans to change it. I am assured by all of the airlines that they are able to keep to that scheduling. It is a matter of configuration and how they make up that 50/50, but I assume – if the Deputy likes, I will check it – that Aer Lingus is fully complying with the law of the land, which is, the 50/50 rule.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_921">I propose to answer Questions No. 73 and 89 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">I am advised by Iarnród Éireann that a total of 151 incidents have occurred over the period from January 1998 to date in locations where the railway crosses a public road. This information relates to railway crossings of public roads. There are also many private crossings on the railway network.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">Of these 151 incidents, 116 had no train involvement and resulted from road vehicles striking level crossing gates or equipment. A total of 21 incidents involved trains striking level crossings or equipment, 12 involved collisions between trains and road vehicles, one incident involved a road vehicle that broke down on a level crossing and one incident involved a person being struck by a train.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">The risks posed at level crossings for rail and road users are well recognised by Iarnród Éireann and my Department. As part of the railway safety programme, 1999 to 2003, approved by Government in March 1999, a major upgrading programme of level crossings is being undertaken by Iarnród Éireann which is funded mainly by the Exchequer. To date, over €50 million has been invested in upgrading or closing level crossings. Some 240 of the level crossings identified for upgrading or closure under the railway safety programme have already been closed or upgraded.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">This major upgrading programme will continue until the end of the current railway safety programme. I intend shortly to seek the approval of the Government to re-convene the railway safety task force to make recommendations for a new five-year programme commencing in 2004. I have no doubt that the continuing upgrading of level crossings will form part of that programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">In addition, a Railway Safety Bill is currently before this House and will have its Second Stage reading tomorrow. This Bill will require all railway undertakings, including Iarnród Éireann, to implement a formal safety management system and to describe that system in a document called  a "safety case". The Bill will require a railway undertaking to identify in its safety case all issues impacting on the safety of its operations. Such issues would include its management of safety at level crossings. The railway safety commission, to be established under the Bill, will need to be satisfied that such management is adequate to ensure the safety of rail passengers and staff and of all users of level crossings. The Bill will place a duty on any person on or near railway land to ensure that he or she does not pose a danger to others.</p>

        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_372">
          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_927">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. Is he aware that in the past five years at least four people have been killed and one person seriously injured at railway crossings, most of which were unmanned? Why have no investigations by the railway safety inspector taken place into any of those incidents, bar the one in Kiltoom, County Roscommon? In light of the fact that Irish Rail, as far back as 1997, following the death of a young woman in County Roscommon, investigated upgrading unmanned level crossings, of which there are 200, why have those level crossings not been upgraded? Even the crossing at which that particular incident occurred has not been upgraded.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">Earlier this year Sr. Joan Bowles was killed in County Limerick. That was the second serious incident at that level crossing and nothing has been done about it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_373">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_929">I share the Deputy's concern about this issue. We must do a great deal more in this area. Of the 151 incidents to which I referred, my note states that two – the Deputy mentioned four – resulted in fatalities. A young man was killed on 5 June 2001 when he was struck by a train at Sullivan's Cross near Galway. Then there was the very sad case of Sr. Bowles, where her car was struck at Woodfarm, County Limerick, in July 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">In total, there are about 2,000 level crossings. A 1998 study by consultants stated that 602 of them pose an intolerable risk. Of those 602 crossings, 240 are now closed. I have told my Department and Iarnród Éireann to proceed quickly with getting rid of the rest of them. The first line of attack must be those 602 crossings, 360 or so of which are left to do. We need to finish those.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">I do not think the Deputy is correct in saying that no investigations were taking place in these cases. A few strategic level crossings have led to multiple incidents. The level crossings at Merrion Gates in Dublin, at Woodfarm, where, unfortunately, the accident with Sr. Bowles occurred, at Slaney Bridge and at Kiltoom, with which the Deputy is familiar, are examples of where there have been multiple incidents and, to the best of my knowledge, they have been fully investigated. I certainly would be concerned were that not the case, but I will double check it. I am telling the Deputy that they have been investigated.</p>

          <p eId="para_937">Regarding the unmanned level crossings on which no work has been done to date by Irish Rail, one recommendation which was made at the inquest into the death of Sr. Bowles was that warning beacons should be provided at these level crossings to warn drivers approaching them that a train was about to arrive. At least that would make people conscious of approaching trains because in the incident at Dunamon, County Roscommon, the level crossing was on a double bend and was not in view. Similar incidents have occurred around the country. Will the Minister agree to put even the most basic safety measures in place at unmanned level crossings?</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_938">I will ask Iarnród Éireann to expedite its work in this area and I will examine the Deputy's point about the formal investigation. Obviously if that was my reply to the Deputy, that was the information available to me. The distinction between a "formal investigation" and an "investigation" might be a moot point. I will have to come back to the Deputy on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">Of the 151 incidents, two resulted in deaths. That is two too many and I want to make sure that there are no more. As the Deputy will be aware, a significant amount of money has been put into railway safety in recent years. With the new continuous welded track being installed around the country, up to half the track is now of that standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">These level crossings are a cause of major concern to me, however, and the new railway safety commission, which is coming into operation, will play a major role. A new railway safety commission, in the full light of day, will not be able to stand over these railway crossings and will have to step on them.</p>

          <p eId="para_941">On a number of occasions in the past five years, in the Kiltoom incident and in a number of other incidents on the Athlone to Wesport line, an engine has gone through closed level-crossing gates. Part of the difficulty is that  the distance between the signal and the gates has not been revised in more than a century although the speed of trains and their braking distances have increased significantly in that time. Does the Minister believe this is acceptable?</p>

      <b>Mr. Deenihan</b>
      asked the

      his future plan for Shannon Airport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [18224/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_388">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_950">I refer the Deputy to my reply of today to priority Question No. 71 on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">The programme for government includes a commitment that as part of the process of transforming Aer Rianta, we will ensure that Shannon and Cork airports have greater autonomy and independence.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">A debate has now been stimulated by me, both within the Shannon and Cork regions and at a national level on the best ownership structure for these two airports going forward, in the context of continued State ownership. I visited both Shannon and Cork recently to further stimulate this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">There is a genuine sense of goodwill towards the airports in the two regions on the part of local  tourism and business interests and views may differ on the best way forward. However, I will listen carefully to the views of all interested parties before framing proposals which I intend to bring to Cabinet within the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">The new passenger terminal of Shannon which opened in 2000 has effectively doubled the Airport's capacity providing it with the capability to handle 4.5 million passengers per annum. Passenger throughput for this year is estimated at this stage to be in the region of 2.3 million. Shannon Airport is now well positioned to cater for future growth in air services.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">In recent days, Aer Rianta has announced its new incentive scheme at the State airports to encourage the development of new routes. This new scheme will run for five years at Shannon and Cork Airports and for three years at Dublin. At Shannon and Cork, airlines launching new routes will enjoy a 100% discount on airport charges in the first year reducing to a 20% discount in the fifth year, and similar at Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">I am intent on achieving a return to growth at Shannon where there has been a 4% decrease in passenger throughput for the first nine months of this year compared to the same period last year. The main reason for this is the continuing negative impact of the fall-off in travel on the transatlantic routes. As part of its new incentive scheme, Aer Rianta will give special consideration to promotional support for long haul routes, including North America, with a focus on increasing the numbers of inbound passengers.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">These initiatives are intended to help reduce the impact of the global aviation downturn on traffic at the State airports, including Shannon Airport, and to boost the Irish aviation and tourism sectors in the months and years ahead.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_389">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_958">Does the Minister agree that the future of Shannon Airport is important for tourism in the west of Ireland? Is he aware that 50% of north American tourists who disembark at Shannon wind up in Kerry while only 20% of north American tourists who disembark in Dublin wind up in Kerry? This is why it is so important from Donegal to Kerry that Shannon operates at its full capacity. The Minister has said Shannon has a capacity for a further 2 million passengers.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">Shannon Development, in its annual report, proposed the establishment of a new independent board for Shannon Airport which would not include Aer Rianta. Does the Minister see merit in that proposal?</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_960">I see merit in the proposal and I have already explained to the Dáil that I am committed to the establishment of a new board in Shannon Airport, with international, national and local input. I am fully committed to the future growth of Shannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">I would not say half of north American tourists wind up in Kerry. I would say they deliberately  set out to go to Kerry. I am sure they go with a more positive attitude.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_963">The Shannon Development proposal is one of many. In general I support what Shannon Development wants to do. However, it recommends a particular format and I have not come to a conclusion on that. I agree that autonomy is important for Shannon but I have not decided whether the form of autonomy its proposal puts forward is the one that will be proposed to Government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_393">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_964">Surely the Minister agrees that a new board without the involvement of Aer Rianta may not be in the interest of Shannon Airport. Aer Rianta is now an international company providing services across the world. It would not be in the interest of Shannon Airport and the west of Ireland if Aer Rianta were excluded from the development of Shannon Airport.</p>

          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_965">In a previous life I worked in tourism and one of our greatest problems was how to get people out of Shannon Airport by public transport. If a passenger wanted to travel to Killarney on the day he arrived in Ireland he or she had to arrive in Shannon before noon. It was almost impossible for a passenger to travel to Westport on the day he or she arrived at Shannon. Will the Minister do a comprehensive review of the public transport services to the airport, which would make Shannon a benefit to tourism on the west coast?</p>

          <p eId="para_966">Is the Minister aware of the Doganis report on aviation and tourism? What role will Aer Rianta have in the new structures proposed for Shannon Airport? The Doganis report refers to Brussels Airport where a separate management company was established over and beyond the management of the airport and which was not successful. What role will Aer Rianta, the State owned airports authority, have in the new structures?</p>

          <from>Mr. P. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_967">As a consequence of the suspension of flight EI-111, the Aer Lingus flight leaves Shannon at 3 p.m. and arrives in New York at 4 p.m., during the evening rush hour. This is not an attractive proposition for passengers. Can the Minister comment?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_397">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_968">Deputy Deenihan asked me about Aer Rianta's involvement. The central question is what degree of autonomy the region wishes to have. I have to take clear account of the opinions of the interests in the region, such as Shannon Development, the management of Aer Rianta in Shannon, the mid-west county councils and all the other interests I have met. I am very interested in what they have to say and I am listening carefully to what Deputies have to say  also. They have views that are worth listening to and I must take them into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">I am committed to a new board in Shannon and the question relates to the degree of autonomy there. Does Shannon Airport want to make a fresh start as a State-owned company? I confirm that it will stay a State-owned company. There is no question of privatising Shannon Airport.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_971">Does it want to start with a clean balance sheet, its own marketing budget, funding from the Exchequer and a national, international and local board? Does it want that fresh start? Does it want to be able to compete with Dublin instead of being complementary to it? If it wants that start, I am happy to facilitate it. If the view is the opposite, that is something I will take into account. I ask that people stand back from this, give it some thought and see what is right for Shannon. That is the important thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">Deputy Eamon Ryan asked about transport to airports and I agree with the point he made. I am trying to get the railway system to Dublin Airport going and there is a proposal about a rail link to Shannon which I am looking at carefully. I agree that airports must be linked to railway lines if they are to be made effective.</p>

          <p eId="para_976">Earlier this year my Department commissioned a major strategic study of the Irish railway system. The main purpose of the study is to develop a 20-year blueprint for the future of the rail network and to identify priorities for investment. The review when completed will provide a strategic framework for future Government decisions on rail development. The study will specifically address the future of rail freight services, as well as passenger services. In carrying out their analysis and formulating their recommendations, the consultants will take account of the environmental and safety factors as mentioned by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">Among other things, the study will have regard to the recent EU Commission White Paper, European Transport Policy for 2010, which aims to promote the revival of the rail network in the EU, particularly the rail freight network. I expect  that the strategic rail study will be completed before the end of this year and I will then consider the recommendations arising from it before presenting it to Government.

This is particularly so in Wexford in relation to the Waterford-Rosslare line and also in Cork in relation to today's announcement about IFI. Will the Minister give the House an unequivocal guarantee that the freight rail services in the south-east will remain open, particularly in the context of the growth in population in the towns of the south-east area, many of which serve as dormitory towns for the greater Dublin area?

In light of the fact that the transport of briquettes, coal, fertiliser, grain, gypsum, molasses, mail, oil, tar and timber has been lost from rail to road, will he ensure that, at national or European level, incentives are put in place to bring those types of products back on to rail transport because the roads are completely congested?</p>

          <p eId="para_991">I propose to take all the Private Notice Questions together.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">IFI is jointly owned by ICI, which has 49% of the company, and the State through NET, with 51%. As the House will be aware, the board of  IFI has decided that it cannot continue trading and has recommended the appointment of a liquidator. It is obviously a matter of extreme disappointment that, despite the efforts of so many involved, it has not been possible to find a solution to the severe financial difficulties at Irish Fertiliser Industries. This will be a devastating blow for the workforce, families and local communities. I have taken steps to ensure that everything possible will be done to assist those concerned to find alternative employment as quickly as possible. FÁS will immediately look at what needs to be done in Cork and Arklow, with the priority being to provide whatever retraining is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">IFI operates in a volatile market which is going through a rough trading period. The market is plagued by considerable levels of over-supply, resulting in poor prices, and costs remain high. The company made significant losses in the past year and despite the identification of a number of significant cost savings as part of recent efforts to save the company, it was not possible to establish a basis for a viable future. The joint shareholders have supported the company, for example by providing €34 million two years ago. Indeed, the value of Exchequer support for NET and IFI has amounted to €750 million in present day terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">Unfortunately, the company has struggled to deliver a return on investment and, as a result, requires large borrowings to fund day-to-day operations. IFI had projected that its working capital needs would have to rise to about €100 million over the coming months, on top of a debt of €200 million, retained by NET when IFI was established in 1987. The debt retained by NET had risen to over €250 million by 2001 when most of it was taken over by the Minister for Finance. The company made a loss for the five years to 2001 and a further significant loss of over €30 million, or €1,000 per employee, was made in the year just ended. In the light of the emerging loss and resultant financial crisis, the company approached its shareholders in July seeking an injection of €25 million. Neither shareholder thought that the basis for this request was acceptable and asked the company to explore further options. The shareholders, in consultation with the company, engaged international financial advisers to see if a buyer could be found to take over the company. Unfortunately, these efforts did not produce a buyer.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">Against this background, the company revisited its business plan to see if it could establish a basis for achieving viability. However, the plan that was finally submitted projected further losses and did not claim to establish a viable basis for going forward. Instead, the objective was to enable the company to continue trading for a number of months. As part of this short-term survival plan, the board sought €10 million from the shareholders to enable it to proceed. Even with such support, the board acknowledged that the company would continue to make losses. This clearly demonstrates how fragile the survival plan  was and even modest shocks would have left the company in an impossible position again. In this regard, Deputies may be aware that a major supplier, Bord Gáis Éireann, last week withdrew credit facilities from the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">In these circumstances, the shareholders did not consider that they could provide the support requested. At this stage, the focus will be on ensuring that operations are shut down in an orderly manner. Both shareholders will, of course, co-operate fully with the company and the liquidator in an effort to ensure that the process can be as smooth and as efficient as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_998">Does the Minister agree that the workforce in east Cork and Arklow has been treated disgracefully? Workers in both plants had produced proposals for viability plans. The workforce in Cork had asked for an extra two weeks and the workforce in Arklow was not expecting the full closure of the plant there. As the holder of 51% of IFI's shares, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has treated the employees scandalously. It is particularly shocking that workers found out about their redundancies from an English newspaper, <i>The Guardian.</i> The Arklow workforce discovered at 2.30 p.m. yesterday that the plant there was to close. Is it true that the workers in Cork, Arklow and Belfast have been treated disgracefully by the Tánaiste?</p>

          <p eId="para_1002">There was no offer, unfortunately, even though international bankers were appointed to advise the Government. They made every effort and spoke to a number of companies. Nobody was interested in buying IFI because of the lack of viability of fertiliser production in Ireland, which involves importing gas from the North Sea, piping it to Cork, converting it to urea and ammonia and taking it by train to Dublin. It is an expensive process. The cost of importing fertiliser is $40 or $50 per tonne cheaper than the cost of producing it here. Notwithstanding that the company came forward with a survival plan that required more money from the shareholders, it was still predicting losses of about €7 million this year. In that context, neither the Government  nor the other shareholder was interested in investing more money in the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">I regret that over 600 jobs will be lost on this island, and that over 400 of them will be lost to this economy. It is a major blow to the workers and the economy, and particularly to the communities that are affected. I do not think anybody could criticise the Government for not being prepared to put more money into the company, given the level of investment of taxpayers' money in the company to date and the fact the company could not have been made viable. The fact is that producing fertiliser in Ireland is not viable at present.</p>

I have nothing against English newspapers, but it is not right that workers read of their fate in such a newspaper rather than hearing it from the Minister or the management of IFI. I would like the Tánaiste to outline, in specific terms, her plan B for the staff of IFI. Many of the Arklow workforce have been employed at the plant since it opened. Some of them are over 50 years of age. We saw on the news last night that they are worried that they may be unable to find alternative employment. Can the Tánaiste clarify the route she intends to take to reassure these employees? I know she said she will ask FÁS to take action, but can she tell the House if any alternative industry will come to Arklow?</p>

I regret very much that someone saw fit to leak information to the newspaper, as a great disservice was done to the company and its workers. Unfortunately, employees sometimes learn of their fate through leaked information and it is always regrettable. It was clearly a matter for IFI to deal with its workforce of 620 people and I regret that it did not have an opportunity to do so. IFI employees have a great deal of experience; the average length of service is 21 years and the average salary is about €50,000 per annum. They are reasonably well paid and experienced. I will make every effort through FÁS, the national training agency, to ensure they are retrained for new jobs. Gloom and doom was predicted when Irish Steel closed 18 months ago, but 75% of the workers who were interested in further work, who were not retiring—</p>

Will she comment on the significant hike in gas prices recently and the enormous costs of transmission, which have been highlighted in the media for some time? The cost of transmitting gas from Scotland to Marino Point was out of control. Will the Minister justify this cost? If she cannot do so now, will she forward that information? Is it true that this issue, above all others, has led to the closure of IFI? How much will the redundancy package cost? How much can workers expect following the decision? Will costs be incurred by the State at the sites at Marino Point and elsewhere? For instance, must the sites be returned to greenfield status whereby the plants would be dismantled and the sites restored to their original state in the 1970s?</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">The Minister has also referred to ISPAT. How many workers lost their jobs at the plant? How many are in full-time, permanent, pensionable employment? How many were trained? How many retired? It is fine to state that 75% of those who lost their jobs were re-employed but the Minister said in an earlier reply that 75% of those who were interested were re-employed. That is a significant distinction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">Will the Minister provide a breakdown of the age profile of workers at Marino Point and the other plants? She stated in her reply that difficulties were noted five years ago. What action did the shareholders take at the time to turn the situation around? Did she allow the position at IFI to drift to the point we have reached? She also stated the company was making a loss for five years. When did it last make a profit? Did it make a profit in 2001?</p>

          <p eId="para_1040">Of the workers who approached FÁS when Irish Steel closed 75%, or 175, are in full-time employment. I am not certain about the pensionability of the employment but it is good, full-time employment. I do not have the age profile but the average experience among workers in IFI is 21 years service. I expect FÁS to compile such data quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">The Deputy asked what the State did. First, the Exchequer took over the company's debt two years ago. It had reached £250 million at the time. We invested €34 million over recent years with the other shareholder. We also sought a buyer for the company. IBI was appointed a number of years ago to find a buyer in the domestic or inter national market but, unfortunately, that was not possible. More recently, international bankers were appointed but they also did not have success.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">Gas was heavily subsidised for a considerable time and there was a contract between IFI and Bord Gáis to supply gas at a set price. That scenario changed. Bord Gáis is a commercial company, which is the responsibility of the gas regulator. It is not up to me or the Government to seek to make another company commercially unviable. Importing gas to Ireland, converting it to urea and ammonia and transporting it by rail to Arklow via Dublin poses significant difficulties for the production of fertiliser and that is why it can be imported more cheaply.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">The costs involved in converting the plants into greenfield sites will be borne by both shareholders on a 51:49 basis and not exclusively the Exchequer. This is a matter for the liquidator who will be appointed by the company's creditors, not the Government, as is the issue of redundancy. We made it clear to the company recently that if in the interest of achieving a viability plan it would have to make people redundant, we were prepared to make money available towards redundancy payments, and that remains the position.</p>

In light of a request by the company for €25 million for investment, which she refused, does she find it grotesque that between 1987 and 1999 the parent company of IFI, Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta, paid £188 million in interest to the banks on borrowings of £164 million? Does she agree, in the context of the disaster that beckons for 620 workers, this bank robbery in reverse should be investigated? Does she further agree if those funds had instead been invested in diversification in IFI, for example, in the area of natural fertilisers, compost alternatives etc., a viable and vibrant company could have been maintained?</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">Does the Minister concur €25 million is a tiny fraction of the £188 million paid by a State-owned company to the banks without a murmur of opposition from successive Governments? Does she also consider it grotesque that Bord Gáis, a publicly-owned company, should summarily pull the  plug on another part-owned State company without holding exhaustive discussions with workers on how the plant could be managed so that it could remain open? Is it the case, in view of the Progressive Democrats' hostility to public enterprise and the party's penchant for privatisation and Thatcherite policies, that when the company sought extra investment, it was approaching the wrong door? Do the workers, therefore, have every right to feel betrayed?</p>

          <p eId="para_1051">In today's monetary terms, €750 million in taxpayers' money was put into the company, which equates to more than €1 million per job. Last year the company lost €30 million which was about €1,000 per week per employee. If a company is not viable after a sustained period of support from shareholders, including €34 million over the past two years, the shareholders must make choices. This is about choices and priorities, particularly when it comes to the expenditure of public money. With no viability plan on the table the company acknowledged that, even with the cost cuts put forward and €10 million from shareholders, it would still make substantial losses this year and no shareholder could reasonably be expected to invest money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">Bord Gáis is like any other supplier and it was coincidental that it happened to be involved in the last few days. It also indicates the state the company was in: it was a further nail in the coffin. The company was not closed because of Bord Gáis – there were other fundamental reasons. It was not viable in current market circumstances to make fertiliser in this country when it can be imported at substantially lower prices from other places, particularly from where gas is available for very little cost. No one could expect Bord Gáis to make gas available at almost no cost because it must cover its costs for bringing the gas here in the first place.</p>

Does she agree there is no comparison between the retraining of Irish Steel workers and workers in IFI, particularly with the age profile of the IFI workforce and the different economic circumstances at present?</p>

          <p eId="para_1054">It is always dreadful for a workforce to learn of its fate in a newspaper, Irish or British. I was not responsible for that and I strongly condemn the person who leaked information to any publication.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">I met the union and worker representatives on 12 September and made it clear that money would not be forthcoming from the Government and that the same applied to the other shareholder, with whom I had many meetings, unless there was a viability plan on the table. Notwithstanding the terrific efforts of workers and management at the company, that was not possible. I pay tribute to the workers who worked extremely hard in difficult circumstances over many years to turn this company around. It is not their fault that this can be done much cheaper elsewhere. Because it is such a gas intensive industry, it was much cheaper to do it elsewhere and that is why the company was unable to trade successfully.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">There is not a huge difference between the former Irish Steel workers and IFI workers, either in terms of age or skills, nor has the climate changed that much in 18 months as far as employment is concerned. There are 36,000 non-EU workers here and 70,000 foreign workers in total. We generate thousands of new jobs every year and the challenge is to find as many new jobs as possible for those being made redundant.</p>

          <p eId="para_1057">When there are job announcements, the Taoiseach or Deputy Harney are to the forefront. She should understand that we are cynical when job losses are announced in a British newspaper. If they had not been announced in that newspaper, how would she have made the announcement? Does she agree that many of the workers are still in the dark? Who is the liquidator and what guidelines has he been given? The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment mentioned that efforts may be made to save some of the jobs. What level of redundancy payment will be involved?</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">What about the creditors? I was contacted this afternoon by some hauliers who are owed substantial sums of money by the company. What assurances can she offer to those companies?</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">I realise that Cork, Belfast and Arklow are of equal importance but what jobs are in the pipeline for the Arklow area? There was a high profile announcement two years ago, which was outside the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment's remit, but did she ever discuss the provision of those jobs with the local authority?</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">Will the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment comment on the price increase that may come about on agricultural  inputs? It is cheaper to import fertiliser but there could be an increase in the cost of agricultural inputs when we stop our own production. She is going to Wicklow tomorrow. Will she meet any local groups that would like to meet her?</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">The State was a 51% shareholder in this company. Was the decision made singly by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or by the Government as a whole to go along with the closure? Was it a case of all or nothing? The workers from Arklow knew there were difficulties and they were aware of the economic realities but it is a matter of concern that the board of directors did not come up with a viability plan for some of the plant. Surely if the State owns 51% of the company there is an onus on the Tánaiste to come up with a viability plan. I feel sorry for workers in Cork but if there was some streamlining, the plant in Arklow could have been afforded an opportunity of survival. That is the major sin and it should be explained.</p>

          <p eId="para_1062">The Deputy acknowledges at least that the high profile job announcement was not made by me; I do not make all job announcements. The board of IFI met yesterday at midday. Shortly before that meeting the acting chairman called me to tell me the likely outcome and I discussed that at yesterday's Cabinet meeting. It was then a matter for the IFI board to tell its staff and make a public announcement, which it did yesterday afternoon.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">Creditors are a matter for the liquidator. The liquidator will not be appointed by the Government or the shareholder but by the company. I do not know who it will be. I cannot say if every single creditor will be paid, although I hope that will be the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">The price of fertiliser is falling rapidly and the market is declining so I do not believe there will be an increase in agricultural inputs in the short to medium term. The market is extremely competitive, so much so that we have not been able to survive in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">Bringing gas from the North Sea to Cork, then making the raw material to be transported by train through Dublin to Arklow was uneconomic. The international advisor spoke to some companies, one in particular, that he felt might keep the Arklow and Belfast sites operating but there was no interest in the idea. That was discussed in the company as a possibility, but it did not come to anything unfortunately. Clearly, if any part of the company could have been saved that would have fitted with my priority which is to maintain jobs. I will meet workers and their representatives from Wicklow and Arklow – and perhaps Belfast – at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_1073">I asked the Minister if she was aware of that, which is a question.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">Does the Minister stand over her quote in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> today in which she says she left the workers in no doubt that taxpayers' money could not be put into this company unless a viability plan was forthcoming? I am interested to know if her understanding is the same as mine, which is that the workers were employed night and day in putting together a viability plan to be proposed to her as the majority shareholder. My knowledge particularly relates to the workers in Cork, whose plan involved sacrificing nearly €4 million in wages in an effort to save a company in which many of them have worked for 20 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">Can the Minister inform the House of the number of European countries which do not have fertiliser processing plants? Is Ireland on its own in this regard and does she believe we are at some risk in relation to a steady and consistent supply of fertiliser into the future given that we are an island and particularly vulnerable to unstable markets and reliance on the shipping of product from mainland Europe?</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">I was astonished at the answer Deputy Stanton received earlier on the cost of dismantling the plant. Taking the Cork example, I remember quite clearly difficulties we had with the Seveso 2 directives when problems emerged for IFI at which time very significant figures were put on the table with regard to the cost of dismantling the plant. We were talking about €150 million or more. Does the Minister not find it astonishing that a majority shareholder would decide to close a plant without any indication of the cost of returning the area to a green field site, which is necessary in this case considering the Seveso 2 directives relating to the potential dangers should the plant close?</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">Can the Minister outline what in her view will be the likely loss of associated jobs, particularly in Cork, as a result of the closure of this plant?  Has she spoken to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, in relation to continued viability of the rail line to Cobh after the plant closes? What will be the impact on Cork Port which sees a number of ships coming and going to and from the IFI plant? I can come back with supplementary questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_1078">I am aware of some of the things that were said. I heard an interview on Cork local radio this morning in which a Government backbench Deputy took a particular view of me and what I stand for. I am the Minister who brought in the minimum wage and I have also presided over some of the biggest ever tax cuts for workers. This was common sense, quite honestly, and it was not the Government who decided to close the company. The IFI board made the decision yesterday because the Government and the other shareholder made the decision that in the absence of a viability plan it could not justify putting in money. The reason the decision was made by the board of the company was that if it continued to operate it might have been in breach of the law by recklessly trading. We were waiting for a viability plan, but it was not forthcoming. Even if the proposed huge savings, including great sacrifices on the part of the workers, were made and the need for more money from the shareholders was met, the company still predicted further losses for this year. That is not a viability plan and it came in advance of any decision made by Bord Gáis or any other supplier.</p>

          <p eId="para_1085">What discussions has the Minister had with BGE regarding the closure of IFI? She has not answered that question. Does the Minister agree that she is hiding behind the coat tails of a decision made by the board of IFI when she is a 51% stake holder in the company? The  decision was a Government decision and if it had the will to keep IFI afloat, it would have been kept open. It was a Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil decision with the full backing of the Government and nobody can blame the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">It is a bit much to come here and be accused of playing politics. The decision that was made was political. Representatives from all parties spent long hours and many nights trying to help the IFI workers to put their case and accusing us of playing politics here is a way of protecting the Minister's own skin. Instead of treating the company to crocodile tears and damning one-liners, I would like the Minister to explain and break down her statement that €725 million of taxpayers money had been paid to keep IFI afloat. Rather than give us the easy one-liner and have it accepted as fact, can the Minister give us a breakdown of that figure?</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">What discussions took place with BGE in relation to IFI? It is something of a coincidence that at the time a viability plan was being finalised BGE screwed another semi-state company and put it out of business. What annual contribution does BGE make to the Exchequer? It is a payment that is forced out of it and made it take this kind of decision. In her answer the Minister spoke about the viability plan that was finally submitted projecting further loss and failing to establish a viable basis for going forward. Could she be more precise? What were the projected losses? How can the Minister state that the plan was not viable for the future? Can she be more precise?</p>

It said it wanted €10 million from the shareholders, but even with that we would lose at least €7 million. That was in advance of BGE looking to be paid as the gas was supplied and not given the 60 days' credit. It is unfair and wrong to say that BGE pulled the plug. That was a further example of the attitude adopted by suppliers. All suppliers must look at their commercial operation. This is a regulated sector. BGE is regulated by a State regulator.

          <p eId="para_1106">Some 40% of the fertiliser purchased in this economy was bought from IFI,  while 60% was bought from other sources. It did not have a majority of the market in the South. Some 60% of the market in the North was supplied by IFI, while 40% was supplied by other sources. I do not anticipate any difficulties as there is a huge oversupply. The market is declining and prices are falling rapidly. They are among the reasons that it was becoming increasingly difficult for IFI to continue to compete and survive. If someone can bring fertiliser into the country at $40 or $50 dollars a tonne cheaper, the consequences are clear to everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">I am aware of the effect that will have in Cork, Arklow, Belfast and the surrounding areas. People travel longer distances to work than some people might understand. I am aware this will have a serious impact on the local economy.

When I met representatives of ICI and officials from my Department from time to time over the past five years we had discussions about when the market would turn around. We have waited a long time for that to happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_1114">As regards the environmental closure costs, I am told that an estimate was put on that during the work done by advisers for the company when they sought to find outside interests. The sum of money mentioned was €10 million, but I do not know on what basis that was calculated. Among the issues considered is the one the Deputy raised. It was put forward by some that if Marino Point was closed, with the high cost of taking the gas there and converting it into raw material and the transportation costs, perhaps Arklow and Belfast could have been viable. That was examined both by the company and by the advisers who sought to find an outside buyer. Unfortunately, that did not materialise as part of the viability plan. It is now a matter for the liquidator. Sometimes scenarios are possible in a liquidation situation which are not possible outside it. I do not want to build up false hopes because it would be irresponsible to do so, but perhaps there is a possibility that something, such as the Deputy suggested, could be the outcome of the liquidation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1115">Can the Minister give us a guarantee about redundancies and creditors? Now that the company is going into liquidation, it is of major concern that people who traded with it in good faith on the basis that it was protected by the Government might not be paid. Is the Minister satisfied that sufficient time was given to the company to come up with a viability plan in view of the efforts made by the workers to save costs? What cost will be incurred by the State if the plant is to be decommissioned to meet EU directives? Were such costs taken into account when the decision was made to close the plant?</p>

          <p eId="para_1116">The decision was taken by the company that in the absence of more money from the shareholders it had to cease trading. The shareholders made that decision because there was not a viability plan. I am anxious that the workers get a reasonable and fair redundancy package and I hope they do. We will work to make that possible. As I said earlier in the context of some redundancies being necessary in order to save the wider operation, the Government was prepared with the other shareholder to set some money aside and have it ring-fenced for redundancy payments because one can never be certain that workers will receive a fair and reasonable redundancy payment when liquidation arises. This is the reason we indicated to the company that we would like the shareholders  to put a sum of money into this company and have it ring-fenced for redundancies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">In relation to decommissioning costs, as they are called, all these issues were examined when the advisors were preparing advice on the possible sale of the company. That is where the figure of €10 million or £10 million – I am not certain which – came from.</p>

          <p eId="para_1119">I understand that to be the case. However, the company will also have assets which will be sold. All the costs must be taken into consideration. One sets the money that can be raised from the assets of the company against any environmental and other costs associated with the closure of a company of this kind. I acknowledge that IFI is a chemical company and that the costs associated with the closure of such companies are sometimes unknown until the process begins. However, I understand the advisers put the figure to which I referred on the process.</p>

          <p eId="para_1120">Does the Minister accept the Government, as the major shareholder, has a part to play in this process? Surely she must accept that the Government could have saved the company if it had been prepared to do so? The rumour mill has already started with the suggestion that once this company enters the liquidation process, there could be a repeat of the Irish Steel episode. People are very worried by the prospect that no offers will be made because the company has entered the liquidation process. This is what happened in the case of Irish Steel.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">Will the Minister outline plans to ensure the employees get alternative employment given that they will be seeking jobs from the same pool as the former employees of Youghal Carpets and the remainder of Irish Steel? Will she also outline what redundancy payments will be offered to employees? Will it be the standard statutory redundancy and, if so, does she agree this would be a very poor reward facing into Christmas for people who are in the main in their 50s and have very few prospects?</p>

          <p eId="para_1122">I would regard statutory redundancy as being very unsatisfactory and unfair to these workers. Since the State was the major shareholder in this company, I want to ensure the workers receive fair and reasonable redundancy payments. I cannot be responsible for the rumour machine. If the Deputy is asking whether someone will buy the company for a euro or a pound, I do not believe this will occur. It will be a matter for the liquidator. In a liquidation process, expressions of interest are sometimes forthcoming which are not forthcoming where a company is solvent. It may well be that some companies in the international marketplace are interested in parts of the company. If we could save any of it, that would clearly be the priority.</p>

As a former Irish Steel employee, I had a particular interest in trying to follow events after ISPAT. Will the Minister give Members with an interest in the matter a briefing on the potential future use of the site and what is likely to happen to the land in which the Government holds a 51% share? There is still total confusion surrounding the ownership of land on Haulbowline. The future of the land is particularly important as it may affect people seeking employment in that area?</p>

There are no market problems in the European Union.</p>

        <heading>Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill, 2002: Second Stage (Resumed).</heading>
        <summary eId="sum_26">Question again proposed: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</summary>
        <speech by="#JohnDennehy" eId="spk_570">
          <from>Mr. Dennehy</from>
          <p eId="para_1185">I made the point earlier that the nature of parliamentary business is rapidly changing, as is the political scene. The technology, environment and the way in which we operate are constantly changing. This Dáil is certainly very different to the one to which I was elected in 1987. The requirements on Members are changing all the time and a dedicated body to oversee the funding and organisation of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas is very welcome. I welcome this Bill, it is important and timely.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">The innovation of a Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is also welcome and presents very real challenges to Members and staff to ensure we all are up to the task. Conditions have been radically improved and I thank Deputy McCreevy for that. However, Members wish to repay that, perform better and be more involved in every possible way. Modernisation of the administration, which has already commenced with the new directorate structure arising out of an IPA report in 1999, is crucial. The old way of doing things in the comfort zone of the Department of Finance will not apply any longer. It was handy at times to opt out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187">I heard one Deputy say we should be able to stand up to Ministers and tell them what the priorities are and that we should have the power to change things. Those of us with the dual mandate and who serve on health boards have that power. We now present a plan of action every September. I have yet to hear a suggestion with regard to changing priorities that meant deleting something. We will worry about the disabled, the environment or our own issues, but we will not wish to delete anything. We need not worry too much about that aspect of it. We need more power in meeting Ministers and questioning them – particularly in committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">While the main thrust of the Bill is very welcome, there are a number of improvements that could be made in the general provisions that would meet some concerns of the staff and administration. I understand these have been conveyed to the Minister's Department. We have tried to discuss this with the people involved, mainly on a one-to-one basis, but the key remaining concerns which have not been taken on board by the Department of Finance include allowing the provision of funds for essential services for  the Houses of the Oireachtas and the administration. I am concerned because I want to ensure that the core parliamentary service, such as Parliamentary Questions, Bills, the office bills etc. are not diminished by the new requirements. It is essential that these are maintained and covered. Staff will complain, particularly within the committees, that they have difficulty in coping with much of what is going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">Provision should be made for a linked annual inflator for the rather rigid funding mechanism provided in the Bill. There should also be a mechanism to deal with contingencies. I will ask the Minister later what the figure is. I believe there is an "X" factor in it at present and that agreement will be reached with the Ceann Comhairle later. That needs to be teased out. If we are to have a three year budget it needs to be a respectable figure. I would like to see some factor that allows for changes that will take place, such as changes in the rate of inflation. It can be difficult to draw up an annual budget for any Department, let alone a three year one.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190">In discussions with interested groups, it has emerged that a board of management should be established to which the commission would delegate the day-to-day functions and which would oversee the administration. It would meet a number of essential needs. There is a question about worker representation. I know worker representation has been sought by the partnership committee, made up of staff, unions and management under the Partnership 2000 agreement. Several speakers expressed concern about their secretaries. It is essential that we recognise the input of the staff. It is not good enough to praise them here, we must recognise their actions in a statutory way. There should be worker representation. Such a board of management would give a statutory underpinning to the new directive administrative structure and move away from the rather archaic model of Clerk and Assistant Clerk of the House that has been in place for approximately 40 years. I particularly welcome the decision to change the title of the Clerk of the Dáil to Secretary General of the commission. We are told that perception is everything nowadays. Clerk of the Dáil is an archaic title and certainly does not describe the work involved and the importance of the post.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">There are several other changes on the day-to-day functioning that are probably necessary. A board of management would provide a comprehensive administrative focus in managing the day-to-day services and the committees. This is where most complaints are at the moment. It would obviously work under the auspices of the commission and would mirror the best practices of other EU Parliaments and the Parliaments of Australia and Canada. Members have travelled to study how they carry out their business. These are the kind of ideas they have returned with.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192">It was suggested that the Clerk of the Dáil, or Secretary General, should be a member of the  commission. I have concerns about that and suggest that it should not happen. The commission should consist solely of elected Members, with the Ceann Comhairle as the chairperson. The Secretary General should be the chief executive officer of the board of management, answerable to this House and various committees. I will ask the Minister to look at the proposal of setting up a board of management.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193">Adequate time must be allowed between the enactment of this Bill and the establishment order. A great deal of preparatory work needs to be done. I would like to hit the ground running. It must be a source of concern to the public when they read about the installation of an electronic voting system in this House but that it will not be used for a couple of months while seating is being sorted out. If we are to take this radical new approach then all of these issues should be in place before the commencement order is signed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194">I am concerned about funding. There is a nominal figure in the Bill for funding over the three year period. It is important that we get that figure right. I appreciate that there will be some negative publicity, regardless of what the figure is. We should be prepared to deal with that. The Minister has been prepared to bite the bullet and commit funding where it was necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195">This morning Deputy Killeen voiced his concern that the commission could end up being situated in a back office, away from the workings of the House. In respect of its day to day operations, the board of management should ensure that this is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196">The Bill deals with a number of extremely technical points and I know we will revisit them on Committee Stage. However, there are a number of aspects which have already been raised by several Members and which require further discussion. These include the provision of secretarial and research services. On a previous occasion, Deputy Ó Caoláin stated that "Ministers and Deputies supporting the Government have the use of a legion of civil servants to cater for their every need." I wish to place on record that I was left out of that particular loop. The Deputy's statement was not correct. I accept that people generalise when making statements such as that made by Deputy Ó Caoláin.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197">Deputy Deasy recently stated that many Members read scripts when making contributions and I accept that some people like to jot down notes to aid them when they are speaking. There is nothing prohibiting Members from using scripts. However, the Deputy went on to state that it was mainly Members on the Government side who were reading from prepared scripts. I have been watching proceedings very carefully in the interim and 50% of those who made contributions – Members from both sides of the House – did so with the aid of scripts. There are rights and wrongs on both sides but I believe that Members must be treated equally. Some people have the ability to sing, while others do not and  some can speak without a script while others ad lib. Thanks be to God we are not all clones.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198">The main point that arises from Deputy Ó Caoláin's comments – I accept there may have been a misconception on his part because he was quite new to the Houses when he made them – is that Members on this side do not enjoy any particular privilege in terms of staff support etc. Everyone has to do the same amount of work, which is crazy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199">We need to look at the entire committee system, particularly in the context of the report carried out by Michael Gallagher, Michael Laver and Michael Marsh. When I was vice-chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I had to take over as chairman when former Deputy Jim Mitchell was ill for four or five months and I was fascinated to discover the excellent level of support available to me in terms of research, technical back-up and advice and secretarial services. However, that support was only available to the Chairman of the committee and I do not know if every Chairman enjoys the same level of support. Any Member serving on the Committee of Public Accounts could take it on as a full-time job and would not have to do anything else for the entire week if he or she wanted to participate fully in its work, particularly in light of the amount of reading and studying required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1200">In addition to being vice-chairman of the Public Account Committee, I also served, more or less at the same time, as a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and as Government Whip on the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. As a result, I found it almost physically impossible to attend the House to make a real contribution on any issue. It is not possible to be involved in that range of work and make meaningful contributions in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201">It is easy for commentators to criticise Members with regard to the number of times they speak etc. One of the difficulties is that, with the honourable exception of Vincent Browne, no one bothers to review the work carried out by or the input of Members to the committees. In my opinion the committees must be seen as bodies which carry out important work on behalf of the House. Changes to the committee system are happening rapidly. If the findings of the 1997 report were put in place, each Member would only be allowed to serve on one committee. I do not know how matters will work out in this regard, but the recommendation has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202">I will not rehash comments made by other Members but the report also indicated how far behind are the Houses in terms of research and support services compared to other Parliaments. There is a great deal of information available about the number of Members in these Parliaments, but statistics are never provided with regard to the number of support staff available to them. However, I am sure some of them have up to ten times the staff resources available to them  as do Members of this House and the Seanad. Consideration must be given to this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203">We will continue to seek changes to the way in which we work. By and large, however, I believe the tools have been put in place to allow us to do our jobs and it is up to us to deliver. We will have to do better in many areas. There are many simple things over which we have control. During the lifetime of the previous Dáil, when the Ceann Comhairle served as Leas-Cheann Comhairle, a 90 minute debate took place on a particular morning in order that we could have an hour's additional speaking time on a certain topic that evening. With adjournments, Members leaving and entering the Chamber and the ensuing row, it took 90 minutes to make the case for an extra hour's debate that evening. That is ludicrous and we should not behave in that fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">We have to use the time available to us in a better fashion. It could be stated that 20 minutes is too long a period for one Member to speak. Local authorities have had to put time limits in place in respect of speakers. However, it must be remembered that tomorrow evening, when only ten or 15 Members remain around the complex, the powers that be will be seeking someone to, as in the past, speak for an hour. We must give Members the opportunity to speak if they wish to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">When complaints were made about the amount of time available to Members representing Sinn Féin, the Taoiseach made the point that there are 81 Deputies on this side of the House about whom he has to worry. It is extremely difficult for Government backbenchers to get time to speak. Members may be given a speaking slot, but anything may happen, such as involvement with committee work, which means that they cannot contribute.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206">I encourage colleagues on both sides of the House to take a positive attitude to the Bill. We need to explain to people, particularly political commentators, the exact nature of its contents. There are so many commissions in place that they may mistake this commission for one of them. The commission represents the most radical change to the Houses of the Oireachtas since their establishment and it has massive potential. We are fortunate, despite forecasts about financial difficulties, to have a Minister as open-minded and enlightened as Deputy McCreevy. I believe he will continue with the work he has been doing and that this will be a better House not only for us but also in terms of service to the public. The new structures will help us provide a better service.</p>

          <p eId="para_1212">As far as singing is concerned, we will leave that discussion for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213">I agree with a previous speaker who stated that Deputies' secretaries are very poorly paid. Given the level of responsibility, expertise and commitment required of these people, I ask the Minister, in the context of the Bill, to consider their salary scale with a view to increasing it. I am not as <i>au fait</i> with the systems and structures as the longer serving Members. My first impressions of Leinster House have been positive. The staff are helpful at all times, efficient in the execution of their duties and, most important for a new Member, they are friendly and considerate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214">The Bill before the House seeks to provide the back up facilities for Members, including staff, which we need to do our work effectively. Although I am a new Member I am already acutely aware of the many facets of my job as a public representative. Is my role that of a legislator or is it as a representative of my constituents, to deliver a service at local level and to help deliver to my constituency what is available to it from the national envelope? It is both and more. My short experience in Dáil Éireann tells me that people expect a service at local level. They expect their public representatives to lobby on behalf of local schools, to deal with planning issues and to take an interest in and respond to local issues. These issues can be as diverse as violence against women, meat factory prices, the restrictions being placed on the sale of food supplements or the continuation of community employment schemes. The issues are local and sometimes the local translates to the national level. Regardless, as a public representative I am expected to deliver the service both locally and nationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215">At national level I am expected to act as a legislator. I have a particular interest in legislation, whether it is the Bill before us today or the Arts Bill tomorrow. However, I need the backup and resources to familiarise myself with the issues so I can make a considered and informed contribution. I had no real idea of the volume of business in the Dáil Chamber and the various committees of the House. I had not realised, either, that the Dáil and the committees often run concurrently, causing additional pressures when one needs to be in two places at the same time. Would it not make sense and ease the demands on Deputies if committee meetings, as far as possible, did not conflict with Dáil sittings? This would create further time demands on Deputies but it would also enable them to maximise their contributions to proceedings in the House and in committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216">The committee on European affairs, of which I am a member, has an enormous amount of work to do on an ongoing basis. This arises from the Government's commitment to ensure that the affairs of the European Union are properly scrutinised and monitored by Dáil Éireann. With 15 nations in the EU the volume of work is staggering. This will increase substantially, hopefully, following a "Yes" vote next Saturday. There are significant developments ahead in the EU, not least the reform proposals for the Common Agricultural Policy, which will have huge implications for my constituents in Sligo-Leitrim.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">With regard to this workload, the sincerity of the Government in ensuring that the people, through the Dáil, have an influence on EU legislation will be called into question if we, who represent the people, are not given the necessary backup to do our job effectively. We must have assistance in research and other backup so we can question and contribute. This is particularly true in the case of an Independent Member since the political parties already have substantial resources for this purpose. Deputy Dennehy referred to this issue earlier and I will be happy to discuss it with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218">I welcome the Bill and I commend the Minister for proposing it. However, a word of caution is necessary. The public is sceptical about increased expenditure on the Oireachtas. There is a need to project the clear message that this Bill is a measure to increase efficiency and accountability, to deliver a better service and to help reduce what is perceived by many to be a democratic deficit.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaddyMcHughIND" eId="spk_576">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_1219">I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate. This is an important Bill for Members of the House. People who are elected to the Dáil are expected to do a good job and to do a job well, one must be well resourced. The resources available to us leave much to be desired.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">I acknowledge the enormous improvements that have occurred in recent years in the facilities available to Members. I also acknowledge that the Minister for Finance was responsible for those improvements. That happened some time ago but, by all accounts, the Minister tackled this issue and delivered as much as he could at the time. However, more improvements are needed if the House is to function as a modern Parliament should. This Bill has the potential to facilitate those improvements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">The philosophy of the Bill is that Members of the Oireachtas will, in effect, regulate their own affairs. That is democracy at work. Where better to illuminate democracy at work than in this Chamber? However, other improvements are required, specifically to make the operations of the House relevant to the public. Some of the procedures in the House are archaic. It is alarming that, on election to the Dáil as an Independent Deputy, I have no recognised speaking rights. We like to think we are modern and pro gressive but the 7,500 people who gave me their first preference vote do not have a right to have their concerns directly represented in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222">Further reforms in the House are urgently required. The basic right of any citizen is the right to free speech. The least a citizen expects is that the person he or she elects to the national Parliament would have the right to free speech in the Chamber to which he or she is elected. I am appalled by the behaviour of the Labour Party in the Chamber this morning. It prevented democratically elected Members of the House from speaking in the House. I would have thought that the title "dictator" would not fit too smoothly on the Labour Party. However, it fits snugly after this morning's performance. The actions of its members clearly indicated that if they do not like what a Deputy says in the House, they will invoke a mechanism to prevent him from speaking. That is censorship in its clearest form.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223">The Deputy leading the charge this morning is from Limerick. If a former Limerick Deputy, who represented the same constituency in this House both as an Independent Deputy and as a Labour Party Deputy, was aware of what took place this morning, he would turn in his grave. Shame on the Labour Party. The basis of the Labour Party's objection this morning to freedom of speech in the House is that the offending Deputies would not be singing from the same hymn sheet. They would be offering their individual views. The Labour Party finds this objectionable. That is what is wrong with this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224">Many members of the public have determined that this House is irrelevant to their daily lives. They have decided that the Members of this House are all the same. The Technical Group in the House offers diversity of views but the Labour Party, the party of reform, does not like this. It is in favour of reform provided everything remains the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225">I welcome the provisions of this Bill. More reform is needed but, after this morning's performance, I doubt that the parties in the House have the stomach for it.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_1227">A few years ago a former Member of this House who went on to become a judge described to me what he thought Leinster House was like during his time as a Deputy some ten years ago. He said, "It's a club – nothing more, nothing less. It's a private members club with privileges that accrue to Members and former Members, and if you expect it to be more than that, well, it's not. It's simply a club."  From my point of view, as an Opposition Member, it is a club with several tiers of membership and it is clear that Opposition Deputies do not have the same rights or privileges as Government Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228">I would like to talk about my own experience, for example. I have no office, no computer and no right to address the House, which is outrageous. It is appalling that a letter to the Chief Whip about these matters has gone unanswered,  although a month after I wrote to her I received a telephone call from her office. My letter concerned very basic issues, such as the right to have an office in this club, yet I still do not have one. I had to burrow under the paperwork of my colleague, Deputy Boyle, to find my copy of the Bill before the House. We have to share, not only an office, but also a desk, which is tantamount to treating us with utter contempt. As an Opposition Member, I have no administrative staff, yet I have discovered that Government and Labour Party Members have a considerable administrative staff available to them who are on the payroll of the Houses of the Oireachtas, over and above the administrative assistants to which we are all entitled. I am trying to understand what is going on. I understand the Labour Party has 16 additional staff in addition to secretarial assistants. I shudder to think what the Government has at its disposal compared to our meagre resources. A salary scale of €18,300 for a secretarial assistant is little short of derisory.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229">This club needs a bit of a shake up. I have discovered that I am not allowed to bring a lap-top computer into the Chamber, even assuming that I had one. I am still waiting for a computer to be supplied by the Houses of the Oireachtas, and there is no crèche. I was quietly reminded by an usher that it is a tradition of the House to wear a jacket and tie in the Chamber. While I wish to pay tribute to the ushers who do fantastic work, I told the usher in question that it was not a tradition of mine to be so attired. I seem to have got away with it so far. Much more attention is being paid to some aspects of the workings of the House than others. Consequently, there is a need for reform and, possibly, reform that goes beyond the provisions of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230">Some people have asked me and my colleagues in the Green Party the reason we joined the Technical Group, a broad church reflecting quite diverse political views. I told them it was quite simply to obtain the right to speak in this Chamber. As a Member of this club of 166, it is a matter of human rights to be allowed to address the House, yet no such right is granted to us. As a result, I am contemplating taking action at European level if I cannot clarify the issue here. I have been told that one must be in a group of seven Deputies, rather than six, to form a group. In addition, we cannot even bring somebody into our group; we must be elected as a group of seven in order to avail of the right to address the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231">We require the provision of administrative staff and technical resources on a par with Government Deputies. We also seek the right to have offices together in order that, whether as a group of six or 22 Deputies, we can communicate with each other. Child care needs should also be provided for. The requirements I have outlined should take precedence over the provision of the proposed new car parking facilities costing €23 million.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_1232">I concur with the contribution of Deputy Cuffe who put his points quite  well. I also wish to address some of the provisions of the Bill before us. A lán de na modhanna oibre atá ann, cibé gnó na Dála féin nó gnó an tSeanaid iad, agus an slí a reachtáltar an Dáil mar ionad oibre, tháinig siad chugainn, thar na blianta nó na cianta, ó impiriúlaithe Westminster, áit a reachtáltar an pairlimint ar bhonn "gentlemen's club". Tá a lán lán le déanamh againn chun na Parlaiminte seo a dhéanamh níos éifeachtaí, níos oscailte agus níos daonlathaigh.</p>
          <p eId="para_1233">Deputies and Senators account for only a fraction of the number who work in the Houses of the Oireachtas. For that reason, I contend that the proposed make-up of the commission is totally insufficient. Some seven Members of the Oireachtas will be members of the commission, but where is the representation for the hundreds of staff members of all grades who also work here? There should be workers' representation on the commission as reflected in best international practice in most modern companies and other Parliaments. In a democratic institution such as this House the fullest possible representation should be evident. The workers' representative could be directly elected or nominated by the relevant trade union or a joint trade union committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234">Tá buairt orm chomh maith nach bhfuil sé leagtha amach conas a roghnófar na Teachtaí agus na Seanadóirí a bhéas ar an gcoimisiún. Séard atá i gceist ná go mbeidh ceathrar ón Dáil agus triúir ón Seanad. Ardaíonn an líon a bhéas ar an gcoimisiún an cheist, "Conas a bhéas ionadaíocht cheart ag na mionpháirtithe agus na Baill neamhspleách san Oireachtas?".</p>
          <p eId="para_1235">The Dáil is now more representative of the political diversity in the State than ever before. The Bill should be amended to reflect this new reality and, thus, contribute to redressing the ongoing democratic deficit in the House. The commission should be large enough to accommodate the make-up of the Dáil now or in the future, especially in the event of Standing Order 114 being amended to give proper recognition to Sinn Féin and other smaller parties and Independent Deputies. These difficulties can be resolved through common sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236">I acknowledge that there have been significant improvements in facilities, but they are far from satisfactory. Even with the addition of the Leinster House 2000 block, the available office space in the Houses of the Oireachtas is still inadequate. Members of my party and other Deputies require more office space as a matter of urgency, in addition to that currently allocated. I realise that space for such facilities is limited, but urge that a thorough review of the use of office space in the Leinster House complex be undertaken. This should be one of the first duties of the new commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237">Another issue for the commission to deal with is the lack of support staff. While Government Ministers have legions of civil servants to cater for their every need, Opposition Deputies must  try to cope with inadequate staff levels. I trust this issue will be treated as a priority and that the minimum provision will be that outlined in the international benchmarking report, which recommended an additional research assistant for every Teachta. We should have a parliamentary system which is the envy of the world, instead of one which is lagging behind other Parliaments in terms of support for Teachtaí, Seanadoirí agus an fhoireann fhéin. Press conference facilities should be provided for Opposition parties as well as child care services. In this day and age it is totally unacceptable that we still do not have a crèche available for the hundreds of workers in Leinster House. It is a disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_1238">Ba mhaith liom filleadh ar an bpointe a rinne mé níos luaithe sa díospóireacht, sé sin teip an Stáit aistriúcháin chomhionnach a dhéanamh ar reachtaíocht agus ar ionstraim reachtaíochta. Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh an coimisiún déileáil leis sin.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnDeasyFG" eId="spk_579">
          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_1239">While the legislation makes eminently good sense, I wish to address my remarks principally to the operation of the Chamber. In an earlier debate I spoke about the Dáil's lack of relevance, which seems to have struck a chord with a number of people who have said they agree with me. It is all very well to complain about such matters, but, as elected Members, we should do something about them by working together on a bipartisan basis to bring about change. Frankly it has become a boring Chamber. The public understands that well and has switched off from the proceedings in this Chamber to a great extent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240">The nub of the problem is there is no longer spontaneity in this Chamber. There is no interaction. The proceedings are designed to make sure that questions are not answered. That is why last week we saw every parliamentary technique and tactic used to make sure that the Taoiseach would not answer questions from the Opposition parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1241">I have knowledge of this subject from my past three years on Waterford County Council. Against the wishes of some people I introduced radio broadcasting of the proceedings of Waterford County Council. I lobbied the Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Labour members and impressed on them that it would be good for them to have excerpts from the county council chamber broadcast on local radio. We won the vote on the issue by 13 votes to eight and it modernised the chamber to a great extent. Some of the older members found it difficult at the beginning, but it really made a difference. People are beginning to understand the local authority processes and all that goes on in the chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242">The problem in this Chamber is that everything is pre-ordained. Everything is rehearsed and scrutinised before it gets to the floor of the House and it has become sterile. For instance, yesterday's Question Time was followed by the Order of Business and the answers were pre-ordained.  There was a total evasion of the questions and there was no effort whatsoever to engage in an open debate, and that is very disappointing. I understand there must be some time restrictions and one cannot allow people speak forever, but unfortunately we have got to the point where the House has become irrelevant. As a result the public and the media are beginning to switch off from the Dáil Chamber and that is a dangerous development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">The debate on the Flood tribunal report was a perfect example of this. The Taoiseach, at the time, stated that we did not want the answers, but I disagree with him. Whether he likes it, this is the people's House and he has a responsibility as head of Government to be accountable. If even there had been a half-hour refereed by the Ceann Comhairle where people could freely involve themselves in the debate, that would have been sufficient. However, the rules are not being used fairly by the Government. They are being used to stifle debate and prevent questions being answered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1244">Some county councils have more power than Deputies. At least I get to confront the county manager every month. I can grill that man and his officials at will, there is give and take, there is a right of reply and there is banter. If you say something wrong, they will take you to task. The public are interested in these debates. They read about them in the local newspapers. That is what it is all about.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245">We have lost that in this Chamber. There is none of that here. Members might shout across the Chamber at each other, but the debate is severely restricted. People understand that is the case and as a result it is becoming a waste of time. To pick an analogy, it is like marking someone on a hurling field with one hand tied behind your back. You might be close to him, but you both realise that you will not do him any damage whatsoever. It is very unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_1246">The door-stepping of politicians by the media is becoming more prevalent. The media have realised that the relevance of the Dáil has waned to the extent that they would be better off waiting outside the houses or offices of politicians to ask questions. That is a dangerous phenomenon and has resulted in government by media.</p>
          <p eId="para_1247">There are some changes which are beneficial. The European affairs committee is bringing in changes to scrutinise directives before they affect the people. It is also a good development that Ministers will be brought before that committee prior to involving themselves in negotiations in Europe so that their negotiating strategies are scrutinised by the members of the committee and by this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248">Deputy Killeen spoke about Ministers appearing in front of committees. The proposal for the European affairs committee should be extended to all committees so that committees are able to compel Ministers to come before them and answer questions. That is an element which is missing here. It would be valuable to the commit tees and would give them more prestige and more power.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249">Some legislatures or assemblies around the world allow one-minute speeches before the Order of Business. Members are allowed get up and speak for one minute on any issue, whether it is a grudge, a constituency issue or an important policy issue. That process lasts for 60 minutes. In some assemblies, it sets the tone of the day and the media really pick up on it. The US House of Representatives is a good example of this, where it makes the House more colourful. It involves the media. Members get a chance to come to the floor before the Order of Business and say what they have to say. It is snappy and it keeps everyone involved. It is something we should consider. In addition, committees must be allowed subpoena witnesses to appear before them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">Earlier Deputy Dennehy mentioned the use of scripts. I agree with Deputy Harkin's point. She said that she was reading a script but it was one she had written herself. That is the difficulty. There are party activists – we had a very good example of that in the Chamber about 15 minutes ago – and civil servants writing scripts for Members which means they are not using their own words. Part of the reason for this is that at the end of the year <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and other newspapers print lists outlining the time each Deputy has spent speaking in the Dáil Chamber. This has resulted in an emphasis on quantity over quality. They are interested only in being listed in the newspapers as having spoken for five or six hours so that they will not get a hard time from their constituents. This is ruining open debate. If you are elected to the Dáil, you should be able to get up on your own two feet and, using notes because everybody needs a prompt, say what you have to say.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">I will not come into the Chamber and confront people if they have a script. I understand change must be agreed on a bipartisan basis and I will not change anything unless the Government parties and the Ceann Comhairle are willing to do so. There is a way of dealing with this. We can work something out so that party leaders and Ministers are allowed to continue using scripts, but apart from that we should ban them. The practice serves no purpose. It stops the free flow of debate and it is dragging the House down generally. It is boring. Nobody wants to listen to somebody reading from a script for 20 minutes when it is obvious in many cases that he or she has not written it. I am sorry the Ceann Comhairle is not present. If he were, I might have asked him for his opinion on it. I understand we need to make these changes on a bipartisan basis. If we do not do so, the Dáil will become more irrelevant than it is already. That is a frightening thought because it has already sunk to a low depth.</p>

        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_580">
          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_1252">I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill. It is important that we improve the structures of the House, finance  those improvements and ensure all groups which serve this House run their offices and finance their structures with full transparency. I do not object to the Bill so long as ordinary Members maintain a say in the new structures being established. It is important that the problems of backbench Members are taken into account. Ministers and party leaders, who have their own structures and support systems, often do not realise how difficult it is for backbench Members to access the necessary research and back-up services and legal advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253">I recall discussions in the Dáil bar when older Members told us of their days in the House when four or five Deputies shared one office, secretary and telephone. We now have mobile phones in our pockets and are deeply involved at all times. We have one secretary-personal assistant and matters have improved. This does not mean, however, that we are satisfied. We must continue to make improvements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254">Setting up a constituency office is a costly matter and the allowance we receive to help with these costs is not sufficient. We also receive a telephone allowance, but rural Deputies receive the same allowance as Dublin-based Deputies who can make all their telephone calls from their Leinster House offices, at no cost. When the media publish the amounts of expenses drawn down by various Deputies, those of us who have constituency offices are shown to receive greater amounts in expenses and the public is led to believe that we put this money into our pockets. In fact, we use it to pay part of the cost of the structures we have set up to service the public. This matter needs to be clearly spelt out. The allowance paid for the running of a constituency office needs to be increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255">Deputies' secretaries are more than just ordinary secretaries. They must undertake research, meet various groups and work unusual hours. They are not paid at a level which would attract the proper people for this work. I receive an allowance for extra help to which I add from my own funds to pay an extra full-time person. I do this because I must compete with others who are better served in this area. I employ two full-time secretaries in my office. This is necessary. The full cost of this staff should be met by the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">I have an office in my constituency and do some business from my own home, but other parties have four or five offices and full-time local authority councillors. The councillors who work with me are all in business or farming and have a full day's work to do. We must have a level playing pitch and know how these things are done. I am asking for no more and no less than other Deputies. I want to give the best service I can to the House and my constituents, but want to be able to do so in an open, frank and structured way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">I have served in this House for almost ten years. Deputy Deasy, a newcomer to the Dáil, has referred to the frustrations of working within it.  This afternoon I heard the Taoiseach give one answer to 28 questions and read a long list of meetings he has attended. This was neither entertaining nor exciting and the media will take little interest in it. Compare our House with other Parliaments where quick sharp questions receive relevant answers. The answers we receive from Ministers are long-winded and often irrelevant. We must change this procedure. This House is the watchdog of the country and when questions are asked, we are entitled to receive answers. I quote today as an example, but the same could be said of any Minister on any day. Long written scripts are read by Ministers, often giving an answer to a question which was not even asked.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">I am frustrated by the publicity given to the length of time for which Deputies and Senators speak. We are judged by the public on these reports, but some of us give enormous lengths of time to committee structures in the House. In the last Dáil I was a member of the Select Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. We spent days discussing agricultural issues with very helpful civil servants, but seldom with the Minister, who ignored the committee unless he needed to pass the Vote for his Department. Otherwise, he seldom used the committee because he knew the media would give its proceedings little publicity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">Committees are the workhorses of the House. They debate Bills and give ordinary Members the opportunity to contribute. However, the structures of the House must be changed. There is no reason the Dáil cannot sit for longer periods during the year so as to allow committees receive a full hearing and public exposure. With the exception of major committees such as the Committee of Public Accounts, the work of committees is not recognised. The work done by farm organisations, of which the Minister and I have been members, is often seen by the media as more important than debates on Bills in the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">I remember a Bill which dealt with public liability insurance in which I had a major involvement. When the Government fell in 1994, the Opposition was trying to make changes to a Bill proceeding through the House that would make it relevant. When we went into Government, a number of us met the Attorney General and others and got the changes made. The day the Bill was passed, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, and some of his then colleagues were pictured with the then Minister in charge, former Deputy Taylor. They came in here for five minutes for a photocall and then claimed full responsibility for the legislation. The Minister of State may accept the point I am making in ten years time, if he is still in this House then.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261">It can be extremely frustrating to put hours and weeks of work into legislation like that. We were the only people who could vote it through. In the council chamber in Monaghan, the same issue was raised and the opposition there demanded legal advice on it. That advice went against them because it was based on the law already in place.  We changed the law to make the situation more tenable for property owners in general, not just farmers. Changing legislation, making it work and making it relevant is what this House is about. However, Members often do not get the recognition for that and I hope change will take place. I am glad to have the opportunity to get some of these matters off my chest. There is a great need for those in charge of this legislation to make sure that it is not only put through the Houses but that it is put into operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262">I make no apologies for raising another agricultural issue that is relevant. The Minister in charge in 1989 put through a Bill on the use of meat and bonemeal. It was a brilliant Bill that banned the meal from being put into different products and feedstuffs. However, the Minister did not put the Bill into operation and it was not until 1995 that personnel were appointed to oversee its operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263">That is not the way business should be done. It is essential this Bill be put through as quickly as possible and that, when it goes through, the Minister finances it properly and that it is put into operation so that everyone in this House has a reasonable service. I could go through the technicalities of the needs of Members and the committee secretariat but it has all been mentioned before. However, it is important that this commission is funded so that the national Parliament has the services and back-up that Members deserve. Above all, it should be transparent so that I can work on the same basis as members of other parties.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_597">
          <from>Ms O'Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_1281">The rules of the House are clear. My good name was misused in a previous contribution and I have the right to answer. I know that the Labour Party Whip at the Whips' meetings argued for the right of the Technical Group and I have no problem with that. However, what happened this morning was an effort to ensure that the rules of the House were upheld. Everybody had the opportunity to speak in the correct order and that is what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">There may be some misunderstanding in relation to the position of the Labour Party. We have exactly the same rights as every other party and grouping in this House. A suggestion was made by a Deputy that the Labour Party had a higher allocation of staff than is our right. That is  not true. Deputy Crawford referred to the fact that he has only one assistant in his constituency office. That is my position also and when I am in the Oireachtas, as I am sure is the case for most Deputies, I must do all my typing and telephone answering as well as other errands. There is a strong argument that all Members should have, in particular, research assistants who would help us to contribute as legislators and enable us to do our work here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">Changes are needed. I agree with Deputy Harkin's point about secretarial staff being underpaid. I join those Members who have spoken on that issue and who have indicated that secretarial staff should be paid a reasonable wage for the job they do. They are much more than secretaries, though I am not knocking secretaries. The secretarial staff in the Houses do a very wide job as personal assistants, dealing with all sorts of problems and issues. I feel strongly that they should be better paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">I support other speakers who talked about the stylised system of debate in this House where many Members read from scripts. Lest there be some misunderstanding or belief that the Labour Party is pleading a special case, I write my own notes and am speaking from notes now. I generally try to do that because I feel that it makes for better debate. I support what has been said about the minimisation of the use of scripts. Ministers have an argument for using scripts in that there is a danger that they will not give accurate information on behalf of the Government if they do not have a certain amount of scripted material. However, there is no reason other Members should use scripts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">Speeches should be shorter and debates interactive where, for example, Members would have three-minute slots and there would be an opportunity for the Government and Opposition to interact. That would make for more real debate. What happens here is not debate in a real sense in that we get set times to make our speeches and do not get a chance to interact.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">I support those who stated that committees do not get the recognition they deserve. A great deal of good work is done in committees, but it is very seldom reported by the media, meaning that those who put the most effort into committee work do not get the recognition they deserve. Many of those who lost their Dáil seats in this year's election had contributed hugely to committee work in this House. I doubt if a line was ever written about it in a newspaper or if they ever received credit for it from their constituents. The work that is done in the Oireachtas needs to be recognised. I support those who have argued that the efforts of Members do not seem to be understood by the public. We have a responsibility to address this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1287">I am the Labour Party's spokesperson on equality and I would hate to think that certain Deputies believe they are persecuted or somehow treated as less equal than others. If I thought that  was the case, I would be happy as equality spokesperson to defend them and to stand over their rights. There is an imbalance in the attitudes of some Members. They seem to think that because it took them a while to get their rights, everyone else is somehow walking all over them. I am a member of the Opposition and I find it extraordinary that other members of the Opposition seem to be attacking my party. They are right to assert their rights, but my party has rights too. Labour Party Deputies are entitled to assert their rights under the rules of this House and I will continue to do so. All Members of the House have the right to express their views and to have them heard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288">A Deputy accused me this afternoon of somehow trying to railroad the system, but I do not have the power to do so. I rely on the decisions of the Chair. I do not know whether the Deputy in question fully realises that the Labour Party is also an Opposition party. I understand that he initially hoped to be selected for one of the Government parties, but had to run as an independent candidate when he was not selected. Perhaps he is confused about which side of the House he sits on. You have known me for a long time, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and you know that I do not normally make speeches in which I enter into debate with other Members. I felt extremely hurt and wronged when I heard the remarks which were made in reference to my contribution this morning. I was simply trying to ensure that the House kept its own rules.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_598">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_1289">I am responding to this Second Stage debate in place of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, who is unavoidably absent on official business. Many new Members have spoken in the past hour while I was listening to the debate. Many of them referred to their experiences and related their frustrations, in some cases, about the way in which we conduct business in the Chamber. The new Dáil has more new Members than has been the case for some time. Like many other Deputies, I was not a Member when the fundamental aspects of this Bill were spelled out upon its publication. It would not be harmful, therefore, to revise some of the Bill's basic provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">This Bill establishes the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to govern the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. The commission will provide administration and back-up services to Members of both Houses. It will, with one exception, consist of parliamentarians and will assume the same functions and powers as a Minister in a Department. It will draw a sum of money from the central fund. The precise amount will be determined by means of an amendment to section 5 of the Bill on Committee Stage and will be expected to last for three years. Many Members have mentioned the frustrations of Opposition Deputies and reference has even been made to the use of scripts, as opposed to off-the-cuff con tributions. I am not 100% sure, having listened to many contributions, whether scripts are more boring than their alternative. I will continue to read from a script tonight because, as a new Deputy, it is important that I set the record straight.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">Most Deputies can expect to sit on both sides of the House at some stage of their careers, but we have a responsibility to those who elected us regardless of which side of the House we sit on. It is right that we should not be deflected from the task we were given when we were elected by having to chase officials of the Department of Finance, or indeed the Minister, for funding for certain services which are needed to do our job properly and effectively. The Bill before the House allows decisions on proposals relating to services and resources, whether made by individual Members or by groups, to be taken in Leinster House. I agree that such decisions should be taken by elected Members who are familiar with the challenges and problems we face. It is probable that the average Member understands such challenges better than officials in the Department of Finance, who made such decisions heretofore.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292">This Bill is concerned with housekeeping issues which are currently addressed by the Minister for Finance. Decisions other than those relating to pay, superannuation and kindred matters will be taken by the commission. Many Deputies have raised the issue of the levels of individuals' pay, but such issues will be outside the remit of the commission. From my experience, it merits such consideration. One of the fundamental principles underlying this Bill is that the commission's relationship with its civil servants should be as close as possible to that of a Minister and his departmental staff. This approach has been built into the Bill. One or two speakers floated ideas about new mechanisms to protect essential services. Such ideas do not, at first sight, seem to be in accordance with the approach I have mentioned. It has been suggested that the Public Service Management Act, 1997, which the then Ceann Comhairle and Cathaoirleach agreed last year should apply to the office, could be better adapted to the precise conditions of the commission regime. This is being examined at present to see if an amendment can be tabled on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">This Bill will undoubtedly result in the fundamental reorganisation of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas, creating a greater level of independence. This will be popular, if I understand today's contributions correctly. I thank those Members who spoke and who raised many interesting issues. Certain Deputies took the opportunity to deal with issues that had nothing to do with the Bill. I wish to respond to a couple of points that were made, although we will be able to do so at greater length and in more detail on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">A number of Deputies expressed concerns about the resourcing proposals in the Bill. As the Minister pointed out in his opening statement, the  amount shown in section 5 of the Bill is the sum of the revised Estimate for the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas in 2002 and the amounts for 2003 and 2004 if policy does not change. The figure in the Bill is merely a holding sum to overcome the prohibition on leaving a blank space in the section. The definitive amount to be agreed between the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for Finance will be substituted for the amount specified in the section, by way of an amendment on Committee Stage. Having listened to Members' shopping lists, I expect all Deputies will support the Minister and the amount recommended. The recently completed consultancy exercise to ascertain the probable resource and staffing requirements of Members and the office, under the new arrangements envisaged by the Bill, will be used to determine the amount to be included in the final version of the Bill. The Minister intends that the commission will have resources commensurate with a modern Parliament. Many speakers referred to other Parliaments. The international benchmarking study was established to provide the basis for the resourcing of the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">Deputy Howlin suggested that the Bill should provide for the financing of the Houses' essential services. As I have said, the sum to be provided will be agreed between the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for Finance. I do not believe it would be appropriate for the Minister for Finance to specify how a portion of the funding should be spent by the commission, as the whole purpose of the Bill is to give the commission independence from the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, and to meet the ongoing expenses of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas as it sees fit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">Deputy Richard Bruton raised the question of best practice and improvements in standards. I would certainly expect the commission to implement best practice. As the Deputy pointed out, the commission must define itself by the way it operates and does its business. The Bill provides for openness and transparency in the working of the commission. Section 6 requires the commission to cause an annual report on the activities of the commission to be prepared, published and presented to both Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">It further requires the Secretary General, if requested by either House of the Oireachtas or a committee of either House of the Oireachtas, to authorise to make such a request to furnish, on behalf of the commission, the requesting body with information on the policies, activities, accounts and other matters relating to the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">Section 13 provides that the commission shall prepare and publish a statement of Estimates on an annual basis. The Estimates will be presented to the House by way of take note motion by a member of the commission or a Member of the House nominated by the commission. The Estimates are then to be provided to the Minister for Finance in good time to include them in the  White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure, that is, no later than 30 days before budget day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">Section 14 provides that the commission shall keep annual accounts in the form, and for the accounting period, specified by the Minister. It also makes provision for the Secretary General to submit these accounts annually to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit within three months of the relevant accounting period. The Secretary General is also obliged to present the Minister with a copy of the accounts and report and present himself or herself before a committee of the House established to examine such accounts and, therefore, to the Comptroller and Auditor General whenever is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">I agree with Deputy Bruton's comments on Dáil reform but the Bill allows for the reorganisation of the structures of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is a major step forward but real Dáil reform must come from within the Houses. The Deputy suggested that a new and radical role must be developed for Members. The former Government Chief Whip and current Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, explored with his counterparts the reforms on which there would be consensus and other parties teased out the implications for their members of the scenarios for change. However, it would not be proper for the Government to define roles for parliamentarians. The Bill will provide resourcing for a modern Parliament and it is incumbent on its Members to decide how this should manifest itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">Deputies Bruton and Howlin discussed eloquently the need to reinstate power to the Dáil and to investigate issues of public importance. I understand and support this but the parameters are not yet crystal clear and, until the outcome of recent cases are reviewed fully, this issue would be better left for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302">Deputy McGrath commented on the prohibition on the commission to make appointments above the level of principal officer. Such appointments are subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance and it is envisaged that the consent of the Minister will be granted where he is satisfied that the workload and responsibilities of proposed posts are on a par with the generality of Civil Service posts at that level. The number of posts in the Civil Service above the level of principal officer is small.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303">Many Members, when commenting on resources, alluded to the need for improved research facilities. The legislation will provide for a significant increase in the resources available to the Houses. The Minister believes it is not his role to define how these resources should be utilised. When the benchmarking exercise was established, it was to report in the areas that are seen to be under-resourced compared to international Parliaments. It is clear from contributions that recommendations of the report in regard to the provision of research facilities for Members do not meet with widespread support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304">Following the passage of the legislation and the establishment of the commission it will no longer be up to the Minister for Finance to make recommendations on how additional resources should be utilised. The Minister's objective is to ensure sufficient resources are in place for the commission to carry out its functions, as set out in the Bill. It is significant that new arrangements will be in place for Members, which are vital to allow them to work effectively for their constituents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">Many of these arrangements have been gleaned from our experience of other European Parliaments as a direct result of our membership of the EU. On Saturday next, we, the people of Ireland, will be asked to play our part in securing a prosperous and peaceful future, not just for ourselves but for all of Europe. Under the Nice treaty, we are being joined by members from countries where for decades Parliaments were merely rubber stamps for totalitarian regimes. Many of these countries have spent the past decade grafting real parliamentary systems on the body politic. A continuation of this process is proposed under the treaty with member states of an enlarged EU going forward together for the greater good.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">I thank all Members for their contributions and I have no doubt there will be an opportunity to discuss the issues further on Committee Stage. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_1309">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_1310">The Bill gives effect in Irish law to the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in connection with the carriage of hazardous and noxious substances by sea, 1996, the HNS convention. The Bill also gives effect to the 1996 protocol to the International Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, 1976, LLMC 1976.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311">The main objective of the HNS convention is to provide adequate, prompt and effective compensation for loss or damage arising in connec tion with the carriage of HNS on seagoing ships. The convention complements arrangements which have been in place since 1969 regarding civil liability and compensation in regard to oil pollution. The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Acts, 1988 to 1998, gave effect to those arrangements in domestic law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312">The HNS convention is to apply to loss of life or personal injury; loss of or damage to property; environmental damage; and costs of preventative measures. LLMC 1976 establishes the basis on which claims may be made arising out of the various risks accompanying maritime transport. It also establishes how they may be prosecuted and sets maximum aggregate limits depending on the tonnage of vessel in question for claims arising from any one incident. The Merchant Shipping (Liability of Shipowners and Others) Act, 1996, gives effect to LLMC 1976 in domestic law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">The 1996 hazardous and noxious substances conference considered, however, that these limits would not be sufficient to provide adequate compensation for claims likely to arise under the new HNS convention and contemporaneously agreed the proposed protocol which would increase the limits. The effect of the Bill is to require Irish vessels everywhere, and non-Irish vessels within a 200 mile nautical limit, in accordance with the terms of the HNS convention, which are carrying hazardous and noxious substances, as defined, to carry compulsory insurance for the amount they may be liable to pay in compensation for any loss or damage caused by those substances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314">These are listed in the convention and include such materials as liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas, oils and fats, combustible chemicals, solvents etc., but exclude radioactive materials which are covered under a separate convention. The deliberate discharge of any of these materials into the sea is already a criminal offence under the Sea Pollution Acts, 1991 to 1999. The Bill provides for enforcement by, among others, the Garda, the Defence Forces and harbour masters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">Penalties for non-compliance with the compulsory insurance requirements are on summary conviction, a fine not exceeding £1,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £1 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or both. These penalties are similar to those set out in sea pollution legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">These amounts, as Deputies will have noted, are stated in punts which reflected the currency prevailing at the date of publication of the Bill. I propose to introduce amendments on Committee Stage to reflect the introduction of the euro.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_57">Mr. O'Flynn: This is an issue that has affected every business in the past two years. Insurance premiums have escalated to an unacceptable level in recent times. My company's combined policy of employer liability and public liability has increased by 100% in 18 months. This must not be allowed to continue. How can insurance companies justify such increases for companies that have no track record of claims, particularly when inflation is 5%? Last night we heard about responsible business people who have ceased trading because they could not get motor insurance cover and those who have decided to operate without public or employer liability insurance. Those businesses run the risk of serious financial consequences if there is a claim against them but they prefer to take that risk than lose the business they have worked hard to develop over a lifetime.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_58">Some companies have seen increases of up to 1,500% in their insurance premiums in two years. The Minister must do everything in her power to bring the insurance companies to book. Businesses compete in the marketplace with their goods and services and should not be stymied by the high cost of insurance. Theà la carte insurance coverage offered by some sectors of the insurance industry must cease. They should not be allowed to pick and choose the business they want, such as life or pension cover which carry little risk.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_59">The insurance industry claims that 11 September is a major cause of its problems but I  reject this. Insurance in the United States and Britain has increased only marginally since 11 September. The true problem is poor international investment returns on funds invested by insurance companies. People should not have to pay for poor fiscal decisions by fund managers and insurance companies.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_60">Courts order high pay-outs in motor and personal injury claims and, as a result, fraudulent claims are made. The present legal system leads to high legal costs and awards, but to blame the legal profession for all the problems associated with claims is unfair, especially when the insurance companies refuse to settle in many cases and ignore the insured person in every case.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_61">The Motor Insurance Advisory Board exposed the motor insurance industry in its report. It found that in many cases the industry had higher profits than British insurance companies. I welcome the 67 recommendations of the report and I await their implementation by the insurance industry and by Government.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_62">I fear that the personal injuries assessment board, however, may turn out to be a flawed body. Legal costs play a part in the crippling cost of insurance but it must be noted that when the assessment board is set up there will be a right of appeal and a solicitor will know in advance what his client's claim is worth. If he feels he can obtain more by appealing to court he will do that. Solicitors' costs are high and it is important to remember that they must carry the case for the client, as no other business would do. In some cases they must wait years for the case to be heard and if there were not so many delays in the hearing of cases, costs could be substantially reduced.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_63">Exorbitant legal costs arise from the insurance companies themselves. They insist on defending cases in areas where it is obvious that the defendant is at fault, they hold up and manipulate the process and insist on customers not admitting liability at the outset. This bogs down the court system and increases legal costs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_64">I was amazed to see today that the only mechanism to find out about uninsured drivers is the gardaí. In the Garda report of 2000, it was stated that 11,000 people were prosecuted for having no insurance. We should establish a register of owners of vehicles and those qualified to drive, and check that register against those who are not insured on a regular basis so we can deal with uninsured drivers.</summary>
        <speech by="#NoelGrealishPD" eId="spk_601">
          <from>Mr. Grealish</from>
          <p eId="para_1317">The high cost of insurance is causing major economic and social problems and the impact on the business sector is clear. Most companies face substantial increases in premiums for employer and public liability insurance. This is a key cost for any company and firms cannot afford spiralling premiums.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318">Unless action is taken the economic consequences are clear. We will lose competitiveness as an exporting State and that reduced competitiveness will be reflected in reduced employment. The impact will be felt most heavily by the small  and medium enterprise sector. Jobs are already being lost and more are at risk. We must halt the rampant inflation in premiums and reduce them to a level in line with other European countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319">Motor insurance is a further problem. It is particularly difficult for younger drivers, many of whom find it impossible to get on to the road because of the prohibitive cost of the premiums they are quoted. It is not unknown to hear of cases where the annual premium is more than the value of the vehicle. This has a social consequence because it restricts the mobility of young people, particularly in rural areas where there is little public transport. In many parts of the State, the car is the prime means of transport for most people, it is not a luxury. There is also an economic consequence. Young people are energetic and enterprising and are willing to travel to find work. It is not unusual for people to drive 40 miles into Galway city every morning from surrounding villages to work. The car is the key to mobility for young people, and if they are forced out of the car market with exorbitant premiums they will be forced out of the job market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320">It is appreciated that there is a higher rate of accidents among younger drivers but that must also be the case in other countries. The higher incidence of accidents justifies a certain loading of premiums over and above what is charged to more mature drivers, but there is no justification for the premiums being quoted to younger drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321">The new Government faces many challenges but insurance costs must be a top priority. There is a clear commitment to deal with the issue set out in the joint programme for Government and I am pleased to see the urgency the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has brought to bear on the problem in the early months of the Administration. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board report provides a good blueprint for the way forward, setting out comprehensive recommendations, including the establishment of a personal injuries assessment board. I am glad the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is making the running by pushing ahead with this idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_1322">As with all major issues of public policy, change does not come easily. There are conservative forces to be overcome and vested interests to be addressed. I am confident, however, that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has the commitment and courage to resolve the problem and reduce the burden of excessive premiums.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanPower" eId="spk_602">
          <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
          <p eId="para_1323">It is appropriate that we are discussing the insurance industry. I have received more correspondence from small and large businesses and young and old people about this than about any other issue. Every sector is feeling the pain of the huge increases in premiums. The two major problems are the availability of quotes and their cost if you are lucky enough to get one. In a number of cases I have come across, people have  found it impossible to get a quote and in my own case I received a renewal notice for my car insurance a number of weeks ago which included a significant price hike. Fortunately I have a full no-claims bonus and when I rang to inquire about the hike I was told that all the company's customers had received a 40% increase in their premiums. I had no accident in nine years with this company yet it was prepared at the stroke of a pen to add 40% to my premium. I was fortunate to succeed in finding insurance at half the price elsewhere, but others have not been as lucky.</p>
          <p eId="para_1324">I know a gentleman who runs an unusual type of business and was made almost redundant as a result of the foot and mouth disease crisis of last year. He sought to cancel his insurance at that time and was told that if he did so he would not receive a quote from the company this year. He continued to pay, but when the time came this year the company refused to quote. That behaviour is not acceptable and we cannot look at EU law and say that we are restricted in what we do. It is important that we take action and refuse to allow companies to abuse their customers in that fashion. A young joiner I know who does wonderful work and employs a number of people cannot get insurance and in a few days he will have to let those people go. Many young people have expressed their concern about insurance and the way it is going and the system we have in place means that they are presumed guilty before they can prove their innocence. Huge premiums are sought from them and they often find that their insurance costs more than their car, which does not make sense. The Government is aware of the seriousness of the problem as is quite obvious from the programme for Government drawn up between the two parties which includes a number of measures to deal with it. The Minister has explained that her purpose is to bring about an improvement in the functioning of the insurance market and the system itself. God knows, it needs to change considerably.</p>
          <p eId="para_1325">Last April, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board published its report, a very thorough study of the industry. It made a number of recommendations on foot of which the Government set up the implementation group. I listened to the chairman of the group promising action within four months and while 67 recommendations and a plan are in place, as far as people are concerned action cannot happen quickly enough. People are losing their jobs and closing their businesses because they cannot get cover, which is simply not good enough. We in Ireland, or Europe for that matter, cannot be asked to pay the price for what happened in America and for poor investments. There are not that many insurance companies in the world and it is wrong that they should pick out a small market. It appears that Europeans are being asked to pay for the difficulties insurance companies are experiencing at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1326">I ask the Minister to treat this as the number one priority within her Department. It is a very  serious state of affairs and enough analysis has been done. We know where the problems are and action is required to ensure that insurance is available to everyone who seeks it at a competitive and realistic price.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_603">
          <from>Mr. O'Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_1327">I disagree with the contention of this motion that the Government has failed to tackle the crisis in the insurance industry. The motion seeks to divert attention from the real problem with our insurance culture by concentrating on what additional regulations and lengthy reports the Government should introduce to solve a problem which every Member and the public knows cannot be solved overnight. The motion seeks to have the Government introduce measures to reduce legal costs, a noble goal which would no doubt have popular support but would end up as an expensive show in the courts. With regard to the call to increase competition in the marketplace, everyone in the House knows that if there was a profit to be made, EU-based institutions would have long since lobbied for access to any part of the market barred to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328">Regarding the referral of the MIAB report to the appropriate Oireachtas committee, my first instinct was to support the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and her Department in getting on with its timetable of reform and its investigation into the industry. If there was a failure to respond in that regard, the Oireachtas committee would then be the most effective forum for examining why the industry failed to participate in solving what is a national issue. However, having reflected this evening I take the view that the report should be referred to the appropriate committee and I will be telling the Minister that I support that position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1329">Insurance costs are excessive. I am not so much a victim, though I have been aware of the cost of insurance from my car ownership. Only 132 days ago I was privileged to become a Member of this House and I am still in the learning process. I decided to open a full-time constituency office which would house my secretary, a part-time assistant and myself in the heart of Tallaght and I was amazed to be told that the insurance cost would be almost €1,200 a year. Some of my people tell me I am being hammered by the insurance companies. That brought home to me, as do the yearly car insurance renewal forms, the difficulties we all face. As with my colleagues, I attend many business events – in my case all over Dublin South-West – and I am constantly made aware by businessmen from large and small concerns of the impact of insurance costs on their enterprises. It is an issue in every constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1330">As a Deputy representing Dublin South-West, which embraces Firhouse, Greenhills, Templeogue and Tallaght, I have found that the main subject I speak to young people about is the cost of their car insurance. That was the case during the election campaign and it still is. As I go about my business in the constituency seeing people in  The Square and other places, this is the thing that people want to talk to me about. It is right to articulate their concerns in the House and represent their interests. In most cases the insurance cost equals the cost of the car which is needed to get people to work. The questions are always "why so much?" and "what are politicians doing about it?". When I explain in detail, as I always do, the measures being introduced by this Government there is a general understanding that the solutions will not come overnight and that in the medium term the cost and availability of insurance will improve.</p>
          <p eId="para_1331">The programme for Government commits the Administration to tackling this issue and the actions of the Minister in bringing forward measures quickly shows her personal commitment as well as that of the Government's to addressing the problems we face. The report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board is an example of this commitment and the urgency with which the Minister and the Government wish to implement its recommendations is underlined by the development of the personal injuries assessment board. I fully support the actions of the Minister and the Government in their work to date in tackling the cost and availability of insurance and I look forward to contributing to future debates on these matters.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnDennehy" eId="spk_604">
          <from>Mr. Dennehy</from>
          <p eId="para_1332">I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this issue. It must be a top priority to deal with insurance cover. Usually the motion and the amendment are in conflict, but there is much in common between the two on this occasion. We all recognise the huge impact this problem has on our families, the population and on every aspect of Irish life. We must do something about it. The problem has mushroomed in the past 12 months. We are being ripped off and there are many contributory factors. We must get our house in order. Local authorities, for example, must deal with matters such as road works, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333">We must also change the culture associated with the insurance business which revolves around cash. There is plenty of funding available for insurance purposes, whether it is for professional fees or work done. If car repairs or panel beating was required to be done 30 years ago as part of an insurance claim, it was treated differently from every other job. Such jobs were set aside as special income. It was treated in a cavalier fashion. The problem is that people seem to think insurance money comes from a hole in the ground or a golden trough. However, we all contribute to it. We must deal with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334">It is scandalous that the lower the risk, the higher the premiums being quoted. The Government's amendment refers to a decline of more than 13% in the number of fatalities and more than 40% in the number of serious injuries on the roads between 1997 and 2001. The rate of fatalities per thousand people at work in the construction industry fell from 15.07% to 7.77% between  1998 and 2001. There was a similar percentage decrease for accidents in the construction industry, despite the fact that the numbers employed increased from 126,000 to 180,000. It does not seem to matter how much we reduce the risk because the insurance companies continue to increase the premiums.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335">An article in <i>The Guardian</i> last week referred to mutual concerns and the fact that status is not a protection against the collapse of shares. It referred to mutual insurance companies and how they are getting into trouble. As Deputy O'Flynn said earlier, we cannot be expected to pay for that. Certain categories of people may be put out of business, such as scaffolders and roofers. There is an increasing number of professional people in the wrong job on any given day. Medical consultants, for example, are spending their time in court rather than in the operating theatre. Evidence can be taken in different ways. There is room for the introduction of a book of quantum and for a range of improvements. I am glad the Minister is dealing with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336">I am disappointed with the delay in publishing the report of the insurance group. I blame the insurance companies for that delay, although I do not know if it was deliberate. We must deal with that report. This is not only an issue for the Government or the Opposition. It affects everyone, including our constituents and families. I compliment the Minister on the work which has been done to date. I would like it to be speeded up if possible. We must go head to head with the insurance companies and take any necessary legislative action.</p>

        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_605">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_1337">The high cost of insurance is one of the most critically important social, economic and political issues of the past ten years. Whether one is trying to operate a business, put a car on the road or insure the contents of one's house, the high cost of insurance is prohibitive. It puts huge financial strain on individuals. In the same way our penal tax rates in the 1970s and 1980s fuelled the growth of the black economy, the high cost of insurance is a major contributory factor in the increasing number of non-insured activities. This is a cost spiral which in the past 12 months is having a major negative effect on growth in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338">What are small foothills in many other countries seem to be insurmountable peaks in Ireland. People are now asking if they can afford to put a car on the road or if they will bother claiming for a small accident. They are also asking if they can afford to insure their staff and customers. Unfortunately, the answer to all those questions is no for many people. Insurance costs are so high that for many reasonable people they represent extortion, a rack rent or a hold up without a gun.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339">Insurance costs are one of the single biggest factors that could prohibit the growth of Irish industry, particularly small industry which is already under pressure. Many reasons have been  advanced by the industry as contributors to the current insurance problem. The 40% claim increases to which Deputies referred are not unusual. In Ireland the difficulties are manifested by poor investment returns. Many insurance companies invest their turnover in equities, but we are experiencing a five year low. There are also substantial increases in reinsurance costs and reduced capacity in the global reinsurance market. Other contributory factors are the high level of claims and awards, legal costs and the method for determining them along with the failure to prosecute fraudulent claimants. The problem is most acutely felt by drivers and by small and medium sized companies who cannot afford the almost penal levels of public liability insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340">An Agreed Programme for Government, agreed between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil, gives a clear commitment to tackle the high cost of motor, personal and employer liability insurance. These commitments make up an operational insurance reform programme which will be implemented across a number of different Departments. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which reported earlier this year, was a major step forward in recognising all the elements of the problem. That the report contains 67 recommendations highlights the depth of the problem. I welcome that the Government implementation group is drawing up an action plan to tackle the issues which will go to Government in the near future. I also welcome the stated objective of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board which is to make available alternative adversarial legislation where the liability is not disputed, but an independent assessment of compensation is required. The implementation of this group will also be considered by Government in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341">The lack of a competitive environment in the insurance market is also a contributory factor to the high cost of insurance. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, has commenced consultation for a study of competition in the provision of non-life insurance, specifically focusing on motor, employer's liability and public liability insurance in the market. Such a protracted problem needs major political will and determination to solve it. I commend the vision and political will of the Minister in pursuing this issue.</p>

          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_1350">I wish to share my time with Deputies Upton and Lynch.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351">Perhaps the greatest problem facing our economy is the appalling and devastating impact of insurance costs on all our lives, whether as individuals, communities or business people. Since the general election, every Member has been inundated with e-mails, letters and visits from the owners of small businesses pleading desperately for action to be taken in response to the appalling insurance quotes they have been receiving.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352">In recent days in my constituency, a one-man business seeking public liability insurance, a window cleaner, discovered that his quote had jumped by 100% for the forthcoming year, while the employer's liability insurance of another small company, a window replacement firm, jumped from about €8,000 last year to €28,000 for the coming year. These type of rises in premia are typical.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353">People have also tried to come to grips with the problem on an individual level. While I could quote from many of the messages I have received, I will confine myself to one sent by a constituent yesterday evening in which she states:</p>
          <p eId="para_1354">I write in connection with my insurance premium. Last year I paid approximately £900 for myself, my husband, and two of my children, one female aged 23 and one male aged 21. Both had full clean licences with no previous claims or endorsements of any kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355">This year despite having no claims during the year I have been quoted €2100, an increase of approximately 80%. When I inquired about this, I was told it was because of the age of my children. Yet I had no difficulty adding them to my insurance last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356">She goes on to relate how perplexed and irate she is about the matter. Her letter is typical of what has been happening throughout society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1357">Many politicians are members of community forums – I am the director of several community companies – which have also faced year on year rises of 100% in public liability insurance. The reason for this is that sometimes our legal representatives and insurance brokers are simply not willing to contest a claim, such is the climate engendered in society regarding claims. For community bodies, this means having to invest hard  work as volunteers to raise the money required. We do not even have the cashflow available to ordinary business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1358">In recent days the joint managerial body of our secondary schools has also complained bitterly about the devastating increases in schools' costs caused by rises in public liability insurance. JMB general secretary, George O'Callaghan, informed me that these increases are between 25% and 60%. The only option open to school administrators is to turn to the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Finance and request some redress.</p>
          <p eId="para_1359">We have arrived at an appalling position, the impact of which has been devastating on the entire economy. In recent months, many businesses have told me their only option will be to try to claw back some of their insurance costs against their tax bill. This is one recourse to which shell-shocked small businesses will resort this year in order to get by. As indicated by the proceedings this afternoon, Members are concerned about falling tax revenues. Corporation tax, for example, is due to decrease again. The small business group, ISME, has calculated that 96% of small businesses have had rises in public liability and employer's insurance this year, averaging 71%. These increases have led to a fall of about 20% in their overall workforce. The Tánaiste reported to the House on this survey a few weeks ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_1360">In terms of tax revenue, falling employment and the general rise in costs to society, recent developments have been a total disgrace. The leader of the party to which the Minister of State belongs has had a very central role in this process, having been Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for more than five years. Throughout the last Dáil she left the responsibility for the critical area of commerce in the very unsafe hands of a very affable Deputy who was, however, a highly incompetent Minister of State, namely, Deputy Noel Treacy. For five years he kow-towed to vested interests in the insurance industry and the legal profession and refused to take action. He even managed to lose the first interim report of the MIAB. The report was later put on the back-burner and he pretended its central findings were ludicrous and did not add up. For five and a half years we listened to the mantra that progress would be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361">As the end of the rainbow Government approached, Deputy Rabbitte, who was Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, pursued the issue of insurance and was in the process of establishing an implementation body to implement the findings of the personal injuries assessment board. These plans date back to April 1997, yet here we are nearly six years later and the findings of the board have still not been implemented. Moreover, the Tánaiste is still talking about establishing the board on an interim basis. There is a real case for calling for her resignation, such has been her lethargy in the past five  years in not pursuing this key element of our costs. Nothing has been done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362">Every time I contact the Tánaiste about businesses in my constituency, as I have done endlessly in the past two or three years, she sends me the same letter which, I am sure, other Deputies also receive. I can nearly recite its contents by heart. She first lists the reasons for the difficulties in the insurance sector, namely, the level of claims, the increasing level of awards, poor investment returns to insurance companies and so on, all of which we have heard before. After this, she always states that:</p>
          <p eId="para_1363">The pricing and underwriting of insurance is, however, a matter for individual insurance companies. EU law prevents us from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks insurance companies are prepared to underwrite.</p>
          <p eId="para_1364">Her statement is utter hogwash and nonsense and the Minister of State, who is an accountant, knows it. We do have the powers to set in train very significant measures to tackle high insurance costs. My colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, when he was party spokesperson on this issue, made one simple suggestion to the Tánaiste which she never took up. Noting that the MIAB report showed that young drivers, contrary to what we had previously believed, were being ripped off by as much as 1000% and that insurance companies here were making 11 times more profit from this group than were their British counterparts, he proposed asking Mr. Niall Crowley and the Equality Authority to begin a statutory inquiry into the matter, as it is entitled to do. Such an investigation could call for papers and documents to be produced to look into the insurance industry and the way in which it discriminates against young men and women and older drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1365">That simple proposal could be accepted tonight by the leader of the Minister of State's party. Year after year, however, she has refused outright to do so. Why? Could it be that the vested interests in the legal profession and the insurance industry exercise a major influence on the Progressive Democrats Party and the Fianna Fáil Party, to the extent that both are afraid to take on these vested interests who are crucifying our people, businesses, schools and communities? They have left us in a desperate crisis. For this reason alone the Government should not have been returned. Its re-election was an outrage given its dramatic failure in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1366">I ask that my colleagues address some of the other problems arising in the area of insurance. It is now time for action. We have had the so-called action plan launched with great fanfare by the Minister a few weeks ago. At the time I called it a damp squib and Deputy Hogan described it in similar terms. What has been achieved? What has been done? It is vital that the Minister finally starts to take the issue seriously. She talked a great deal about referring it to Dr. Fingleton and the Competition Authority. Why was such a plan  not implemented three or four years ago? Why are we still waiting for the Minister, Deputy Harney, to take action on possibly the most important area of her portfolio? Her plan is belated. This plan should have been implemented years ago, as it will not have sufficient impact when it is finally implemented. We need an urgent plan of action.</p>
          <p eId="para_1367">I commend the Irish Insurance Federation on suggestions it made, particularly regarding fraud, requiring a sworn affidavit and an RSI number on every claim and addressing the outrageous legal fees we permit. We cannot allow the insurance industry to continue to operate as it has been. If a Deputy on this side of the House had been responsible for the management of the insurance industry, as the Minister has, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats would be calling for that person's resignation. It is past time that the Minister took action.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_615">
          <from>Dr. Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_1368">I welcome the opportunity to support this motion. The cost of insurance is virtually at crisis level, this issue is raised with me like Deputy Broughan on a daily basis. I have had to set aside box files to take account of the number of letters I receive on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1369">I want to address the area of motor insurance. It has been widely debated inside and outside this House to the extent that, in the general election, a number of constituencies put up insurance candidates specifically to deal with the issue of car insurance. Unfortunately, the position has not improved. It is a crisis for young drivers who are unlikely to get a quotation or, if they do, they will not be able to afford the exorbitant premium quoted. Many young people are dependent on having a car to earn their livelihood, not to mention the minor detail of having some kind of social life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1370">The victims of exorbitant insurance costs are the most vulnerable. They have been sidelined in all the discussions on processing the accessing of insurance. Car insurance for young drivers increased at the rate of about 80% in the past year. Many young people cannot avail of public transport. A number of rural Deputies mentioned the problems facing young drivers in rural areas. This is also true to a great extent in the Dublin area. I know of many young people who would be happy to avail of public transport in Dublin South-Central, but it is not at all adequate. Therefore, they have no choice but to pay exorbitant insurance costs. We need to address the issue of public transport as a backup to addressing this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1371">I wish to address the problems regarding penalty points and the introduction of a substantial response to that issue. At long last we have a commitment from the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, to address this issue, but until we have a substantial road safety policy in place we will continue to have unsafe driving practices on our roads. A consequence of that will be more accidents and a consequence of that, in turn, will  be increased insurance costs. Many bright ideas have been mooted about road safety practices, but they have not been implemented. We need to stop talking about this matter and get down to introducing legislation and doing what needs to be done to change the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1372">The high cost of car insurance is not only due to poor driving habits, the lack of significant competition in the insurance business has been highlighted in the MIAB report. That must be tackled as a matter of urgency. Insurance companies appear to be able to make the story up as they go along in terms of the premiums they decide to charge. Unless there is significant competition in the industry that practice will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1373">Small businesses and industries have taken a major hit due to the high cost of insurance. Like many Deputies who raised this point, I too have received a large number of letters and representations from many people in small industries who have suffered significantly from being unable to get insurance or from the exorbitant cost of insurance. As an alternative to paying these exorbitant charges, some of these people highlighted that some companies are reverting to the unfortunate practice of dispensing with insurance. They are operating on a wing and a prayer and hoping nobody will have reason to take a claim against them. This practice is unacceptable, but one can understand why people are driven to do that. Others are in the unfortunate position of having to let employees go, another practice which is unacceptable in terms of the development of the economy apart from anything else.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374">Another group mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Broughan, was the voluntary and community sector. Those people provide a valuable service at personal inconvenience. They have to raise funds to pay their insurance costs. These will be the first people to drop off the end of the list because they cannot afford to raise the price of insurance charges. As a consequence of that the most vulnerable will suffer, as this sector will not be able to provide such valuable support and facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1375">The Minister stated last night that we have had an excellent analysis of the reasons for our high insurance costs and the focus must now be on action. I could not agree more with her on both counts, but the action must be sooner rather than later. Action needs to be taken in a way that restores trust in the insurance business, that young responsible drivers will not be discriminated against, that affordable insurance becomes the norm rather than the exception, that small industries remain viable and that voluntary organisations can continue to provide a valuable service to the community. I would like a timeframe set for those targets and to know when we can expect delivery in respect of them.</p>

        <speech by="#KathleenLynch" eId="spk_616">
          <from>Ms Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_1376">I thank the Deputies for sharing their time with me. A meeting was called in Cork in September at which the CIF and the trade  union representatives for the construction industry got together and asked the Deputies representing the area to meet them. Deputies might ask what was unusual about that, but that was quite unusual. The CIF and the trade union movement are seldom on the one platform, but in this instance they were and they had their facts and their figures. They were concerned about insurance costs. A difficulty that has arisen in Cork and elsewhere throughout the country is that approximately 12 small construction firms have gone out of business because they could not obtain a quote or, if they did, they could not pay the premium quoted. Approximately 100 small construction firms are under threat of closure because they cannot obtain insurance. We all know the construction industry is dangerous, by its nature it is hazardous, but it has taken tremendous steps to clean up its act and try to ensure it is less hazardous for those who work in it. However, that does not appear to matter. Certain firms who have never had a claim brought against them have gone out of business because they could not afford insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1377">A Government Deputy said that high insurance costs are all our responsibility. The issue of insurance, how we claim, how it is dealt with, the courts, the costs and the medical expenses is multifaceted. We all know there is no single solution to this problem, but it is Government's job to solve it. It is not our job or the job of the people who cannot get insurance to solve it. They know what the solution is, the effect high insurance costs have on their industries, but they know that only the Government can solve the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1378">As Deputy Broughan outlined, the Minister said that because of European law we are hamstrung and cannot take action to resolve this problem, but that is not true. We have been awaiting a report on this issue for five years. As Deputy Broughan said, when it was published, it was lost. It was put on the slow burner and did not go to Cabinet. It was not available, but suddenly half way through the general election campaign the report appeared, as if manna from heaven. Every door to which I called during the general election if not opened by a driver was opened by a mother, father or wife and they wanted to know why young people could not get insurance. One would imagine we were living in a Utopia where there was public transport by which one could set one's watch, but we all know that is not true. Cars are no longer a luxury, but a necessity. As long as the Government refuses to invest in public transport they will remain a necessity. I know a man who passed his driving test at 19, has a clean driving licence and has never made an insurance claim. He is now 29 and is still on his father's insurance as he cannot get insurance of his own. A man who should be independently living in the community cannot get insurance to drive his own car. If the Government does not tackle all the facets that have contributed to companies closing and to young men tak ing risks on the road without insurance, then it does not deserve to stay in power.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_1379">I wish to share time with Deputies Connaughton, English, Paul McGrath and Ring. I congratulate Deputy Hogan for putting this important issue on the agenda. While canvassing in Carrickmacross on Tuesday morning I met a woman whose son was quoted €6,500 for motor insurance. She told me she would not be able to vote because her son needs her car to get to his job. Deputy Power and others on the Government benches made it very clear that they are as frustrated as we are. For the sake of young people I hope they have the wit not to split this House on a vote but to agree to take action. We want action, not political stunts that pretend this is not a real problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1380">Deputy Noel Treacy was the Minister of State in charge of this for the last five years. He oversaw the production of a report which was four and a half years in the making. I agree with everybody that it is an excellent report but it is untenable to ask young people or business people to wait four and a half years to get insurance. I welcome the Tánaiste taking responsibility for this in the Administration. For all our sakes, I hope the final comment of Deputy Parlon does not turn out to be a damp squib, though I am afraid that may be the case. I hope she takes action and does not simply convene another committee or commission another report. The ISME clearly stated that insurance costs are a serious problem and are going to put many small industries out of business. Taxi drivers, builders and community groups are all affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1381">Listening to some Ministers one would think this is a new Government. This Government has been in power for the past five years. The Minister held a fancy press conference some time ago. We do not want fancy press conferences, we need action. The action required has been clearly spelled out in this motion. The motion calls for the immediate implementation of the outstanding recommendations of the MIAB report and for it to be referred to the Oireachtas committee to carry out investigations into it including the taking of submissions from interested parties. It further calls for the introduction of measures to facilitate greater competition in the insurance market and measures which will bring a reduction in legal costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1382">Each Member knows of a number of cases where insurance companies have either refused to insure or raised premiums to such a level as to make them unviable. Small firms are being forced out of business. I know of a company which took over another company only to be told by their insurers that insurance was not available. This is a crisis which must be handled immediately, with no more reports or press conferences. There must be action to curtail legal costs and allow competition to develop which will allow people to insure their cars, homes and businesses.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_618">
          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_1383">I congratulate Deputy Hogan for tabling this very important motion. Thousands of people feel helpless, annoyed, disgusted and irritated that what was once perceived to be normal insurance cover at an affordable price seems to be gone forever. Insurance has now gone beyond the reach of individuals, firms, community groups and a host of other parties. The country is teeming with instances where insurance is either not available or is so financially prohibitive that small firms are reducing their workforces to stay in business. Many firms are under-insured, which is the worst problem of all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1384">Fraudulent claims are a source of great irritation. Many business people are fed up to the back teeth with it but nobody seems to want to do anything about it. Irrespective of who is to blame or where liability lies, it appears that for relatively small claims insurance companies will collapse like a paper bag and accept them. They do so because they do not want to incur large legal costs. That might be all right on the day, but the insurance companies themselves have created a compensation culture. Bogus claims are spreading like wildfire across the country. People that cheat in this way are no better than drug pushers. There should be a very severe jail sentence for people who make bogus claims. Like all other Members, I can reel off countless incidents of increases in insurance premia from 50% to 500%.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_619">
          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_1385">Deputy Crawford spoke about a crisis. Spiralling insurance costs is more than a crisis – it is a stick of dynamite that is going to cause the economy to blow up in our faces if we do not do something about it shortly. I know of a scaffolding company in Navan that had an insurance premium of €20,000 last year and cannot get a quote this year. They are willing to pay €100,000 but they cannot even get insured for that. I know of another builder whose insurance was €25,000 last year and €75,000 this year. In some cases motor insurance has gone up from €3,500 last year to €5,000 this year. I know a man whose garage caught fire last year who cannot get a quote for insurance this year because he is considered a high risk. It seems to me that if one's garage was burned once the chances of it catching fire again are slimmer. Taxi drivers are also being put out of business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1386">We have to investigate if taxis and other high-risk trades such as carpenters, builders and other craftsmen are suffering from unnecessary profiteering or are being deliberately priced out of the market. High insurance costs do not provide an incentive for people to make a blind leap of faith in starting their own business or expanding their existing one. Small businesses have already started to fold and more will follow if the Government does not act decisively. Business closures will lead to job losses and there will be a resultant drain on social welfare. This will also lead to decreases in PAYE and corporation taxes. Everyone wants and needs a job and is entitled to one as it provides dignity and self esteem. The  loss of jobs is bad for families, communities and ultimately the public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1387">The crisis in the motor insurance industry is certainly not new – it is nearly as old as I am. When I was 18 and taking out insurance for the first time, I was informed that the cost would be high but that it would decrease when I reached the age of 20. Having paid a few thousand pounds for insurance in the intervening years, I was looking forward to a reduction on my 20th birthday but I was charged £2,500 and told that it would decrease when I reached the age of 23. However, I am now paying over €3,000 and I have been told it will decrease by the time I reach 30. At the rate it is increasing, I am not looking forward to turning 30.</p>
          <p eId="para_1388">This crisis did not develop overnight and I am tired of being told that the events of 11 September 2001 is the reason for it. That is a disgrace and it is shameful for any insurance company to use 11 September as an excuse. How did the crisis first come about? The Government should hang its head in shame over the revelation from the Motor Insurance Advisory Board that legal fees represent 42% of premia as compared to the EU average of 10%. The figure is as low as 2% in Sweden. With apologies to Deputy Enright, the legal eagles are getting far too much money. When one considers the figures, it is easy to see who the Government really represents. These figures were never a State secret. Despite representations from the Motor Insurance Justice Action Group, from me and many others on this issue, the Government has chosen to ignore it. As a 24 year old I resent this because it is not good enough. It is my, and every other young person's, right to drive a car. We need a courageous Government to wield the axe and cut through the cartel operated by the legal profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_1389">I am not optimistic for the future. The previous Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition was the longest serving Government since the Second World War. However, I would label their term of office an era of missed opportunities with regard to insurance. A car is an absolute essential in this new age of commuting because people sometimes have to travel very long distances to work. More importantly, cars are the lifeblood of small rural communities in my native Meath and many other counties throughout Ireland. For many elderly people, those who live in isolated areas and farming families, they provide the only means of contact with the wider world. Bearing this in mind, it is, therefore, wholly unnatural that any Government should knowingly preside over five years of increases in car insurance. What the hell is the Government thinking about?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulMcGrath" eId="spk_620">
          <from>Mr. P. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1390">I commend Deputy Hogan on bringing forward this motion and I hope at the end of the debate the Government will have something constructive to offer. The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, will address the  House shortly and I hope he will outline the initiatives the Government is going to take in respect of insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1391">There is a major problem in the area of insurance and this was one of the major points of interest in the general election campaign when one was talking to individuals, particularly young people, who are experiencing difficulties obtaining car insurance. Young people need cars to travel to work because they need to be mobile to take advantage of the employment opportunities on offer. These individuals need transport but the insurance costs they are expected to bear are enormous.</p>
          <p eId="para_1392">Household insurance has risen by approximately 35% in the past year. The insurance on my small constituency office in Mullingar rose by 39% this year. That is a large outlay on a property in respect of which I have only made one claim – it amounted to £700 – when a window was broken by late night revellers or, perhaps, disgruntled constituents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1393">Insurance costs have risen across the board. Small community groups and GAA clubs are experiencing enormous difficulties in insuring their premises. A previous speaker referred to the problems encountered by taxi drivers. I met a taxi driver who had previously paid £3,000 for insurance and who was involved in an accident which was no fault of his own. His insurance premium was immediately increased to £10,000 and he had to get out of the taxi business as a result. That is not satisfactory.</p>
          <p eId="para_1394">Deputy Hogan outlined some of the difficulties experienced by the business sector. I am familiar with a thriving business in my home town which paid £45,000 in insurance costs three years ago. These rose to £87,000 the following year and last year they increased to £145,000. This meant that the company had to increase its turnover in a three year period by almost £1 million if it was to meet its insurance costs. That is completely unacceptable. The net outcome will be that the company will have to lay people off, which is not satisfactory. It has a claim pending at present, but, as the managing director stated, people pay insurance costs to meet claims they may have to make and if the company has to pay for the claim itself in the form of a hugely increased premium, then it might as well not have insurance. It is difficult to argue with his assertion. One pays insurance so that when the rainy day arrives one is covered, and it is not right that there should be an enormous hike in insurance costs when a claim is made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1395">The Minister announced recently that she will take action. However, the time for announcements has passed. What we need now from the Government is action. It has been in office long enough and it is time something was done.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_621">
          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_1396">I compliment Deputy Hogan on bringing this motion before the House. I am glad he did so because this matter is a topic of conversation throughout the country. The two greatest  difficulties businesses and young people face at present are public liability and high insurance costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1397">I receive telephone calls from parents who live in rural areas about this matter on a daily basis. When their children turn 18, 19, 20 or 21, parents believe that they should be able to look after themselves. People in rural areas need cars to travel to work or Mass or to bring their children to school because they do not have access to the DART or the public transport system available in our cities. It is outrageous that people who purchase cars for €3,000 or €4,000 are obliged to pay €6,000 or €7,000 to insure them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1398">Governments must govern when the time comes to do so. This Administration has been in power for a long period but it has failed to deal with this problem. Legislation should be introduced, if necessary, to oblige every insurance company to take a quota of young people on to its books. If any of these young people were involved in accidents and made claims, they could be made remain with the company for 20 years and not allowed to seek quotes from other companies. What is happening at present is wrong because we are penalising young people before they start out in adult life. We should encourage and help young people by giving them opportunities. The individuals who do not avail of those opportunities should be penalised and should be obliged to pay high insurance costs if they are involved in accidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1399">The cost of public liability insurance is outrageous. A man who serves on the local council with me was not even given a quote by the company he had been with for ten or 12 years. He had never made a claim but he suddenly received a letter from the company which stated that it was not even going to provide him with a quote. Legislation should be introduced to protect that man who paid his dues and never made a claim because when he needed cover, he was almost put out of business. That should not be allowed to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1400">We have returned to the bad old days. The Government recently promised that the Irish soccer team's match this evening would be broadcast on terrestrial television, but what has happened? I am sure the Taoiseach and his Ministers are in the best seats in Lansdowne Road, but the poor people of Ireland, despite the Government's claim that it would resolve matters, are missing out on the opportunity to watch the match because RTE has been prevented from covering it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1401">Members may ask what this has to do with insurance. We were promised that difficulties with insurance would be dealt with but that promise has been broken. We were also promised that tonight's football match would be shown on terrestrial television, and that is another broken promise. The Government informed us that the then Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, would deal with the matter which is the subject of this motion, but that promise was also broken. We  were also informed that there would be no increase in third level fees, another broken promise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1402">How can we believe that the Government will deal with the most serious problem this country faces? What will I say to the woman who phones me tomorrow and asks how she can obtain insurance for her son who works in a rural area and needs his car, which is the only vehicle the family owns? All I will be able to tell her is that the Government has promised to do something and she will ask how we can believe an Administration that breaks promises every hour on the hour.</p>
          <p eId="para_1403">I hope the Minister of State is in a position to give us some positive news. I also hope he will inform the House that he will deal with the insurance companies and that he will bring forward the necessary legislation in order that Deputy Hogan will not be obliged to table another motion of this nature. I further hope that companies will be able to remain in business, that insurance will be controlled by the State and that insurance companies will no longer be in a position to control the people, which is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1404">The Minister has to do something. If there were good news tonight, Deputy Harney would be here. When there is good news about jobs, she is in Longford, Cork and all over the country. Even when the report was published the Tánaiste was on television with the advisory board and, of course, our great friend RTE had as its main news headline that something would be done. What has been done? Nothing, and nothing will be done until there is a new Government and Deputy Hogan, as Minister, is on the Government benches dealing with this serious problem.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1408">I thank Deputies for their contributions to what has been a constructive debate. It highlighted, if that was necessary, the high cost of insurance, which has major implications not only for business but also for community and sports bodies, local authorities, motorists, householders and many other sectors of society. This has led to the establishment of single issue groups to campaign on the issue of insurance cost increases, such as the Business Insurance Alliance, the Alliance for Insurance Reform and the Motor Insurance Justice Action Group.</p>
          <p eId="para_1409">There is a high level of agreement on the reasons for the increase in insurance costs. There  is a general acceptance of the analysis, conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. We have a societal problem which will have to be addressed by society. This includes insurance policy holders, insurance undertakings, the courts, solicitors, barristers, other professions, a number of Departments and, possibly, the Oireachtas. For policyholders there is a clear need to reduce the level of accidents and to improve our safety record. The Government will continue its efforts to reduce the level of accidents on the roads, at work and during non-work activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1410">We intend to pursue vigorously a concerted programme of action to reduce insurance costs. The central planks of this programme will be the action plan prepared for implementing the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board and the establishment of the PIAB interim board. The action plan identifies who should undertake the specified tasks and incorporates a timeframe for implementation, together with the insurance industry's estimate of the potential impact of implementation on claims and premia. The PIAB interim board will enter constructive discussions with interested parties to further the objective of a fair and efficient compensation system for the victims of accidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1411">I wish to respond to a number of matters raised during this debate. There has been rationalisation in the Irish insurance industry. This has resulted essentially from mergers and takeovers taking place in other EU member states where the competent authority to clear the takeover or merger is the European Commission. It is an area in which we will become more active in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1412">A major concern is the failure of insurance undertakings with head offices in other member states to sell business into Ireland. Discovering and analysing the reasons for this is one of the main attractions for the Department in the study of the competitive situation in the Irish insurance industry. We can speculate on the reasons or reservations insurers may have about entering an unfamiliar market, especially such a small one, the common law system and the apparent high insurance claims cost but we need hard information. The reason for undertaking the study is also influenced by the economic importance of the sector, indicators of the level of competition in the sector and the extent of public interest in the sector. A preliminary consultation document has been launched to invite submissions before the terms of reference for the study are finalised. Interested parties should make submissions to the Competition Authority before 1 November next.</p>
          <p eId="para_1413">Under EU law, the pricing and underwriting of insurance are matters for individual insurance companies. EU law prevents governments from intervening in relation to premium levels or the risks that insurers are prepared to underwrite. The new independent financial services authority will have a major role to play in increasing the  confidence consumers have when dealing with financial undertakings. IFSRA will have effective mechanisms to balance the concerns of consumers with the requirements of effective solvency supervision. The Bill which establishes IFSRA is on Committee Stage and is scheduled to have completed all Stages by the end of the year. It is planned to have IFSRA in business early in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1414">I have taken note of the other points made by Deputies. We have a significant societal problem. The Government is committed to taking action under a number of headings to address it, including continuing to improve our safety legislation, greater implementation of existing legislation, reforms in the legal system and reforms in the interaction between the customer of insurance undertakings and the undertakings themselves. These measures will have an impact on insurance claims and awards. We will look to the insurance undertakings to respond through a reduction of premium levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1415">The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, reactivated the MIAB when he returned to office. The board's report has been referred to the Equality Authority. For the first time the MIAB has used raw data from the insurance companies. That data was not available prior to its investigation—</p>

          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_1420">I congratulate Deputy Hogan for bringing forward this important motion. Members who campaigned during the election got a wake up call about insurance and how concerned people are about it. The general public, especially business and young people, are concerned about the increases in insurance costs. Members who are involved in local government are aware of the level of claims and the insurance costs for local government, which impinges on the provision of local services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1421">It is often suggested that 20% of claims are spurious. I believe that is an underestimation. People no longer take responsibility for their safety. They no longer accept blame when they have an accident or are irresponsible. Their first response is to consider making a claim. They try to place blame elsewhere. We should try to return to a system where people accept responsibility for their actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1422">Ireland is one of the most litigious countries in Europe. The compensation culture is like a cancer eating into society. At this stage it borders on  the immoral. The State and the Government must move quickly to halt the slippery slide towards a situation where all commercial services and industry will grind to a halt. We are less competitive in industry and commerce than our partners in Europe because of the level of compensation and the consequential increase in the cost of premia. IBEC has calculated that if Ireland had the same level of insurance payments in the area of employers' liability as in other countries, over a four year period 10,000 jobs would be created due to the improved level of efficiency. We are uncompetitive in many areas, especially manufacturing, where we are in competition with our European partners because of the level of claims made against employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1423">Young people cannot obtain motor insurance. Why must their insurance premia be so high? They are many times higher than in the UK or elsewhere in the EU because compensation payments are far higher. There is a practice whereby insurance companies reach agreement on settlements at the steps of the court. They do so because claimants will settle for less rather than appear in court, and it has been proven statistically that this is so. However, it creates a situation where people who make spurious claims do not even have to take the stand to give their side of the story. Agreement is reached at the door of the courthouse and they go away laughing. The system acts against the best interests of genuine claimants who may have to wait many years for a resolution of their claims, with consequential distress arising from uncertainty over the level of compensation. This discourages rehabilitation and a return to work. If someone has a claim against his or her employer, he or she is advised to delay returning to work until the claim has been settled. The courts are clogged with such claims and claimants who are fit to work are advised not to do so, which is not in the interests of the claimant, the employer, industry or the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1424">Insurance costs are creating complications for employers, businesses, motorists, public authorities and voluntary and sporting organisations. For example, school teachers can no longer send anyone out on an errand and playgrounds are also in difficulties due to rising insurance costs. The sooner the Government takes action on this matter the better.</p>

        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_631">
          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_1425">The issue of insurance costs was a major problem for the last Government and it remains so today. I wonder if the Government intends to deal with this matter which affects every sector of society? A small factory in my constituency, employing a staff of 22, contacted me recently because its insurance premium rose by 230%. The company was not notified of the increase until two weeks after the policy's renewal date and, thus, had no opportunity to seek alternative quotations for cover. The factory was faced with a stark choice and the insurance company stated, "Why don't you let two people  go in order to pay for your insurance this year?"  That would have meant that two employees would lose their jobs to maintain corporate insurance cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_1426">This year, the average business has been hit by insurance premium increases in the region of 60%. I am aware of the case of another company with seven employees. From 1999 to 2001 its insurance costs doubled, so we cannot say that this situation has come about suddenly as a result of the events of 11 September 2001. Insurance costs have been rising since long before then. This year, however, the company's premium rose by 150%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1427">Another sector that has been particularly badly hit by this problem are the self-employed, including painters and decorators, and builders. I know of one painter who has been in business for 18 years and never made an insurance claim. Yet, he was refused a renewal of his public liability insurance this year and, as a result, has lost a significant State contract. The man has effectively gone out of business. He has returned to painting private houses on his own and is no longer able to employ people, as before.</p>
          <p eId="para_1428">This situation has a knock-on effect because home owners cannot risk engaging someone to undertake painting, decorating or building work if they do not have public liability cover for accidents. The owners of premises risk having their existing insurance nullified if they allow someone who is uninsured to work there. If people cannot engage builders and others to work on their houses, there will be an overall slowdown in this area of endeavour.</p>
          <p eId="para_1429">My generation had been hit hard by the rise in motor insurance costs, which have risen by 40% to 50%. Last year, one young man had to pay £4,017 to insure his Nissan Micra car. He needed the vehicle to travel 20 miles to work because he lives in an area which is not served by public transport. Essentially, he was working to pay for his motor insurance, not to mention his car.</p>
          <p eId="para_1430">Local authorities have also had to face the problem of insuring children's playgrounds and, as a result, in my county there are no such playgrounds. Even if funding was available from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which there is not, councils could still not provide playgrounds due to the prohibitive insurance costs. As we have heard, some major tourist attractions are in danger of closing down. They include Birr Castle Demesne, in my constituency, and Westport House in County Mayo. Both businesses faced serious problems this year and when they eventually obtained insurance cover they had to pay massive increases. This makes the operation of such tourist enterprises extremely difficult. They will have to examine their figures to see whether they can survive next year in light of spiralling insurance costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1431">While premiums are increasing significantly, there is a reduction in what insurance companies are prepared to cover. The Government must  examine the reasons for this phenomenon. Every year people are complaining that less and less is being included in the items covered by insurance policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1432">Insurance companies should be compelled to notify people of premium renewals and the precise costs involved, well in advance of the renewal date, which is not the case at present.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_632">
          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_1433">I thank Members who have contributed to this debate and I am grateful for the support of the Labour Party, the Technical Group and the Independent Deputies who have endorsed the Fine Gael motion. It is strange that, in one way or other, most of those on the Government side also supported our motion. They realise the importance of this issue and the difficulties it is causing for businesses, young people and communities generally. The Minister should agree to this motion because there is very little that separates us on the issue. We should proceed in a united way in the Oireachtas to deal with this urgent matter that is affecting the lives of most people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1434">Yesterday, I set out a number of details concerning the massive increases in insurance that have occurred across the board, from motor vehicle cover to employers' liability and community groups' insurance. The case has been made cogently and the details were tabulated last April in the report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which was three and a half years in gestation. Notwithstanding the difficulties in obtaining much of the information in the report, we have seen no action since then. There has been, however, a desperate attempt to introduce a 15-day notice rule for the renewal of premia, which had to be renegotiated during August. Much more concerted and co-ordinated action is required by the Government to implement this plan. The insurance issue is urgent and must be treated seriously by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1435">I was disappointed by the response of the Minister yesterday that she has had to establish yet another study of competition issues. We have received many representations and complaints from interested parties over the years and we have had long enough to react to this problem. When insurance companies were merging we had opportunities to foresee that these developments would have an effect on insurance premiums and that competition issues would arise. Regrettably, however, the Minister and her Department have not seen fit to carry out a detailed study on the competition implications of these decisions at the same time as the Motor Insurance Advisory Board was preparing its report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1436">If only four or five insurance companies are dealing with the motor vehicle market, there will be a temptation for such firms to come together unofficially to have the same premia structure. That happens in other walks of life, including the meat industry about which we often hear complaints. It is difficult to prove such things but,  nevertheless, when there is only a small number of players in the market there will be a private monopoly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_633">
          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_1437">That is correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_634">
          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_1438">That is not in the public interest. As long as the Minister prevaricates on this issue through consultation and establishing studies, Fine Gael will campaign for action on the implementation of the relevant recommendations in the MIAB's report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1439">I am worried about another aspect of the Minister's speech. She stated that even though she was in favour of the establishment of a personal injuries advisory board, this would have to be done in co-ordination with court reform. I have been a Member of the House long enough to realise that reform of the courts is a difficult issue, involving the Judiciary, the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society. Such reform will not occur rapidly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1440">Therefore, I would be interested to know how the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will move forward this important development – the setting up of this PIAB – at the same time as court reform, and how long it will take. I would be disappointed if the Minister was engaging in a two-hand reel with her colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and slowing down the process in the interests of certain professions which, ultimately, would be against the interests of the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1441">I am delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has arrived in the House. He knows that everything I said about the difficulties which have emerged over the past number of years in dealing with this issue is true, but, unfortunately, he did nothing about it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelTracey" eId="spk_635">
          <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
          <p eId="para_1442">That is not true.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_636">
          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_1443">Just before the election the then Minister of State for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, certainly got to the stage where he published an excellent report by the board under the chairmanship of Ms Dorothea Dowling. Unfortunately, he did not give himself a chance to implement the report. I am disappointed that, with all the knowledge he built up over four and a half years of gestation, all we got at the end of the day was a report and no action.</p>
          <p eId="para_1444">For the sake of business, young people, community groups and all those who are writing to Deputies on all sides of the House about this issue, let us get action rather than words, let us get implementation rather than another study. Accordingly, the House should not divide on this issue. All of us should be united in ensuring that there is a cost structure in the insurance industry which will lead to reduced premiums and which will also allow people, who are going without insurance at present, to get it at reasonable rates.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Job Losses.</heading>
        <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_638">
          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_1450">I am disturbed by the reports of job losses at the Oasis factory in Ballina. At one time the factory employed 300 people and it now employs only 120. A further 46 employees lost their jobs today. This problem, which is a symptom of what is happening in north Mayo, needs an urgent solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1451">I call on the Government to take action to save the jobs at the factory. A previous task force was successful to a degree but it did not provide the complete answer because Government commitment to the area does not exist. I ask for the setting up of a task force which would include Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, Ballina Chamber of Commerce, Mayo County Council, Ballina Urban District Council, Forbairt, Teagasc and the local development groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_1452">I particularly seek a Government commitment to Mayo. The root cause of the problem of north Mayo is the lack of essential infrastructure. While funds have been available they have not come to the west and there is an onus on the Government to correct this imbalance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1453">We matter in north Mayo. I was raised in the area and, like people everywhere, we want to live and work in our own area and to keep our children there. We cannot do this in north Mayo. Half of our graduates must go to Dublin to get their first job. Dublin has enough problems with the number of people who are already there without attracting more people to the capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1454">The answer is regional development. The Government should practise what it preaches. It preaches regional development but does not practise it. The roads in the west are worthy of the Third World. The Western Development Commission has charged that the national development plan does not address this situation. The roads are getting worse and not better. The telecommunications infrastructure is not satisfactory. Our young people go to Dublin in droves every week to get jobs which they should be able to find locally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1455">The Oasis factory is closing because the jobs it provides can be too easily transferred to cheaper economies. Because we do not have the telecommunications and roads infrastructure we cannot provide quality jobs to allow our young people to stay in their own area. The west of Ireland, and north Mayo in particular, cannot compete with other areas of the EU in attracting industry by providing a proper climate for development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1456">Objective One status has not meant anything to the people of the area. What good is a grant, no matter how large, if one cannot get it? We  have had the wrong kind of consistency – consistent neglect – from successive Governments. We want a commitment to infrastructure. People in north Mayo, particularly young people, are disillusioned, and one cannot blame them. Since 1997, about 600 jobs have been lost between Heneghans and Asahi. What will happen in 2004 when Bellacorick closes? That will be another 200 jobs lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_1457">It is not surprising that people feel hopeless and can see no future. Employment in Oasis is down from 300 to 74. It is not sufficient to respond with lip-service and any type of task force. A task force that can address the problem, that can put pressure on Government to do what is required and that can ensure regional development takes place is necessary. It must also ensure structural funds are allocated to this Objective One area. People in the voluntary sector fought hard for that status and it is regrettable to realise it is useless.</p>
          <p eId="para_1458">There are many educated young people in the area. They cannot get jobs due to the failure of successive Governments to support them.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_639">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1459">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The Oasis facility in Ballina, part of Oasis Corporation of Ohio, employs 135 permanent staff. It was established in 1993 to manufacture water coolers for the European and Middle Eastern market, which now constitutes 90% of its business. In 1994, it commenced production of dehumidifiers, which now accounts for the balance of output. The company is the international market leader in water coolers for commercial and domestic use. Annual sales are in the region of €25 million. The company undertook expansions in 1995 and 1999. It is understood that the company is reviewing its operations due to current market circumstances and IDA Ireland is in contact with the company in relation to this review.</p>
          <p eId="para_1460">In relation to the Mayo area, the IDA has helped secure a significant number of job creation projects in recent years. Coca Cola has completed the construction and commissioning of its facility in Ballina; this project already employs 236 people. Lionbridge Technologies established its European software test centre in Ballina and currently employs 63 people. Dekko Heating Technologies, has established its European manufacturing operation in Ballyhaunis and current employment is 88 people. Dalkia has established operations in Ballina to provide maintenance and facilities management services to the Coca Cola facility. It is expected that this will lead to the creation of 50 new technical jobs. Fort Wayne Metals, a provider of precision wire products for the medical industry announced a new 80-job project for Castlebar in February 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1461">DeCare Operations Ireland, established a claims processing centre in Claremorris in 1999 to create 150 jobs involved in processing dental  insurance claims and the company now employs 120 people. In November 2001, the Tánaiste announced a significant expansion of the facility in Mayo with 150 jobs being announced for a new facility in Crossmolina and a further 60 jobs at Claremorris. Schutz has established an industrial packaging manufacturing operation in part of the former Asahi factory at Killala to supply the needs of Coca Cola and other customers in Ireland. Currently, 25 people are employed there.</p>
          <p eId="para_1462">The IDA is in the final stages of acquiring a 25 acre site at Ballina and 37 acres at Westport. Development of these sites is expected to get under way in due course. Employment in IDA-assisted companies in Mayo has increased from 2,855 in 1996 to 3,742 in 2001. Enterprise Ireland has had considerable success in the promotion of indigenous business in Mayo in recent years. Between 1996 and 2001, employment in Enterprise Ireland companies has grown from 2,861 to 3,103. There are now ten community enterprise centres approved for support by Enterprise Ireland in the county. In addition, it has identified Castlebar as one of the strategic locations for the development of a webworks with the view to generating local high technology projects. This is building on Castlebar's reputation as an information age town.</p>
          <p eId="para_1463">Enterprise Ireland has been working with the local authority with a view to the further development of broadband services in the county. Ballina and Kiltimagh have been approved for the construction of metro rings and that was announced on 8 March 2002 by the then Minister for Public Enterprise, Senator Mary O'Rourke. I am confident that the existing co-operative framework involving the development agencies and local parties can be used effectively and efficiently to deal with job creation in the region. Accordingly, the re-establishment of the North Mayo Task Force would not achieve this objective with any greater effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1464">The State development agencies are fully committed to the promotion of employment creation in north Mayo. The Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities and the importance of making even greater efforts in this field has been impressed on the development agencies. The agencies work closely with each other and with the development bodies in the area, including the Mayo County Development Board and Mayo County Council, as well as other local bodies and interests in facilitating an integrated approach to enterprise development. Given the representation of the State agencies and the county council on the Mayo County Development Board, it is considered that, should any further co-ordination be necessary, the county development board would be the most appropriate forum to fulfil this function.</p>

          <from>Mr. S. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_1465">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this important issue, namely, the implications for next year's Special Olympics of the decision taken by Fingal County Council on Monday last to close the gates of Morton Stadium on 31 December 2002 should outstanding issues not be resolved with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. Under an agreement entered into, the financing of the operations at Morton Stadium will be borne by the four local authorities in the greater Dublin area and the sports section of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. To date, the Department has reneged on its obligations as part of that agreement and its current liability stood at £277,525 at the end of last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1466">Athletes will be well aware that the then Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, announced, in a glare of publicity prior to local and European elections in 1999, that the Government intended to provide a national indoor athletic centre at Santry. For its part, Fingal County Council agreed to provide the site free of charge – a significant contribution. At the request of the Minister, Fingal County Council commissioned a feasibility study on the provision of this indoor facility. The result of this was examined and approved by the Department and the Irish Sports Council. In July 2000, the Minister announced a capital grant of £4.8 million toward the cost of the project. To date, the Department has failed to pay €1.44 million to Fingal County Council in respect of expenditure and commitments to date on the planning, design and tendering stages of the proposed national indoor athletic centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_1467">Should the Government decide not to proceed with this project, that is between it and the people. What is another broken promise anyway? However, the rate payers of Fingal should not have to carry this burden. If this outstanding funding had been paid to the council over the years, it is highly likely that up to eight community sports projects in my constituency, which have been put on hold through lack of funding, would have been grant-aided and up and running.</p>
          <p eId="para_1468">The 11th Special Olympics will be held in Ireland next year. Ireland will be the first country to host the Special Olympics outside the USA. It is estimated that the Special Olympics will attract up to 7,000 athletes, 3,000 coaches and official delegates and thousands of family members and friends of participants from 166 countries. This is a prestigious event and it is important that everything is put in place to give a céad míle fáilte to the athletes and to ensure a successful outcome. The athletics element of the games will commence in Santry on 24 June 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1469">It is proposed to upgrade existing facilities and ancillary services to successfully host the event in Santry, at an estimated cost in excess of €500,000. As a result of departmental indifference, it seems  that Fingal County Council will be asked to carry this additional cost, which means that over €2 million will be owed to the council. The council has decided that it will be unable to carry such a burden. Morton Stadium in Santry is a national stadium and should be financed primarily by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, although the local authority is also willing to play its part. Notwithstanding these difficulties, Fingal County Council is looking forward to playing its part in hosting a successful games, alongside thousands of volunteers and host families throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1470">I implore the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and the Taoiseach to acknowledge their responsibilities and to meet their financial obligations to the council. In this regard, I suggest that an early meeting be organised between both parties. I look forward to a fruitful outcome to such a meeting so that the aims of the Special Olympics, as outlined in the games' mission statement, can be met. The mission is to "provide in Ireland a unique and unparalleled sporting and cultural experience for the athletes taking part, from 160 international delegations all over the world, as well as for their coaches, families, volunteers and sponsors, combining the excitement of sport with the opportunity for personal distinction, achievement and pride". I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to ensure that no obstacles are placed in the way of achieving this objective. We must work together to ensure that next year's games are a fantastic and successful experience and the Government must do its part by fulfilling its financial obligations.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_1471">I thank Deputy Seán Ryan for raising this matter on the Adjournment and for giving me the opportunity to address the issues involved on behalf of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and his Department are fully aware and appreciative of the crucial and unique role played by Morton Stadium as the primary venue for athletic events in Ireland over many decades. The stadium is recognised as the Irish national athletics stadium and the individuals and organisations who have contributed to developing and running it over the years deserve to be commended. In particular, the local authority now known as Fingal County Council should be mentioned for its outstanding support for, and commitment to, the stadium and its activities in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1472">Hosting the Special Olympics World Summer Games in June 2003 offers Ireland the opportunity to showcase itself to the world as the host of many inspirational athletes who will participate. This is the first time the games have been held outside the United States and it will be the largest international sporting event in our island's history. It will truly be a world-class event; there will be delegations from 165 countries, participat ing in 22 different sports at various venues in the greater Dublin area. Some 7,000 athletes, 30,000 volunteers, as well as coaches, officials, families and friends will be involved in the games. The events will be covered by 2,000 international media personnel. The project has generated massive goodwill and commitment across the spectrum of national life. Staging the event is expected to cost about €34 million. The Government has committed €10.2 million to the project through the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the EU has committed over €6 million and sponsorship has raised over €14 million so far.</p>
          <p eId="para_1473">I am pleased that Ireland has taken the opportunity to participate in this way in the games, which will provide a lasting legacy for those with disabilities. The games will broaden our sporting experience and our understanding of difference. Great tribute is due to all those who have given unstintingly and who will undoubtedly be called upon to make a significant effort to bring off a successful venture. Those involved with Morton Stadium are among a long list of people whose worthwhile efforts will bring credit to the country and great joy to the participants of the games.</p>
          <p eId="para_1474">The suitability of the Morton Stadium as a venue to host the athletics events of the summer games next year has been raised by Deputy Ryan. As he is aware, the current facilities at Morton Stadium, which include a state-of-the-art modern track and ancillary facilities, were provided by previous Governments over many years, at a cost in excess of £2 million. I can inform the House that the Special Olympic Games committee has confirmed that Morton Stadium "is suitable to run the track and field competition for the games as it stands right now". I suggest that this statement from the games committee speaks for itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_1475">Fingal County Council was asked by the former Minister, Deputy McDaid, to prepare an application for an indoor athletics track under the 2000 sports capital programme. In January 2001, Fingal County Council opened a public tender process for this development and for the provision of a headquarters for the Athletics Association of Ireland. The outcome of the tendering process, however, was that the cost of the project almost doubled to €15.5 million from €9.56 million. The promised grant of €6 million was no longer adequate to make the project feasible. A number of options for reducing the overall cost of the project were considered by Fingal County Council but such an approach would have reduced the standard and quality of the project considerably. It would not have been appropriate to provide a second class facility that would not meet European and world standards. The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is considering how the project can be progressed. In any event, it was felt that the start of the project should be delayed until after the Special Olympics because of safety considerations and the possible risk to athletes if work was ongoing when the games were in progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_1476">I assure the Deputy that the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is committed to the provision of sports facilities at all levels and to continuing the excellent work of the last five years in this regard. It may be of interest to the Deputy to know that sports funding has increased from £13.25 million in 1997 to over €161.4 million this year. I mention this fact to illustrate the degree of the Government's commitment to sport. The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism has been in contact with Fingal County Council in relation to the running costs of Morton Stadium. The Minister intends that the Department and the county council will, through these discussions, reach an accommodation to enable Fingal County Council to manage the costs. He is anxious to satisfactorily resolve these issues and with that in mind, he has asked that an early meeting be arranged between officials of his Department and Fingal County Council, with a view to progressing these matters to the satisfaction of all concerned.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Special Educational Needs.</heading>
        <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_643">
          <from>Ms O. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_1478">I appreciate the opportunity to raise this issue. When I originally submitted the request to speak about this matter on the Adjournment, the parents of clients of St. Vincent's on the Navan Road had been marching for six weeks in an attempt to secure better service in the centre. They have now been marching for almost eight weeks. I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the dilemma faced by the parents, which results from a gradual shift from the health care model of the past, to the educational model of the present day. Nursing and health care staff have left the facility; in effect, they have been forced out. The service is being increasingly dictated by the demands of the Department of Education and Science, which dictates timetables, school terms and the service contracts of teachers and classroom assistants. It would be incorrect to suggest that there has been a diminution of the service at St. Vincent's, as there is no real service now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1479">Totally inappropriate care is offered to children with multiple disabilities, all of whom suffer physical as well as intellectual impairment. Such is the level of concern among their parents, they have considered challenging the findings in the O'Donoghue and Sinnott cases. It would be an absolute travesty and the ultimate irony if parents of handicapped children were forced to challenge these judgments. The finding in both cases was that children should receive care that is entirely appropriate to their needs. It is being implemented in the case of these children through the provision of entirely inappropriate and inadequate health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1480">The move to an educational model for intellectual disability has created a structural problem nationwide. It has reached crisis point at the Navan Road campus but it is a problem through out Ireland. While the classroom setting is undoubtedly suitable for many children, it is completely inappropriate for those with severe and profound disability as health care is their primary need. Many of these children have multiple disabilities and their basic needs are to learn how to sit, chew, eat and cope with seizures. The last thing they need is to be taught sums in a classroom. One size does not fit all in terms of intellectual and physical disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1481">I call on the Minister of State to intervene immediately to prevent the problem at St. Vincent's extending nationwide. It is vital that the service offered to these children meets their overriding health needs and they are not expected to slot into an educational service geared towards children with an intellectual disability who are physically healthy. This problem must be resolved as it cannot be allowed to continue week in, week out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1482">I appreciate there are chain of command difficulties which inevitably arise when two sets of professionals clash in a common setting. Nevertheless, a solution must be found and the problem cannot be left to sit. It is up to the Minister for Health and Children to solve this problem because it is the children's health care, not their education, that is suffering.</p>
          <p eId="para_1483">I have met many children with these disabilities, including some from St. Vincent's. They are given two months summer holidays. It is entirely inappropriate to send them home for two months when they need daily therapy and 24 hour care. Apart from anything else, their families cannot cope with the provision of such non-stop care while at the same time watching the health of the children deteriorate because of a lack of therapy and treatment. Parents are worn out and stressed and they do not need to be forced to march up and down the Navan Road or to the Dáil in an effort to have their problem noticed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1484">They are not able take up a service that is available and paid for by the taxpayer. It is infinitely frustrating and totally dispiriting for the parents that no one notices or cares. They are so concerned that they have withdrawn their children from the service because of concerns for their physical safety and health care. I appreciate the Minister of State will understand what I am talking about and I realise it will not be an easy problem to solve because of the structural arrangements in place. However, it is an issue to which a resolution must be found. I ask the Minister of State to take action before there is a major problem in this area nationwide.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TimOMalleyPD" eId="spk_644">
          <from>Mr. T. O'Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_1485">On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to outline the position concerning this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1486">St. Vincent's special school on the Navan Road campus provides educational services to more than 100 children, including a number of children with a severe or profound level of intellectual dis ability. The developmental education centre, which was established in 1987 as part of St. Vincent's services for children with a severe or profound level of intellectual disability, was initially funded and managed by the health services. These services continue to deliver nursing and care support for the children in question. Following the O'Donoghue judgment in 1993, which confirmed the right of children with a severe or profound level of intellectual disability to a primary education, the authorities at St. Vincent's sought the introduction of a primary education service for the children in their care who suffer from severe or profound intellectual disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1487">The Department of Education and Science responded to this request by providing the necessary teaching and special needs assistant support to facilitate the delivery of the educational component of the overall support programme at the centre. The centre is currently housed in part of the older buildings from which health funded services are delivered. However, a purpose built modern facility, designed to meet the particular needs of this group and funded by the Department of Education and Science is nearing completion and will shortly be ready for occupation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1488">The policy on the delivery of educational and health-related services to children such as those attending St. Vincent's centre is that provision is based on an assessment of the children's needs involving parents, educational and health professionals. While particular difficulties have been experienced in delivering services at local level, I assure the Deputy there has been no reduction in the level of resources available from the health services to support the children attending the services. The majority of children have been attending the centre on a daily basis over the past number of weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1489">My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and I have met representatives of the parents, as has the Minister for Education and Science. Officials from my Department have been in contact with the management of the centre. Local management has been endeavouring to resolve the difficulties and this process is ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1490">As part of the internal process to resolve the difficulties which have arisen in the services, it has been agreed by the staff representatives that an internal working group will be established to work with the various professionals with a view to reaching a resolution in these matters. The initial timeframe for the group to complete this work is one month, with the first meeting due to take place this week. The facilitator involved in these discussions was to meet representatives of the parents yesterday. Every effort is also being made to fill the vacant nursing posts attached to the services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1491">Deputies Dempsey, Lenihan and I agreed that our Departments would nominate two people with professional experience in this area to provide whatever assistance they can to local man agement. The two people nominated by the Departments met representatives of the families and other relevant parties last week. They will report back to both Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1492">While the immediate issues affecting the services on the Navan Road require a resolution at local level, there are elements which have broader implications for the delivery of educational and health-related support services to children with a severe or profound level of intellectual disability and these are also being followed up by both Departments. The information which will be provided to both Departments by the two nominated individuals will form an important part of that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1493">Finally, I again appeal to all involved in the delivery of services to these children to ensure that the needs of the children are met by the most appropriate application of the health and educational resources available to the services.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Sex Education.</heading>
        <speech by="#FionnaOMalleyPD" eId="spk_645">
          <from>Ms F. O'Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_1494">I welcome very much the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the findings of the report into the experience of teenage pregnancy in the south east, which was carried out on behalf of the South-Eastern Health Board. The report informs us that young people are sexually active. That is hardly a surprise but in many cases they are ill-equipped with information about contraception and the dangers of unprotected sex. Worryingly, a number of teenagers interviewed for the report failed to make the connection between having sex and pregnancy. That is quite astonishing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1495">According to Angela O'Shea, the Women's Health Development Officer with the South-Eastern Health Board, as sexual maturity begins at an earlier age, every teenage girl between the ages of 15 and 19 now has a one in ten chance of having a baby. The latest figures for the number of women accessing abortion services in Britain indicates a worrying increase in the number of under 20s travelling. The first quarter figures for 2002 from the British National Statistics Office shows an increase of 47 in the number of Irish women and girls under the age of 20 accessing abortion services compared with the same period last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1496">Pregnancy is not the only consequence of unprotected and casual sex. The incidence of sexually transmitted infections in Ireland is growing at an alarming rate, with huge increases in the number of girls and women presenting with chlamydia. The South-Eastern Health Board report calls for comprehensive policy responses to assist young people in making more informed choices about sex. In delivering such responses we must bear in mind that many young people are sexually active and have particular sexual health needs. It would be wrong to warn them simply against engaging in sexual activity because of the consequences of crisis pregnancy and sexually trans mitted diseases. The lecture approach does not work. Instead we should provide information and sexual health care services to young people that enable them to make informed choices about sexual behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_1497">Education plays a critical role and while relationships and sexuality education in the curriculum aims to make young people more aware, the reality is that it is not being taught in all schools. Furthermore, the formal surroundings of a school are not always conducive to young people discussing issues around sex and reproductive health in a frank manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1498">The report also points to a need for peer education and sex education programmes delivered in a more holistic, interactive and comprehensive manner. Such education programmes should not only deal with all aspects of contraception, sexual health and sexually transmitted diseases, they should cover issues of self esteem. It is the experience of family planning service providers that young people, particularly young girls, seeking emergency contraception often explained that they were more or less forced to have sex because they felt that the relationship was at risk of breaking down otherwise. Sex education should impart the message that sexual relations must be approached in a responsible and informed way, and never as something into which a person should be pressurised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1499">For those who make an informed choice about sex, access to non-judgmental information on contraception, sexual problems and crisis pregnancy is essential. There is a huge information gap about where people can access reliable information and many young people are receiving unreliable information from equally uneducated peers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1500">When young people become sexually active, there is huge reluctance to seek parental advice and guidance. Often approaching the family doctor is not an option, particularly for those on low incomes or those who cannot meet consultation fees or the cost of contraception. There is a need for sexual health services particularly targeted at young people where contraception, counselling, STD testing and other services are offered at a subsidised rate or for free. Universities and colleges sometimes offer this service but that is for those with the good fortune to be in third level education, from which many are excluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_1501">High profile advertising targeted at young people could play a role in raising the awareness of sexual transmitted infections and crisis pregnancy. Such advertising should not just warn of the dangers but also promote condom usage and safe sex generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1502">The health board report also deals with the evaluation report on pilot teen parent support projects. I welcome the commitment contained in it to supporting teen parents but we, as policy makers, must play a role in delivering comprehensive sexual and reproductive services.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#IvorCallely" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_646">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_1503">I would like to thank Deputy Fiona O'Malley for raising this important issue. The Minister and I share the Deputy's concern about the need for relevant and comprehensive sex education programmes and reproductive health services for teenagers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1504">In relation to sex education programmes, the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children has been working both independently and in partnership with the Department of Education and Science over the past number of years to achieve an improvement in sexual health of the entire population and of young people specifically. The national health promotion strategy for the years 2000-05 set down the strategic aim of promoting sexual health and safer sexual practices amongst the population. The specific objectives are to support school based programmes designed to develop personal skills such as relationships and sexuality education and social, personal and health education; to work in partnership to develop and implement health promotion initiatives which address teenage pregnancies; to contribute to a reduction in the number of crisis pregnancies; to work in partnership to develop and implement strategies aimed at reducing the incidence of STIs; to initiate research into the need for a national sexual health strategy that would encompass the prevention of STIs and crisis pregnancies and to support the implementation of the recommendations from the national AIDS strategy committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1505">I am pleased to inform the House that the Department has well developed structures and policies in place to achieve these objectives. By September 2003 it is the intention that all primary and post-primary schools will have a timetabled programme of social, personal and health education. The SPHE programme forms part of the core curriculum at junior cycle and provides an integrated and substantial use of education, relationship and sexuality education alongside emotional and physical health issues and the development of communication skills. This holistic life skills approach thereby provides students with the opportunity to develop skills and competence to learn about themselves, to care for themselves and others and to make informed decisions about their health, personal lives and social development. To date 76% of our postrimary schools have engaged with the SPHE support service to support their implementation and delivery of the programme. Over 80% of primary schools report having SPHE on the timetable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1506">In addition to the implementation of the national programme, many of the regional health boards are developing and implementing sexual health strategies and initiatives for young people. In particular the Southern, North-Western, Midlands and Mid-Western Health Boards are at an advanced stage of strategy development and implementation. The health promotion unit of the Department is working closely on an ongoing  basis with these boards to support and advise on strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1507">In addition to school based interventions, the health promotion unit of the Department has almost doubled its investment in convenience advertising in pubs, clubs, colleges and youth venues across the country. This means of delivering sexual health messages has been very positively evaluated world-wide and here in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1508">Through the education and prevention sub-committee of the national AIDS strategy committee, the Department has engaged extensively with both the gay community and HIV positive groups in relation to the promotion of healthy sexual behaviours. Awareness raising initiatives and programmes are continually being developed and funded by the Department relating to the specific needs of these groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_1509">The establishment of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency has given new impetus to, and will play a major role in, the development of co-ordinated, responsive and appropriate services for crisis pregnancy, including teenage pregnancy. The agency has the task, in consultation with other non-statutory agencies, of drawing up a national strategy to address crisis pregnancies, especially those of teenagers, and overseeing its implementation. It will draw on the experience of existing bodies while fulfilling its remit to bring a new systemic and sustained approach to preventing crisis pregnancies and to providing assistance during and after they occur. It will also address shortfalls in counselling services, practical support and education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1510">The prevention of crisis pregnancy is the primary task of the agency and preventative issues concerning the education of young adults as well as services appropriate to their needs and lifestyles will be addressed. The agency will work to develop strategies to make women more aware of their options should they have a crisis pregnancy and to improve the supports and assistance available to them to help them feel they have genuine alternatives to abortion. Women who have had  abortions also have particular needs which is another area the agency has been asked to address to ensure that women are treated with compassion and understanding and their emotional and physical health needs are attended to.</p>
          <p eId="para_1511">To help develop a strategy to address crisis pregnancy, the agency invited submissions from organisations and the public earlier this year. I encourage anyone listening to this debate with a view or a creative suggestion to make a submission either to the agency or directly to me. I am pleased to indicate that approximately 250 submissions have been received to date and are currently being examined, coded and analysed. Further consultation will take place with the appropriate agencies. It is expected that this wide-ranging consultation process will run into 2003 and it is hoped to institute an action plan for the coming years. This will provide the agency with a framework to implement its strategy in a planned and structured manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1512">The main public information scheme being developed by the agency in 2002 is the development of an information on supports in crisis pregnancy programme which the agency expects to begin to roll-out from November 2002. The development of a research programme has also commenced and the agency has stated that the main priorities in this area include the development of an initial framework, an audit of existing research and an analysis of research gaps. In 2002, key research on crisis pregnancy counselling commenced, as did the development of a communications framework and an audit of the services provided nationally. I am satisfied that the current programmes are in place and I will consider any innovative proposal. The strategies being developed by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency will bring about a reduction in teenage pregnancies.</p>

          <p eId="para_1518">I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 98 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1519">The widely publicised call by my Department for expressions of interest in the concept of a second independent terminal at Dublin Airport requested interested parties to submit their responses by Thursday, 31 October 2002. There has been a strong response to the invitation and I expect further responses before the deadline.</p>
          <p eId="para_1520">The concept of a second, independent or competing terminal at Dublin Airport has been mooted by a number of interests in recent years and the new programme for government provides for an examination of such a proposal and to progress it if the evidence suggests that it would deliver significant benefits. The most practical way forward at this point is to explore the pros and cons involved and to test the viability of the concept by canvassing the market to which end my Department published a notice in early August calling for "expressions of interest" from interested parties. This call for expressions of interest provides an opportunity for proponents of the concept of a second, independent terminal at Dublin Airport to outline what precisely they have in mind, how it would work in practice, and possible approaches to addressing the regulatory implications for the transparent pricing of airfield facilities.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_77">The notice set out a number of areas which should be addressed by interested parties such as a clear specification of the precise nature of their proposed concept, the preferred location for a second terminal, the benefits for airlines and other airport users, etc. However, we have not  been prescriptive in any of these issues. It is entirely a matter for interested parties to address, as they see fit, the areas covered in the notice including the financing and economic dimensions of their proposals.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_78">When these ideas and proposals are received at the end of this month, I intend to have the responses professionally assessed and to make recommendations to the Government on this issue before the end of the year. The current exercise is not a tender process but rather an informal canvas of the market for ideas which will assist me in determining if the concept of a second independent or competing terminal would deliver significant benefits. The responses received will also enable me to determine what further actions I may need to take to allow this concept to be further progressed, including the possible initiation in due course of a formal public tendering process for the provision of such a facility.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1522">The primary immediate investigative role in relation to road accidents is vested in the Garda Síochána. Priority in the pursuit of such an investigation must be given to the determination of the causes of road accidents and in particular to the determination of whether a breach of the road traffic laws contributed to the occurrence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1523">The Garda Síochána is the only body empowered to make such a determination and to launch criminal proceedings against any person who the Garda consider should be accused of the commission of an offence. In the final instance it is a matter for the courts to decide on the guilt or innocence of an accused person. The Garda reports relating to an accident provide information to assist the courts in making decisions in such matters. Given the pivotal role played by the Garda in accident investigation, they are tasked with the preparation of detailed reports on each accident they attend.</p>
          <p eId="para_1524">These reports are passed on to the National Roads Authority and subsequently to each local authority for the purpose of the establishment of accident trends and causes generally and to facilitate carrying out remedial works relating to road infrastructure where such action is deemed to be necessary. The overall role of monitoring road safety activity at national level is carried out by the high level group on road safety on which all of the bodies involved in road safety are represented. I have no immediate proposals to establish alternative arrangements for investigating road accidents. However, I will give further consideration to the Deputy's suggestion.</p>

          <p eId="para_1528">I propose to take Questions Nos. 78, 113 and 115 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1529">This year €233 million of Exchequer funding has been allocated to CIE as a revenue subvention to provide for non-commercial but socially necessary services. This represents an increase of 75% in Exchequer revenue funding since 1997 and together with significant capital investment under the national development plan reflects the commitment of this Government to public transport, following decades of under investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1530">A multi-annual framework for funding the public transport elements of the national development plan has been put in place to assist the companies in planning the implementation of the plan and the delivery of services. Against this background, the annual subvention to CIE is being increased by a further 5% per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1531">In the context of the significant State support being provided to the CIE companies, I am anxious that a system to measure output performance criteria be put in place to determine value for money for the State subvention provided. In this regard, my Department is developing a performance indicator system in conjunction with the operating companies. This system will allow for greater analysis of the operation of the bus and rail companies in the context of the on-going subvention, and for monitoring of the companies performance over time in containing costs, generating revenue and increasing passenger numbers.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_79">However, despite the significant increase in the State subvention in recent years, the three operating companies continue to face a difficult financial position following the rapid expansion of services under the national development plan, the increasing impact of congestion on certain services and increased operating overheads. In this context, the companies have recently submitted an application for fares increases to my Department. I am conscious that the significant progress in infrastructure development in recent years needs to be accompanied by improvements  in the organisational structures for and the efficiency and effectiveness of public transport provision. It is in the context of these reform issues that I am considering the applications for the fares increase.</summary>

      <b>Mr. Penrose</b>

      the Government's position regarding the EU proposals for a single sky policy or the creation of a single EU airspace; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_1533">Air Traffic is growing and will continue to grow despite the temporary downturn due to last year's terrorist attacks. This growth is giving rise to capacity constraints. In 2000 some 20% of flights from European airports were delayed by an average of 25 minutes while in 2001 according to the Association of European Airlines more than 24% of intra-European flights suffered a delay of more than 15 minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1534">There are various causes including shortage of airport capacity constraints, weather, aircraft serviceability, airline operations policies and air traffic control. Air traffic control capacity constraints are a significant contributor to the delays. While such delays are rare in Irish airspace they impact on Irish airlines who must operate through UK and European centres where there are significant capacity constraints.</p>
          <p eId="para_1535">With a view to tackling the delays caused by air traffic control constraints, the European Commission, following a report by a high level group comprising representatives of member states has brought forward the Single European Sky package of legislative proposals. The package comprises four elements, a framework regulation establishing the general principles, a regulation on the provision of air navigation services, a regulation on the organisation and use of airspace and a regulation on the inter-operability of the air traffic management network.</p>
          <p eId="para_1536">The EU is undertaking a genuine reform of air traffic management. This involves first strengthening safety by a more coherent organisational structure at Community level and second increasing capacity in the system to meet traffic growth by a more efficient use and organisation of air space. The objective is to establish a Community airspace as a single operating airspace where member states designate air navigation service providers and where common procedures for the design, planning and management ensure the efficient and safe performance of air traffic management at a European level. To make a comparison, today arterial routes stretch throughout Europe in a single seamless road system. The objective is to do the same thing in the air: rationalise airspace boundaries so that flights do not have to be inefficiently guided through a multiplicity of air traffic control areas.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_80">The European Council on 15 and 16 March 2002 called for work to be pursued actively in 2002 on this package of proposals so that decisions can be taken to bring about a single sky in 2004. I attended the recent Transport Council meeting held on 3 October which considered progress on this matter and it was agreed that work should be carried forward with a view to enabling a political agreement to be reached at the Council's session on 5 and 6 December 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_81">Before the end of 2004, the main accompanying measures at Community and national level should also have been adopted, so that the regulatory framework necessary for the operation of the Single European Sky will be in force by that date. All member states have welcomed the Single European Sky package and underlined its importance. Ireland strongly supports the concept of a Single European Sky and my Department has been working closely with the Irish Aviation Authority in order to make progress on adoption of the package. As an island nation with a high dependence on air and sea transport, improved efficiency in these modes is important in enabling future economic development and expansion of international trade links.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_86">There is funding provided in the national development plan for public transport initiatives in rural areas on a pilot basis. This scheme, known as the rural transport initiative, was developed in my Department and launched by my predecessor in 2001, following a nation-wide consultation process. The RTI is being managed by area development management, ADM, on behalf of my Department. To date eight groups have received funding for transport operations while projects from a further 26 groups are being assessed for funding.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_87">The main purpose of the RTI is to promote the development of a range of innovative pilot community based public transport projects in rural areas that would help to contribute to the development of rural public transport policy for the country as a whole. Some €3 million will be spent on the RTI this year and a similar amount is earmarked for 2003 when the pilot initiative is due to end.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_88">Also in 2001 an interdepartmental committee, under the chairmanship of my Department, was established with the remit of bringing forward options for the development of rural public transport policy. The committee commissioned a study on this subject which, I understand, is now nearing completion and I am looking forward to receiving the committee's fresh ideas in this area. I expect to be presented with the findings of the study before the end of the year. This study, together with the experience gained from the RTI, will enable me to formulate appropriate policies for rural transport for the future.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1580">I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 120 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1581">Significant investment has been made by Aer Rianta at Shannon Airport in recent years in developing facilities for passengers and cargo. With the completion of the terminal extension two years ago, Shannon now has capacity to handle up to 4.5 million passengers per annum. This year, Aer Rianta expects 2.3 million passengers to pass through Shannon Airport. Further investment is now required at Cork Airport to cater for traffic growth and initiatives are also under way for Dublin Airport to expand passenger and aircraft handling facilities.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_92">It is recognised by Aer Rianta that Cork Airport needs significant investment to cater for the growth in traffic through the airport in recent years and the company is well advanced with its  plans for a major new capital investment programme in infrastructure and facilities. The main feature of this programme, estimated to cost €130 million, is a 25,000 sq. metre terminal building. Planning permission for this project was secured earlier this year and Aer Rianta is currently evaluating tenders for the works. The company expects the work will take two years to complete and the aim would be to have the new terminal ready for Cork's year as European city of culture in 2005. I have made it clear that this project will proceed, whatever the outcome of my current examination of options for greater autonomy for Cork airport.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_93">At Dublin Airport, the Programme for Government commits to ensuring that a new, low cost facility (Pier D) is built without delay. The need for further facilities to cater for the rapid turnaround of aircraft when they are on the ground was specifically identified in the Doganis report earlier this year. To this end, Aer Rianta recently secured planning permission from Fingal County Council in respect of a new, permanent, two-story pier. The company has also submitted a planning application for a temporary pier facility. Subject to planning permission being secured, the temporary facility will be in place and operational by the beginning of May next year, in good time for the peak summer tourism season. In relation to the proposed permanent pier facility, I have indicated to the board of Aer Rianta that while I have no objection to the company proceeding with its planning and other preparatory work, no contractual or other irrevocable commitments should be entered into before the Government makes a decision with regard to the possible provision of a second independent or competing terminal at Dublin Airport.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_94">The concept of such a terminal at Dublin Airport has been mooted by a number of interests in recent years and I believe the most practical way forward at this point is to explore the pros and cons involved and to test the viability of the concept of canvassing the market. To that end, my Department has already made a widely publicised call for expressions of interest from interested parties. This call for expressions of interest provides an opportunity for proponents of the concept of a second, independent terminal at Dublin Airport to outline what precisely they have in mind, how it would work in practice, and possible approaches to addressing the regulatory implications e.g. for the transparent pricing of airfield facilities. We have asked for these ideas and proposals to be submitted by the end of this month, 31 October, and I intend to have the responses professionally assessed and make recommendations to the Government on this issue before the end of the year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_95">The programme for Government also includes a commitment that as part of the process of transforming Aer Rianta, we will ensure that Shannon and Cork airports have greater autonomy and independence. A debate has now been stimulated by me both within the Shannon and Cork regions  and at a national level on the best ownership structure for these two airports going forward, in the context of continued State ownership. I visited both Shannon and Cork recently to further stimulate this debate. There is a genuine sense of goodwill towards the airports in the two regions on the part of local tourism and business interests and views may differ on the best way forward. However, I will listen carefully to the views of all interested parties before framing proposals to bring to Government.</summary>

I have not met the management of the Dublin Port tunnel.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_97">Construction work is under way on the Dublin Port tunnel which has a construction contract value of almost €450 million. The tunnel will provide direct motorway access to Dublin Port and is expected to be open in early 2005. On completion, the tunnel will very significantly reduce the number of heavy goods vehicles using the city centre. National Roads Authority estimates suggest that in the year of opening, 7,200 heavy goods vehicles per day will use the tunnel. With a clearance height of 4.9m. and an operating height restriction of 4.65m. the Dublin Port tunnel is higher than most European tunnels where height limits apply. The tunnel also fully complies with an EU directive which requires that heavy goods vehicles up to 4.0m. in height must be accommodated in member states when undertaking international journeys. In addition, according to a survey carried out by the Dublin Port Company of all trucks exiting the port in June and July 2002, 98% of all trucks were below 4.65m. and will be accommodated by the tunnel. In view of the above, there are no proposals to increase the height of the tunnel. By taking significant numbers of HGVs and cars off the streets of Dublin every day, the port tunnel will provide much needed relief from congestion for freight distributors and other port-related traffic.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_98">Finally, I should mention that a regional freight study is being undertaken by the Dublin Transportation Office as part of its integrated transportation strategy for the greater Dublin area to 2016. This study will identify appropriate routes and measures for the better management of general goods distribution for freight trips to and from Dublin port, Dún Laoghaire port and Dublin Airport.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1596">In a strategic review undertaken in 1999 for my predecessor, the board of Aer Rianta considered that the Great Southern Hotels Group, while operating successfully, is non-core to Aer Rianta's airport management operations. The board recommended that it should exit from the hotels and use the proceeds from the sale towards financing capital expenditure programmes at the State airports. A subsequent report prepared by Warburg Dillon Read and AIB Capital Markets for the former Minister agreed with the view of the Aer Rianta board on this matter. I will revisit the question of the future of the Great Southern Hotels Group in due course. I intend, however, to concentrate for the time being on the priority issues for aviation, and transport in general, as set out in the programme for Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_1599">I am very much aware of the problem of crowding on our railway network and am conscious of the discomfort and inconvenience this causes to passengers. Iarnród Éireann has a statutory responsibility for ensuring the safety of its passengers. It is therefore a matter for the company to satisfy itself that the number of passengers being carried in any particular train or carriage does not compromise overall passenger safety. Data provided by Iarnród Éireann show that over the period from 1994 to 2001, passenger numbers on inter-city services have increased from 7.8 million to an estimated 11.3 million, and on suburban services from 18.8 million to an estimated 22.7 million. In order to address this, significant funding has been, and continues to be, made available to  Iarnród Éireann for investment to improve the safety of the network, increase the passenger capacity of the system and improve the quality, reliability and speed of services. Iarnród Éireann has ordered 80 diesel railcars for use on suburban routes and delivery of these is expected to commence shortly. The ongoing delivery of this new rolling stock will increase the available capacity to deal with peak periods and should help to alleviate the present crowding difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1600">In the meantime, the railway inspectorate of my Department continues to monitor developments in regard to crowding on trains. They have been in contact with Iarnród Éireann on a number of occasions drawing its attention to the importance of keeping the issue of crowding under review and have also raised particular aspects of the crowding problem with Iarnród Éireann. Iarnród Éireann has advised the inspectorate that the recommendations made by its consultants in 2001 for alleviating crowding on services in the Dublin area are being implemented by the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_1601">In regard to inter-city mainline services, a second independent review of its crowding management strategy is currently being carried out by consultants for Iarnród Éireann. Pending completion of that review, crowding issues continue to be managed in a proactive manner by Iarnród Éireann. For instance, Iarnród Éireann has adopted a system of pre-booking tickets and boarding cards at bank holiday weekends and other particularly busy periods. Iarnród Eireann is considering expanding this system to all inter-city services using modern ticket reservation technology. My predecessor advised the House on several previous occasions that there are no national or EU quantitative safety standards in existence at present in regard to the maximum number of passengers permitted on trains and this is still the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1602">The Railway Safety Bill 2001, which was published in December last and will commence Second Stage in the House tomorrow, will require all railway undertakings, including Iarnród Éireann, to implement a formal safety management system and to describe that system in a document called a "safety case". The Bill will require a railway undertaking to identify in its safety case all issues impacting on the safety of its operations. Such issues would include its strategy for managing crowding of trains. The railway safety commission, to be established under the Bill, will need to be satisfied that the proposed strategy is adequate to ensure the safety of passengers.</p>

          <p eId="para_1605">The programme for Government commits to ensuring that a new, low cost facility (Pier D) is built at Dublin Airport without delay. The need for further facilities to cater for the rapid turnaround of aircraft when they are on the ground was specifically identified in the Doganis report of earlier this year. To this end, Aer Rianta recently secured planning permission from Fingal County Council in respect of a new, permanent, two-story pier. The company has also submitted a planning application for a temporary pier facility. Subject to planning permission being secured, the temporary facility will be in place and operational by the beginning of May next year in good time for the peak summer tourism season. In relation to the proposed permanent pier facility, I have indicated to the board of Aer Rianta that while I have no objection to the company proceeding with its planning and other preparatory work, no contractual or other irrevocable commitments should be entered into before the Government makes a decision with regard to the possible provision of a second independent or competing terminal at Dublin Airport.</p>

The Cohesion Fund assisted the project at an 85% aid rate. The cost was then stated as IR£14 million. The contract to deliver the mini CTC project was terminated in June 2001. Costs of €21.4 million had been incurred under the contract. The board of CIE approved, in December 2001, a revised proposal to deliver a mini CTC signalling system, using in-house resources. The estimated cost of delivering the revised project is €44.4 million. I am informed by Iarnród Éireann that the mini CTC system on the Galway line is due to be completed in June 2003, with the Waterford, Tralee and Sligo lines due for completion in August 2004, March 2005 and December 2005 respectively.

          <p eId="para_1611">The Government road safety strategy 1998-2002 provided for the implementation of a penalty points system in support of road safety enforcement. The legislation necessary for this measure was passed by the Oireachtas in March 2002. The penalty points system will be operated through the national driver file which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I understand that the software supporting the national driver file has been amended to accommodate the penalty points system. Before the system can become fully operational the national driver file must be supported by the IT systems of the courts and the Garda. The development of these IT systems and the awarding of contracts for this work is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I understand from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that work on the necessary Garda IT systems to support full implementation of penalty points is under way and is planned to be completed by the end of 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1612">Penalty points will be applied in respect of a wide range of minor offences, the commission of which have a potentially negative impact on road safety. These include excessive speeding, red light running, poor lane discipline, non-compliance with stop and yield signs and a number of offences relating to vehicle safety and driver licensing. Excessive speed is recognised as the most significant contribution to road accident causation and has already been the subject of significant investment in enforcement measures by An Garda Síochána, with over 345,000 speeding notices issued in 2001. The importance of achieving safer speeds is recognised as a key priority of the current road safety strategy.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_100">Accordingly, I have ordered that the highest possible priority be given to the introduction of penalty points in respect of speeding offences on a stand alone basis. Work is at an advanced stage in putting arrangements in place for the limited operation of penalty points and I expect this system to be operational by the end of this month. To facilitate the operation of this system, it has been necessary to engage a data processing company to capture manual data from An Garda Síochána and the courts and convert it into an electronic format which can be transferred to the national driver file. The tendering process for the award of the contract to a data capture company is at an advanced stage and I expect a contract will be awarded shortly. Meetings are being  arranged with the appropriate authorities in order to develop a public information programme which will commence shortly.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1618">The proposal to develop a metro in Dublin forms an essential part of the Dublin Transportation Office (DTO) strategy document "A Platform for Change 2000-2016". The DTO considered that a metro based system, as distinct from a heavy rail link, represented the best option for serving Dublin Airport with a rail-based public transport link. The DTO estimated the capital cost of the metro at €7.2 billion in 2001 prices. In January 2002, the Government approved the commencement of the procurement process for phase one of the Dublin metro involving a line from Dublin Airport and Blanchardstown to the city centre and Shanganagh. The metro is to be developed by the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, as a public private partnership. The RPA has been carrying out all the necessary preparatory work for phase one and a notice requesting expressions of interest was placed in relevant publications in April of this year. Over 30 responses were received from interested companies and consortia. The RPA subsequently carried out a market consultation exercise with the respondents. The RPA is now developing the business case for phase one of the metro. The business case, which will include a cost benefit analysis, a financing model, system and route options, and the estimated cost over the lifetime of the project, is to be presented to me in the coming weeks and I will then assess these proposals.</p>

          <p eId="para_1620">The maximum fine applying to the offence of illegally parking in a disabled persons parking bay provided for under the Road Traffic Acts is currently €19, which is the general penalty that applies to the majority of offences under these Acts. The determination of the actual fine to be imposed in each particular case is a matter for the courts. The Road Traffic Act 2002, which was passed by the Oireachtas in March, provides for major increases in certain financial penalties for road traffic offences including an increase in the general penalty to €80.</p>
          <p eId="para_1621">The offence of parking illegally in a disabled person's parking bay currently comes within the scope of the on-the-spot fines system. The amount of the on-the-spot fine applicable to this offence is currently €19, which is the level that applies to the majority of parking offences. Where an on-the-spot fine notice is issued, it is open to the person to whom the notice is addressed to pay the relevant amount so as to avoid the matter proceeding to court. The Road Traffic Act, 2002 provides for the replacement of the current on-the-spot fines system by a fixed charge system. This new system will bring greater certainty to the application of administrative charges for the majority of traffic and parking offences. It will feature, in particular, a provision through which the original amount of the fixed charge will automatically increase by 50% where payment is not made within 28 days of the date of the original notice. The introduction of the new system will not affect the right of the accused person to allow a matter proceed for hearing in the District Court.</p>

There  has been a 23% increase in Dublin Bus peak hour capacity since the start of the NDP as a result of the delivery of 334 new buses and Bus Éireann has increased peak capacity by 40% on all main corridors into Dublin. The DTO receives a grant from my Department for traffic management and bus priority measures in order to implement a quality bus network throughout the greater Dublin area. Currently, nine QBCs have been implemented, amounting to 98 km of bus priority. Three entire QBCs remain to be developed. Dublin Bus, Dublin City Council and the DTO are collaborating successfully to ensure delivery of targeted QBC services. To date the QBC strategy has been a success. I understand that, since the introduction of QBCs, Dublin Bus patronage on QBC routes has shown a 38% increase overall in the peak period.

          <p eId="para_1634">The current framework for development of rail services in the greater Dublin area is set out in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and A Platform for Change, the Dublin Transportation Office Strategy for 2000-2016. Over the last number of years there have been significant developments in rail-based public transport in the greater Dublin area, and further enhancements are also planned. Progress to date includes a 50% increase in DART capacity as a result of the introduction of 38 additional DART cars, and 100% increase in the capacity of the Maynooth line as a result of doubling of the track and provision of additional carriages.</p>
          <p eId="para_1635">Over the next two years, it is anticipated that morning peak capacity will have increased on key rail commuter lines from 30,000 in 2000 to 47,000 in 2003. This will be achieved through the following planned investment: Entry into service of 80 additional diesel railcars, the first batch of which will be delivered next month; €117 million investment in Heuston Station between March 2002 and mid 2003 to provide four additional platforms, a signalling system upgrade, and increased track capacity which will enable the station to handle extra mainline and commuter trains, particularly at peak times; Kildare line upgrade to enable a 130% increase in peak hour suburban capacity by end 2003. An additional programme of investment is being developed for investment in suburban rail for the period beyond 2003 in respect of the DART upgrade, Maynooth and Kildare lines, which will further expand rail capacity to meet the needs of the greater Dublin area. In addition, commencement of Luas services will provide passenger capacity of approximately 13,000 per direction per hour. Finally, the proposed metro, as envisaged in A Platform for Change, will have a major role in alleviating congestion by providing higher public transport capacity that offers an attractive alternative to the private car. I look forward to receiving the outline business case for the first phase of the metro from the Rail Procurement Agency shortly.</p>

          <p eId="para_1637">The National Development Plan 2000-2006 envisages  significant private sector investment in national road development: it is proposed that some 23% of the €6.75 billion investment in national road improvements under the NDP is to be contributed by public private partnership financing based on user tolls. User tolls are now in widespread use throughout the developed and developing world and are particularly favoured where rapid expansion in major road networks is required. They are a considerably more widely used instrument of roads financing than shadow tolls and more readily permit the transfer of economic risk, which is desirable in PPP projects. While the use of shadow tolls has not been ruled out, road user tolling is, on the basis of the above considerations, more likely to be relied upon in the earlier stages of national roads PPP development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1638">Toll-financed road PPPs will attract private sector funding and aim to ensure earlier delivery of badly needed national roads infrastructure. Through PPPs, private sector innovation will be harnessed in the areas of scheme design, construction and long-term operation and maintenance. As regards the system of tolling to be used, I have already publicly stated that my strong preference is for a method that utilises the most up to date electronic technology to ensure that there is rapid movement of traffic through the tollbooths and traffic tailbacks are eliminated. I have discussed the need to incorporate the electronic tolling system on all proposed toll roads with the National Roads Authority and I intend to continue these discussions over the coming months. I am confident that the modest level of the tolls to be charged, combined with the high quality of the new roads and the greatly improved transport service they will provide, will ensure that the routes are attractive to the vast bulk of inter-urban traffic. Good progress has been made in the roll out of the NRA's PPP programme and four projects – Kilcock-Kinnegad, Waterford city by-pass, Dundalk western by-pass and Fermoy by-pass – are at tender stage. The NRA is also examining the scope for extension of its PPP programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1639">The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws, and to enter into toll agreements with private investors is vested in the National Roads Authority under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000). Road authorities have similar powers in relation to the tolling of non-national roads. Toll charges are determined in accordance with procedures contained in the Roads Act 1993 which provide for public display-consultation of proposals to apply tolls and the holding of public oral hearings in the event of objections being made on toll scheme proposals. I have no responsibility in relation to these matters.</p>

          <p eId="para_1642">I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 235 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1643">As I indicated in my response to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 1260, 1261 and 1288 on 9 October last, I am pleased to note that, barring some unforeseen events, Aer Lingus is on track to make a profit of around €40 million this year, compared to its original projection of losses for the year of €27 million in the survival plan and an operating loss of €50.4 million before exceptional items in 2001. This performance in 2002 is a reflection of the successful implementation of the survival plan measures required to achieve significant cost reductions. These included a reduction of over 2,000 in staff numbers since last September; extensive work practice and other changes; a pay freeze in 2002 and 2003 and the sale of non-essential assets and non-core subsidiaries. This turnaround in performance is a direct consequence of the very clear and committed efforts of the board, management and staff in addressing the serious situation which faced the airline in 2001. I want to put on record my appreciation of all their efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1644">However, I must stress that the competitive and changing nature of this industry requires the airline to continue to focus on cost reductions and efficiency improvements. In this regard, the airline has already embarked on a further series of cost cutting measures which are essential to its future performance potential. Unless this effort continues unabated and the airline builds up its reserves, it will remain vulnerable to market forces and particularly to unexpected economic and other external shocks. I am optimistic, however, given the new focus in the airline combined with the lower cost base and greater flexibility that the airline will be in a better position to respond to market opportunities which may arise.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_102">We have seen clear evidence of this in the fact that, despite the difficulties of the past year, Aer Lingus has commenced operations on five new routes, with a further four planned to commence from end October 2002, all from within existing resources. I am assured that the company will continue to monitor opportunities for new and profitable services going forward. In addition to lowering fares for the leisure market, the airline has recently announced a further major reduction in the cost of air travel to benefit business travel lers to the tune of €65 million. Aer Lingus advise that this will involve the provision of a product to its customers, at a price they are prepared to pay, for a service better than its competitors in terms of quality, punctuality and airport locations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_103">With regard to the future of Aer Lingus, the Deputy will be aware of the previous Government's decision in October 2001 to facilitate private sector and staff investment in the company to support its future development provided the survival plan was fully implemented. In the context of the survival plan, a framework was agreed between all parties last December in relation to an increased staff shareholding. I am hopeful that talks in relation to this matter can be successfully concluded in the near future. My primary concern in recent months has been to see a viable and flexible Aer Lingus taking shape which is able to compete in the volatile and changing aviation market. In the near future, I will be looking at the funding requirements of the airline taking account of the Government decision on investment in the company. I will be meeting the board later this month to review the airline's performance.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1646">Iarnród Éireann has a statutory responsibility to manage its railway safely. The company has assured me that all railway services on its network operate to strict standards, which are in place to ensure the highest level of safety for its customers and staff. This Government places the highest priority on the safety of our railways and is carrying forward two very important railway safety initiatives started by the previous administration. These initiatives, when complete, will greatly enhance the safety of our railways.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_106">The first of these initiatives is the railway safety programme which was approved by Government in March 1999. This safety investment programme involves investment of €546 million over the five years 1999 to 2003. This programme has seen over €400 million invested to date and has transformed many parts of the railway, replacing 246 miles of track with continuous welded rail, permanently closing or making safer 371 level crossings and renewing 228 bridges. Significant funding has also been made available for works to cuttings and embankments, fencing and improvement of safety management systems. I also intend to seek the approval of Government  in the near future for the re-convening of the railway safety task force to make recommendations for a new five year railway safety investment programme to commence in 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_107">The second of these initiatives is the Railway Safety Bill which was published in December 2001. This Bill, when enacted, will modernise the railway safety regulatory framework by establishing a railway safety commission to regulate and enforce railway safety and investigate railway accidents. The Bill also places duties on railway undertakings, their staff and third parties and requires railway undertakings to put in place formal safety management systems. The Second Stage reading of the Bill is scheduled to commence in the House tomorrow.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1648">The provision of road traffic signs is a matter for each road authority under section 95 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961. That section provides that all traffic signs must be in accordance with traffic signs regulations in the case of all regulatory signs or, in accordance with directions under section 95 (16) of that Act in respect of all other traffic signs. The current parameters set for local authorities for the provision of traffic signs can be found by reference to the Road Traffic (Signs) Regulations of 1997 and 1998 and the traffic signs manual published in December 1996, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_108">Dublin City Council's proposed orbital route directional signs were not consistent in terms of sign design, content and colour coding with the relevant provisions of the traffic signs manual. The maintenance of consistency and uniformity of traffic signs generally is particularly important from a road safety perspective and given the attempts at international level to ensure that colour combinations in signs are reserved for particular purposes. At a meeting between senior officials from my Department and the Dublin City Council on 27 August 2002, the city council accepted that its proposed orbital signage system did not comply with the relevant statutory provisions. However we agreed that the concept that underpins orbital signage for Dublin has merit and should be advanced. Accordingly, my Department is currently engaged in a consultative process with the city council, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the National Roads Authority for the purpose of determining appropriate criteria for the develop ment of such a system of signage. If the city council's new proposals require to be supported by amendments to the traffic signs regulations or the traffic signs manual, I will give positive consideration to such amendments.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_109">The cost of the provision of road signs is a matter for each road authority. I understand that the programme for the provision of the orbital signage system was at an early stage of development and that the Dublin City Council had not engaged in any significant level of expenditure. The city council's initial step involved the manufacture and installation of only 10% of the total number of the new signs that would be required. It is not proposed that my Department would meet the cost of the removal of these signs.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1650">It is my policy that Irish Rail should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility for the mobility impaired within the overall resources available to them. The DART and Arrow suburban rail services are wheelchair accessible over most of the network and the new railcars that Iarnród Éireann is currently introducing for these services have a number of additional accessibility features. With the exception of the services operated with the 1960s vintage Craven carriages, all mainline rail services have at least one carriage which is accessible. The Craven carriages will be phased out over the next three years or so as new wheelchair accessible rolling stock comes on line. The new rolling stock will be designed to meet the most up to date accessibility standards. A total in excess of 180 rail carriages for DART, Arrow suburban and InterCity services is expected to be brought on stream over the next few years at which point practically all IE services will be accessible. All station upgrades and new station developments take into account the needs of the mobility impaired. There is an ongoing programme in place to provide either ramps or lifts at stations to make platforms accessible and other accessibility improvements are also undertaken when stations are being refurbished.</p>

          <p eId="para_1655">Under Section 17 of the Roads Act, 1993, the National Roads Authority has overall responsibility for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and maintenance of national roads. The Minister for Transport, and formerly the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, appoints the members of the authority, is responsible for the payment of block grants to the authority, certain broad policy matters, and until 2000 performed quasi-judicial functions such as the approval of motorway schemes and road developments the subject of environmental impact statements. Under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, the above quasi-judicial functions transferred to An Bord Pleanála. The Minister for Transport is answerable to the Houses of the Oireachtas as regards the functions vested in him.</p>
          <p eId="para_1656">The policy framework for the improvement of national roads is set out in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, together with the Community Support Framework and the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme. Within this framework, it is a matter for the NRA to prioritise and schedule individual road improvement projects and to progress them in co-operation with local authorities. The Minister has no function in relation to the day-to-day administration and management of the work programme on national roads or in relation to the allocation of funds for individual projects. This division of responsibility has been approved by the Oireachtas and enshrined in legislation passed by both Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1657">The NRA's annual report and accounts must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the accounts must be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.

In addition to oversight by the Public Accounts Committee, the NRA is also periodically called before Oireachtas Committees as regards its operations and general stewardship of the national roads network. These arrangements afford reasonable opportunities for Deputies to question the NRA about its day to day operations.</p>

          <p eId="para_1668">The Government consultation paper, A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport was published in September 2000. This paper set out the Government's proposals for institutional and regulatory reform of the public transport system. One of the key proposals in this paper was the establishment of an independent market regulatory function for public transport and the gradual opening up to competitive tendering of all bus services in the greater Dublin area. I am currently engaged in a round of meetings with the social partners and other interested parties. I will consider their views and consult further with the Public Transport Partnership Forum prior to finalising my proposals for Government on regulatory reform in the greater Dublin area. With regard to market regulation of provincial city and inter-city services, I have recently received a consultants' report which was commissioned by my Department on the regulation of bus services outside the greater Dublin area. I will launch a public consultation on this report shortly. I will finalise my proposals for reform of the regulatory regime in the bus markets outside Dublin once that consultation is complete.</p>

          <p eId="para_1671">The Government, in April of last year, published a consultation paper on institutional arrangements for land use and transport planning in the greater Dublin area. The consultation paper proposed  that a new greater Dublin land use and transport planning body be established, which would have responsibility for strategic regional land use and transport planning and have statutory powers to supervise and ensure implementation of strategies and programmes by all implementing agencies. The consultation document had envisaged that it would also act as a public transport regulator for the greater Dublin area, and be responsible for the allocation of funding to implementing agencies, including local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1672">The consultation paper indicated that local authorities would continue to be responsible for preparation and adoption of local development plans and making decisions on individual planning applications and the implementation of transport infrastructure projects within their remit. The paper also proposed that the new body would have powers similar to those available to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government under the Planning and Development Act, 2000 to ensure compliance with the regional land use and transport plan. During the consultation period, a total of 57 submissions were received by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Work is proceeding in the Department on the preparation of legislation taking into consideration the views expressed during the consultation process. Since coming to office, I have been reviewing the proposed legislation and I hope to be able to conclude these considerations without delay.</p>

          <p eId="para_1677">Iarnród Éireann informs me that since 1997, 52 miles of the line between Athlone and Westport have been renewed at a cost of €33 million. A further 15 miles are programmed for renewal this year at a cost of approximately €14.9 million and 13 miles are planned for 2003. This will complete the work on upgrading the line to Westport. When completed, total investment on the Athlone to Westport section of the line alone will have amounted to approximately €60 million. The levels of service and the rolling stock allocated to individual lines is an operational matter for Iarnród Éireann.</p>

          <p eId="para_1679">I understand the Deputy's question refers to the former Department of Public Enterprise Vote. As the Deputy will appreciate, this Vote is in the process of being revised to reflect the changes in Departmental functions following the setting up of the Department of Transport with effect from 19 June 2002. The information requested by the Deputy is contained in the following table, but this relates to expenditure which is now the responsibility of four Departments. In the circumstances, I am not in a position to anticipate a year end figure with reference to the original Vote. However, in respect of the areas for which I have responsibility in the Department of Transport, I expect expenditure to come in on target. Any overruns which may occur on particular programmes will be met by savings elsewhere.</p>

          <p eId="para_1812">Education and information is recognised in the Government road safety strategy 1998-02 as being vital to forming good road safety habits. The National Safety Council was assigned the lead role by the Government strategy for road safety for the development of road user awareness and educational campaigns, targeted at the safe use of roads generally. The current council programme for public awareness is fronted by three major media campaigns on road safety awareness and education, which includes "Thump"– anti speeding, "Shame"– drink driving and "Damage"– seat belts. These are the three areas prioritised for action in the Government's road safety strategy. In addition, the council concluded an agreement with RTE television earlier this year to broadcast educational filmlets at peak viewing times in the summer-autumn 2002. Four new filmlets encompassing roundabouts, two, motorways and overtaking manoeuvres have been produced for  this purpose and are designed to highlight safe driving practice in these key areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1813">The National Safety Council is also responsible for the promotion of road safety to both primary and secondary school pupils, who are the adult road users of the future. The question of introducing a road safety and driver education syllabus into the schools is currently being examined by the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, NCCA, who have commissioned a study of the issue at the request of the Minister for Education and Science. In addition the council regularly targets young drivers in its public media campaigns. In addition to promotional and educational campaigns, regulations have been made which provide that first time provisional licence applicants must undergo the driver theory test before they can obtain a licence to drive. The theory test has been in place since 11 June 2001 and is designed to encourage a deeper and more structured understanding by novice drivers of information and behaviours which will assist them to become safer drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1814">Under the Road Traffic Act, 1994 the power to decide the speed limit which applies to individual roads within an area rests with the relevant road authority, in consultation with the Garda Commissioner and with the consent of the National Roads Authority in the case of national roads. Road safety is a major consideration in the application of speed limits. However, there is a general obligation that a vehicle shall not be driven at a speed exceeding that which will enable its driver to bring it to a halt within the distance which the driver can see to be clear. Enforcement of speed limits is a matter for the Garda Síochána.</p>

          <p eId="para_1820">I assume the Deputy is referring to the provision in the programme for Government which states that, as part of the process of continuing to transform Aer Rianta, we will ensure that Shannon and Cork Airports have greater autonomy and independence. I have arranged to meet the group of unions in Aer Rianta on Monday next, 21  October and I look forward to hearing their views on this proposal and other matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1821">A debate has now been stimulated by me both within the Shannon and Cork regions and at a national level on the best ownership structure for these two airports going forward. I visited both Shannon and Cork recently to further stimulate this debate. As the Deputy may be aware, I have already made it clear publicly that the issue for Shannon and Cork is being considered solely in the context of continued State ownership of those airports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1822">There is a genuine sense of goodwill towards the airports in the two regions on the part of local tourism and business interests and views may differ on the best way forward. However, I will listen carefully to the views of all interested parties, including those of the unions in Aer Rianta, before framing proposals to bring to Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_1831">The consultants' report ‘Evaluation of Investment in the Road Network', which was published recently, is available on the national development plan website www.ndp.ie or from the NDP-CSF evaluation unit, Frederick Buildings, South Frederick Street, Dublin 2. Telephone 01-6045333. Arrangements are also being made to place the report in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
          <p eId="para_1832">The cost of the national roads programme has increased for a range of reasons including construction cost inflation and higher land costs. The benefits of substantial capital allocations to NDP projects by government have consequently been eroded to an extent. However, I am pleased to note that the rate of construction price inflation is now abating from a peak of 12% per annum, over the period 1998 to 2000, to 9% in 2001 and a projected 5% in 2002. I expect this trend will continue in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1833">Completion of the NDP programme will be dependent on funding levels and the prevailing budgetary and economic situation over the coming years. The Government is committed to strong promotion of the NDP national roads programme and to maintaining a high level of investment in the national road network. Already, the funding for national roads in the period 2000-02 is approximately 12% in excess of the planned NDP profile.</p>
          <p eId="para_1834">The programme outlined in the NDP remains a valid framework for upgrading our national road network and we are now considering how the programme can best be pursued having regard to the increased costs. A programme of this ambitious scale over a seven year period is inevitably subject to change and adjustment to take account of changing economic and budgetary conditions. The revision of the economic and social infrastructure operational programme would be premature in advance of the mid-term evaluation of the NDP which will be carried out in 2003.</p>

In these circumstances, I have no plans to introduce an aid package.</p>

          <p eId="para_1937">I met with Commissioner Fischler in Brussels last February and in Luxembourg last June to put forward my views prior to the publication of the Commission's proposals on the mid-term review of Agenda 2000. On 10 July 2002, the European Commission published a communication on its mid-term review of the Common  Agricultural Policy. The communication has been discussed in the Council of Ministers in July, September and October. It is expected that the Commission will bring forward detailed proposals after consultation with the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. Discussions on the detailed proposals are likely to continue until well into 2003. I have told the Commissioner and the Council of Ministers that I will not agree to changes to the Agenda 2000 agreement arising out of the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy which will impact negatively on the Irish agriculture and food industry. Apart from the ongoing discussions in the Council, I hope to meet Commissioner Fischler again before decisions are taken in the Council.</p>

Since then, intensive efforts at Government level, politically, diplomatically and technically, resulted in the Egyptian authorities re-opening their market to Irish beef imports in October 2001. The decision by the Egyptian authorities to lift the ban on Irish beef imports was a welcome development for Irish cattle and beef sectors. The recent introduction of a special export refund rate of up to 30% above the normal level should help Irish exporters regain a strong presence on this important and traditional market for Irish beef.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1963">Section 18 (2) of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act, 2000 provides that each year there shall be paid into the national pensions reserve fund, in equal quarterly instalments, a sum equivalent to 1% of GNP.</p>
          <p eId="para_1964">The national pensions reserve fund was established on 2 April 2001 with €6,515 million being allocated to the fund. This sum comprised the net proceeds of the sale of the former Telecom Éireann and 1% of GNP in 1999 and 2000 as well as interest earned on same.</p>
          <p eId="para_1965">A total of €972 million, representing the 1% of GNP contribution was paid into the fund in 2001. The first three quarterly payments of 2002, amounting to some €775 million, have already been made this year and the fourth payment of €258 million will be made in December. Thus, to the end of September 2002, total payments into the fund amounted to €8,262 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1966">The fund is managed by commissioners who are independent of Government. They control and manage the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement an investment strategy for the fund. This investment strategy is based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long-term, having regard to (a) the purpose of the fund as set out in section 18 (1) of the Act, and (b) the payment requirements of the fund as provided for under section 20, provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1967">In this regard, the commission's report stated that the fund would be invested 80% in equities and 20% in bonds. As the investment strategy is designed with long-term returns in mind, short-term losses which may never be realised cannot be taken as an indicator of fund performance. The commission is required by law to submit to me an annual report and the next such report is due around mid-2003. At the end of 2001, the total value of moneys standing to the credit of the fund was €7,715 million which included interest earned on the contributions to date. According to the 2001 annual report submitted to me by the commission, the fund earned a return of 3.27% for the period to 31 December 2001 compared to a short-term benchmark return of 3.24%, and a long-term benchmark return of 3.5%.</p>

      the revenue raised from undisclosed offshore accounts, distinguishing the elements of tax, interest and penalties; the institutions the payments were made by; and the type of liability which properly falls on the financial institutions and on the individuals in these cases.

          <p eId="para_2003">However, separate records are kept in relation to two particular high-profile instances of evasion related to offshore accounts. These are the National Irish Bank cases involving the Clerical Medical insurance company in the Isle of Man and the Ansbacher cases which have a Cayman Islands connection. Recoveries to date for these two categories of cases are shown in Table 1 – broken down between tax, interest and penalties, and payments on account.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_129">This investigation by the Revenue Commissioners involved two phases: first, the DIRT look-back audits of financial institutions which collected some €220 million from the financial institutions; second, pursuing the payment of tax liabilities which relate to funds deposited in bogus non-resident accounts, "underlying" tax. This second phase commenced with a voluntary arrangement for bogus account holders to voluntarily disclose "underlying" tax liabilities by 15 November 2001, which yielded some €227 million and is continuing with the ongoing pursuit of underlying liabilities of the remaining bogus account holders. A breakdown between tax, interest and penalties for the first phase and the initial stage of the second phase is shown in Table 2.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2146">Ethiopia is one of the least developed countries in the world – it has a population of over 67 million people, nearly half of whom are living on less than US$1 per day. This is reflected in development indicators such as HIV prevalence, maternal mortality and life expectancy rates which rank among the worst in the world. As a bilateral development partner, Ireland Aid is sup porting the government of Ethiopia in the implementation of development programmes aimed at addressing poverty and disadvantage. Over 20% of Ireland Aid support is directed at programmes to improve health and prevent the further spread of HIV-AIDS. Ireland Aid support for these activities is directed through both Government and non-governmental organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_2147">Ireland Aid has provided 2.5 million Ethiopian birr –€299,828 at present exchange rates – to 16 Ethiopian NGOs based in the Tigray and in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Regions as part of a pilot programme for combating HIV-AIDS.</p>
          <p eId="para_2148">This pilot programme is managed on behalf of Ireland Aid by the Christian Relief and Development Association, the umbrella body for NGOs in Ethiopia. It aims to complement the government of Ethiopia's HIV-AIDS interventions through community-based interventions by civil society organisations. It also supports civil society organisations active in areas where there are government of Ethiopia capacity limitations and where there are no HIV-AIDS interventions being implemented in the two regions. The focus is on community-based care interventions for people affected by HIV-AIDS. Support is also provided to innovative, grassroots-based prevention activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_2149">Of the Ireland Aid-funded NGOs working in the areas of HIV-AIDS, two are also directly engaged in the sexual and reproductive health aspects. The Ethiopian Family Planning Guidance Association of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region provides training on sexually transmitted diseases and mass education on family planning. The Ethiopian Pastoralist Research and Development Association provides training on sexually transmitted diseases and reproductive health for traditional birth attendants. They also distribute delivery kits to traditional birth attendants at the same time.</p>
          <p eId="para_2150">The effectiveness and impact of this pilot project will be reviewed next year and, provided the review's findings are positive, it should be extended and expanded. The embassy of Ireland in Addis Ababa also funds local NGOs through the in-country micro-projects scheme. This year it has provided birr 50,000 –€5,997 – for a media HIV-AIDS awareness project. An application for funding, from a NGO based in a pastoralist area, on increasing public awareness in combating HIV-AIDS and female genital mutilation is currently being considered.</p>

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_2152">In 2002 Ireland contributed €1.84 million to UNFPA – the UN Fund for Population Activities – in support of its work in developing countries in such areas as maternal and infant mortality, HIV/AIDS and reproductive health-care. This represents an increase of 45% in our contribution for last year and is well over double that for 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_2153">Recent reports by the Population Research Institute, a private US body, have alleged that UNFPA supports the Chinese Government's one child policy. There have been a number of US congressional hearings on the basis of these reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_2154">Two separate recent investigations by independent teams, commissioned by UNFPA itself and by the British parliament, examined UNFPA's activities in China in detail and both came to the same conclusion – that the fund is working to encourage China away from coercive policies and is not involved in supporting a one-child policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_2155">The US Administration however, despite the two independent investigations, decided to carry out its own fact-finding mission to China. This mission, which reported in May 2002, also found no support for the allegations made by the Population Research Institute. The report of the mission, addressed to Secretary of State Colin Powell, stated that the mission found "no evidence that UNFPA has knowingly supported or participated in the management of a programme of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation in China" and therefore recommended that the "$34 million which has already been appropriated be released to UNFPA".</p>
          <p eId="para_2156">In the event, the US administration did not accept the recommendation of the investigation team and decided to withhold its financial support from UNFPA. This decision was taken by the State Department which voiced concern <i>inter alia </i>that it was possible that some of UNFPA's activities – such as the funding of computers – might unwittingly be used to support China's coercive policies. UNFPA has vehemently denied this possibility and no investigation to date has found any evidence that this is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_2157">The EU is currently engaged in dialogue with the US on its decision to withhold its funding from UNFPA and on the background to its decision. At the EU development council in May 2002, EU member states reaffirmed the importance of the role of UNFPA in reaching the millennium development goals in the areas of infant, child and maternal mortality and restated the EU's firm commitment to continue to support the fund. The Commission has allocated an additional €20 million to UNFPA.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_136">The Irish Government believes that UNFPA abides by its mandate and is playing an important role, particularly in Africa, in helping some of the world's poorest countries to fight HIV-AIDS and to deal with the challenges of maternal and infant mortality. Recent trends in the level of our contributions to UNFPA are concrete evidence of our  support for both the mandate and the operations of the fund.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_2166">The leaving certificate home economics (general) syllabus has been in existence since the majority of teachers in the system began their careers. The leaving certificate home economics (social and scientific) syllabus was introduced in the 1970s. Clearly, there are changes in society and in education that warrant a change in syllabus at this stage. The elements of the syllabi most in need of updating are in the area of food science and the legislation affecting food, resource management and social studies.</p>
          <p eId="para_2167">Another change, much sought after by teachers who found the old syllabi very difficult to cover in the time available, is a reduction of teaching-time to 180 hours. This has been achieved by a streamlining of content and by the introduction of a strong element of choice. Perhaps the most important change from the point of view of quality of learning and teaching is the new emphasis on practical work in the revised syllabus. It is clear from the above that if my Department were to continue with the old syllabus that is now outdated students would be increasingly badly served by the teaching offered to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_2168">I have previously indicated that the revised leaving certificate syllabus for home economics will be examined in 2004. In-service training for teachers of the revised leaving certificate home economics syllabus has been in place since September 2001. A seven-member support service has planned and delivered a programme which is offered to all teachers. To date, 80% of all teachers of leaving certificate home economics have attended round one of the programme which ran from October to November 2001. So far, about 8% have attended round two of the in-service programme which is running at present and will continue up to 22 November 2002. This face-to-face delivery of in-service training was accompanied by the provision of teacher guidelines by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and by the publishing by the support service of a booklet containing comprehensive guidelines for teachers on the planning, implementation and recording of exemplar course work assignments. Copies of the material used at rounds one and two of the in-service programme are available to teachers on request.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_137">Textbooks based on the revised syllabus are available at present. "Get Living" has already been published by Gill and Macmillan and sample copies have been sent out to all schools. While the book may not be currently available in some bookshops, I am informed that teachers may  order it directly from Gill and Macmillan. Other publishers may also have textbooks available shortly.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_138">Practical work was covered to some extent in round one of the in-service training programme. It is being covered more intensively in round two. It is also very well covered in the NCCA guidelines and in the guidelines provided by the support service. Guidance in this area is also available to teachers through the support service website. In addition, I have asked my officials to ensure that, in the event that the ban is lifted, all necessary arrangements are in place to make up any ground lost by ASTI members either by way of in-service or professional support.</summary>

An assessment is carried out of the likely implications of such developments in relation to the capacity of any existing schools and, where appropriate, the local authority is requested to reserve a site for educational purposes. In this way, every effort is made to ensure that there is adequate existing provision or that timely arrangements are made to extend capacity where necessary. Liaison with existing schools is important also and these would normally alert my Department where the need for additional accommodation is anticipated.</p>
          <p eId="para_2195">In the event that the level of development and population growth in an area indicates a long-term need for primary or post-primary educational provision, a decision is made on the means by which that need should be met.

Temporary or prefabricated accommodation is normally provided to alleviate short-term accommodation needs and it is open to schools to make application to my Department setting out their requirements in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_2208">Support to date for infrastructural investment in Drogheda under my Department's expenditure programmes includes funding made available to Drogheda Port Company for infrastructure and capacity development under the seaports measure of the BMW operational programme. Drogheda is also  one of the target urban areas for the roll-out of broadband infrastructure and services across the regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_2209">An advance allocation of €1.664 million to Drogheda Port Company was approved in December 2001 in respect of the Tom Roe's Point Phase 1 completion development in Drogheda. This is a €6.6 million project and the port company was awarded 40% funding, subject to a maximum of €2.641 million under the infrastructure and capacity sub-measure of the seaports measure of the BMW regional operational programme of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. Further applications for NDP funding by Drogheda Port Company are currently under consideration at my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_2210">In relation to telecommunications, Drogheda is among the priority towns that have been targeted for the first phase of the broadband programme, as outlined below. The provision of telecommunications services is critical to delivery of e-business services. The provision of such services is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Director of Telecommunications Regulation. My responsibility is for public policy in the telecommunications sector within which these companies operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_2211">However, recognising that there are areas of the country that are not as economically attractive for firms to invest in infrastructure and services, my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to facilitate the roll-out of advanced communications infrastructure which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in regional Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_2212">In 1999, under the National Development Plan 1994-1999 and INTERREG II, €26.5 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Thirteen projects which rolled-out broadband nationwide to a value, both public and private funding, of €70 million were supported and have recently been completed. These projects entailed the roll-out of broadband services in the Border, midlands and west region and the south and east region.</p>
          <p eId="para_2213">On foot of submissions received under the first call for proposals in 2000, nine contracts were signed with telecommunications operators in 2001 which will result in additional investment in the regions including Drogheda in broadband infrastructure and increased availability of broadband services for business and residential users. The projects involved are scheduled to be completed by the end of this year and will entail an overall investment of €160 million in broadband infrastructure leveraged from grant assistance of approximately €55 million.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_146">On 8 March 2002, the Government announced a major drive to bring high speed broadband access to 67 priority towns around the country. Phase one of the broadband programme is intended to target a number of key towns, including Drogheda. Under the plan metropolitan area fibre optic networks will be built in these towns  to link up with the existing backbone network in the country. The town links will facilitate consumers, educational establishments, industry and business and provide always on low cost and high speed Internet access which will drive the Government's e-commerce agenda.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_147">The taking forward of further initiatives will depend on the level of funding available to my Department for 2003 which will be determined in the context of the overall difficult budgetary situation.</summary>

On the contrary, to seek to ensure the continued availability of such products that are of appropriate quality and safety, my Department is currently examining proposals from the Irish Medicines Board for the control of these products, the aim of which is to provide the consumer with an assurance that the traditional medicinal products which they buy are: produced to an appropriate quality standard; safe under the recommended conditions of use; can be expected to be effective in the context of their established tradition of use, and are appropriately labelled.</p>

The board immediately provided a relief of pain service. The chief executive officer is confident that full-time dental care will be provided in Mountbellew following the return of the dental surgeon from leave of absence; this is expected in the near future.

          <p eId="para_2245">In the wake of the events of 11 September 2001 in the USA, I established an expert committee under the chairmanship of Professor Bill Hall, director of the virus reference laboratory, to develop a contingency plan which would be activated in the unlikely event of a biological attack in this country. In preparing the plan it was necessary for the committee to identify the level of risk of such an attack. The committee considered that although the risk of a primary attack here was  low, the secondary consequences of an attack in another country was the more likely threat.</p>
          <p eId="para_2246">Based on the recommendations of the expert committee I approved the purchase of specific antibiotics and vaccine which would be required in the event of a biological attack with specific Class A agents. The following quantities were secured: 2.5 million doses of Ciprofloxacin, oral and 16,000 doses of Ciprofloxacin (i/v) for the treatment of anthrax; 600,000 doses of smallpox vaccine for use in the event of a confirmed case of the disease and 20 vials of Cidofovir, anti viral for treatment of smallpox.</p>
          <p eId="para_2247">These products will complement the existing stocks of medicinal products for the treatment of these diseases. There is a considerable quantity of antibiotics and other therapeutic substances against the range of biological agents that can potentially be used in biological attacks. The Irish strategy on smallpox vaccination is broadly based on WHO guidelines which includes the identification of persons with smallpox, the tracing of contacts and the vaccination of these groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_2248">In the event of a case of smallpox occurring, the expert committee contingency planning for biological threats will provide advice on the management of the situation, including the issues of vaccine use and dilution based on the specific circumstances prevailing at the time.</p>

          <p eId="para_2254">The White Paper on Private Health Insurance set out the Government's proposals regarding the corporate status of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. This provided for the establishment of the VHI as a company under the Companies Acts, with full commercial freedom of operation, in the ownership of the Minister for Finance. It also provided for a "once-off" financial injection to facilitate the restructuring of VHI and to enable VHI be considered for authorisation as an insurance company. The Government has not, to date, made such a capital injection. The possibility of third party investment and eventual full sale of the State's interest in VHI, if deemed desirable by the Government, were also addressed in the White Paper.</p>
          <p eId="para_2255">Further to the White Paper, corporate financial and legal advisers were engaged to examine the strategic options for the VHI and they have reported. The advice provided by the consultants, including that relating to the matter of a financial injection, is currently under consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_2256">It remains Government policy to proceed with changes to the corporate status of the VHI within the range of possibilities set out in the White Paper. The Government will determine how this may be best progressed in the context of its consideration of the consultant advice obtained. Ultimately, proposals by the Government for a change in VHI's corporate status will require legislation and will therefore arise for consideration and discussion in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

The target population consists of approximately 136,000 women and it represents about 50% of the national target population. BreastCheck is on target to complete phase one of the programme by December 2002. To end August 02, 91,906 women had been called for screening and 68,184 women have been screened, representing an uptake of 74%.</p>
          <p eId="para_2290">The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and it is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice. The board of BreastCheck has recently submitted a business plan to my Department for the national expansion of the programme. My Department is currently discussing the business plan with BreastCheck and especially the links with the existing symptomatic breast disease services. I have invested substantially in the development of symptomatic services and further development is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_2291">I am also committed to the national extension of BreastCheck and a decision on this will be considered in the context of the overall investment programme for cancer services for 2003. As the Deputy is aware, any woman irrespective of her age or residence, who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_157">I assure the Deputy that my Department is committed to facilitating a reduction in waiting times for routine smear test results. To this end, additional funding has been provided in recent years for the development of cervical cytology laboratories in terms of additional staffing, equipment and the introduction of new technology. Furthermore, my Department has recently approved the piloting of a proposed contingency plan to assist in overcoming capacity problems in the cervical cytology laboratories. This plan involves the contracting out of the analysis of cervical smears to a laboratory abroad subject to compliance with the requirements set out in the December 1999 document, "Quality Assurance Guidelines for the Irish National Cervical Screening Programme".</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_158">Under the National Health Strategy, a commitment has been given to the full extension of the programme to the rest of the country. The experience gained from phase one of the national programme in the Mid-Western Health Board area should be of assistance in the context of implementing this commitment. The process of planning and organising the national programme is a major undertaking with significant logistical and resource implications that requires careful consideration. Accordingly, following discussions with my Department on the matter, the chief executive officers of the health boards initiated an examination of the feasibility and implications of a roll out of the national programme. I understand the chief executive officers will be reporting on the outcome of the examination soon.</summary>

The information in the format requested by the Deputy is not routinely collected by my Department.

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_159">I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services in the Southern Health Board area and on a national basis. In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of €6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which €4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists.  This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. The Southern Health Board was allocated an additional €1.191 million last year for orthodontic services of which €1.032 million was for the orthodontic initiative. Under the initiative, the board proposes tointer-alia, recruit an additional two consultant orthodontists, one of which will be based in Tralee. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has informed me that the board recently advertised this position through the Local Appointments Commission but on this occasion, no eligible applicants applied for the position. The board will again consider the possibility of advertising the post at the earliest opportunity.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_160">Last June, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The Southern Health Board were allocated an additional €0.720 million from this fund and have informed my Department that it expects to treat an additional 246 orthodontic patients who are on waiting lists for treatment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_161">My Department has funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately €1.269 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_162">The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. The introduction of this pivotal grade will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics in the public service. Ultimately, it will address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the service.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_163">This year, my Department expects to fund 11 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 11 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. This is an aggregate of 18 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_164">The training programmes concerned provide a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods and are made possible by co-operation between health boards, health board consultant orthodontists and dental teaching institutions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_165">These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an  auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_166">The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has advised me that at the end of the June 2002 quarter, there were 2,932 patients in orthodontic treatment in the board. This is an increase of approximately 632 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in December 2001. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2337">Arising from the health strategy Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You, one of the key actions for dealing with the public hospital waiting lists was the establishment of the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF. The NTPF was set up in April and referred its first patients for treatment at the end of June.</p>
          <p eId="para_2338">Health boards and hospitals have been asked to identify public hospital patients waiting longest on in-patient lists, so that they can be offered treatment under this initiative. The NTPF is initially concentrating on adults who have been waiting on in-patient lists over 12 months and children waiting over six months. The patients' consent to being treated under this scheme is also sought. Capacity is sourced by the NTPF and patients are referred for treatment. To date capacity has been sourced in private hospitals in Ireland, Northern Ireland and in England. In the current year the NTPF expects to treat up to 2,000 patients and from January 2003 it expects to refer 600 patients per month for treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_2339">To the end of September, 29 patients from the Southern Health Board area have been treated under the NTPF. These patients were referred for treatment from Tralee General Hospital and from the Mercy Hospital, Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_2340">The funding arrangements for treatment under the NTPF differ from the waiting list initiative. The NTPF does not make allocations of funding to the individual health boards. Hospitals who treat patients are paid directly by the NTPF, having regard to the number and type of procedures carried out. Payment is made post-operatively to the treating hospital.</p>

          <p eId="para_2342">Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, the determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged seventy years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_2343">Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_2344">The Government is fully committed to the extension of medical card coverage as set out in the health strategy. This will focus on people on low incomes and will give priority to families with children, particularly those with a disability.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_169">The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in both the acute and non-acute sectors. The review, which has informed the health strategy, has focused primarily on the need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and long term. This year I have made provision for the commissioning of an additional 709 acute beds in public hospitals at a cost of €65 million. Included in the additional 709 beds is an additional 16 beds at Tralee General Hospital representing an additional investment for the hospital of €1.7 million in both capital and revenue costs.</summary>

        </question>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_760">
          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</from>
          <p eId="para_2356">The Government is strongly pursuing the implementation of its Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002, the first ever national road safety strategy to be adopted by the Irish Government. The strategy  has prioritised a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It establishes quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principal of which is to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. Priority is accorded by the strategy to actions targeted at speeding, alcohol, seat belt wearing and vulnerable road users. A timetable for key actions in these and other areas is also set out.</p>
          <p eId="para_2357">The Government strategy is monitored by the high level group on road safety, whose first progress report, July 1999, second progress report, August 2000, and third progress report, July 2001, detail progress with key actions. Copies of all three reports have been circulated to all Deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas Library. A fourth progress report will be published shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_2358">The third progress report shows that real and worth while gains are being made in road safety within the framework of the Government strategy. In addition to the reduced level of road deaths and serious injuries to which I have already referred, the interim targets fixed by the strategy for achievement by 2000 have been well met.</p>
          <p eId="para_2359">Progress is also ahead of target in extending low cost accident measures across the national road network, with 365 schemes completed on the national network by end 2001 with a further 32 approved for 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_2360">Garda enforcement activity has been intensified and improved in accordance with the road safety strategy. Over 345,000 on the spot fines issued in relation to speeding offences in 2001, compared to 175,000 in 1999 and 130,000 in 1998. A pilot scheme providing for the deployment of fixed speed cameras is in operation on four of the main national routes out of Dublin and on the M50. Speed limit enforcement is also being supported by an increase in mobile speed detection, the use of laser speed detection as well as in-car and motorcycle cameras. At the end of 2001, approximately 149,000 on the spot fines had been issued for non-wearing of seat belts since the introduction of this measure in July 1999. The number of detections for drink driving in 2001 increased by almost 53% over 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_2361">The road safety strategy also provided for the implementation of a penalty points system in support of road safety enforcement. The legislation necessary for this measure was passed by the Oireachtas in March 2002. The necessary software amendments to the national driver file to record penalty points and administer the system, have been made. Work is at an advanced stage in relation to the introduction of penalty points for speeding offences, which I expect to be operational by the end of this month.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_173">An essential prerequisite of the development of the next strategy is that a detailed review of the results of the current strategy should be carried out. Accordingly an international expert in the field of road safety has been engaged to carry  out an independent review of the current strategy based on the following terms of reference: review developments and progress made under the current national road safety strategy 1998-2002; place Ireland's performance in an appropriate international context; having regard to recent developments, including relevant international developments, and suggest options for priorities for the next strategy to cover the period 2003-2007, and beyond if considered necessary.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_174">The programme for Government states that a three-year road safety strategy will be developed and will target speeding, drink-driving, seat-belt wearing and pedestrian safety in order to reduce deaths and injuries. The European Commission is in the process of developing a third road safety action plan for the EU and is proposing a primary goal of halving the number of road deaths in the EU between 2002 and 2010. The preparation of the next strategy will take account of the review of the current strategy, to which I have already referred, the commitment in the Programme for Government, and the evolving developments at EU level in relation to the third road safety action plan.</summary>

The line from Manulla Junction to Ballina is also the subject of significant upgrading with the assistance of EU and Exchequer grants. Upgrading the line to Westport will be finished by end 2002, and the section from Manulla Junction to Ballina by the end of 2004. I understand from Iarnród Éireann that no decision has been made to downgrade the line from Limerick Junction to Rosslare.

          <p eId="para_2405">The national development plan sets out a strategic framework for the development of national roads and provides for investment of €6.75 billion in national road improvements over the period 2000-06.

          <p eId="para_2406">The NDP provides for the upgrading of five main inter-urban routes in their entirety to motorway-high-quality dual carriageway standard – Dublin to Border, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford.

          <p eId="para_2407">It is clear that good progress has been made with the development of the national roads network as mandated in the NDP, including on the five key inter-urban routes. Fifteen major schemes, involving 106 km of roadway were completed in 2001, including such major projects as Dunleer-Dundalk (M1) and Southern Cross Route (M50).</p>
          <p eId="para_2408">Over €1 billion, the highest allocation ever, and nearly twice the level of funding in 1999, is being provided to the NRA in 2002 for the improvement and maintenance of national roads. This year work is under way or has been completed on over 20 major projects with a combined length of over 200 kms including the M1-N1 – Cloghran-Balbriggan and Drogheda by-pass; Dublin Port tunnel, N4 – Celbridge Interchange; N7 – Kildare bypass, Watergrasshill bypass, Limerick Southern Ring Road; and on the M50 – South-Eastern Motorway.</p>

          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</from>
          <p eId="para_2412">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 239 and 240 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2413">It is Government policy to encourage as wide a range as possible of reliable, regular and competitive air services to and from Ireland. Efficient and competitive networks of air links are vitally important for developing our trade and tourism sectors, particularly having regard to our island status and peripheral location.</p>
          <p eId="para_2414">A wide range of international destinations are served from the three State airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork with Dublin serving the greatest number of routes. Internally, our public service obligation, regime provides regular air links between Dublin and the regional airports in Kerry, Galway, Sligo, Knock, Donegal and Derry. Shannon-Dublin and Cork-Dublin are also served on a commercial basis. The regional airports in Kerry, Waterford and at Knock also have direct air services to London and Aer Arann recently commenced a direct service from Galway Airport to London.</p>
          <p eId="para_2415">Regarding the State airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork, the policy is to focus on the planning and funding of adequate and cost effective airport infrastructure in line with the projected traffic demands. Each of these airports is a major driver of economic growth and development for their respective catchment areas and indeed for the entire country.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_181">At Dublin Airport, Aer Rianta is well advanced with a comprehensive master planning exercise which will enable the company to plan the development of the airport systematically over the medium to long term for both passenger and cargo handling. In the short term, and subject to planning permission, a new temporary pier to facilitate the rapid turnaround of aircraft will be provided by Aer Rianta in May 2003. The company also has plans to provide a new, permanent, two-story pier at Dublin Airport in due course but I have indicated to Aer Rianta that no contractual or other irrevocable commitments should be made in relation to this permanent facility  pending the outcome of the independent terminal issue which I am currently pursuing. On this latter issue, my Department advertised in August of this year for expressions of interest from parties who would be interested in the concept of providing an independent or competing terminal at Dublin Airport. The responses are due to be submitted at the end of this month and I intend to have the submissions professionally assessed and to make recommendations to the Government before the end of the year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_182">Significant investment has been made by Aer Rianta at Shannon Airport in recent years in developing facilities for passengers and cargo. With the completion of the terminal extension two years ago, Shannon now has capacity to handle up to 4.5 million passengers per annum. This compares with an expected throughput of about 2.3 million passengers at Shannon for this year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_183">Major new investment is now required at Cork Airport to cater for the growth in traffic in recent years and Aer Rianta is well advanced with its plans for a capital investment programme estimated to cost €130 million which will include a new terminal building and a multi-storey car park. This work will take about two years to complete and Aer Rianta's aim is to have the new terminal operational in time for Cork's year as European City of Culture in 2005.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_184">The six regional airports also play an important role in the promotion of balanced regional economic development and the generous support mechanisms for these airports, and for regional air access through the PSO regime, are fully in keeping with the commitments under this Government's new programme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_185">Under the airports measure of the NDP, the first major round of funding was announced earlier this year. A total of €9.2 million, covering the period 2002 and 2003, was approved for projects at the six regional airports which are designed to facilitate improvement works and upgrades to facilities and maintain continued safe and viable operations at these airports. In addition to the NDP allocation, €1.9 million was allocated earlier this year in Exchequer grants to the six regional airports for marketing, safety and security measures.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_186">My Department also administers the operation of the public service obligation air routes in accordance with EU Council Regulation 2408/92. There are six PSO routes linking Dublin with the regional airports in Donegal, Derry, Kerry, Knock, Galway and Sligo.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_187">The award of new three-year contracts for the operation of five of these PSO routes to Aer Arann Express and EuroCeltic Airways Ltd. was announced in July this year. Aer Arann was awarded the new contracts for the Kerry, Galway and Knock PSO routes while EuroCeltic was awarded the contracts for the Donegal and Sligo routes. The Derry-Dublin PSO route is currently operated by Loganair, a Scottish carrier, under a contract that runs until January 2004.</summary>

The targets for Bus Éireann include the purchase of 450 new buses to upgrade rural transport fleets and 110 new buses to improve services in the urban centres outside of Dublin.

          <p eId="para_2433">The designation of special areas of conservation does not in itself give rise to any entitlement to or need for compensation. The European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, however, provide that where consent, other than through the planning system, is refused for an operation or activity, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government shall in certain circumstances  pay compensation, whether to the owner, occupier or user of the land. Refusal of planning permission for development on grounds of interference with an SAC is in principle non-compensatable.</p>
          <p eId="para_2434">Against this background, my predecessor in the nature conservation function, the then Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, undertook earlier this year to engage with the Irish Farmers Association in an examination of compensation and related matters for farmers and landowners in designated special areas of conservation as well as in natural heritage areas and special protection areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_2435">My Department has now received detailed proposals from the IFA in relation to the substance of the review and had an initial meeting with them on 7 October 2002. Further meetings will be arranged to progress the review which will also involve other farm representative bodies as appropriate.</p>

          <p eId="para_2437">I presume the resources to which the question refers are the annual general purpose allocations from the Local Government Fund. Drogheda Borough Council has received substantial increases in these allocations from my Department in recent years. The allocation for 2002 is €3.7 million, which represents an increase of 37.5% over the 2001 baseline allocation and is some 117% higher than the corresponding allocation in 1997. This funding is in addition to other State grants. Local authorities also have access to local sources of income from commercial rates and other fees and charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_2438">In determining the general purpose allocations for 2003, regard will be had to the needs and resources model which amongst other factors takes account of the latest reliable population figures for each authority.</p>

Both schemes are included in my Department's water services investment programme 2002-04 as schemes to advance through planning.

          <p eId="para_2447">The farm assist scheme was introduced in 1999 as an income support scheme for low income farmers. It is a means tested scheme with a different method of assessment, including disregards in respect of qualified children, than applied under the smallholder's unemployment assistance scheme.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_192">The scheme was further improved in two ways from October 2000. Firstly, the child-related income disregards were increased by €126.97 (£100), bringing them to €253.95 (£200), in respect of each of the first two children and to €380.92 (£300), in respect of the third and subsequent children. Secondly, the means assessment rate was reduced from 80% to 70%. I should mention that claimants of farm assist benefit from the improved capital assessment regime which was also introduced in October 2000.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_193">I have received a number of proposals for changes in the farm assist scheme. The question of any changes to the scheme will be considered in the context of the budget considerations.</summary>
