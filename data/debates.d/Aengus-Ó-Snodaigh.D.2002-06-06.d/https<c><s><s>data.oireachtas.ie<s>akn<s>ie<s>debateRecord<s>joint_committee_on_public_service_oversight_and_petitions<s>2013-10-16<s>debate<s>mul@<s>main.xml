          <p eId="para_11">I propose that we write to the petitioner giving her a transcript of what we have done to date and that the Minister's correspondence would be forwarded to her. Given that the social welfare qualification criteria are quite black and white, we should write to the social protection committee requesting that when it is considering any future pension changes or substantial changes to the social welfare code in terms of changing the criteria that it would take into account the need for a lead-in time. We should also write to the Minister asking her that when substantial changes are being made, especially regarding pension entitlement, that sufficient lead-in time is given for those measures to take effect to allow people alter their work practices or contributions to ensure they can qualify if at all possible. People have built up an expectation, especially in terms of their pension. They have worked all their lives. They have an idea what to expect and if that changes overnight or over a short time, they do not have the opportunity to make up the shortfall in contributions, change the number of hours they work or the number of qualifying credits required. In this case that is the least we can do.</p>

          <p eId="para_12">Is that agreed? Agreed. That petition is closed on foot of that proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> The next petition is No. 30/12 from Mr. Des Keane regarding cases of those convicted of capital murder whose death sentences have been commuted by the President with the result that this small group of prisoners do not have any redress to parole or remission. I open up the discussion to the members.</p>

          <p eId="para_14">This is a complex and difficult case for the petitioner but we ask that the committee write to the Minister for Justice and Equality on foot of the Supreme Court ruling of 18 July 2013, which directly affects this particular petitioner because it gave relief to another person. It would appear as if the petitioner in this case, Mr. Des Keane, may be able to get relief under that ruling but we need clarification from the Minister for Justice and Equality. I recommend that we write to the Minister for Justice and Equality to ask him if that Supreme Court ruling applies to all other prisoners serving sentences for capital murder prior to 1990.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">I would like to put on the record that the Tobacco Free Policy Review Group has a very large task before it, which is to try to establish whether a smoking ban should be extended to all public areas such as playgrounds, parks, sporting grounds in education and so on. I am aware that University College Dublin recently voted to have a smoke-free zone so obviously we will have to wait. In writing to the petitioner we might explain to her that this work will take some time. The review group will not suddenly announce something. It will have to take many issues into consideration but at the very least the Minister for Health and his Department are keen to pursue a healthy Ireland policy, which would include banning smoking in public places, but that work cannot be done overnight. That might be made clear to the petitioner.</p>

          <p eId="para_26">We will encourage the petitioner to engage directly with that process. It is the appropriate process rather than this committee. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> The next petition is No. 67/12 from Mr. Liam Tuathail in respect of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010. He states that it is unjust and unfair and that the State is reneguing on contractual agreements.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh<recordedTime time="2013-10-16T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_28">Mr. Liam Tuathail has raised some interesting points but a particular point he has highlighted is that the Pensions Ombudsman fully acknowledges that his contractual rights have been violated but that it was not within their power to overturn an Act introduced by the Oireachtas. Given that, and the other points raised by Mr. Liam Tuathail, it would be appropriate to refer this petition to the parliamentary legal office for consideration and for it to revert to us.</p>

          <p eId="para_30">The petitioner raised his concern that government had failed to intervene to reduce the pensions of former taoisigh and others but it is my understanding that the pensions of former taoisigh have been reduced. Given that this aggravated the petitioner considerably, we might perhaps write to the petitioner and explain when we respond to the rest of the petition that this has happened and give the detail to him.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> The final petition is from Mr. Pat Brady regarding the closure of carpentry joinery at the Institute of Technology Blanchardstown. I have a proposal to make on this. First, we should contact the petitioner to clarify what efforts he has made to engage with the Department of Education and Skills, the Higher Education Authority or the institute to raise these issues of concern because it is required that every petitioner demonstrate that he or she has made every effort within their power to appeal or question something before it comes to this stage. We will clarify that and revisit it next week. At that stage we may write to the Institute of Technology Blanchardstown seeking its perspective and then further consider the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>

          <p eId="para_34">Several issues of concern have been raised. The committee would be minded to address them when we get clarification next week.

          <p eId="para_37">Is it possible to get clarification from the Department of Education and Skills before next week on its review of apprenticeship? The second phase of that was due to start in April. Can we find out what progress has been made and when we are likely to see a report based on that because that will tie into the points raised by the petitioner?</p>

          <p eId="para_39">Perhaps also in preparation for that meeting it might be worth checking what the Higher Education Authority's ruling was at the time this change took place because there has been a great deal of rationalisation by the authority recently. There must be a note of the decision on what happened, which we could take in tandem with whatever comes back from the petitioner next week so that we would be adequately informed and could take our next step with the appropriate information.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> The joint committee will adjourn until next Wednesday, 23 October, when we will meet Mr. Peter Tyndall who has been nominated as the new Ombudsman. That is a very important meeting because it will be the first time that the Houses of the Oireachtas have had an opportunity to engage with Mr. Tyndall about his vision and plans, and to revisit some of the lessons learned from and perspectives of the outgoing Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly.</p>

          <p eId="para_45">He has not been officially appointed. The process is that he must first come before this committee. There is then a resolution of the Dáil and the Seanad following that meeting. That is the procedure. It is a recommendation from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform which is agreed by Cabinet and it comes to us. The secretariat will issue the framework for the meeting, the context in which it takes place, our responsibilities as members and suggestions of the types of issue that we should raise and ask about. We will issue that to members in good time.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">That would be very helpful. I thank the Chairman. It would be incorrect of us to abdicate our responsibility. It would also be incorrect if we overstepped our responsibility.</p>

          <p eId="para_47">That is very true. We will make sure to issue a note to all the members to explain the framework in which we should work. It should be a very constructive and positive meeting. I emphasise that we brought in the outgoing Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, who gave us a perspective based on immense experience over ten years. We might circulate the Official Report of that meeting to members to read over and recap on the points that she made to assist us.</p>
