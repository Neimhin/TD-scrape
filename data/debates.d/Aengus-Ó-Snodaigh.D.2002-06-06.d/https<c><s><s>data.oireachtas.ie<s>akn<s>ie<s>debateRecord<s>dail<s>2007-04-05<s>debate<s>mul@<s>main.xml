          <p eId="para_2">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent public and national concern, namely, the likely disenfranchisement of thousands of third level students in the forthcoming general election due to their inability to return to vote in their home constituencies on polling day, signalled by the Taoiseach to take place on a Thursday; the discrimination against and the alienation of the college population, many of whom will be voting for the first time, by requiring students to travel to the farthest reaches of the country to vote; and to call on the Minister to provide polling stations on third level campuses to ensure maximum participation by students in the democratic process.</p>

        <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_3">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of national importance, namely, the emergence of a gangland culture in Clonmel, County Tipperary, fuelled by drugs and violence.  A local newspaper in south Tipperary recently documented the fact that Clonmel gangs are now using the Internet as a forum to taunt and threaten rivals and to promote a culture of drugs, gangs and violence.  I am sure that Clonmel is no different from any other large town in Ireland.  Accordingly, the House urgently needs to debate this matter.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_14">In respect of No. 18, Britain is a member of the Schengen group and, as a consequence, so is Ireland.  Is the Tánaiste satisfied, on behalf of the Government, that the operation and use of the second generation Schengen information system will give a truly accurate account of the persons entering this country?  There has been some discrepancy in this regard in the past.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_14">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_15">On No. 18, I recall when this was referred to committee only last week that there was an indication that full address of all that is entailed in the Schengen information system mark II would be accommodated.  Yet it is coming back to us here and being pressed for approval without debate.  That is certainly not in line with my understanding of the Government's intent.  As I understood it, there was a cross-party interest in ensuring proper scrutiny of all that is involved, particularly given that data protection legislation that needs to be front loaded to facilitate a further consideration of all that is involved has yet to present.  There is so much involved in all of this.  We should not pass it without further scrutiny and debate.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_16">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_17">Unfortunately, I do not have access to all the committees, any more than Deputy Rabbitte does.  This is the forum to which I have direct access and I would be happy to participate in a full engagement on the floor of this House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Tánaiste" eId="spk_17">
          <from>The Tánaiste</from>
          <p eId="para_18">I understood this matter was debated at length and thoroughly investigated at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights under the chairmanship of Deputy Ardagh.  I wish to correct the impression given by Deputy Ó Caoláin.  What I said was that if it was considered, after it had been debated at committee, that there was a further need for a debate in this House on the issue that this was a matter the House could decide at that point.  It is my understanding that the Deputy's party did not contribute to the discussion of this issue in committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">I appreciate that there are multiple commitments for smaller parties.  However, we agreed we would send this to a committee for detailed examination.  Any Member of either House is entitled to attend meetings of Oireachtas committees and speak with the permission of the Chairman.  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe attended the meeting on behalf of Fine Gael and Deputy Lynch represented the Labour Party.  We cannot have a situation where we must have a full blown debate in this House because people do not turn up at the relevant committee meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">In response to Deputy Kenny's question, we have a common travel area with the United Kingdom.  I cannot put my hand on my heart and say I know exactly how many people are entering and leaving Ireland.  I could only do so if I put people at every crossing point and counted those coming in and out.  That is not possible.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_24">The debate on this Bill has been constructive up to this point.  The Fine Gael spokesperson, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, and Deputy Howlin on behalf of the Labour Party have engaged in a considered debate.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has taken into account several of the relevant points raised by Deputies from these and other parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">However, we have only reached amendment No. 104 out of a total of 171 amendments to this important Bill.  Debate will resume at section 31, out of a total of 53 sections.  One of the sections that remains to be dealt with is that relating to detention.  The Tánaiste said on Second Stage that "we must tread carefully when authorising extensions to detention periods".  He has pointed out before that he sees what he sees and knows what he knows.  This is a fundamental aspect of the Bill and it must be teased out properly and debated thoroughly and fully.  However, it will not be reached under today's proposal, which allocates only one hour for the remaining Stages.  In keeping with the Tánaiste's observation, this is something that requires much further discussion, not only from a political point of view but also from the perspective of ensuring this legislation is teased out properly and fully understood.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">I do not know whether the Tánaiste or Government Whip will agree to allocate additional time today for this debate.  In view of the Tánaiste's comments on Second Stage that this is an area in which we must tread carefully, it would be wrong to have the Bill pushed through without including this issue in the recommitted Report Stage debate.  The Whip should either offer an amendment to today's Order of Business, bring the House back a week earlier on 17 and 18 April or reschedule this debate for 24 and 25 April.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">We do not want a situation where the Government points out the importance of the Bill but does not allow an issue as fundamental as detention to be debated properly.  In view of the Minister's own observations on the matter, I make my proposals to him in good faith.  This is not the way to proceed.  The section on detention will go through without any discussion on the Report Stage recommital.  This is not good enough in respect of an issue as fundamentally important as this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_22">
          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_28">I agree with the observations of the leader of the Fine Gael Party.  This is an extremely important Bill.  All types of corners have been cut in regard to it, putting enormous pressure not only on Opposition spokespersons and their support staff but also on the staff of the Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">Recommitted Committee Stage will resume for one hour, but there are important issues that have not been debated at all, the most important being the potential for sevenday detention.  A distinguished former Attorney General wrote yesterday that this provision is unconstitutional.  It is important that we address these matters in open debate in this House so that there is no doubt, as far as we are concerned, that the law we make is as robust and constitutionally sound as we can make it.  I have tabled an amendment to this section, which I believe will improve it.  As it stands, however, we will not even have a chance to debate it.  That is fundamentally wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">The Tánaiste indicated yesterday that the Dáil would definitely be back after the Easter recess.  Nobody in the House or outside it can say the Opposition has not been constructive.  We have disciplined ourselves in terms of the type of debate in which we have engaged and have made very good progress in constructively remodelling sections of the Bill.  However, we do not know where we stand on many fundamental matters.  For example, the Minister undertook to rethink over night his position in respect of mandatory sentencing.  We have not yet had sight of the Minister's Report Stage amendments and do not know whether section 24 will remain in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">We do not know, as of this minute, what enactments will remain in Schedule 2, whether the comprehensive Schedule currently provided will remain or whether particular provisions will be removed from it.  These are fundamental matters.  I ask that the suggestion from the leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Kenny, to use the time today to conclude Committee Stage and adjourn the debate to allow for a separate Report Stage following the Easter recess be accepted.  This would give everybody time to reflect and it would ensure we provide a robust package to which we can all sign up in response to gangland crime.  This is the proper, fair and sound way to proceed.  I ask that the Tánaiste accept the proposal made in good faith from this side of the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_32">As somebody who has engaged fully in the Second and Committee Stage debates on the Bill, I am opposed to the proposal.  As we teased out this Bill, it became obvious the Minister was not on the sure footing he believed himself to be on.  He undertook to re-examine a number of parts of the Bill, including section 24, and stated yesterday he would consider withdrawing it.  This shows the Minister is floundering.  The more we debate this Bill the more glaring are the problems, the more unconstitutional it appears and the more obvious it becomes we are making a mistake in the manner in which we are proceeding with it in this House.  Enough time is not being provided to adequately debate the Bill.  I support the call that Committee Stage continue today and that adequate time be provided between Committee and Report Stages to allow everybody, including the Minister and his officials, to reflect on what is a fundamental change in our justice system.  I urge that the debate on this Bill not conclude today.</p>

          <p eId="para_49">The Tánaiste speaks today on behalf of the Government.  However, he does not know now whether the Taoiseach intends to dissolve the Dáil on 24 April, the day the House is scheduled to resume.  Neither he nor anybody else can know that; it is the sole prerogative of the Taoiseach.  From that point of view and given normal business including Leaders' Questions, the Order of Business and Private Members' Business will be taken on the day in question, only two or three hours will be provided for Report Stage of the Bill.  This is a fundamentally important issue.  I see no reason the Dáil cannot resume on 16 and 17 April to discuss this matter exclusively.  This would allow for a two day debate on the critical issues outlined by Deputies Howlin and O'Keeffe without interfering with the Taoiseach's prerogative on 24 or 25 April which, with respect to the Tánaiste, neither he nor I can know.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">If the Tánaiste is willing to take Report Stage when the House resumes, I suggest we resume on 17 and 18 April to do so exclusively.  If he has to return from far off climes, he has a duty to do so.  This is reasonable in the context of ensuring a full, open, thorough and comprehensive discussion on a matter which the Tánaiste rightly said is one on which we should tread very carefully.</p>

I acknowledge he has agreed to extend the time for the Committee Stage debate.  However, we believe the proposal in respect of the taking of Report Stage on 24 April is wholly inadequate in terms of addressing the Criminal Justice Bill 2007 and all it entails.  We believe the Dáil should resume prior to 24 April as so much business needs to be addressed.  The methodology employed by the Government, cramming through legislation in the last days of a dying Administration, is not acceptable.  There are many other important matters that also need to be addressed, not least yesterday's publication of the MacEntee report which further investigated the Dublin-Monaghan bombings of May 1974.  Real concerns have been expressed by Justice for the Forgotten.  All the matters surrounding the issue of collusion should be addressed here.  The Taoiseach should accommodate a full debate in the House on these serious matters which arise from the single largest loss of life in all the tragic years that we have now, thankfully, seen consigned to our history books.  It is important to recognise that, 33 years later, many people are still dependent on the Government to elicit the full factual truth of what happened back in 1974.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">Deputy Ó Caoláin raised the issue of debating the report prepared by Mr. MacEntee.  I believe that report deserves time and consideration, and we will have to come back to consider it in this House, however we agree to do so.  When the Deputy calls for a public inquiry into that particular atrocity, he should remember that on 21 November 1974, 21 people were killed in Birmingham.  There was a massive miscarriage of justice and we have never had an inquiry.  People much closer to him know the truth of all that.</p>

          <p eId="para_194">I would like to raise a number of matters.  The Government published its list of legislation on 30 January and it included 25 Bills to be published before the end of this session.  Some 12 or 13 Bills have been published and I ask the Tánaiste to outline for us the number and titles of the remaining Bills to be published up to 24 April, the day the Dáil is due to resume.  In other words, will the Tánaiste give us a list of the remaining 12 or 13 Bills to be published, in accordance with the list published by the Minister in January, before 24 April?</p>
          <p eId="para_195">Is it proposed to give an update on the situation arising from the fact that 40,000 nurses are on a work to rule that will have a serious impact on the health service?  Will the Tánaiste expand on his reference to the MacEntee report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings?  If I understood the Tánaiste correctly, he suggested there would be an opportunity for a debate on this when the House resumes.  Those of us who were around at the time will recall with clarity and sadness the events of those turbulent times.</p>

          <p eId="para_221">The Taoiseach has promised a full debate on collusion.  With the publication of the MacEntee report yesterday, it is clear Mr. MacEntee did not secure access to all the information he would have required to properly report on the matters referred to him, not least owing to the destruction — although I understand the word "cull" has been employed — of material held in Garda files and the absence of files which went missing from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the period since the tragic events of May 1974.  This is a serious matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">Mr. MacEntee's report, in a number of sections, says more in what is omitted than in what appears in the text.  Mr. MacEntee clearly poses a number of serious questions to us.  It is imperative that every effort is employed to establish the full and whole truth.  This can only be aided through full address, in the House, of the issues concerned in the first instance.  At least one full day should be given over to a debate on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  The debate should accommodate the opportunity for Members to put questions.  It should not be confined to a trundling out of statement after statement but must have in-depth engagement with the Tánaiste and Taoiseach representing the two critical ministries, the Department of the Taoiseach and Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>

The day after the publication of the MacEntee report, the relatives and victims, those who have suffered, are still seeking the truth and it is clear that organisations of State, both here and in Britain, are hiding that truth.  We have not got to the truth.  The Tánaiste will shortly be taking to the lampposts of Dublin South-East again, but before he does so, rather than have this issue continue until the autumn, will he tell the Dáil anything to assuage the worry and angst of those who have suffered and the relatives about how he proposes to get to the truth of this atrocity and lay it before the Irish people.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Tánaiste" eId="spk_103">
          <from>The Tánaiste</from>
          <p eId="para_229">I do not want to anticipate a debate by having a half-baked debate on the subject today.  The Dublin and Monaghan bombings were an atrocity and there is every reason to believe that there was involvement at some level of the security forces in Northern Ireland with some of the people involved in that atrocity.  That is a serious and grave matter, which I do not believe anybody now seriously discounts, bearing in mind what we know.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">I am absolutely satisfied that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has given all the knowledge in its possession to successive Dáil committees and to Mr. MacEntee.  It has held back nothing whatsoever.  Therefore, I immediately reject the suggestion that State agencies are trying to hide the truth from anybody.  As the MacEntee report points out, either reports were sent to the Department of Justice by the Garda Síochána and have disappeared or they were never sent.  With regard to that proposition, it is not possible 30 years later for the incumbents in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to throw any more light on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">Mr. MacEntee and the committee in Dáil Éireann considered this issue and took evidence from Ministers in the then Government and senior gardaí of the time as to their recollection of these events.  If they cannot get at the truth, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform by itself cannot go further because it is not in a position to disprove a negative.  All it can say is there is no record in the Department of this material and if it was in the possession of the Department at some stage, it has ceased to be so, in circumstances of which nobody has knowledge — if it was not, that raises other questions.  Those questions fundamentally fall to be answered by the people who were involved in these affairs at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">Different people occupied the different ministerial positions at the time and, at this remove, I am not in a position to say why the Garda investigation was wound down so quickly, what happened to all the papers concerning the investigation or at what level it was discussed in Government.  Only the people who were there at the time can throw light on that issue.  Efforts have been made, as I understand it, to find out as much as possible from them, and Mr. MacEntee has produced his report.  All I wish to say with regard to records in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is that the conclusion I personally have to draw from this, as the present Minister, concerns the need to ensure records are properly dealt with now, regardless of what happened to these records in the 1970s.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">I am not in a position to say what happened in the 1970s.  The people who occupied my position at that time should be in a position to do so but perhaps they are not.  In all good faith, perhaps they are totally incapable of assisting with finding out what happened in this regard.  Let us remember that senior gardaí were called before a committee of this House and asked to explain why that investigation was wound down.  The public heard the explanations, unsatisfactory as they were, given that memory lapses over 30 years are very significant and people's recollection of events is very different.  There is no intent on the part of the Government to conceal or hide anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">With regard to the transnational and trans-Border aspects of this matter, I am absolutely satisfied the Government has done everything in its power to persuade the United Kingdom authorities to yield up everything in their possession.  Whether they have done that to an adequate extent is a different matter, but nobody can level the finger at the Taoiseach and say he has not done his best, meeting after meeting — I have been present at such meetings — to raise this issue and attempt to arrive at the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">The year 1974 was the year of Sunningdale, of this murderous atrocity and of many other atrocities, including the Birmingham bombing and the miscarriage of justice which arose from it.  Looking back over all of these events, the establishment of the narrow factual truth of each and every event is something which most people want but which is sometimes impossible to arrive at.  More and more inquiry into one narrow focus, when other matters are left out of the equation, could sometimes be misleading to the public if it was suggested one could get to the absolute scientific truth 30 years later.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">By way of a footnote to that, I will make the following point.  People sometimes forget that in 1974 there was no extradition between the two parts of this country.  It was the norm in this House in the 1960s and 1970s, and defended across the party divide, that there should be no extradition.  Things have changed dramatically but we should not look back at historical events through rose-tinted glasses.  They were different times and the Government was struggling for the survival of democracy.  To attack the Fine Gael-Labour Government of the time by suggesting it did not deliver an adequate response to those bombs is something which people can have the luxury of doing, but it was in a fight to preserve democracy on this island and to save this country from a conflagration which would have involved tens of thousands of people being killed if certain people had had their way.</p>

          <p eId="para_317">I wish to speak on amendments Nos. 115 to 120.  They are on the point I have made already about mandatory sentences so I will not repeat them except to say that we dealt with firearms in legislation last year.  The fact that we are returning to the issue so soon shows that the Tánaiste does not think we got it right then.  There have been several gangland killings in the meantime but we have not had the chance to allow the legislation that was passed last year take effect and to see whether it had its intended effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">I do not approve of mandatory sentences but I approve of strong sentencing guidelines.  The Judiciary should understand the concerns of the legislation and society on these issues.  Society wants the Judiciary to come down heavy on drug barons and gangs which shoot one another and innocent victims caught in their crossfire or mistaken targets.  That is the basis for these amendments deleting Part 6 until we have reviewed the effectiveness of last year's legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_322">It would be useful to have clarity on these important issues before going into the Easter recess.  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe asked how the two processes for possession of drugs sit together, one for drugs of a value greater than £10,000 or €13,000, and the new provision which is of an extraordinarily different order.  The Tánaiste thought of withdrawing his second proposal which would clarify our determination on this matter.

          <p eId="para_326">As I said yesterday I appreciate the Deputies' point.  There is jurisprudence, particularly in Canada, to the effect that it is possible to have proportionate mandatory sentences which, having regard to the value of the drugs, would be absolute and fixed.  The downside of this as Deputy Howlin says, in a point with which I sympathise, is that it might be interpreted as saying this is a two-tier offence and that between €13,000 and €500,000 there is a no-man's-land where the law exists but does not mean what it says.  If that were the outcome that would be the opposite of what most people in the House would like the law to be, a direction to the Judiciary that the minimum mandatory sentence for significant quantities of drug trafficking is ten years——</p>

The separation of Committee and Report Stages is a slight improvement and it will give everybody time for reflection, but the rushed manner in which the Bill is being taken does not permit adequate consultation and reflection.</p>

          <p eId="para_341">That is as clear a message as I can state, bearing in mind what the Constitution requires in avoiding disproportionate sentences.

This heritage, if that is the right word, is in the car park of the Phoenix Park when it could have been bored and given to a museum.</p>

I assume, if a mandatory sentence is to apply to somebody caught with a firearm in suspicious circumstances, it would apply to a wife who picks up an unlicensed gun kept in the home.  If a person carries out a hijacking or an armed robbery he or she knows what they are doing when they pick up the weapon.  A child aged four years was found recently with a loaded gun.  Are these suspicious circumstances?  What if a person was frightened and could not account for why he or she were in possession of a gun?

          <p eId="para_375">There are a number of firearms offences, namely possession with intent to endanger life, possession with intent to commit indictable offences and possession with a number of other specific intents.  If a garda goes to my house this evening and finds, in my sock drawer, a loaded pistol and there is no explanation as to why it is there, meaning it is my possession rather than, for example, that of a family member, that must be a serious criminal offence.  One cannot ask gardaí to go before a jury and engage in a psychological analysis of the accused to ascertain the actual intent.  If a person has a machine pistol in his or her house it is not necessary for the prosecution to show it was for the purposes of shooting somebody, planning a bank robbery or threatening gardaí.  It is a serious offence in its own right.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">If we are serious about countering the threat of firearms, if not ending their presence, gardaí who find a loaded firearm in somebody's drawer must not be forced to leave the property only able to charge the possessor with not having a licence for it.  Nor must gardaí fail in a prosecution if they are unable to determine why a person has a loaded weapon.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">The offence was brought in to make it clear that people should not possess a loaded weapon.  It is not necessary for the prosecution to prove the exact purpose where it is clear from all the circumstances that the person in question did not have the weapon for lawful purposes, such as where they found it in the street and resolved to bring it to the Garda station the following day.  Once a person crosses the threshold of criminality it is not necessary to prove specific intent.</p>

It can be hard to talk to someone with that wealth of experience, force of personality and enormous presence by virtue of his or her position.  I would like the Tánaiste to outline how this can be done.  It is difficult to do but it needs to be done.  We need to ensure that the public will have a high degree of confidence in this type of board.  I do not necessarily believe that it should merely contain the professional classes, members of which by their nature probably never get mistreated by the Garda.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_390">The issue of corporate governance of the Garda Síochána is important.  For that reason, the Government authorised me to ask Independent Senator Maurice Hayes to establish a group to advise on this area.  He has given me his report, which I have published.  We have also received a report from the Garda inspectorate.  Happily, there was considerable overlap between the two in their approach.  Paragraphs 9 and 10 of the report of Senator Maurice Hayes's group read:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_391">9. A prerequisite for progress, in our opinion, is to get the top structure right.  The present structure of a management group of 15 meeting monthly should be replaced by a more tightly knit and focused executive group meeting weekly under the chairmanship of the Commissioner — this would provide strategic leadership, drive change, allocate resources, set targets, monitor performance and maintain professional standards and managerial efficiency.  It would also free the Commissioner of much of the day-to-day detail and leave him free for the strategic task of leading the organisation through a period of rapid change.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_392">10. Our preferred top structure would comprise a Board of Management, meeting weekly, chaired by the Commissioner with three Deputy Commissioners (one of whom would be a civilian with appropriate experience of finance, HR or change-management in large private or public sector organisations).  We wish to give further consideration to the possibility of providing a review and challenge capacity within the Board at crucial stages in the annual planning cycle by the introduction of two or three persons with relevant experience at a senior level in the private and wider public sector.  We will return to this issue in a later report.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">In response to what Deputy O'Keeffe said, this is not envisaged to be a pale imitation of an authority.  This is an executive board, which meets the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioners weekly to ascertain progress on particular areas, for example, radio communications, civilianisation, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Since the commissionership of Daniel Costigan, the force has always had a garda at its head and a structure with gardaí in the top positions.  This may be acceptable in one sense because it helps it to be a disciplined organisation and it means that people who join the force see they can go the whole way to the top, as it does not have outsiders, an officer class or executive class telling them how to run the force.  I am happy and comfortable with that concept.  However, there is a downside to it.  There are people working in banking, insurance, the public sector etc. who have tremendous experience of operating other large organisations and who could make a great input on an executive basis to assist the gardaí who have come up through the ranks and have been involved from the level of investigating crimes to being in charge of a division of the force.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">This has nothing to do with an independent police authority.  This is a management board that is supposed to assist the gardaí at the top of the organisation to make hands-on decisions to drive the force forward and to drive change.  I am very appreciative of the way in which the Commissioner has driven the process of change in recent years.  The Garda Síochána is tremendously proud of its reputation.  It has had its own way of doing things for a considerable time.  It is difficult and challenging for somebody who has come to the top of an organisation of which he is tremendously proud to announce that he is changing the way it is to be run and is bringing in other people to assist him.  This House owes a huge debt to the present management of the Garda Síochána for its willingness to drive and accept change and be champions of change within the force.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">Deputy Lynch asked me whom I had in mind.  I certainly do not have barristers and solicitors in mind as the candidates.  It could be that some barrister or solicitor might be suitable.  However, it would not be either an indicator or an advantage to be either a barrister or solicitor for this job.</p>

          <p eId="para_401">We have in mind a system of public appointment.  I considered all the possibilities involving some competition.  However, I am sure that a top executive in a bank, chemical company, computer company or whatever would not submit himself or herself to a public examination before the Houses of the Oireachtas and then rejection in some competitive process or to controversy in such circumstances.  One of the problems we have in public appointments is that the more nominally transparent and accountable the process of appointment, frequently the greater the reluctance of anybody with intelligence in their head to get involved in the process.  They do not want people standing up and decrying them in speeches and pointing out that they have a first cousin with a criminal conviction.  They will not go down that road if we have a process equivalent to the American Senate hearings for judges.  They will just say that life is too short to be humiliated in public and have their life turned over in public.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">Of course character background investigations for these people will be required because it would cause great scandal if a corrupt or compromised person was appointed to one of these positions and it would destroy the Government that attempted to do it.</p>

Mismanaging their own time and managing one secretary is about the full extent of their administrative experience.</p>

One need only mention somebody such as my predecessor as Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleason, who has a significant job in the private sector.  However, being a barrister is not a passport to such jobs.  I believe in barristers being sole traders and single, independent, rugged individuals, but that life demands from them that they never really get involved in large-scale administration.  Perhaps the length of the tribunals has something to do with the fact that barristers are taking on roles which are organisational rather than otherwise.</p>

          <p eId="para_410">Yes.  With regard to its composition and who can be a non-executive member, all such legislation appears to carry a standard provision, inserted by the bureaucracy, providing for the exclusion of Members of the Oireachtas from being considered for membership of boards.  I object to that.  It is not that I have an interest in being a member but I believe there are certain circumstances where Members of the Oireachtas, appointed in an open and transparent fashion, could offer a considered viewpoint to some of these bodies.  Subsection (9) provides that a person ceases to be a non-executive member when he is nominated as a Member of Seanad Éireann.  Who has contributed so much in terms of thoughtful analysis and proposals for the development of the Garda Síochána and contributed so significantly to Northern Ireland as Senator Maurice Hayes?  We are providing in legislation that even if we wanted him to be appointed a member of this board, we cannot.</p>

If the Minister believes that at some stage we should have a police authority, this is the time to establish it.  Has the Minister given any thought to the remuneration that would be available to the non-executive members?  It will be subject to discussion between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Finance.  A substantial package would be required to attract the type of person the Minister mentioned, that is, somebody in a top job who is capable of dealing with up to 15,000 personnel and the range of other functions that would have to be undertaken by the management board.</p>

          <p eId="para_422">There are two power points in the current structure, the Minister and the Garda Commissioner.  The Minister is not responsible for operational duties.  He has been accused of directly running the show from St. Stephen's Green but, in truth, he does not.  The operational decisions are made by the Garda Commissioner, who is not subject to democratic scrutiny for operational matters.  If one tables a parliamentary question about an operational matter, one will be told that it is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and the Minister has no responsibility for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Somebody needs to move that forward for the 21st century, where there is an agreed democratic plan and an accounting role.  The Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer.  Will his degree of accountability, even before the justice committee or the new security committee envisaged by the Minister, which I wish to see explained in plain writing, include being open to scrutiny with regard to operational decisions or will it simply be for moneys spent and value for money?  A careful line must be drawn in this regard.  It would be disastrous if either the Minister or the Oireachtas tried to micromanage the operational duties of the Garda.  I would not support such a course.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">For that reason, and having given great consideration to the matter, I am wedded to the concept of a democratic Garda authority giving general guidelines in terms of policing plans and objectives and objectively setting the resource and manpower needs within the democratically determined work programme.  This would be mirrored at local level by the local policing committees which would devise local policing plans.  The plans for Kilmuckridge in my constituency, for example, would be different from the plans for Darndale, while those for parts of Limerick city would be different from those for rural Connemara.  After years of my knocking on its door, there is the beginning of an agreement in the House that the Garda Síochána needs to change structurally and that the current structure is not working.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">We will not have time to deal with those matters today and I do not propose that the Minister read his views into the record of the House today, but he might send them to me over the break.  I am happy that this is a step in the right direction, but I am anxious in the 40 or so minutes left to us to get on to the next sections of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">I do not say this to underplay my concern and belief that the structures and management of the Garda Síochána are principal issues in determining its effectiveness.</p>

          <p eId="para_427">I will set out all the thinking I have done in public and departmental thinking and have a letter saying all these things sent to the Deputy.  I share his passion for reform, which is why I said earlier that the Commissioner, who is in the difficult position of keeping the Garda Síochána functioning and, at the same time, changing it, which is a very difficult position for anybody to be in, has led the process of reform while being in the middle of the battle against crime.  This is not an easy position for anybody to be in and he has done a tremendous job.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">However, there must be change and everybody in the Garda Síochána knows this.  All I will say is that just as the Deputy and I are passionately committed to that proposition, I am equally passionately committed to the notion that there must be accountability to this House for the Garda Síochána.</p>

Generally speaking, his accountability as Accounting Officer is to the Committee of Public Accounts.  There is no reason the Commissioner and the deputy commissioners should not be regular attendees before a policing and crime prevention committee of this House where they are asked about the policing plan, their annual plan and developments that have emerged in the recent past and, without micro-managing them, asked to publicly state whether they agree with the Minister's assertion that they have enough resources.  They would not be brought into conflict with the Minister because, obviously, that would not be desirable, but those kinds of questions would be probed.  For example, they would be asked what resources they have for the national drugs unit.</p>

          <p eId="para_487">There is no evaluation currently.  I went ahead with a number of the joint policing committees in order to get the CCTV systems up and running.  I had boxed myself into a corner as I could not put in a CCTV system without a local policing committee to approve it.  There was a slightly arbitrary approach to decide which places got them.  I hope to roll them out right across the country.  We have seen them in operation long enough.</p>

          <p eId="para_498">Perhaps, but let us suppose that something like that emerged and it was not a matter for the Garda Ombudsman Commission to look at it, I want to be in a position to have an effective means of inquiry to get at the truth of such a matter.  In drafting the Garda Síochána Act 2005, we discovered that we had watered down the scope of our capacity to appoint a special inquiry, in anticipation that the Garda Ombudsman Commission would be carrying out the whole inquiry.  In the Garda Síochána Act 2005, the pendulum swung too far and we did not want to have tribunals and commissions of inquiry on relatively simply, single issue items.  That is what this section is all about.</p>

          <p eId="para_501">The final stages were rushed.  Having said that, the change proposed makes much sense and the particular example quoted by the Minister highlights the need for power being there to inquire into issues like that insurance case.  I have no idea if there is any substance to the report.  In fact, it has been heavily denied.  However, if there is a scintilla of evidence to support the point raised in the article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>, there should be a power to inquire into it fully.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_302">
          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_502">I read this section and I was not quite certain what it was about.  I thought it was just a saver clause to provide a legislative basis for an inquiry into something which happened that was not covered in the rest of the Bill.  However, the matter raised by the Minister should be a matter for the Garda Ombudsman Commission.  If we are to establish a robust system with 100 investigators, then that would be the mechanism to deal with matters like this.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">There may be other matters that would not come under the remit of the Garda Ombudsman Commission, or some matter might be so urgent that the commission would not have the resources to deal with it as a matter of urgency.  Therefore, I have no difficulty with the availability of this clause, but I would not like it to undermine the authority and scope of the Garda Ombudsman Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">I wish to make a point about the issue raised in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>.  Two allegations were made.  The first dealt with Quinn Direct, which has been robustly rebutted with an allegation of forgery.  This is an extremely serious matter and I have no doubt it will take its course and the truth will out.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">The second allegation relates to what appears to be an exclusive arrangement entered into by the Garda Síochána and AXA Insurance.  I am deeply concerned about this and have tabled several parliamentary questions today, which I am sure will be answered.  I understand the pilot scheme in my county, which was supposed to run for six months, is still ongoing.  Having read the report last Sunday, I made some inquiries and discovered that it has been ongoing since the middle of 2005.  Under this arrangement, gardaí must telephone this particular insurance company's designated towing company within 45 minutes in respect of any vehicle bearing its sticker that needs to be towed.  However, a different tower applied through the tendering process to be the official Garda tower for my county and his drivers were vetted by the Garda and so on.</p>

          <p eId="para_508">There is a third issue that should be investigated.  This is the allegation that certain arrangements were made whereby solicitors were engaging in practices not principally to the benefit of their clients but for their own gain.  As a non-practising solicitor, this is an allegation I take seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">What will be the fallout from these three issues?  Moreover, there is a fourth issue in that there has been an allegation of forgery.  What, if any, will be the position of the Garda Ombudsman Commission, which was established under the provisions of the 2005 Act we are now amending?  That commission is not yet operational.  Is there a date for commencement of its operations?</p>

I remind Members that the establishment of a body of this type requires huge preparation.  If the commission were to open its doors before being certain of how it will do its work, it would be discredited almost immediately.  It is independent in making its decisions and the chairman is a High Court judge.</p>

          <p eId="para_512">However, I am not in a position to direct the commission to initiate a particular inquiry.  This means that in a case where everybody in this House sought an inquiry into a particular matter, for example, I might not be able to initiate it.  This is another reason for having an alternative means of inquiry.  The commission might decide it is not its business to conduct a particular inquiry, perhaps because it does not consider it to be as serious as does the Oireachtas or because it takes one view or another of its area of competence or priorities.  In such circumstances, I might be unable to direct that an inquiry be undertaken.  That is what this section is all about.</p>

          <p eId="para_515">The allegations are based, as I understand it, on the allegedly forged document.  I do not know what the Law Society will do about it.

It is yet another instance where we are returning to legislation that was dealt with only a short time ago.  The Minister obviously got it wrong in his own view and in terms of his agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">This section grants significant additional powers to fishery protection officers and the Garda Síochána.  It is included among provisions relating to unrelated issues.  This legislation was presented to the world as being aimed at gangland crime and drug dealers.  Yet, it includes provisions in respect of fishermen.  I do not understand why such provisions are included in this legislation.  I agree we need to regulate the fishing industry and ensure those involved do not break the law.  However, to equate a person who has exceeded his or her fishing quota with a person who brings into this country €500,000 or €1 million worth of drugs or who has shot innocent bystanders is stretching things a bit.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">My amendment seeks the deletion of this section.  If this provision was presented in another format, in a more reasonable fashion which does not seek to decimate the fishing industry by allowing hoover-ships and other countries to denude our fishing stocks, I might have some sympathy for it.  However, its inclusion in this legislation will result in more people being forced out of the industry and to more clashes between fishermen trying to make ends meet and fisheries protection officers who seem to have a habit of going after the smaller fisherman rather than those who have bought, with the benefit of major grants, hoover-ships which are hoovering up fishing stocks in the Atlantic.  The Government and European Union should never have allowed this to happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_534">The Criminal Justice Bill 2007 is trumpeted by the Minister as his answer to gangland crime.  It is extraordinary that in the middle of it are proposals to further criminalise those involved in the fishing industry.  They resent the juxtaposition that arises from their being associated with gangland crime and they have a point.  The notion of equating the committing of an offence by a person who may have exceeded his or her EU fish quota with offences committed by those involved in gangland crimes and drug trafficking is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">The criminalisaton of the fishing community by Government by way of the enforcement of these provisions bears no relationship to the type of technical offences committed.  Currently, the sea fisheries protection officers out-number those involved in the national drugs squad, which is crazy.  The national drugs squad comprises approximately 50 members, not its full complement.  Yet, we have 54 sea fisheries protection officers including 35 current members and the recruitment of 19 new officers.  This is a crazy way of enforcing our laws.  The Minister may respond saying the national drugs squad is assisted by many members from different divisions around the country who also deal specifically with drug crimes.  That is a fair point until one completes the comparison.  Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, the 54 sea fisheries protection officers to which I refer, all 13,000 Garda, all permanent members of the Defence Forces not below the rank of leading seaman and all Customs and Excise officers, working on behalf of Revenue, are classified as sea fisheries protection officers.  The fishing community resents being lumped in by way of this legislation with gangland criminals and drug traffickers given many of the offences committed are technical in nature and should never reach the Criminal Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">Amendment No. 143 seeks to address the point in respect of an attempt to commit an offence.  My argument will be reinforced by my colleague, Deputy McGinley, who also comes from a maritime constituency.</p>

          <p eId="para_539">This Bill was presented as an urgent package to deal with crime as a result of the development of drug gangs in particular and the series of gangland murders that occurred at the end of last year.  That tight focus must be maintained if we are to justify this Bill being frogmarched through the Oireachtas at a rate of knots without an appropriate allocation of time to allow for the checking of all provisions.  There is no need for this provision to be piggybacked into this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">This is a most inappropriate vehicle to deal with changes in maritime law.  It is insulting to the fishing industry which is already on its knees.  Communities like Kilmore in my constituency are reeling from the pressures of a declining income from fisheries.  There are real issues of concern with not alone boats but houses being repossessed.  The fishing industry needs a sympathetic ear and should not be included in a package of measures designed to deal with gangland murderers.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">This provision should be withdrawn from the legislation in the interest of the Minister's stated objective that it is a tight and comprehensive package focused on gangland criminality and in the interest of the development of some level of decent relationship between the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and seafaring communities which many of us represent.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" eId="spk_321">
          <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
          <p eId="para_542">I am glad to have an opportunity to say a few words on this matter.  As my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe, stated, I come from a fishing community.  One could say I was born and reared in a fishing port and I continue to live there.  I have witnessed many changes there during the past ten or 15 years.  When I was much younger, some 30 or 40 half decker boats left the port of Bunbeg.  One would not see two boats leaving that port nowadays.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">I am amazed that the Criminal Justice Bill 2007 seeks to lump in fishermen with big criminals and drug barons.  This is, as Deputy Howlin stated, a reflection on fishing communities who are trying to make a living at great danger to themselves.  They have suffered so much in the past.  There have been many tragedies at sea in Donegal, along the western coast and in many other European countries.  They are on their knees at the moment.  Killybegs was always known as the premier fishing port in this country, perhaps even in Europe.  Currently, however, Killybegs is virtually a ghost town.  Some €300 million or €400 million worth of ships are tied up to the pier and they will probably not go out until next October.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Fishermen were targeted in the maritime legislation that went through the Oireachtas in 2006.  They were criminalised for major infringements that are dealt with in other European countries by fines or administrative measures.  Here in Ireland, however, we always go that extra mile, as a result of which the fishermen are under pressure now.  I am amazed that fishermen are being targeted once more by this Bill, which deals with serious criminal matters.  It is a piggyback exercise by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources who, incidentally, said last year that he would examine the decriminalisation issue by amending the legislation.  Instead of that, however, he has gone a step in the other direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">There is widespread dissatisfaction about this draconian measure, which I want to convey to the Minister.  As Deputy Ó Snodaigh said, we are all in favour of conservation, including fishermen.  Fish constitute a renewable resource but if stocks are to be vacuumed out, they cannot be renewed.  Fishermen are interested in the future of their children and grandchildren, but this legislation is an example of using a sledge-hammer to crack a nut.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">Has there been any consultation with fishermen?  Has the Minister consulted the industry about this legislation?  If consultation had taken place, the Minister would find that fishermen feel hurt and insulted, given that the Bill comes on the heels of what occurred last year.  On behalf of the fishing community I represent, I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_547">I share the concerns expressed by Deputies about the fishing industry.  However, the dagger pointed at the throat of decent, honest fishermen all around Ireland is held by a minority who break the law, destroy our capacity to fish and bring down the wrath of the EU Commission which will take steps against us, as happened recently.  That is the dagger at the throat of every innocent, decent fisherman around Ireland.  This is not a draconian measure.</p>

          <p eId="para_549">It is purely to give fisheries protection officers the right to search premises.  If they do not weed out the tiny minority who are betraying the great majority, we will have worse consequences next year.  More boats will be tied up and the cycle will be repeated.  The point was made that the measure should not be in this Bill, but I have explained honestly and patiently why it is in the Bill.  The measure is no more an insult to fishermen than the inclusion of the Garda Síochána management board, which is also in the Bill, is an insult to gardaí.  It is not intended to have that effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">We could have a separate debate on this subject with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, on another piece of legislation.  Bearing in mind the urgency of making our fisheries protection law system effective, and to stop another catastrophe whereby a few traitors could destroy fishing prospects for another season, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, asked me to include this provision in this Bill.  That is why I have done so.  I am not accepting the amendments.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_325">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_551">I do not think they are traitors.  It has more to do with the foreign invaders that we have less fish stocks than before.  There is a logic to the Garda management executive board being included in this legislation.  The Minister has said that unless we get the management of the Garda Síochána right it could hamper the fight against crime, so the more effectively it is managed, the better.  However, there is nothing in this part of the Bill that relates to gangland crime or drug dealing.  It concerns fisheries.  Last year, following the highly controversial Sea Fisheries (Maritime Jurisdiction) Act, the Government promised to work with the industry to ensure that it could flourish in future, but that has not happened.  The inclusion of this provision is a disgrace.  There has been no consultation with the fishing industry, not that there was any consultation on most of this Bill anyway.  The Minister should withdraw the measure, return it to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, who first landed it in his lap, and tell him to do his own dirty work.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, should introduce his own legislation and fight it out with the fishing industry spokespersons and Deputies representing coastal communities.  Those areas have been suffering because of the EU fisheries policy and this State's failure to protect our fishing stocks against foreign invaders and the few within the Irish industry who cut corners and abuse the system.  The majority of fishermen are eking out a living but they deserve a lot more consideration and support from the Government.  In recent months, however, all they seem to get is more and more criminalisation of their industry and their livelihoods.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_553">Like Macbeth, the Minister has seen a dagger before our eyes, but fishermen genuinely think the dagger is being wielded by the Government.  Whatever the Tánaiste may say, associating fishermen with gangland criminals in the Bill is not the right way to regulate the fisheries sector.  The main points on that issue have been made eloquently by my colleagues, but the Tánaiste might consider a specific point in my amendment concerning search warrants.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">As is normal, the measure provides that a judge, on hearing evidence on oath given by a sea fisheries protection officer — one of the many to which I referred — and if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that evidence of, or relating to, the commission of an offence to which this section applies is to be found, may issue a warrant.  The words "or relating to the commission of an offence" have been drawn to my attention by representatives of the fisheries sector who suggest they could lead to a wide interpretation.  In certain circumstances, they could lead to sea fisheries protection officers seeking a warrant on dubious grounds, purely on the basis of suspicion without any evidence.  On that basis, the premises of law-abiding, fully compliant fishermen could be subject to searches as a result of a warrant issued by a judge of the District Court.  Apart from the general point, which has been eloquently argued, the Minister might consider my specific point now or on Report Stage.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_568">I have given the House my reasoning behind sentencing provisions.  Regarding the detention provisions, I carefully considered, as did the Attorney General, the newspaper article to which the Deputy refers.  I am satisfied that the provisions are not unconstitutional or in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Attorney General has advised me that this is the case.  If these provisions were unconstitutional it would follow that the existing drug trafficking in respect of extended detention are also unconstitutional and I have no reason to suspect that that is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">It is clear in my mind that the extended detention provisions are necessary to deal with tiger kidnappings involving firearms, murders involving firearms and so on.  I have every reason to say to this House that the existing detention periods are not adequate in these circumstances.  Gardaí find themselves trying to put together forensic materials and make inquiries of witnesses but must release people in certain circumstances while inquiries are still taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">All this is subject to judicial control.  The suggestion that this is not a function of the Judiciary is a novel proposition that I reject.  It has no echo in European law and no echo in the laws of these islands.  It is a function of the Judiciary to exercise a role in detention powers.</p>

          <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. O’Dea)</from>
          <p eId="para_578">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_579">That Dáil Éireann approves Ireland's accession to the Memorandum of Understanding concerning the Principles for the Establishment and Operation of a Multinational Battle Group to be made available to the European Union and to the Memorandum of Understanding concerning the Principles for the Cooperation Regarding the OHQ-Function for the Nordic Battle Group.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">As Deputies will recall, we have previously discussed the issue of Ireland's participation in EU battle groups, in particular when we debated the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006 last summer.  The issue now before the House relates to the terms of agreement for Ireland's participation in the Nordic battle group.  Before going through the specifics of the memoranda of understanding, MoUs, I would like to just set out some of the background to our proposed participation.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The ambition of the EU to be able to respond rapidly to emerging crises has been, and continues to be, a key objective in the development of European security and defence policy.  In the Headline Goal 2010, the EU set itself the objective of being able "to respond with rapid and decisive action, applying a fully coherent approach to the whole spectrum of crisis management operations covered by the Treaty on the European Union".  A key element of the headline goal is the capability to deploy forces at high readiness, broadly based on the battle groups concept.  The purpose of the EU battle groups is to undertake operations known as the Petersberg Tasks, which include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking.  These tasks are consistent with our national traditions in peacekeeping and peace support operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">As I have done on many previous occasions, I would once again emphasise that the creation of battle groups does not alter the scope or purpose of European security and defence policy or the Petersberg Tasks.  These are firmly rooted in the Treaty on European Union, as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam, both of which the people approved by referendum.  Nor are battle groups linked to the concept of a possible EU common defence.  The purpose of battle groups is, very simply, to enable the European Union to be more effective in contributing to international peace and security in support of the United Nations by putting in place a rapid response capability.  In this regard, I again recall the strong support of the United Nations for the EU's efforts in this direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">In January of this year, the EU achieved full battle group operational capability, which means that two battle groups are on standby for periods of six months at a time.  In an informal decision, taken at its meeting in January 2006, the Government agreed that I could enter into discussions with Sweden and other like-minded nations on Ireland's contribution to EU battle groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">Representatives from the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Defence Forces have met their Swedish counterparts on a number of occasions to discuss possible participation by the Defence Forces in the Nordic battle group.  Following these discussions, Sweden, as the framework nation for the Nordic battle group, advised that it would welcome a contribution from Ireland to the Nordic battle group, subject to Ireland's agreement to sign the memorandum of understanding, MoU, for the Nordic battle group and the memorandum of understanding regarding the use of Northwood in the UK as the operational headquarters for the Nordic battle group.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">In July last year, the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006 was enacted by the Oireachtas.  The Act provided for, among other things, participation by the Defence Forces in overseas training and field manoeuvres, participation by the Defence Forces in humanitarian operations and for early pre-assembly and dispatch of contingents.  While not solely related to our possible participation in EU battle groups, these were important provisions in facilitating and furthering our engagement with the participants in the Nordic battle group.  Following enactment of the legislation, discussions with Sweden continued in earnest and the detailed provisions of Ireland's participation in the Nordic battle group were agreed, subject to Government and Dáil approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">At its meeting of 14 November 2006, the Government formally approved the arrangements for Ireland's participation in the Nordic battle group, agreeing to provide a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force to participate in the battle group and to sign the memorandum of understanding for the Nordic battle group, subject to the approval of Dáil Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">I would now like to outline to the House the detailed elements of Ireland's contribution to the Nordic battle group.  The Defence Forces will contribute an explosive ordnance disposal and improvised explosive device disposal, EOD-IEDD, contingent with its own security detail, together with staff posts at the operational and force headquarters.  EOD relates to normal type munitions whereas IEDD generally refers to devices devised by terrorist groups, such as car bombs.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">It is expected that between 80 and 100 Defence Forces personnel will be involved.  This level of commitment will only arise should the battle group be called upon to undertake an operation.  The number of personnel involved operationally during the stand-by period, where the battle group has not been mobilised to undertake an operation, will be approximately 15.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">Any contribution to a battle group will be met within the context of the overall ceiling set in the White Paper on Defence of 850 personnel serving overseas at one time and will have no adverse impact on our existing peace support operations.  It goes without saying that any deployment of the Irish element of the battle group on an operational mission will, as always, be subject to the requirements of the triple lock.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">To address the issue at hand, the Nordic battle group memorandum of understanding is an agreement between the participants comprising the Nordic battle group, namely, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Estonia, which sets out principles in respect of the operation, deployment and management of the Nordic battle group.  The memorandum of understanding, MoU, has been signed by the existing participants in the battle group.  Ireland will join to the MoU through an exchange of letters with each of the existing participants in the form of the letter of accession included in the documents laid before Dáil Éireann on 22 March 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">I propose to outline each of the provisions of the memoranda of understanding.  Sections 1 and 2 deal with the definitions and reference documents, respectively.  Section 3 outlines the purpose of the memorandum of understanding<b> </b>as a framework document, which sets out principles in respect of the operation, deployment and management of the Nordic battle group.  Section 4 deals with the scope of the memorandum of understanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">I draw the attention of Deputies to the fact that the memorandum of understanding specifically recognises the sovereignty of each participant in terms of any decision to deploy its forces being in accordance with its own national law.  This principle is reiterated in section 6 of the memorandum of understanding.  In Ireland's case this means that any decision to participate in a battle group operation, irrespective of our joining the memorandum of understanding, would be subject to a further decision in accordance with the provisions of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">Section 5 sets out the purpose of the Nordic battle group as a means to support the development of European Security and Defence Policy through its participation in European Union led crisis management operations.  This reflects the aim of the EU to react quickly across the spectrum of crisis management tasks, as outlined in the Headline Goal 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">Sections 6 and 7 set out the principles for deploying and withdrawing the Nordic battle group.  The battle group will only be deployed following the appropriate EU decision-making process.  Each participant retains the right to deploy or not deploy its forces, irrespective of an EU decision to launch a battle group operation.  Equally, each participant retains the sovereign right to withdraw its contingent at any time.  With regard to the general withdrawal of the battle group or elements of it, the memorandum of understanding provides that such decisions will be made on the basis of consensus following EU decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Section 8 outlines the political-military consultation<b> </b>process.  It envisages that regular consultation between participants will be required before and during the stand-by period.  Sweden, as the framework nation, will lead the consultations and all decisions will be made on the basis of consensus.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">Section 9 deals with the establishment phase<b>. </b>During this phase, co-ordination of the policy and military issues relating to the battle group will take place in the framework of NORDCAPS.  This is a co-operation arrangement between the Nordic countries for co-ordination and planning of peace support operations.  Ireland and Estonia are not members of NORDCAPS but will participate in its meetings when battle group issues are discussed.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">Section 10 details the arrangements for force contribution, generation and tailoring.<b> </b>Participants make their offers to the battle group at co-ordination conferences and each contribution is laid out in a technical arrangement.  The force commander may alter the overall make-up of the force for a specific battle group deployment depending on the nature of the operation and the forces offered.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Section 11 discusses command and control arrangements.  Sweden, as a framework nation, will lead the force headquarters, with all participants able to hold positions in headquarters.  The command of each contingent remains under national control, with operational control delegated to the operational commander.  This is in accordance with EU crisis management concepts and standard operating procedure in a multinational force.  The same arrangement applies where Ireland is engaged in UN "blue hat" operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">Training is discussed in section 12.  It will be necessary for the various participants of the battle group to train together in accordance with EU standards.  Most battle group training will take place in the contributing member states, which means Irish troops will mainly be trained in Ireland.  That said, some level of joint training with other battle group elements will be required.  It is planned that joint training of the Nordic battle group elements, including field manoeuvres, will take place in Sweden in September and October 2007 for a period of approximately three to four weeks.  The full operational capability of the Nordic battle group will then be assessed and the battle group will be on stand-by from January 2008 for a period of six months.  There will be no joint field training or exercises held in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">Section 13 notes that the battle group will be certified in accordance with agreed EU procedures.  Section 14 deals with the status of forces in terms of jurisdiction and discipline, while section 15 deals with claims and liabilities.  When a battle group participant is within the territory of another participant, the issues of jurisdiction and discipline and claims and liabilities of forces will be dealt with in accordance with the NATO Partnership for Peace status of forces agreement, SOFA.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">A SOFA is an agreement on the status of personnel engaged on overseas training and operations, whereby the host country agrees to extend certain rights and privileges to such personnel.  These include arrangements regarding jurisdiction in respect of certain crimes, powers of military police, enforcement of discipline by the superiors of the relevant personnel and determination of liability for damage to the property of third parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">In the case of the Nordic battle group, the NATO PfP SOFA is the one being used.  The application of this status of forces agreement is a common requirement for participation in all European Union and NATO PfP led peace support operations.  It applies in the case of our participation in KFOR in Kosovo, ISAF in Afghanistan, EUFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina and EUFOR in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  While all the other Nordic battle group participants have signed the NATO PfP SOFA, Ireland has not done so.  We have previously acceded to the relevant provisions of the agreement, generally through an exchange of letters with the European Union, NATO or lead framework nation for any operation in which we are engaged.  The Attorney General has considered this matter in detail and has advised that there is no impediment to Ireland agreeing to be bound by the relevant provisions of the SOFA, as provided for in this memorandum of understanding.  As a result, Defence Forces personnel will be subject to the terms of such agreements in terms of jurisdiction and discipline and claims and liabilities when in the territory of another participant.  As no battle group activities involving forces from other participants can take place here, Ireland will not be required to extend the relevant provisions of the status of forces agreements to foreign forces.  This has been agreed with Sweden as framework nation for the Nordic battle group.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">Section 16 outlines the arrangements in terms of financing.  Individual costs, other than those deemed to be common costs, will be the responsibility of each participant.  Section 17 notes that regulations in terms of logistics are to be dealt with in technical arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">Security regulations are outlined in section 18.  All exchange of classified information will be handled in accordance with EU security regulations.  Each participant will appoint a designated security authority to deal with any security issues that arise.  Section 19 notes that third parties can be invited to participate in the battle group based on consensus among participants.  Section 20 notes that the memorandum of understanding will take effect from the date of the last signature.  Participants may withdraw from the memorandum of understanding with six months written notice.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">Section 21 deals with modifications, amendments and disputes.  The memorandum of understanding may be modified with written consent of all participants and any dispute will be handled through negotiation between participants.  In addition to the Nordic battle group memorandum of understanding, Ireland is required to enter into an MoU with the United Kingdom on the use of Northwood and the staff to be based there.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The operational headquarters for the Nordic battle group will be located at Northwood in the UK.  An operational headquarters is a complex facility, providing strategic direction and advice to the force on the ground.  There are only a small number of such facilities in Europe, mainly in the larger member states.  Northwood has the necessary infrastructure, communications systems, facilities and support, which are not otherwise available within the member states contributing to the Nordic battle group. The operational commander and headquarters staff for the Nordic battle group, which will be drawn from the participating member states, will be based in Northwood for the duration of the standby period.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">The memorandum of understanding for the operational headquarters broadly follows the same structure as the main battle group MoU and conforms to all EU agreed guidelines on battle groups.  Its purpose is to define the aim, principles and responsibilities for co-operation with regard to the establishment and operation of the EU operational headquarters in Northwood for the command and control of the Nordic battle group.  It details the right of access to the operational headquarters for appointed staff of the Nordic battle group during the establishment, pre-activation, activation and redeployment phases.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">Section 9 outlines the command and control arrangements.  As in the memorandum of understanding for the Nordic battle group, the operation commander will be appointed by the council but all personnel contributed by individual participants remain under full command of the sending participant.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">It is vitally important at this stage that our participation in the Nordic battle group is formalised in order that we can fully participate.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_347">
          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_610">Fine Gael supports the motion.  The European Union battle group concept has been strongly supported by Fine Gael and I am happy to reiterate our support again today.  From the outset, Fine Gael has recognised the value that battle groups could bring to our response to humanitarian disaster or the threat to human life from political upheaval or even genocide.  In responding to matters as grave as these, we believe every day can count for thousands of lives and that there is a special responsibility on the international community to put in place the best system so we can respond to crises effectively, efficiently and, above all, quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">I welcome Ireland's membership of this EU battle group.  This has been a long time coming.  When this concept was first mooted, there were frequent public contradictions of Government policy between the Ministers with responsibility for foreign affairs and defence, with even the Taoiseach making suggestions that Ireland might not be able to take part on constitutional grounds.  Through all this time, Fine Gael rightly rejected the idea that there might be a constitutional difficulty with Ireland's participation and we advocated that Ireland press forward on this matter with all other European Union countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">I support the memorandum of understanding agreed between Ireland and the countries of the Nordic battle group, namely, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Estonia, and the memorandum of understanding with the United Kingdom regarding the use of facilities at Northwood as the operational headquarters for the military grouping.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">We should remember that the development of these battle groups has been strongly supported by, among others, the former Secretary General of the United Nations.  The United Nations has recognised that regional groupings, such as the EU battle groups, will play an ever-increasing role in promoting stability and tackling large-scale human rights abuses.  Importantly, Kofi Annan has also commented that sometimes it is necessary to show force in order not to use it.  This is vital.  The international community must have the capacity, agreement, organisation and will to stand firm against those who would promote death and destruction, genocide and vile abuses of human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">Ireland cannot forget, and the European Union has a duty to remember, that in our recent history genocide and the large-scale loss of human life took place within our midst and we allowed ourselves to be largely powerless to stop it.  This realisation should also inform our position with regard to the development of these necessary and welcome EU battle groups.  However, I remain seriously concerned at the legislative response to Ireland's involvement in these groupings.  Contingents of our Defence Forces can only be deployed under the triple lock system.  This means, for Ireland, that any potential military action must be endorsed by a full United Nations mandate establishing or authorising such an international UN force, approved by Dáil Éireann and agreed within the Government itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">The development of EU battle groups has been specifically designed to allow for a swift response to unfolding situations of concern.  I understand that the EU battle group on call at any time will be in a position to deploy quickly to trouble-spots or in responding to a humanitarian crisis.  However, as we all know, the provisions of the so-called triple lock have already impacted negatively on Ireland's involvement in certain peacekeeping missions.  For example, Ireland could not participate in the EU peacekeeping force, Operation Concordia, sent to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia even though this force replaced NATO and had both EU and UN support, as set out in UN Resolution 1371.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">The difficulty in getting a resolution establishing or authorising an international UN force can relate to the self-interests of members of the Security Council.  In the case of Macedonia, such a resolution was not carried because it did not suit the interests of China.  Macedonia had recognised Taiwan so China retaliated by blocking the UN peacekeeping force resolution.  Therefore, by having a triple lock we have given self-serving members of the UN Security Council, who may be operating to a narrow national agenda, the right to pre-empt our free and democratic decision.  This is neither healthy nor wise.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">With specific regard to the development of EU battle groups, the mechanism of the UN Security Council can easily mitigate against quick decision-making.  In the absence of a UN mandate for action, it is easy to foresee a situation whereby the Irish contingent of the EU battle group may not be in a position to respond alongside their colleagues due to the absence of formal UN backing, critically undermining the entire concept, not to mention the group that they will have trained alongside.  Although Ireland will now enter into an arrangement where a contingent of our forces will be in position and waiting to move on humanitarian or peacekeeping duties, should an international emergency occur, the possibility is that we may have to stay in Northwood in Britain and allow our battle group counterparts to go it alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">Our foreign policy should not and must not be a slave to the permanent members of the UN Security Council.  The Government cannot pretend it is in a battle group and then discover our troops cannot move when they are needed.  It should face up to reality and amend the triple lock in line with legislation Fine Gael presented years ago.  The vagaries of UN Security Council permanent members must be taken out of the picture.  We cannot continue to allow the effectiveness of our troops to be blunted by this outdated mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">Notwithstanding this, it is important to note that these battle groups are not a great change from the current position.  However, following from difficulties the UN experienced with regard to the effectiveness of its forces, a report was commissioned, known as the Brahimi report, which recommended that the UN outsource some of its operations to various regional bodies, such as the European Union or the African Union.  What we see here is a mechanism whereby units which are participating in an operation can train and work together and become more organised, which will ultimately lead to a more effective force that will be able to deal with many of the difficulties that exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">We often talk of the concept of neutrality.  Ireland is not neutral <i>per se</i>; it is simply unaligned.  However, it is important to point out that this measure in no way impinges on our neutrality.  Fine Gael is coming from the other end of the spectrum in that we believe the State is mature enough to take its own decisions, on the basis of Dáil and Government approval, on what we should and should not participate in.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">Darfur is not a classic example because the Sudanese Government will not grant authority to the UN to intervene there.  We talk of standing idly by with regard to genocides in the past.  Tens of thousands of people are being massacred in Darfur but the international community is doing nothing.  I cannot understand how Ireland, as a member of the international community, can justify this.  We can issue all the pious condemnation we want but they will achieve nothing.  To return to the point made by Kofi Annan, sometimes we must show force to prevent wrongdoing.  This is what the battle group concept is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">Some 80 to 100 Irish ordnance personnel will initially participate in the battle group.  This will certainly benefit the development of the Defence Forces.  As they have shown over a number of decades, the Defence Forces are capable of competing with any other force in the world, provided they have the necessary equipment.  They are educated and very progressive.  I wish them well.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">I take this opportunity to wish all members of the Defence Forces well over the coming months.  As this may be the last Question Time on defence matters in this Dáil, I wish the Minister and his staff well.  I congratulate Major General Earley on his appointment as Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.  It will be a popular decision as he is highly respected across a wide spectrum of Irish public life, and the appointment will benefit the Defence Forces.  I also congratulate his colleague, Brigadier General O'Sullivan, on his promotion and wish Lieutenant General Sreenan well in his retirement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_348">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_624">I wish to be associated with Deputy Timmins's good wishes.  The appointments of Major General Dermot Earley and Brigadier General O'Sullivan are welcome.  I wish them, and Lieutenant General Sreenan, who is retiring, well.  Perhaps this is the last occasion the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, will grace this House in his current role.  If that is the case, we wish him well also.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">I have great respect for Deputy Timmins and for his and the Fine Gael position on these matters.  However, I strongly believe the wider the scope of Defence Forces involvement in military operations abroad, the more important it is we have the triple lock mechanism in place to ensure we operate within parameters that are clearly defined by this House, the Government and the United Nations.  This was a crucial issue in 2002 when we faced the first Nice treaty referendum, which was a watershed for Ireland.  Two thirds of the electorate at the time, for the first time in the history of the State, said "No" to a European Union treaty.  They rejected the advice of all the major political parties, the trade union movement, the churches and the farmers' organisation.  They snubbed all the traditional pillars of society and said "No" to all the sacred cows.  This was a very sobering experience for the Irish establishment.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">One of the central concerns over Nice was the European Foreign and Security Policy.  In order to allay those fears and prepare for Nice II, the Seville declaration was promulgated by the European Union in June of 2002.  Paragraph 6 of the Seville document included the national declaration by Ireland in which Ireland reiterated that the participation of contingents of the Irish Defence Forces on overseas operations, including those carried out under the European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP, required first, the authorisation of the military operation by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations; second, the agreement of the Irish Government; and third, the approval of Dáil Éireann in accordance with Irish law.  Thus the Seville declaration copper-fastened the triple lock mechanism for all Irish Defence Forces' overseas operations, including ESDP operations — those under discussion now in the context of the memorandum on battle groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">The European Council made a solemn declaration at the time, in paragraph 4 of the Seville declaration, in which it acknowledged: "that the Treaty on European Union does not impose any binding mutual defence commitments".  Nor does the development of the Union's capacity to conduct humanitarian and crisis management tasks involve the establishment of a European army.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">In paragraph 6 of the Seville declaration the European Council recognised that like all member states of the Union, Ireland would retain the right, following entry into force of the Treaty of Nice, to take its own sovereign decisions in accordance with its Constitution and its laws on whether to commit military personnel to participate in any operation carried out under the ESDP.  In its national statement in the Seville declaration, Ireland clearly stated its position and the European Union clearly accepted that position.  That was the position of the triple lock.  This was one of the major reasons the Nice treaty was carried the second time round.  Some other issues were also involved, including the scrutiny legislation and the National Forum on Europe.  All overseas operations, including battle groups, come under these terms.  Indeed, the memorandum of understanding on the Nordic battle group reiterates as much in section 4.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">In 2006, the Oireachtas passed the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006.  This Act provided for participation by the Defence Forces in overseas training and manoeuvres and for preassembly of Irish troops.  It also made provision for participation in battle groups.  Thus, it seems to me that the arguments and suspicions surrounding battle groups somewhat miss the point.  A battle group is a multinational force which is trained as a highly mobile rapid reaction force.  The Irish Defence Forces require optimum training in the modern equivalent, up to the highest international standards.  Whether some of that training takes place in Ireland or abroad is irrelevant.  What is crucial are the circumstances and purpose for which that trained force gets involved in military operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">Ireland is committed to engage in military operations abroad only under the mandate of the United Nations and with the approval of the Government and the Parliament.  Once the triple lock is intact, Ireland can properly participate in a multinational battle group and be available to the European Union to undertake functions under the Petersberg Tasks.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">A number of issues relating to the memorandum require clarification.  First, will the Minister clarify the status of forces in terms of jurisdiction and discipline, in that we come under the NATO-PfP SOFA terms of reference?  It is stated in the memorandum that certain crimes, powers of military police, enforcement of discipline by superiors of the relevant personnel and determination of liability for damage to the property of third parties will be dealt with under the status of forces agreement, SOFA.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">I understand the law of the land would operate for any citizen of Ireland, whether in the Defence Forces or not, when in a participant state.  However, does this memorandum imply that if there are grounds for a court martial, that court martial would take place under the auspices of that participant state?  Could an Irish citizen be tried by a foreign court martial?  Will the Minister clarify whether an Irish citizen can face a court martial in a foreign jurisdiction and face the rules, regulations and legislation that apply in that jurisdiction?  This is a particular concern considering the recent legislation we have passed in terms of improving and human rights proofing our court martial structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">It is proposed that the operational headquarters for the Nordic battle group will be in Northwood in the United Kingdom.  It is unsatisfactory that a country that is not a member of the battle group would host the crucially important seat of operations.  Britain will not sign up to the memoranda of understanding, yet the operational headquarters will be based there.  I recognise that the commander will still be the commander of the framework country, Sweden, and that the Irish contingent will be led by the Irish commander.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">If Ireland is to be involved in a Nordic battle group, will the Minister make it a priority that one of the Nordic countries is the home of the operational headquarters?  Although only a few countries in the European Union have the capacity to deal with the complexity of operational headquarters, it seems a contradiction that we are entering a Nordic battle group, but the headquarters of the group are not in a Nordic state.  I suggest this matter should be rectified at an early stage.  The Minister should enter into discussion with the other Nordic countries with a view to ensuring the most suitable country, probably Sweden, the framework country, which is the largest country in the group, is the site of the operational headquarters for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">Will the Minister clarify how the Irish contingent will be led by an Irish commander and explain the proposed relationship between the Irish contingent control and command and the overall commander, who will be a Swedish commander?  How will decisions be made and communicated in this regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_636">Will the Minister clarify what extra resources are required in terms of Irish involvement in battle groups?  There will be enhanced levels of training and I presume we will require enhanced levels of equipment to bring the group up to modern international standards.  Considerable travel will also be involved with regard to training, pre-assembly, standby and operations.  Some three to four weeks will be spent training in Sweden in the autumn.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">It is envisaged the first battle group will be ready and on standby by January 2008 and that this group will be on standby for a six-month period.  Will the Minister undertake a full assessment and examination of that operation?  It may be a stand-by situation with no operation.  They may not be called to engage in any of the Petersberg Tasks.  Will the Minister commit himself and his successor to a review of the operation of the battle group, with a report presented to the House and a debate here to inform us of future commitments in this area?</p>

          <p eId="para_640">This motion is important and it would be good to have more time to discuss the fundamental changes proposed in the way Ireland deals with the rest of the world, particularly from the point of view of military operations, international law and human rights.  All parties would claim these as cornerstones of their approach to foreign relations.  There are, however, differences between the parties in respect of the role of the United Nations, the need to reform it and its role as the custodian of international law.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">Ireland has played a proud and honourable role in serving with the United Nations overseas.  It is necessary, however, to examine our present and future positions.  TASC, the think-tank for action on social change, held a seminar yesterday at which the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, said that the Dáil is becoming a rubber stamp for Government decisions.  This motion is an example of that point.  The memorandum of understanding was presented in committee for 40 minutes, most of which time was devoted to the Minister's presentation, and we are having a 60 minute debate today.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The Defence (Amendment) Bill which was discussed for three hours on 4 July 2006, with a vote at midnight, was not as fully debated as it could have been.  That in turn diluted the definition of a United Nations mandate and allowed Irish forces to assemble before having one.  That may be what some parties want but not the Green Party.  We want better accountability and a stronger role for the United Nations with the reforms that it needs.  We should be putting our efforts into making that happen.  A grey area is emerging in which our forces are to be in place without a UN mandate.  If they are attacked another grey area will emerge.  I hope that does not happen but no provision has been made for it in this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">The legacy of the Government is not a proud one in respect of partnership for peace.  A referendum was promised but it did not take place.  The Amsterdam and Nice treaties resulted in further militarisation and Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, wants a European army.  Ireland has joined the European arms agency with no debate in the Dáil.  Most disgracefully, we continue to facilitate more than 1 million US troops that have passed through Shannon Airport on the way to what started as an illegal and immoral war.  It remains immoral, whatever about the retrospective sanction from the United Nations.  It was a war of invasion which we should not have supported and which did not initially have a UN mandate.  We continue to turn a blind eye to that atrocity despite calls from the European Parliament, the Council of Europe, Amnesty International and other major human rights organisations that we search the CIA planes coming in here which have been implicated in extraordinary rendition flights.  That is a crying shame.</p>

          <p eId="para_644">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the proposed European Union battle groups, although I dislike the term.  It sends out the wrong message to citizens.  Why were titles such as peacekeeping groups or conflict resolution groups not used?  The public deserves answers about the language being used which sends a strong negative message and suggests militarisation of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">Every nation has a right to defend itself but the battle groups raise serious questions.  Will they be the regiments of a new European army?  As we approach the commemoration of the Easter Rising we should remind ourselves that the Proclamation, to which many Ministers will pay tribute over the next week or so, states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_646">We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">The former President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, said on 13 February 2001, "Are we all clear that we want to build something that can aspire to be a worldpower . . .?"  There is a contradiction between those two statements which we should examine.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">As the Defence Forces are about to be integrated into the EU battle groups the Irish people are being offered a choice between a type of imperialism or independence.  The Government's decision that 200 Irish soldiers should join the EU battle groups is another step in the destruction of Irish independence, democracy and neutrality.  The integration of Ireland into an imperial, militarised, neo-liberal European superstate allied to the United States will ensure the full and active participation of all of Ireland in the resource wars of the 21st century.  The defeat of the European-United States axis is the inevitable outcome of these wars, against which we should guard.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">I advocate a different choice, a united independent Irish Republic as part of a democratic Europe, a partnership of independent democratic states, legal equals without a military dimension.  Ireland should pursue its foreign policy and security concerns through a reformed United Nations.  The choice for the people is clear and is the same as it has been for many generations, a republic or some form of political arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Secretary General of NATO, said in March 2005:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_651">Battle Groups could be used to go to war.  Why did the EU create the Battle Group?  It is not just to help rebuild a country. The Battle Groups are not for building schools.  We shouldn't think the EU is for soft power and NATO for tough power.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">Our forces should be involved in peacekeeping practices in which they have done an excellent job over the past 30 or 40 years, particularly in the Middle East and other areas of conflict.  The defence forces of other EU countries should be used to rebuild countries devastated by famine and war.  We should not be afraid to consider other possibilities such as a protocol.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">Denmark is not taking part in the battle groups because the movement for Danish democracy won a major victory which ensured that a number of legally binding protocols were added to the Amsterdam Treaty, including one that excluded Denmark from the process of militarisation of the EU.</p>

          <p eId="para_656">These motions are a further signal of the demise of Irish neutrality.  No one has done more to diminish the neutrality of this State than the current partnership of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  They helped the United States to attack and invade Iraq in an illegal action commencing in 2003 by using Shannon Airport as a military staging post.  They colluded in the United State's illegal programme of extraordinary rendition, which involves the kidnap and torture of individuals, by aiding and abetting the escape of CIA agents, some of whom are the subject of arrest warrants in other jurisdictions, again through Shannon Airport.  The Government parties also rushed through the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006 in one night last July with the support of both Fine Gael and the Labour Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">Ceanglaíonn an tAcht sin Éire páirt a ghlacadh i ngrúpaí cogaidh de chuid an AE.  Lagaíonn sé an chosaint a chuireann an triple lock ar fáil trí ligint do na Fórsaí Cosanta páirt a ghlacadh i réimse gníomhaíochtaí míleata thar lear le cead ón Rialtas amháin.  Ar an ócáid sin, ní dhearna ach Sinn Féin, An Comhaontas Glas agus roinnt de na Teachtaí Neamhspleácha seasamh ar son neodracht na hÉireann.  Ó bhallraíocht i PFP, NATO, agus an fórsa frithghnímh mhear go dtí na grúpaí cogaidh atá á bplé againn, thug mise faoi deara ag gach uile chéim go raibh muid ag bogadh i dtreo airm Eorpaigh ar gach bealach.  In ainneoin nach n-aontaíonn an tAire liom sa chás seo, aontaíonn ceannairí stát eile san AE liom.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who heads up the current Presidency, acknowledges that these developments are part and parcel of an attempt to introduce an EU army.  On the eve of the EU's 50th anniversary she stated: "In the EU itself we have come closer to a European army."  While our Government denies EU militarisation has ever been an objective, Belgium's Prime Minister must be delighted with the "progress" made in terms of militarisation.  Speaking in London a year ago he said: "We need a European defence, a European army, not just on paper but a force genuinely capable of operating in the field, including beyond the European borders".</p>
          <p eId="para_659">The second memo of understanding relates to the location of the battle group, which will be in the British Ministry of Defence's permanent joint headquarters in Northwood, which is also headquarters for NATO regional command.  The location of the battle group at Northwood effectively means that any participating Irish troops will be under the operational command of British officers and NATO officers.  It also means that there will be no distinction between the battle groups and NATO forces if they are engaged in a conflict.  Northwood headquarters makes no secret of the fact that it is "... helping to expand and intensify ... military cooperation throughout Europe".</p>
          <p eId="para_660">There is no way in those circumstances that an Irish Government can claim that the State is neutral.  Could the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Foreign Affairs credibly maintain at this stage, as the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform attempted to do last week, that this State is neutral?  Could either plausibly maintain that when the battle groups are established and if the current war in Iraq is still ongoing or those forces are involved in another adventure, Irish troops would not inevitably be drawn in?  If the EU decides to commit to participation in such a conflict, this Parliament would have little or no influence on such a decision.  It would be difficult for the Minister to deny that.  If the Irish Army participates in the battle groups it will be clearly aligned with Britain, NATO and the United States, and fully committed to EU involvement in the sort of adventure that we are witnessing in Iraq currently.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">We do not have sufficient time to discuss this major step in the demise of Irish neutrality.  It is a scandal that we have come this far and this represents a breach of promises made by Fianna Fáil at various elections that the party would stand by neutrality.  However, our neutrality has been diminished repeatedly.  Rather than building up the capacity of the UN and encouraging other countries to do likewise, the Government has eroded our neutrality and engaged in a project of militarising the European Union and participating in military adventures overseas with countries that were imperialist powers in the past, which seem to be dreaming of setting up other empires and spheres of influence that they can dictate into the future.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_358" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
          <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
          <p eId="para_664">I thank Members who contributed to the debate and the members of the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, which discussed this issue last week, for their time and support for these memoranda.  They made a number of interesting and useful comments and I trust I clarified issues that may have caused concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">I reiterate a number of issues relating to the memoranda and the Nordic battle group.  I appreciate the continued support voiced for the triple lock.  Maintaining this requirement has been a consistent policy of the Government and Deputies can rest assured I do not intend to depart from it.  The memorandum of understanding specifically recognises that a decision by a participant to commit to a mission is subject to national decision and in accordance with national constitutions, legislation and policy.  For Ireland, this means a decision to deploy troops remains a national decision in each case and it is subject to the triple lock, notwithstanding any commitment to the battle group.  Furthermore, concerns were rightly raised about participation in battle groups turning into an EU common defence.  This is not, and never has been, the case.  The Constitution clearly prevents Ireland from participating in a common defence.  The purpose of battle groups is to improve the effectiveness of the EU in contributing to international peace and security and support of the UN by putting in place a rapid response capability.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Deputy Costello referred to the question of discipline and jurisdiction when Irish troops are on foreign soil and whether they would be the subject of a court martial by the military authorities of a foreign power.  It is specifically provided for in the agreement that Irish troops will be subject to domestic military law and, therefore, they would be subject to an Irish court martial.  The Northwood issue was also raised.  Few buildings in Europe have the logistics, communications system, etc, to serve as operational headquarters for battle groups.  There is one in Potsdam in Germany, which is being used as operational headquarters for the EU mission in the Congo.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">Basing the operational headquarters for this battle group in the UK does not mean the UK will be involved in the chain of command.  The UK authorities have given us a loan of the hall for the period of the battle group.   Administrative staff at Northwood will provide assistance to those running the battle group but the commander will be a lieutenant general from Sweden and the operation will be commanded by the countries involved.  I take Deputy Costello's point that a similar facility is not in place in the Nordic countries or in Ireland.  On the other hand, the force headquarters will still be based in the framework nation, which is Sweden.  If a battle group becomes operational, the headquarters will move to the theatre of operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">Deputy Costello also asked about additional resources.  I estimate that if the battle group is deployed for its maximum period of 120 days, it will cost €3 million.  It will initially be deployed for 30 days and three extensions will need to be applied for to extend it to its maximum period.  If the battle group remains on standby, the additional cost will be approximately €500,000.  Deputy Costello asked me to undertake to carry out an assessment of how Ireland participates in the first battle group, whether it is on standby or deployed.  If I can be Minister for Defence again when that happens I will be delighted to comply with that request.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">Deputy Sargent said that the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, had said she wanted there to be a European army.  To put it bluntly, I do not give a damn what Angela Merkel said.  She is the same person who wanted to see Fine Gael head the next Government but she will be wrong about that too.</p>

          <p eId="para_677">Deputy Ó Snodaigh said he was worried about the headquarters being based in Northwood but the operational headquarters for the Congo mission is based in Potsdam in Germany.  Germany was the initiator of and the aggressor in two world wars but there was no word about that from Sinn Féin.  However, because the operational headquarters are based in the UK it makes a song and dance about it, which is rank hypocrisy.</p>

          <p eId="para_761">The Health Bill 2006 assigns responsibility to the chief inspector of social services for the inspection and registration of designated centres.  Designated centres are defined as private nursing homes and institutions, homes or centres at which residential services are provided by the Health Service Executive or a service provider for children, people with disabilities or other dependent persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">A "service provider" means a person who enters into an arrangement under section 38 of the Health Act 2004 to provide a health or personal social service on behalf of the Health Service Executive.  The service provider may also be a person who is in receipt of assistance from the Health Service Executive under section 39 of the Health Act 2004 or section 10 of the Child Care Act 1991 of an amount prescribed by regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">However, it is technically possible that an agency providing residential services for children or people with disabilities may be in receipt of funding under section 10 of the Child Care Act 1991 or section 39 of the Health Act 2004 which is less than the amount prescribed because the agency is a small scale operation.  It would be important that all residential centres are inspected and registered.  The Seanad therefore amended the definition of designated centre to ensure there was no possibility of such a residential centre falling outside the remit of the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_764">Under section 26, HIQA is required to recruit its employees in accordance with the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.  However, I intend to establish the authority shortly to give it the opportunity to properly organise itself and the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services.  It will need to recruit personnel immediately.  The interim authority has already begun the process of recruiting its senior management, including the Chief Inspector of Social Services.  Amendment No. 2 was passed by the Seanad to allow a transitional arrangement, lasting three months or a lesser time specified by the Minister, during which the provisions of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 will not apply.  This will allow the authority to complete the recruitment process undertaken by the interim authority and enable the organisation to set itself up.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">There is still the safeguard that any employees appointed to the authority are appointed in accordance with terms and conditions determined by the authority, subject to the approval of the Minister, given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The deferral of the requirement to recruit through the Public Appointments Service or obtain a recruitment licence from the Public Appointments Service will only last for a maximum of three months.  This is similar to the provision included in the Health Act 2004 which was used to set up the Health Service Executive.</p>

          <p eId="para_766">The Chief Inspector of Social Services has responsibility for inspecting and registering residential centres.  The chief inspector is also given statutory responsibility for other matters under the Bill.  These include overseeing the performance by the Health Service Executive of its functions under sections 39, 41 and 53 of the Child Care Act 1991 in respect of fostering and pre-school services and section 10 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 in respect of the boarding out of elderly people.  Amendment No. 3 clarifies that the chief inspector's oversight of the performance of the executive's functions under the Child Care Act 1991 will include the executive's functions under sections 40 and 42 of that Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">Both sections relate to the Health Service Executive's functions in respect of children in its care and section 40 refers to the Health Service Executive's functions in the placing of children in residential care, securing their welfare and the form of contract to be entered into by the Health Service Executive with persons providing residential care.  Section 40 also refers to the supervision and visiting by the executive of children in residential care and section 42 of the Child Care Act provides for the case review by the executive of each child in its care.  Given the role assigned to the chief inspector in regard to the inspection of residential services for children and the oversight role in regard to the other functions of the Health Service Executive under the Child Care Act 1991, it is appropriate for the chief inspector to have an oversight role also in regard to sections 40 and 42 of the Child Care Act.</p>

          <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
          <p eId="para_772">The Bill provides for the chief inspector to inspect residential centres against standards set by HIQA and regulations made by the Minister.  Currently, regulations for private nursing homes are made under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and regulations for children's residential centres are made under sections 38 and 63 of the Child Care Act 1991.  Under the Bill, regulations for private nursing homes will no longer be made under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act but will instead be made under the Health Bill.  While regulations in respect of registration issues for children's residential centres are also to be made under the Health Bill, it was envisaged that regulations in respect of standards of care at children's residential centres would continue to be made under the Child Care Act 1991.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">Offence provisions in respect of the operation of children's residential centres would, therefore, be split between the Child Care Act and the Health Bill, with prosecutions taken by the chief inspector under both legislative measures.  Following further consideration of this matter with the Parliamentary Counsel, it was subsequently decided that all the relevant regulations would best be made under the Health Bill.  This would result in a more easily understood system of regulation overall.  The change in approach advocated by the Parliamentary Counsel necessitated some amendments to the Health Bill and consequential amendments of the Child Care Act 1991.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">Amendment No. 4 is a technical amendment to section 41, which sets out the functions of the Chief Inspector of Social Services.  One of the functions under paragraph (c) is to assess whether the registered provider of a designated centre is in compliance with regulations made under the Bill or under any other Act which provides for the regulation of those centres.  As all regulations will now be made under the Bill, it is proposed to delete the reference to regulations made under any other Act in paragraph (c).</p>
          <p eId="para_775">Amendment No. 6 amends section 45.  The Health Service Executive currently carries out inspections of children's residential centres provided by the voluntary sector.  The executive also inspects private nursing homes, and section 45 of the Bill provides for a transitional arrangement whereby the Minister may require the Health Service Executive to continue to carry out inspections of children's residential centres and private nursing homes.  This is intended as a temporary arrangement to facilitate the continued inspection of the relevant services pending the final establishment of all necessary arrangements, such as the transfer of staff and resources to the authority.  Amendment No. 6 is a necessary technical amendment to section 45 to take account of amendments to the Child Care Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">Section 50 deals with the grant or refusal by the Chief Inspector of Social Services of applications for registration of designated centres or applications for renewal of registration.  In granting registration, the chief inspector must be satisfied that the designated centre complies with standards set by the HIQA and regulations made by the Minister.  Amendment No. 7 is a technical amendment to section 50 to delete references to regulations made under the Child Care Act and to ensure that all references to regulations in the section are to regulations made under the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">Section 79 provides for offences and subsection (2) of that section sets out the offences committed by a registered provider of a designated centre if the registered provider fails to discharge a duty to which he or she is subject or contravenes a provision of the regulations made in respect of the designated centre.  Amendment No. 8 is a technical drafting amendment to section 79 to ensure that all relevant regulations made under the Bill are taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">Section 101 allows the Minister to make regulations respecting designated centres and amendment No. 10 ensures that such regulations will now be applicable to children's residential centres.  The Bill currently deletes those sections in the Child Care Act which provide for the registration of children's residential centres operated by the voluntary sector as, along with Health Service Executive residential centres, registration of these centres will now be regulated under the Health Bill.  Amendments Nos. 11 and 14 are further technical amendments to the Child Care Act to delete provisions relating to the making of regulations for residential centres and related offences under that Act.  These amendments are consequential to the changes made to the Health Bill, as all regulations relating to the residential centres will now be made under the Bill and offences against the regulations will be prosecuted under the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_779">I am letting these amendments go through because, to be honest, I do not fully understand what the Minister is doing here.  It is fascinating that the Minister is bringing forward amendments on the basis of the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel and that he is deleting sections of the Child Care Act.  He is changing legislation.  We have made the comment in the last two weeks that most people outside this Chamber have little or no interest in what we are doing with health legislation.  Even now,  only I, the Minister and officials are present in the Chamber, so it is unlikely there will be great discussion of what is happening with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">It is amazing that we are changing such major legislation in the last few minutes of the Bill's passage.  We have rushed a great deal of good legislation in the last two weeks. We should have been more sensible and given it more time.  I regret that we rushed this so much.  However, I will not oppose any of these amendments.</p>

This allows the chief inspector or HIQA, as the case may be, to prosecute where evidence of the offence only came to light some time after the offence was committed.  However, in line with similar provisions in other legislation, proceedings in these circumstances must be commenced not later than two years after the date of the offence.  Amendment No. 9 also provides for the admissibility of certificates certifying the date on which evidence first came to the knowledge of the chief inspector or HIQA.</p>

          <p eId="para_792">This is a further amendment to Schedule 2, Part 7, which is an amendment to the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006.  It is a technical amendment to deal with an issue where a patient to whom the Act applies who would be entitled to a repayment of charges is a ward of the Circuit Court and the Circuit Court has a concurrent jurisdiction with the High Court in wardship matters.  This concurrent jurisdiction is conferred by section 22(2) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961.  The registrar of the ward of the High Court only has responsibility for wards who have property with a value in excess of €6,350 or an income from savings and investments in excess of €380 per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">A patient whose property value or income from interest on savings or investments is below either of the thresholds mentioned by me could only be made a ward of the Circuit Court and the registrar of the wards of the High Court has no authority to act in such cases.  Authority in this instance rests with the relevant county registrar.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">The amendment amends the definition of a connected person in the Act to include county registrars and this puts beyond doubt the right of patients who are wards of the Circuit Court to have the county registrar apply for repayment of funds in line with the provisions of the Act.</p>

         the number of social and affordable housing units his Department expects to be completed in 2007 on foot of Part V of the Planning and Development Acts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#NoelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_400">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government  (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_815">Output from Part V has been increasing in recent years according as general housing activity has expanded and planning permissions which predated the implementation of Part V have been increasingly built out.  From a position in 2002 where just 46 homes were delivered, provisional data indicate that 1,600 affordable homes and approximately 600 social homes were delivered under Part V in 2006.  The total of approximately 2,200 homes delivered last year represented a very significant increase of approximately 60% on the corresponding level of delivery in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">Predictions of future output under Part V are necessarily subject to a number of uncertain variables.  These include the volume of housing development for which planning permission is granted, the finalisation of individual agreements between local authorities and developers, and the timing of commencement and phasing of individual developments.  Notwithstanding the uncertainty associated with these variables, it is estimated that 3,500 social and affordable homes will be provided under Part V in 2007, of which it is estimated 2,400 will be affordable homes.  This would represent a further significant increase in delivery of close to 60% compared with last year's level of activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">I am satisfied that Part V is rapidly gathering momentum and is being implemented effectively across the country, contributing significantly to the provision of social and affordable housing, within the comprehensive policy approach contained in the Government's recently launched statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_401">
            <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_818">I understand that approximately 80,000 homes were built last year.  Not every house is in a Part V scheme.  However, there is a very paltry return of approximately 3,000 homes when it should be 10,000, 15,000 or even 20,000.  It is a very poor result from Part V.  The question is directed towards local authorities and how they are performing.  Does the Minister of State have a list of local authorities detailing the ones with which he is not satisfied and those with which he is satisfied?  The average price of a home nationally has risen to more than €300,000.  That is a lot of money and it is not affordable for many people.  Other Deputies in the House have pointed out recently that in Kildare one would need an income of approximately €67,000 per annum to get into the market for affordable homes.  This is not sustainable.  The Minister of State is not providing lower income or even average income families with the capacity to provide their own homes.  He has failed completely.</p>
            <p eId="para_819">Does the Minister of State intend to address the issue of the footprint of the site in that not all groups of five or more homes or apartments fall under Part V because of a site restriction below which they do not have to operate under Part V?</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_820">Last year's output is considerable, if one looks at the figures over five years — 46, then 163, 600, just under 1,400, and 2,200.  That is a considerable increase.  Part V does not apply and was never intended to apply to everything.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_822">It does not apply to one-off housing.  While there is very little one-off housing around the Dublin area now, approximately 26% or 27% of housing in the country is one-off housing.  It increases as one gets further from Dublin.  It does not apply to small developments of under five units, nor does it apply to unzoned land.  Zoned land is still a peculiarity around the big urban areas.  As one goes out even to reasonable sized towns and villages further away from Dublin, the land is unzoned.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_406" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_824">It could, but that is not the purpose of Part V.  In many areas houses are not unaffordable.  The affordability problem is in the greater urban areas.  The 2001 Act related to zoned land on the basis that that was where the affordability problem lay and where there was a demand for affordable homes.  There is probably only another year or so of planning permissions that got approval before the new Bill came through.  As those old planning permissions die out, Part V will apply to everything.</p>
            <p eId="para_825">The Deputy mentioned that an income of €67,000 would be required to get into the affordable housing market.  That would be the case for a single person seeking to buy a three-bedroom family house.  One can play around with statistics and make the figures look ridiculous if one likes.  It is usually couples who seek three bedroom semi-detached houses.  Relatively ordinary people earning €35,000 or €40,000 would, as a couple, reach the amount cited by Deputy O'Dowd.  A single person with only one income would not normally buy a three bedroom semi-detached house.  That is not the market for which we are trying to cater.  Last year, 2,200 housing units were built and we expect an increase of between 50% and 60% on that figure this year.  Part V will be a significant source of social and affordable housing in the future.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_407">
            <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_826">Although 80,000 houses were built last year, there has been a poor response to the need for social and affordable housing.  Nothing the Minister of State has said indicates his intention to change his policy.  Will he change the size of the footprint of a housing site?  In some cases five or more dwellings are being built on small sites of less than 0.1 of a hectare.  These developments are not affected by Part V, even when they are on zoned lands.  Will the Minister of State change this regulation?</p>
            <p eId="para_827">Will he review the income limits for local authority loans so that people can take greater loans from local authorities?  Much affordable housing, particularly apartments, are very small.  Some are so small one could not swing a cat in them.  Affordable dwellings are often smaller and less attractive than other housing units in the same development.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_408" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_828">The loan limits have been adjusted several times.  They are usually adjusted every year.  It may be time to look at them again.  Raising income limits for loans sometimes simply means that a different category of people qualify for the loans and the houses become more expensive.  However, I will check those limits.  It may be time to make another adjustment.</p>
            <p eId="para_829">I accept that very small apartments were built in the past.  However, some time ago the Department issued new national guidelines for public consultation.  Many views have been expressed on this subject.  Some local authorities may already be implementing the new guidelines and they will have statutory effect when the consultation period has ended.  They require an increased apartment size and a mix of housing unit sizes in each development.  Some local authorities, including Dublin City Council, already have these requirements.  The guidelines will give them statutory effect.</p>

However, some 75% of householders to be accommodated by this sector are taken from local authority waiting lists.  The rental accommodation scheme caters for the accommodation needs of households in receipt of rent supplement who have long-term housing need.  The target group for RAS is the number of households on rent supplement for more than 18 months.  The target figure for the end of 2006 is 31,959 households.  There is, however, a significant overlap between households in receipt of rent supplement and those on local authority waiting lists.  In the 2005 assessments, 2,399 households were categorised as being homeless, 4,112 households were considered to be living in overcrowded conditions and 1,725 households were considered to be living in accommodation that was unfit or unsuitable.  Some 13,778 households on local authority waiting lists were in receipt of rent supplement according to the 2005 assessment.</p>

            <p eId="para_834">The Minister of State has not answered the question I asked.  What is the total number of people considered to have a housing need?  There are 60,000 households on rent supplement.  They are required to have a housing need in order to qualify for rent supplement.  Not everyone on a local authority housing list is on rent supplement.  The Minister of State gave the figure for those on local authority waiting lists and in receipt of rent supplement as 13,778.  This leaves 30,000 households on local authority housing lists and not on rent supplement.  This means the minimum number of households with a housing need is not 43,000, which figure the Minister of State repeatedly cites, but 90,000.</p>

How many households cannot meet their housing needs from their own resources?  For a long time, the Minister of State has farmed out all kinds of figures to mislead the public on this question.  He has done so again today.  The 60,000 households on rent allowance have a housing need.  According to the Minister of State's answer, there are 30,000 households on housing lists but not on rent allowance.  That makes 90,000 households.  Is 90,000 the totality?</p>
            <p eId="para_853">Is the Minister of State happy at that net result?  If not the final sitting day of this Dáil, it is the last day on which we will have environment questions.  On the final day on which the Minister of State answers to the House for the stewardship of his ten-year-old Government, is he satisfied that 90,000 households in the State cannot meet their housing needs from their own resources?  Of those households, 60,000 are in receipt of rent allowance and 30,000 are waiting on local authority housing lists.</p>

         if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there are approximately 3,000 households on the social housing waiting lists for County Louth local authorities and that this has been the case for ten years; his plans to rectify this unacceptable situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_868">The most recent assessment of social housing needs was undertaken by local authorities in March 2005.  The results of the assessment indicated that 1,492 households were in need of housing in the three County Louth local authority areas.  More comprehensive data from the 2005 assessment was published in the 2005 annual bulletin of housing statistics, a copy of which can be made available or found on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_869">The Government is providing local authorities with the necessary resources to address housing needs in their areas.  The programme of investment and policy priorities reflected in Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities underpin the approach to increasing housing investment as set out in the National Development Plan 2007-13.  The NDP envelope provides for an investment programme of approximately €21 billion, including €3 billion for rent allowance.  As agreed in Towards 2016, 27,000 new social homes will be commenced or acquired and 17,000 new affordable units delivered in the initial 2007-09 period.  The resources being made available under the NDP will allow for similar levels of activity post-2009.  In total, it is estimated that the needs of approximately 140,000 households will be met over the full period of the national development plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">Last year my Department provided the three local authorities in Louth with record funding of over €37 million for their housing construction and acquisition programmes.  The provision represented an increase of €8 million on the funding provided in 2005.  The provision enabled the three authorities to start construction of and acquire over 400 housing units and to complete and acquire almost 240 dwellings in 2006.  My Department has met with all local authorities this year in the context of their proposed housing programmes for the next three years under their individual action plans.</p>

            <p eId="para_871">Does the Minister of State accept that at the assessment point in 2005, many households were struck off the housing lists for failure to apply quickly enough to a local authority or, if they replied, because some minor error was detected in their applications?  It is the case that thousands of people were struck off the list or not counted.  Does the Minister accept that over the past ten years, the average number of people on County Louth local authorities' housing lists has been approximately 3,000, to which level they have returned notwithstanding the 2005 difficulties?</p>
            <p eId="para_872">I acknowledge the enthusiasm and conscientiousness of the current county manager who has a genuine interest in housing provision, unlike her predecessor.  Her genuine concern is improving the scenario in County Louth and it is only fair to acknowledge her efforts and those of her staff to meet the crisis.  Does the Minister of State have a plan to deal with the Louth housing lists which have remained at such a significant average level during his ten-year tenure?</p>

          <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_441" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_873">We have a plan as demonstrated by the new policy we announced some time ago.  There are also individual action plans and strategies in the local authorities, for which the Department provides resources.  The experts are the people on the ground at local authority level.  It is good to hear the Deputy's comments on the county manager.  Where officials and councillors really wish to drive these issues, progress can be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">On the striking off of households, the local authorities told us they went to great lengths to contact people on the housing lists.  Some people move around through the rent allowance scheme and end up acquiring multiple addresses.  I am not sure if there are three separate housing lists in Louth.  My constituency straddles the city and Fingal local authority areas and I tell people to register on the lists in both.  If there were three lists in County Louth, an assessment to establish the net figure will have resulted in a co-ordination of the names on all of them.  We do not consider figures on a monthly basis because while they are much higher, they are not verifiably correct.  Most of the names will have been removed from the list in Louth because people were on more than one list.  The figure of 43,000 was not equal to the sum for all three local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">We are providing very significant resources amounting to €1.5 billion this year.  Over the last couple of years, funding for local and voluntary social housing has increased significantly, especially in the context of the NESC report and the commitments in Towards 2016.  Funding has increased by 9% this year and a commitment has been made to provide 27,000 social housing units in the next three years, a figure far in excess of the total provided in the recent past.</p>

            <p eId="para_879">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this important question.  Deputies have been caught off guard due to the changes to the Order of Business.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">I am very conscious of the inconvenience and hardship being caused by the parasitic outbreak of cryptosporidium in Galway.  I have made my Department's resources and expertise available to the local authorities in Galway to help them to resolve the problem in the shortest possible timescale.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">Last Friday I travelled to Galway to meet the Galway city and county mayors and their officials, together with representatives of the Health Service Executive.  I subsequently briefed public representatives on the outcome of the discussions, during which an extensive package of measures to mitigate the effects of the current situation and to accelerate a permanent solution was agreed.  It was agreed at the meeting that the city and county councils would work to reduce the immediate impact on households directly affected by the present difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_882">The main points of the agreement include continuing the efforts to identify the source or sources of the outbreak.  The 2004 report of the National Disease Surveillance Centre stated that cryptosporidium is predominantly a parasite of neo-natal farm animals.  Water supply output from the Tuam plant will be increased to augment the city supply.  A pipe connects the Tuam plant to Galway and water may be transferred along it.  The additional water supply can come on stream within a matter of weeks.  The old Terryland water treatment plant will be phased out as additional water is delivered from the Tuam system.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">A package treatment plant will be installed at Terryland before the end of the year.  I have asked the authorities to be ambitious and to fast-track this plant.  It will provide 18 million litres per day, which is more than the current output from the old Terryland plant that is at the centre of the problem.  The longer-term upgrade of the Terryland treatment facility, which was approved for funding under my Department's water services investment programme from 2002 onwards, has an estimated cost of €21.46 million and is being fast-tracked.</p>
            <p eId="para_884">I also indicated last Friday that I would respond positively to a request from Galway County Council, which has sought funding of approximately €27.4 million for increased water storage capacity and additional conservation measures in the Tuam regional scheme.  This will allow water to be made available to the city as required in the longer term.  I have given Galway County Council permission to invite tenders for these works.  Incidentally, as the application was lodged only last November, the county council is to be commended on acting extremely rapidly.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">Additional resources will be provided to Galway city and county councils in respect of staffing to deal with the immediate problem and the exceptional costs of, for example, water quality testing or the delivery of water to households.  In addition, Galway City Council's recent application for permanent additional staff to work on its water services programme is being assessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">My main focus is on advancing the short, medium and longer-term solutions represented by the increased supply from the Tuam regional scheme, for which I am grateful to the county council, which should allow the old Terryland plant to be decommissioned; the installation of an interim package treatment plant; and the completion of a substantive upgrading project in Terryland.  Any assistance my Department can provide to the local authorities has been promised and will be forthcoming.</p>

            <p eId="para_895">I thank the Minister for his reply.  This is an extremely serious public health issue.  It constitutes a crisis for the people of Galway and could become a crisis in many other locations.  I appreciate the EPA has asked local authorities to identify immediately areas in which public water supply may be theoretically at risk.  I ask the Minister to provide Members with this information as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_896">The key question is why water tankers have not been deployed in Galway to supply households.  The Minister should respond.  Can the Minister comment on the report published in <i>The Irish Times</i> today that suggests the cause may be human contamination as a result of a complete malfunction of a sewerage works in a particular location?  The report states this extremely serious issue is due to over-development.  These are serious issues for Galway city and county, as well as for many other locations nationwide.</p>

            <from>Mr. Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_897">The point raised by Deputies Grealish and O'Dowd pertains to the immediate problem.  I accept they are both correct that there is a significant inconvenience for families in Galway and for large families in particular, who are obliged to haul water home from supermarkets.</p>
            <p eId="para_898">I raised this issue with the local authorities on Friday and indicated that I was willing to help them to overcome this problem.  Specifically, I suggested that if it would be helpful, I would ask my colleague, the Minister for Defence to make available either Civil Defence or Army transport to bring in water.  For reasons it has discussed, the council is not disposed to taking up that proposition.  I am aware the local authorities were working over the weekend on alternative means of providing emergency clean water supplies.  I have told them I will provide them with any assistance or back-up required to so do.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">I indicated yesterday to the council that I was somewhat frustrated to read and hear media reports to the effect that families still had not been provided with the relief mentioned by Deputies O'Dowd and Grealish.  I again indicated today that I am anxious for this to happen.  As a parent of four children, I well remember raising young children and I do not understand how large families in particular can cope with such an imposition.  The councils have been offered resources.   I have stated they may have tankers if they wish.  While I do not wish to trespass on areas that are the responsibility of the councils, I wish to be as helpful as possible to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">To be fair to Galway City Council, I realise it is dealing with a significant problem.  It has devoted many hours to the issue and is highly conscious of its potential impact on the city.  Deputy Grealish made the point to me earlier today that it is extremely important to send out the message that Galway remains open for business.</p>

            <p eId="para_902">It is not a "no go" area.  Boiling the water more than adequately deals with the problem and I understand guesthouses and hotels have taken steps on which I commend them.</p>
            <p eId="para_903">Deputy O'Dowd asked a second and much more pertinent question, which is also the subject of Question No. 12.  It pertains to the monitoring of water supplies.  I agree with him.  Last month, I introduced new water monitoring regulations that directly follow up on the suggestions made in the last EPA report.  The regulations make monitoring mandatory and include a requirement for accessible public information in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">The EPA's last two reports raised concerns regarding the quality and volume of monitoring taking place and indicated that while some local authorities were very good, others were not.  One of the plants identified specifically as being at risk was the old Terryland plant.  This is the reason there is so much mystification regarding the delays in Galway.  However, this has been changed.  The new regulations were introduced before the outbreak and I understand they took effect on 8 March.  If Question No. 12 is reached, this issue can be dealt with in greater detail.  However, I agree with Deputy O'Dowd that it is extremely important.</p>

          <speech by="#DickRoche" eId="spk_459" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Mr. Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_908">I thank Deputy Cowley for raising this question.  As Members are aware, I take a particular interest in rural housing and in the right of people to live in their own area.  The guidelines for planning authorities on sustainable rural housing came into effect in April 2005.  While the fact they are called guidelines is often taken to mean they are not statutorily based, they are.  Although local authorities sometimes assert they do not have a statutory basis, this is incorrect.  The guidelines were issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which requires planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála to have regard to guidelines in the performance of their planning functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">The guidelines provide that reasonable planning proposals on suitable sites in rural areas for persons who are part of, contribute to, or have links with the rural community should be accommodated.  As Deputy Cowley is aware, the guidelines also deal specifically with those who have a need because of disability and those who wish to return to their home place, particularly emigrants who have been abroad for a long time.  The guidelines thus affirm a presumption in favour of quality one-off housing in rural communities, provided proposals meet normal standards in respect of matters such as proper waste water disposal and road safety.  The guidelines also classify rural areas for housing purposes and specifically address those locations, such as CLÁR areas, that have suffered from depopulation.  The guidelines make specific reference to areas which have suffered systematic depopulation.  Following publication of the guidelines, my Department held two seminars for local authority planning officials on implementation of the guidelines and held discussions on the matter with the planning committee of the County and City Managers Association.</p>
            <p eId="para_910">Planning authorities have been asked to review their development plans with a view to incorporating any changes necessary to ensure development plan policies are consistent with the policies set out in the guidelines.  My Department is continuing to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the guidelines on an ongoing basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">As I stated previously to Members of this House and in Seanad Éireann, if there are instances where there is a clear breach of the guidelines, I would be delighted to hear about them.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_460" as="#Acting_Chairman">
            <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
            <p eId="para_912">I thank the Minister for his clear reply.  He stated, the "guidelines have a statutory basis as they were issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 which requires planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála to have regard to the guidelines in the performance of their planning functions."  With respect, that is the rock on which they perish.  "To have regard to" is a meaningless term which has already been tested in the courts.  A case was taken against Meath County Council for not enforcing the guidelines.  The difficulty is there is no binding requirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_913">Local authorities have no right to inquire about blood lines, as they are doing in establishing the right of a person to live in a particular area.  Great confusion has been created.  Even though the Minister stated the guidelines have a statutory basis, there is no adherence to them.  In west and north County Mayo in particular where the population has declined by 1,100, the number of one-off houses in the countryside is one third of the total, yet the percentage of planning permissions has fallen to 22% when it should be 33% to sustain one-off rural housing.  People are being asked intrusive questions they should not be asked, especially given that the area is in serious decline and there is no pressure on land.  The census figures which are due should confirm this state of affairs.  I am aware of returning emigrants who have gone home because of the guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">A similar situation pertains to the road safety regulations which the Minister left to the local authorities to enforce.  They do not enforce them and they are resisting them.  I tabled a question on this matter but it was not accepted.  The Minister is aware of the situation and I know he is concerned about it.  I received an e-mail from him confirming a telephone call he had with Mr. Tommy Gallagher about his concerns with the lack of enforcement of the regulations following the death of his daughter, Aisling.  The death of another girl in Donegal was also due to loose chippings, purely because these statutory regulations are not being enforced.</p>

            <p eId="para_916">Does the Minister agree with the Tánaiste — I do not always agree with the Tánaiste — that local authorities are a collection of elected councillors under the diktat of a county manager who is responsible to nobody? Does the Minister agree this has led to the current situation with the regulations on planning and road safety?  County managers are not answerable to anybody and the Minister does not appear to have power over them.</p>

            <p eId="para_926">We could argue about the issues of the local government managerial system for a long time but I reiterate councillors have significantly more powers than they realise sometimes.  It is incumbent on everybody elected to a local council, especially since the end of the dual mandate, to inform themselves of their powers and to use them judiciously.</p>
            <p eId="para_927">The interpretation and application of the guidelines, which is the central issue in the Deputy's question, is a matter for each local authority.  However, the managers and directors of services have a duty to ensure consistency among planners.  This has given rise to the frustration expressed by the Deputy.  They have a duty to ensure consistency among planners, both in terms of the interpretation and application of the guidelines.  Leadership and example is required at the highest level.  That is where the manager's role comes into play.  After all, the manager is the chief planning officer and it is he or she who must ensure consistency.  If there is inconsistency, a lack of transparency or a feeling that the guidelines are not being properly enforced, the councillors can raise that issue in open council.</p>
            <p eId="para_928">I am not convinced by the argument that councillors are particularly powerless.  If that argument is put forward often enough, the public will ask why we have councils at all.  We have them because they have specific powers.  However, I share the Deputy's concern on this matter.  The guidelines are intended to have, and do have, statutory application.  They are not something that is being operated on a pick and mix basis.  They should apply consistently and we will continue to monitor them.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">Deputy Cowley referred to the tragic case he brought to my attention.  I had the pleasure of speaking with the gentleman concerned on several occasions.  He should be listened to, and I have made certain points about his comments.  At every local authority level, these guidelines are applicable and they should be operated in a transparent, open and consistent way.</p>

          <speech by="#DickRoche" eId="spk_473" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Mr. Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_932">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 8 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_933">I met the Secretary of State for the Department of Trade and Industry, Mr. Alistair Darling, in London on 9 January last.  I have no plans for a further meeting with him before the end of the current Dáil session — I say that without smiling.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">My meeting with the Secretary of State focused on issues relating to Sellafield and, in particular, the THORP plant.  I made very clear to the Secretary of State the extent of the Government's concerns regarding Sellafield.  I strongly underlined our view that the operations there are uneconomic, environmentally damaging and have a particularly poor track record in safety.  I also emphasised our particular concerns regarding THORP, which has been closed for nearly two years following a serious leak.  I impressed upon the Secretary of State the Government's strong view that the operating life of THORP should not be extended and called upon the UK Government to undertake an international expert peer review of the safety case prior to the reopening of the THORP plant.  The response of the UK Secretary of State to this proposal was, regrettably, less than positive.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">I also advised the Secretary of State that while energy policy and supply was a matter for each individual State to decide, adverse consequences have arisen for Ireland as a result of nuclear policy decisions and actions taken by the UK in the past.  I pointed out to him that while the outcome of the energy review was supportive of new build, it was noticeably silent on the issue of reprocessing.  Clearly, continued discharges and ongoing safety concerns have been a feature of Sellafield reprocessing operations and if reprocessing is to become a feature of proposed new build then this would be of major concern to Ireland.  As stakeholders, we have a right to have our concerns taken into account.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">These issues had been highlighted in a written submission by my Department to the consultation process put in place by the UK Government prior to the publication of the energy review.  At present, the position of the UK Government is that subject to the reopening of THORP in the near future, existing reprocessing contracts will be completed in 2010.  In addition, I have been informed there are no plans to seek new contracts.  I also took the opportunity to make clear to the UK Government that any proposal for additional contracts for reprocessing at Sellafield would be opposed by the Government.  From my contacts with other governments in Europe, in the European Union and outside it, this would also be opposed vigorously by other governments.  Mechanisms for intergovernmental notification and co-operation between the Irish and UK Governments have been greatly improved and a series of co-operative measures were developed, agreed and put in place.  That is to the credit of the UK Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_937">These measures are working well and represent considerable added value to the co-operative relationship to which Ireland is entitled on matters relating to nuclear issues and Sellafield in particular.  These co-operative measures include the bilateral agreement on early notification of a nuclear incident, direct access to the UK radiation monitoring system, known as RIMNET, access for the Garda Síochána to Sellafield, access for the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to Sellafield and other nuclear facilities, significantly improved information exchanges, co-operation on emergency planning with the UK and improved contacts at regulator and official level for discussion of nuclear issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">I have little doubt that the diplomatic and legal initiatives of the Government on Sellafield have resulted in the greatly increased recognition by the British Government and its agencies of the priority accorded to the issue by the Irish Government.  While there remains a significant difference in views on this issue between the two Governments, I am confident that my meeting with Secretary of State Darling served to highlight the Government's ongoing commitment to securing the safe and orderly closure of the Sellafield plant.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_474">
            <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
            <p eId="para_939">At the outset, I acknowledge the Minister's intervention with the British Secretary of State on this important issue and I ask him to keep at it.  Does he accept that the British energy review will inevitably produce a whole chain of nuclear power plants?  In turn, it is almost certain that this will feed in material for reprocessing at Sellafield and therein is the nub of the difficulty with the British energy review.  Does he agree with that and the consequences it holds for the Irish people?  Does the Minister accept that among the consequences for the Irish people will inevitably be an ever greater health risk to people on the eastern seaboard?  Does he accept that cancer rates in my constituency of County Louth are currently running at 20% above the national average and one in five deaths is cancer related?  There is no reasonable explanation for that.  Is he concerned about the extraordinarily high death rate from cancer and incidences of cancer in the constituency?</p>
            <p eId="para_940">Is the Minister considering the establishment of an environmental task force, perhaps in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, to establish once and for all what exactly is the cause of the high cancer rates?  We would be delighted if Sellafield was not the cause because the problem might then be easier to solve.  However, at the moment we believe that it is the cause of the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">I am delighted the Minister is raising this case with the British at every opportunity.  I accept that he is enthusiastic in doing so.  However, does he agree that it is not working?  We need to join with the Nordic countries and others to form one European group to fight this scourge that is a plague on many countries in northern Europe as well as on our own country on the edge of Europe.</p>

            <from>Mr. Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_942">I agree with the Deputy's latter point and I have taken steps in that direction.  I have taken a number of opportunities to establish cross-community activity within the European Council of Environment Ministers.  I spoke to almost all the other Environment Ministers in Europe, especially those who do not have nuclear plants.  I recently convened a meeting in Dublin that was attended by Minister Pröll from Austria, colleagues from Iceland, Norway and the parliamentary secretary from Germany.  A declaration was signed at the end of that meeting, which could not be signed by Germany as it holds the Presidency of the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">There are concerns in Germany.  It is now trying to withdraw from nuclear power and we must start listening to that.  Iceland seems a long way from Sellafield but its Prime Minister has echoed precisely the concerns we have about the THORP plant.  This is a diplomatic initiative that should be pursued and I am grateful to the Deputy for his support in this.  I am grateful also to Deputy O'Dowd who has always been supportive of any initiative in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">The Austrian Minister, Mr. Pröll, has indicated that he will follow up the Dublin initiative with a further meeting to be held in Vienna in the early part of the summer.  I am aware from contacts with colleagues in Norway and Iceland that discussions on this issue will take place on the margins of the next meeting of Environment Ministers in the Nordic Council.  There will be difficulties to confront given that, regrettably, Finland has become involved in a nuclear build and Sweden is somewhat conflicted on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">As I said at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government, I have taken the opportunity to raise my concerns, which are shared by everybody in this House, at the manner in which the British have responded on the health issue and particularly on the question of an expert peer review.  For example, I raised this matter recently with Dr. El Baradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who indicated he would communicate our concerns to the British authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">The energy mix employed by any individual country is a matter for that country.  However, no state can be cavalier in terms of cross-boundary issues and the long-term effects and impacts of nuclear power.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_947">The subplot of this argument is the energy crisis in Britain, including security supply issues, Ukrainian gas and so on.  The British are approaching this issue from a totally different perspective than we are.  I agree that all parties in the House are <i>ad idem</i> in our opposition to nuclear power on our doorstep.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">However, other arguments are being put forward by elements in the media, engineers and others.  I do not agree with these arguments but we must confront them through a decisive debate.  One of the arguments coming into play relates to carbon emissions and the carbon footprint of nuclear power versus traditional power sources.  We must refute utterly in a sensible and logical way all the arguments in this regard.  The first action we should take, whether in this Dáil or the next, is to arrange a round table debate at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government to facilitate a comprehensive discussion of all these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">My greatest fear is the prospect of a terrorist incident at Sellafield.  Will the Minister bring to the attention of the IAEA our deep concerns in this regard and ask for its assistance?  As an independent nation, we cannot obtain the information we seek from the United Kingdom.  I understand the security issues in this regard.  Does the Minister agree there is a role for the IAEA as an international policing force and as guarantor of our rights in this area?</p>

            <from>Mr. Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_950">I fully agree there is a role for the IAEA.  The EU also has a responsibility in this area.  In addition to speaking with Dr. El Baradei, I have spoken on several occasions with Commissioners Dimas, Frattini and Piebalgs.  The uniformity of views in this House is helpful in drawing their attention to our concerns.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">I also agree with the Deputy that the nuclear lobby, which I regard as cynical and sinister, is using the issues relating to climate change and energy security as a means of scaremongering and encouraging a stampede back to nuclear power.  After the accident at Three Mile Island, the entire build stopped.  Unfortunately, however, there is now equivocation in some European states.  As Deputy Morgan observed, it is a self-serving analysis that will lead Britain to decide to expand its nuclear power capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">We must be continually vigilant through the means available to us.  I agree with Deputy O'Dowd that there is little we could do if a major incident took place at Sellafield.  This is the issue we must keep bringing to the attention of the British.  They have a moral responsibility in addition to their economic responsibilities.  The Deputies are correct that the way forward is through more effective lobbying from the non-nuclear states in Europe.</p>

            <from>Mr. Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_958">In 2003, Goodbody Economic Consultants were engaged by my Department to carry out a study that considered factors affecting the supply of land to the housing market, including the possible hoarding of building land.  There have been many discussions on this topic.  The study considered previous analyses of the housing and land markets and sought possible evidence of hoarding based on case studies of three areas, two urban and one rural.  The consultants' report, which is available in the Oireachtas Library, concluded there was no evidence, something which may surprise many people, that hoarding of land was a widespread problem or that there were excessive levels of land banking.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">Considerable investment has been made in servicing of land and the inventory of zoned and serviced land taken in June 2005 indicates the availability of some 14,800 hectares nationwide, with an estimated yield of 460,000 housing units.  The Government wishes to ensure that zoned land is used as promptly as feasible for residential purposes.  Therefore legislation is being developed to give powers to planning authorities to act on a selective basis to accelerate the development of appropriate zoned land for housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">The Government has approved the drafting, at my suggestion, of a designated land (housing development) Bill to provide for a "use it or lose it" scheme.  The general scheme of the Bill provides powers for planning authorities to enter into a binding agreement with, or to impose requirements on, the owners of designated land in order to bring such land into housing development; an amended compensation mechanism whereby designated land, if not developed in agreement or accordance with requirements imposed by the relevant planning authority could be compulsorily acquired at below market value; and as a possible alternative to compulsory acquisition, provision for the imposition by planning authorities of an annual development incentive levy on designated land.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">The general scheme also provides for mandatory registration of, and the imposition of a levy on, land purchase options.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">Landownership alone is not at issue: people with options could be a stymieing factor.  I hope the Bill, which will be comprehensive legislation, will get early passage through both Houses.  Obviously, it will not be passed by this Dáil but hopefully it will be passed by the next one.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_963">This is quite a radical step.  I agree with the Minister in respect of many of the issues he raised.  The key point is, however, that the legislation has not yet been published.  The principle being established is that land which is zoned for social and affordable housing and not so used can be compulsorily acquired.  Perhaps the Minister will outline what will be the effect on me if, say, I own 20 acres of zoned land outside Drogheda but wish to sell it for some other purpose.  For how many years must I have sat on the land before the new legal instruments come into force?</p>

            <p eId="para_964">The Deputy is correct.  This will be a radical move.  The legislation is currently being drafted.  We have a long way to go to perfect it.  The legislation will radically alter the situation.  One can subject land to compulsory purchase order for specific purposes but one cannot do so simply because people are sitting on it.  Where it is perceived the land is being sat on, which is a handy way of influencing the market, this device will be used.  The Bill will dramatically change matters and will provide local authorities with significant additional powers to intervene either where people have taken land into their ownership or where people bought options in order to stymie development.  I do not believe it will be necessary to use this on a wholesale basis.  However, the mere fact this legislation is being introduced should give those with ideas of holding land for negative purposes pause for thought.</p>

            <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
            <p eId="para_965">We are constantly told that legislation tends not to be retrospective.  The Minister tells us that sufficient land has been zoned for 460,000 housing units and it cannot be interfered with.  Servicing land is obviously a key issue and the Minister referred to the hoarding of land.  A balance must be achieved between the industrial and residential use of land.  For example, Intel has a huge capacity for water because it is a wet industry.  It is important to find the balance between housing and industrial development in order keep people in one area.  We must examine resources in that respect.  Local authorities often over-zone land to 1.5 times or twice the projected requirements because they wish to resist the possibility of land hoarding.</p>

We have seen the example of Dartmouth Square and such areas are becoming more essential by the day as our cities run out of green space.  Does the Minister agree it is now necessary to use that mechanism to purchase compulsorily some institutional lands in order to preserve green spaces?</p>

          <speech by="#DickRoche" eId="spk_489" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Mr. Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_969">The Bill does not deal with the latter point but it certainly deals with the point raised by Deputy Catherine Murphy.  In the lifetime of this Government we, that is, the taxpayers, have created equivalent water treatment capacity, for sewerage purposes, for an additional 3 million people.  If my memory serves me correctly, drinking water capacity has been created for an additional 1.25 million people.  Given that there has been a massive investment in such projects by taxpayers, it is important that their purpose cannot be stymied by hoarding land.  On the other hand, the Deputy is right in saying that local authorities tend to over-zone.  They do so for a positive reason, so people will not have an easy stranglehold on land.  In the recent past, however, some local authorities have gone way over the top.  I reluctantly intervened in two cases because of substandard planning — in one case to strike down the county development plan and in the other to issue warnings that I would strike down the plan.  I do not like the idea of Ministers intervening directly but the law is the law and if people behave improperly by excessive use of zoning, it must be curtailed.</p>
            <p eId="para_970">The legislation will answer the long-standing debate we have had since the Kenny report was published.  As regards Deputy O'Dowd's point, I believe it will have the effect of demonstrating that the Houses of the Oireachtas are anxious to ensure that people who have significant amounts of land are not tempted to interfere with the housing market by sitting on it.  I hope it is passed early in the next Dáil.</p>

            <p eId="para_972">I understand from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland that it has issued almost 120,000 radon measurement detectors since the establishment of its radon measurement programme in the early 1990s.  However, this does not indicate the full extent of measurements taken, as private companies also provide the service and detectors can be purchased from retail outlets.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">Radon measurements undertaken by the RPII since the early 1990s have involved: over 31,000 houses, over 3,800 schools nationwide measured under a programme commissioned by the Department of Education and Science and over 1,600 workplaces.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">A summary of the results, on a county basis, of the radon measurements carried out in houses up to 31 December 2006 is available on the RPII website <i>www.rpii.ie</i>.  Approximately 13% of houses measured were above the reference level where remediation works would be recommended.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, has reported on the radon measurements found in schools, and the results on a county by county basis are also available on the RPII website.  All schools which were found to have high radon levels have been remediated.</p>
            <p eId="para_976">In regard to workplaces, I understand that of the 1,600 workplaces measured, approximately 10% were above the reference level for radon in workplaces.  The Government, largely through the RPII, has for many years committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to highlighting public awareness of radon and the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to radon concentrations.  The RPII has consistently urged householders, particularly those in high radon areas, to have their homes tested for radon and, where necessary, to undertake the necessary remediation works.</p>
            <p eId="para_977">Government efforts and resources, together with those of the RPII, will continue to focus on highlighting public awareness of radon and on improving information to householders to enable and encourage them to address monitoring or remedial requirements effectively and economically.</p>

            <p eId="para_978">Is the Minister aware that more than 200 people die every year in Ireland from lung cancers that can be attributed directly to radon gas?  Would it not make sense, in the circumstances, to waive the fee being charged for one of these kits?  It has gone up from €50 to €54 and, according to my calculations, it would cost a mere €5 million to test the 90,000 homes directly affected.  This would be a sensible health measure to take, aside altogether from a sensible environmental measure.  Has the Minister given this any consideration?  In my view people are dying from this unnecessarily.</p>

            <p eId="para_979">The Deputy is correct and there is a responsibility on all of us to inform ourselves of the risks associated with radon.  A study in the United States found that 90% of radon-related lung cancer deaths occur among smokers and I was not aware of that statistic.</p>

            <p eId="para_981">That may be so but 10% of people do not fall into that category.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">I do not agree that the charging system put in place by the RPII is excessively onerous.  This issue arose previously; remediation is relatively easy and I was surprised on examining its cost.  I do not contest the figures presented by the Deputy and the vast majority of radon-related deaths occur among smokers and ex smokers.  I happen to be a former heavy smoker.  An element of responsibility lies with householders and businesses to ensure they avail of the tests.  The tests are very easy and involve a small device that is placed in two locations in a house.  The device is returned to the RPII and that organisation supplies the results quickly.  It is imperative that those living in areas with a high concentration of granite, such as Wicklow, where I live, get their houses tested.</p>

            <p eId="para_983">Does the Minister have statistics on people who have not availed of the test?  On the basis of the figures the Minister has provided it appears many people living in high radon areas are not testing and remediating.  This is clearly resulting in the deaths of more than 200 people every year.  It is scandalous that so many people are dying unnecessarily.  Would the introduction of free testing kits not be a sensible public health measure for this Government to take?  On examining the figures, €5 million is not a great deal of money if it saves lives.</p>

            <p eId="para_984">The Deputy is correct but €55 to have a house tested for a lifetime is not a large amount either.  The RPII website should be commended because it is clear and provides the relevant data.  Every county is shown on the website along with becquerel background levels, areas of high concentration and the number of tests that have been carried out.  The website shows that 2,800 houses in Kerry have been measured and the highest concentration of becquerels there was 49,000, which is astonishing.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">Deputies will be aware of the case in question.  A great deal of public information is available.  It is important that the RPII continues to provide public information and members of the public take some responsibility in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_987">The National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012, which I published earlier this week, includes limited provision for the purchase of Kyoto units by the State so as to assist compliance with the Kyoto Protocol in the period 2008 to 2012.  Deputies will be aware that under the plan, 80% of the requirement will be met domestically.  The strategy also sets out an explicit national policy framework for this purpose.  This will <i>inter alia</i> guide the National Treasury Management Agency, which will act as a national purchasing agent for the State in the conduct of its role, as agreed in the Carbon Fund Bill.  The framework requires that Kyoto unit purchases on behalf of the State shall be made with the objective of ensuring they contribute to the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system; that risk is minimised, particularly in relation to the timely delivery of credits; and they represent good value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">In purchasing Kyoto units the agency will also be required to ensure Ireland does not use credits generated from nuclear facilities and any surplus units at the end of the 2008-12 commitment period can be banked and used in a subsequent period of the Kyoto Protocol or any successor treaty.  To date, my Department has committed to investing €20 million in the multilateral carbon credit fund operated by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and a further €20 million in funds offered by the World Bank.  In the latter case, €10 million is committed to the second tranche of the biocarbon fund and €10 million to a new carbon fund for Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_989">The Carbon Fund Bill 2006, which came into effect this week, makes provision for the designation of the National Treasury Management Agency as purchasing agent for the State.  Further purchases will be a matter for the agency, having regard to the purchasing framework set out in the national climate change strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_991">Underlying the Deputy's question is the fact that some dodgy forms of credit are available on the market.  There is, in some of the declining eastern economies, what is known as "hot air".  As Deputies will be aware, it is also generated in the House on occasion.  The National Treasury Management Agency will not be involved in the purchase of this or of nuclear generated credits.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">It is interesting that the debate is opening up to a discussion on how carbon credits will be used.  Carbon credits could be phenomenally positive and have a significant impact on developing and transitional economies.  They could revolutionise living for people in sub-Saharan Africa, a region with no energy and credits to sell.  The ethical application of the carbon fund will have beneficial effects in addition to helping Ireland meet its targets.</p>

            <p eId="para_998">I am disappointed the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not present because this is a serious situation, as he acknowledged yesterday.  Last weekend <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> published a memorandum to claims supervisors in the Quinn Direct group outlining a series of steps being taken to drastically reduce the cost of claims to this group and therefore to dramatically increase profits.  According to the memo, a panel, consisting mainly of retired gardaí and some serving gardaí, was put together to investigate claims and to use “Their negotiation ... and persuasive skills” in settling claims on the doorsteps of claimants against this insurance company.  It further outlined that solicitors acting for claimants would be given incentives to persuade their clients to settle claims against Quinn Direct at greatly reduced amounts.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">These are explosive allegations.  In today's <i>Irish Independent</i> and <i>Irish Examiner</i> newspapers, Quinn Direct has taken out an advertisement claiming the memo is a forgery and denying the claims.  I believe the memo is not a forgery and that the claims in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> will stand up to scrutiny.  There is no doubt but that the——</p>

            <p eId="para_1000">I do not think the Deputy is entitled to make that claim in the House.  They are allegations.  The Chair is concerned about the use of language in this House, both as regards people outside the House who are not here to answer for themselves and also against Members in the House.  There is a long-standing tradition in the House and rulings of my predecessors going back to the foundation of the State, reflected in the Salient Rulings of the Chair, that Members should show restraint in the House in their use of language.  I would ask the Deputy to honour that long-standing tradition of the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_1003">I will discuss the point with the Ceann Comhairle at another time.  I will be more general for the remainder of this contribution.  However, I have said things before which have proved to be true.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">What is undeniable is that the profits of insurance companies have rocketed in recent years to the tune of hundreds of millions of euro — up to €500 million.  Clearly, the number of vehicles on the roads has increased but I have no doubt ruthless measures used by various groups were an important factor.  This is not about eliminating fraudulent claims but about pressurising ordinary, genuine people with genuine claims to settle for much less.  In claims of personal injury due to motor car crashes, there is a good reason not to rush into a settlement as long-term effects of injuries may not be evident early on.  Clearly, profits increased as a result.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">In 2005, another major insurance company awarded a lucrative contract worth approximately €40,000 to a recently retired, very senior member of the Garda Síochána to assemble a panel of claims investigators for that company.  Meetings of retired and serving gardaí were held in the second half of 2005 to advance this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">The fact that those among the most senior officers of the Garda Síochána can work in a job with serious traffic responsibilities and then, within a short period of retiring, work for multinational insurance companies raises the most serious issue.  It is similar to senior planning officials in local authorities resigning and then going to work for developers who have substantial dealings with the planning authority for which these officials previously worked.  I believe the insurance companies should be in public ownership to ensure that the interests of the public are served.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007">A so-called memorandum of understanding was signed by the Garda Commissioner and AXA Insurance providing an extraordinary situation whereby gardaí in the south east were instructed to call AXA recovery agents only to tow away vehicles involved or damaged in road crashes.  It is completely inappropriate for the police force to give a clear commercial advantage in an entire region to one arm of a major multinational insurance corporation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1008">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform informed me last week that gardaí in the south east had saved €10,000 as a result of this agreement.  We seek further clarification on that.  Of course, AXA would have gained enormously commercially from the arrangement.  The Minister also informed me that an exclusive arrangement between the Garda Síochána and AXA Insurance to have damaged vehicles in the Dublin metropolitan region towed away will be introduced in Dublin soon.  The capital has one third of the population of the State and this exclusive arrangement with the Garda would be an enormously lucrative situation for this insurance company.  What do the other companies, smaller garages and towing companies think of this proposal?  They will be cut out to benefit the major multinational, AXA Insurance.  I call on the Minister to halt this arrangement immediately and to arrange for a full discussion on the issues raised by these questions.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1009">On behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who cannot be here, I am pleased to respond to the matter raised by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">The allegations to which the Deputy refers emerged in a newspaper article last weekend.  Lest there be any doubt about it, these allegations are being taken most seriously.  The Tánaiste regards the situation as a matter of the utmost gravity and contacted the Garda Commissioner.  The Garda Commissioner shares the Tánaiste's view that the allegations in the article concerning an abuse of position are of the utmost gravity.  They are being treated seriously and are being inquired into fully.  The Commissioner has appointed a senior officer at assistant commissioner level to investigate the matter.  The Garda Síochána would welcome the receipt of any information that would assist the investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011">The allegation that serving members are being employed in a private capacity by motor insurance companies to assist in settling claims is something that must be treated with the utmost seriousness.  The idea that members of the force could use the official resources at their disposal in the service of a private company for their own personal gain is anathema to the notion of public service.  The thrust of the Tánaiste's policy on the Garda Síochána since he assumed office, as exemplified by the historic enactment of the Garda Síochána Act, has been to ensure that public confidence in the concept of an effective and impartial policing system is maintained.  For that reason, each and every allegation must be investigated and, where evidence exists, the perpetrators must be subject to the full rigours of the law.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012">In this instance the law is very clear.  An explicit prohibition on the disclosure of information was specifically inserted in the Garda Síochána Act 2005.  The section covers both serving and former members of the force.  Section 62 of that Act prohibits a person who is or was a member of the Garda Síochána, or its civilian staff, from disclosing information obtained in the course of his or her duties.  The section provides stiff penalties, fines up to €50,000 and-or up to five years' imprisonment for conviction on indictment in the ordinary course, increasing to €75,000 and-or seven years' imprisonment where persons who contravene its provisions receive any gift, consideration or advantage as an inducement to disclose any information.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">These penalties are severe and will cause any errant minority to think twice before considering releasing sensitive information.  The provision, in its original draft form, attracted a considerable degree of public controversy during its passage through the Oireachtas on the grounds that it would be unnecessarily restrictive.  However, the purpose of the legislation was to deal with a real concern that confidential and personal information about individual investigations was emerging in circumstances which were neither legitimate nor ethical.  The penalties in section 62 of the Act strike the right balance.  The great majority of members of the Garda Síochána would be appalled at the thought that colleagues might conduct themselves in this way and would instinctively support the fundamental policy aspect of the provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">In addition to section 62 of the Garda Síochána Act, serving and former gardaí are also governed by the provisions of the Official Secrets Act and the Data Protection Acts.  At an operational level, the Garda authorities take all the necessary precautions to ensure that information contained on their computer systems is secure.  As a practical measure, members' log-on accounts for the Garda Information System, PULSE-GNIB-FCPS are disabled upon their retirement to ensure that they cannot access any of the Garda IT systems.  The Garda Commissioner takes his responsibilities in this area very seriously and every allegation of misuse and abuse of information will be investigated vigorously.</p>

          <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_509">
            <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
            <p eId="para_1015">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.  The Ballinrobe youth development project has made considerable progress in a short time and has been invaluable to the youth of Ballinrobe.  This is a rapidly growing area with an increasingly diverse population, including a long-established and significant Traveller population and many newcomers.  The schools strive to support second level students, many of whose families are marginalised.  There is considerable concern among those families and in the community that their needs are not being adequately met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">The Ballinrobe youth development project was initiated at a local educational committee meeting in early 2005.  The committee's remit is to identify issues in the community that impinge on children's learning in order to address those issues.  Committee members represent a cross-section of the local community and include young people, parents, school and community representatives directly or indirectly involved in education.  The committee identified the lack of activities and facilities accessible to young people in the area.  Parents expressed considerable concern for and about their teenagers, particularly in respect of the lack of adequate facilities and activities.  The wider youth population confirmed this in a survey it carried out in November 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">Once the objectives were identified, work to establish the much-needed Ballinrobe youth development project began.  In January 2006, the project received welcome funding from the Department of Education and Science through the Mayo VEC, for which we thank the Minister.  Young people in crisis in the Ballinrobe area had already come to the attention of the Health Service Executive.  As there was no youth service in Ballinrobe, these young people had to access relevant support programmes in bigger towns.  Ballinrobe youth development project aims to provide direct intervention for young people, aged between 12 and 18 years — second level students — who are at risk of experiencing personal, family, educational or social problems to enable them to grow and develop to their full potential and overcome adversity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">The project also aims to expand and develop a range of voluntary youth group activities for the broader youth population and particularly for young people not involved in youth activities.  Ms Tara Gannon started work as the project's first youth worker in December 2006.  She is a source of hope for the young people of the area.  In her short time with the project, she has consulted widely with the youth, families, schools, wider community and related youth services, identifying key issues affecting young people to address through in-school and after school group activities and individual work.  Disenfranchised and marginalised youth have found a voice at last and are already participating in educational programmes and activities which Ms Gannon has set up.  She is actively empowering young people as evidenced in a recent open night which was organised and facilitated by young people from the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1019">Funding for a contract of four months' full-time work with the project will cease this month.  We are all extremely concerned about the implications of this for the young people of the area and for the future of Ms Gannon's work and the project.  Her enthusiasm, energy and great dedication has meant that in her short time at the project she has set up considerable activities and programmes to run beyond the expiration of funding.  Young people have big expectations arising from the work she has begun with them.  The project urgently needs to secure further core funding.  I urge the Minister of State to provide this so that young people can see these support programmes and Ms Gannon can build on the impact she has made on the young people of the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020">The management advisory committee has invested considerable time, effort and dedication in developing this much needed project, specifically for the purpose of empowering marginalised youth and young people of the Ballinrobe area.  The committee members have invested their time and toil in this project.  They have wonderful support from ForÓige, the employer of the youth worker, and ask that the Minister of State recognise the structures and strong links that have been established and support them to enable the project to continue its work on the behalf of youth of the area.  Ongoing funding would allow the Ballinrobe youth development project to continue its work, which holds so much educationally, personally and socially for the young people of Ballinrobe.  I hope the Minister of State can assist this valuable project and I thank the Ceann Comhairle most sincerely for allowing me to raise this issue.</p>

            <from>Mr. Haughey</from>
            <p eId="para_1021">I welcome the opportunity to comment on youth work programmes and services in County Mayo and in the Ballinrobe area, in particular, and I thank Deputy Cowley for raising this issue.  One of my areas of responsibility within the Department of Education and Science is the support and development of the youth work sector in Ireland.  The overall purpose of the youth work service in Ireland is to assist young people to realise their potential and to become active participants in a democratic society.  I am extremely conscious of the great benefits of youth work to young people themselves and to society.  I am also aware that this recognition requires appropriate support.  Through the youth affairs section of my Department, I work with the National Youth Council of Ireland, the national youth work advisory committee, which includes representatives of other Departments, and other interested parties to support youth work activities.  This support is provided by way of financial and other assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">Youth work programmes and services are provided primarily by voluntary youth work organisations.  In this regard, my Department provides a range of financial supports to the sector including support for projects for disadvantaged young people under the special projects for youth scheme; to national youth organisations under the youth service grant scheme; to a network of youth information centres, including a centre in Castlebar which is under the aegis of Youth Work Ireland — formerly the National Youth Federation; and to local clubs and groups throughout the country, including a number of clubs throughout Mayo under the local youth club grant scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023">Under the special projects for youth scheme, grant-in-aid is made available to organisations and groups for specific projects which seek to address the needs of young people who are disadvantaged due to a combination of factors, for example, social isolation, substance misuse, homelessness, early school leaving and unemployment.  Projects facilitate the personal and social development of participants thus enabling them to realise their full potential.  This aim underpins all programmes and activities covered by the scheme.  One special project in County Mayo receives funding under this scheme.  This project in north Mayo, which received grant-in-aid of €53,743 in 2006 from my Department, offers a wide range of programmes and services aimed at young people most at risk of early school leaving and involvement in crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024">The local youth club grant scheme was introduced by my Department in 1999 and it aims to support youth work activities at a local level.  These grants are made available to youth clubs and groups through the local vocational educational committee.  While the scheme is open to all those involved in the provision of youth work services at local level, it is intended that disadvantaged and marginal groups will be the priority targets, with further priority being given to young people between the ages of ten and 24 years.  While sports clubs are not eligible for funding under the terms of this scheme, funding for such clubs is available from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, under the sports for young people grant scheme.  This scheme encompasses a number of grants that can be grouped under two headings: youth grants designed to aid the ongoing costs of youth clubs and groups and special youth grants, which are once off in nature and intended to aid special youth work initiatives, particularly those aimed at disadvantaged young people.  In 2006, County Mayo VEC provided almost €21,000 to local youth clubs in the county on behalf of my Department under this scheme.  In addition, €57,000 was allocated to 59 local youth clubs from the dormant accounts fund in recent weeks.  These funds ensure local youth clubs and groups are appropriately resourced at local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025">The youth affairs section of my Department has received an application for funding on behalf of Ballinrobe area youth project.  This application was submitted for consideration in the 2007 round of grants under the special projects for youth scheme.  Funding allocations for 2007 are currently being examined by my Department and consideration will be given to this application in light of available financial resources, existing commitments in the youth sector and other applications.  My Department's objective is to finalise decisions on such applications before the end of April.</p>

          <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_511">
            <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
            <p eId="para_1026">In light of a 64% increase in fees on one estate, I wish to draw the House's attention to three case studies which will illustrate the activities of property management companies.  All will highlight the fact that such companies are protected by the Government while they rip people off.  An estimated 8% of people in Ireland now live in properties managed by companies and the proportion is much higher in Fingal, given the large amount of development there recently.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027">One of my constituents told me:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1028">I purchased a duplex under the shared ownership scheme with Fingal County Council this time last year.  I was told by Fingal County Council that the management fee would be €550 per year with insurance and bin charges included in that fee, though it seems other people were told different things.  I was also told the charge was paid for the year.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1029">I live in a courtyard and there was no street lighting in the courtyard.  They had the lights but did not switch them on until, if I remember correctly, late October or the start of November, which I found extremely dangerous while walking at night.  Also, I cycle a bike and for months I had to keep it in my apartment because they did not have adequate lighting in the bike storage areas.  To be honest I do not see much being done around the estate.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1030">Last summer the management company, Murphy Moore in Malahide, resigned.  Director Gerry Gannon, comically, is head of the development Robswall, known also as Gannon Homes.  A new management company was introduced, Smith Dunboyne, and again Gerry Gannon appears as the director, which is bizarre.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1031">I have not had much to do with them until now.  I got landed with a bill for €940 for service charges for my duplex, including €250 for refuse, which is a huge difference from what I was told last year.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1032">They provided a breakdown of the charges and one of the things I found most comical was external window cleaning.  I have been living there for a year and not once have they cleaned my windows.</p>
            <p eId="para_1033">There are many similar cases which beggar belief.  Another management company in Balbriggan, Brecan management company, has directors registered as Mark Colgan of Blencam, Kerrymount Avenue, Foxrock, Dublin 18, and Desmond Ryan, Ardfallen, Cunningham Road, Dalkey, but they are no longer directors.  The head of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, Mr. Paul Appleby, wants more resources to ensure company law is being upheld but is denied them.  People take that as a licence to flout company law so I ask the Minister to tackle these clear cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">The third example relates to a new form of landlordism, which the inaction of Government encourages and is exemplified by the exorbitant fees being charged.  A constituent tells me:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1035">Unfortunately things have not improved a great deal in my area.  I have e-mailed Smiths Property Management with the problems in Barons Hall.  In fact the only things I have received from Smiths is a bill for €387.26 and a final notice letter that they are going to sue me if I do not pay up immediately.  At this stage I am refusing to pay until I see some action being taken.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1036">The thing that angers me most about this company is the fact they do not even have the courtesy to reply to me by telephone, e-mail or letter — nothing.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1037">Smiths seems to be a particularly bad management company.  Charles Smith recently appeared on a RTE "Primetime" special about management companies, although he did not want to be interviewed or even show his face.  I wonder why.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1038">I have friends in Chieftans Way and Brackenwood here in Flemington, both in apartment blocks managed by Smiths.  Both have doors that do not lock.  In fact the apartment block door of my friend in Brackenwood has not locked now for two months and lights in the stairway have not worked for the same period.  She has e-mailed and telephoned Smiths numerous times and still nothing has been done.  This is the kind of service we have come to expect of this company.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1039">If I saw them do something with the green and act promptly when an abandoned car was reported to them I would pay my bill, even though it annoys me so much that this is something Fingal County Council should be doing but the fact they demand money and treat residents with such disrespect leaves me no option but not to pay and go to court if it comes down to that.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1040">If I had a problem with my phone bill... I could complain to a regulator but with the management company there is no regulator...</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1041">How the present Government has let these management companies come into existence really gets me angry.</p>

In recent times the Chair is concerned at the number of Deputies coming into the House, naming companies and individuals outside and making allegations against them when those people are not here.  There is a very long-standing tradition in this House and many rulings by my predecessors that this is not allowed.  I ask Deputies to desist from allegations in future.

            <p eId="para_1047">Apartment living will constitute a key part in the future of housing in Ireland from a number of perspectives, including spatial policy, efficient land use, sustainability, housing choice and affordability.  Successful apartment developments, providing good quality of life, depend on a range of factors, including the standard and quality of the units themselves, the quality of the general living environment, as well as convenience to workplaces etc.  A key factor, essential to the success of the sector concerns the quality of management in apartment complexes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048">Regarding the local authority's role and my Department's involvement in this area, planning authorities have been advised that they should not attach planning conditions requiring management companies for traditional housing estates, except in very exceptional circumstances.  I understand that this advice is now accepted by all planning authorities.  A working group chaired by my Department and involving relevant interests has been considering issues relating to the taking in charge of developments, including responsibility for the maintenance of certain shared facilities in newer type mixed estates.  It is intended that further guidance for planning authorities, based on the group's deliberations, will be issued shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">Management companies are an unavoidable feature of the interdependence that exists in multi-unit developments.  It is necessary to have management companies or similar arrangements to manage the common elements of apartment complexes and certain other types of multi-unit developments.  On the specific question of management charges, it is important to remember that the charges levied on property owners are determined by the management company of which the owners themselves are the members.  I realise that might sound somewhat theoretical, but it ought to be the case.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_1053">Up to recently, property management received relatively little notice in residential housing, but that has changed radically.  Much of the focus has been on negatives, including management fees, poor maintenance, complaints, management companies being dissolved and so on, and this has given rise to considerable misunderstanding and even misinformation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">I am glad to say that the information deficit has recently been reduced through a series of publications and consultation processes undertaken by a number of organisations, including the National Consumer Agency, the Director of Corporate Enforcement, Dublin City Council and the Law Reform Commission.  There is no doubt that better consumer information and awareness will help to avoid some of the problems and frustration that have been experienced in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055">My Department is not responsible for the wider range of legislation and regulation relevant to management companies in apartment complexes.  The Law Reform Commission's consultation paper on legal aspects relating to multi-unit developments is currently the subject of a public consultation process.  Possible measures to be taken in this area will be considered by the relevant Departments and agencies, and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has convened an interdepartmental committee to help develop appropriate legislative responses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1056">Indeed, a number of legislative measures are already in the pipeline.  The Government has already decided that property managing agents will be regulated by the Property Services Regulatory Authority under legislation currently being prepared by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Property managing agents are commercial firms engaged by management companies to provide management and maintenance services for which management charges are paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1057">With regard to company law, which is the framework within which management companies operate, forthcoming legislation will also provide a chance to ensure that the framework of law supports the effective operation of management companies.  It is a moot point whether there should be further regulation of management companies since they consist of the property owners themselves——</p>

We need clarity about when the management company starts, that is, whether it should start when all the units are privately owned or otherwise.  That limbo area is causing difficulty and needs to be resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1060">I believe the different processes I mentioned with deal with the issue.  The measures being taken by the different Departments and the interdepartmental consultation process on what is required in law will result in a successful apartment sector.  However, we must go through this process before reaching that.</p>

            <p eId="para_1066">Regulatory regimes have been in place for many years in Ireland prescribing strict EU based standards for drinking water quality and monitoring. Reports on Irish drinking water quality are regularly compiled by the EPA and are regarded as among the most comprehensive within the EU. In its latest (2002) Synthesis Report on the Quality of Drinking Water in the Member States of the European Union, the EU Commission identified Ireland and the United Kingdom as the two member states in which improvements in drinking water quality were significant and obvious. The latest relevant EPA report verifies the high quality of Irish drinking water, with 98.9% of public supplies being in compliance with all microbiological standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1067">The Drinking Water Regulations 2000 consolidated and updated earlier regulations, and they transposed the 1998 EU Drinking Water Directive and prescribed drinking water standards and monitoring regimes to meet the requirements of this Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1068">On 8 March 2007, prior to the Cryptosporidium outbreak in Galway City, I made the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2007 to update and replace the 2000 Regulations.  In particular, the 2007 Regulations require local authorities to monitor all water supplies, under the supervision and direction of the Environmental Protection Agency, and to ensure that any non-compliance with quality standards is immediately investigated and appropriate remedial action taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_1069">I am satisfied that the new Regulations will underpin the provision of comprehensive monitoring regimes for all water supplies and that further detailed requirements can also be addressed when the Water Services Bill, now at Dáil Report Stage, is enacted.</p>

The NDP provides the resources — some €18 billion in total, which will enable increased output from social and affordable housing measures resulting in the needs of some 140,000 new households being met in this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">These resources will be used to meet the needs of some 100,000 households by commencing/ acquiring 63,000 new social homes in the period 2007-2013, through a combination of local authority, voluntary and co-operative housing and new units for the Rental Accommodation Scheme.  Further households will benefit as they transfer to the Rental Accommodation Scheme with their existing landlords or from naturally occurring vacancies. Over the period   2007 to 2009, sufficient resources will be made available to commence/acquire some 27,000 new units of social housing.  In addition over the period of the NDP some 40,000 households will benefit from affordable housing.  17,000 of these will be delivered in the first three-year period, in line with the agreement in Towards 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">To ensure that these programmes are delivered in a coherent and coordinated manner City and County Councils have put in place multi-annual Housing Actions plans which encompass delivery of social and affordable housing in their area, including Town Councils.</p>

            <p eId="para_1089">The threat posed by the large and complex nuclear facility at Sellafield has long been a concern to the people of Ireland.  The actions of this Government have reflected that concern over many years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090">In 2001, and in response to the imminent commissioning of the MOX plant, Ireland instituted legal proceedings against the United Kingdom under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).</p>
            <p eId="para_1091">The action related, among other things, to the inadequacy of the environmental impact assessment carried out by the United Kingdom for the MOX Plant as well as the failure of the United Kingdom to take all steps necessary — and cooperate with Ireland in doing so — to protect and preserve the marine environment of the Irish Sea.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092">The UNCLOS Tribunal hearing began in June 2003 but was suspended to facilitate resolution of an issue raised by the European Commission that the case was more appropriate to matters of EU, rather than UNCLOS, competence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1093">Pending hearing of the substantive case, and following an application by Ireland, the UNCLOS Tribunal issued a Provisional Measures Order, which made provision for, inter alia, a review by Ireland and the UK of the mechanisms for inter-Governmental notification and co-operation.  Under this process, over the following three years, a series of co-operative measures were developed, agreed and put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">These measures are very valuable from Ireland's viewpoint.  They are working well and represent real added value to the necessarily co-operative relationship to which we believe Ireland is entitled on nuclear issues. The Bi-Lateral Agreement on Early Notification of a Nuclear Incident, direct access to the UK Radiation Monitoring System (RIMNET), access for the Garda Síochána to Sellafield, access for the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) to Sellafield and other facilities, significantly improved information exchanges, co-operation on emergency planning with the UK, and improved contacts at regulator and official level on nuclear issues, all provide objective evidence of real improvements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">The judgment of the European Court of Justice of 30 May 2006, inter alia, declared that Ireland, by instituting proceedings against the UK under UNCLOS, had failed to fulfill its obligations under Community Law.  This judgment established that certain provisions of UNCLOS form part of the Community legal order and that the ECJ has exclusive jurisdiction to determine disputes between Member States on their interpretation and application.  Following consultation with the Attorney General, the case taken by Ireland against the UK under UNCLOS will not now proceed. The Commission and the UNCLOS Tribunal were informed accordingly on the 16 February last.</p>
            <p eId="para_1096">The case taken by Ireland under UNCLOS has served the purpose of identifying the concerns of Ireland in relation to Sellafield on the international stage and more particularly at EU level. It has also led to significant improvements in the level of co-operation and information received from the UK in relation to Sellafield. Lack of co-operation and information from the UK on the issue was one of the significant claims made by Ireland in the UNCLOS case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">The ECJ in its judgement against Ireland provided clarity in that certain international agreements now fall exclusively within the Court's remit insofar as disputes arise under them.  This applies not only to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (which was in dispute in this case) but also potentially to other international conventions whose aim is to protect the environment. Accordingly, the ECJ and the European Commission are now placed centre stage in respect of Ireland's concerns regarding discharges and safety at Sellafield. In my meeting with Commissioner Piebalgs in January 2006, I made clear to the Commissioner that the Commission needs to respond to these concerns and become more proactive on the Sellafield issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1098">Since Ireland began its case against the UK under UNCLOS in 2001, the Commission has instituted two actions against the UK in relation to Sellafield under the terms of the EURATOM Treaty. Following my meeting with Commissioner Piebalgs, the Commission issued a Decision (15 February 2006) against Sellafield in respect of the THORP leak. This follows the Directive issued by the Commission against the UK in March 2004 in respect of the B30 ponds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099">The UK have lodged an appeal in the ECJ (April 2006) against the Commission Decision on the THORP leak claiming inter alia that the Commission does not have the competence to adopt the decision because it is based on safety concerns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1100">While the broad legal landscape regarding disputes between Member States has changed, this Government's fundamental position has not.  Our policy continues to reflect the firm position that Sellafield is an unacceptable threat to Ireland and that it should be closed in a safe and orderly manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101">I will continue to ensure that the concerns of Ireland are represented directly to the European Commission in relation to Sellafield at Commissioner and Senior Official level and that the current actions against Sellafield by the Commission are continuously monitored to ensure that they are sustained and effective. The Attorney General will also monitor developments at the European Court of Justice. The Government, as in the past, will continue to explore all legal, diplomatic and political options open to it on an ongoing basis in order to ensure the concerns and interests of the Irish people are represented and protected in relation to the continued operation of the Sellafield Plant.</p>

            <p eId="para_1103">The Government consider that home ownership should be made available to as many people as possible where this is their preferred option.  Local authorities play a key role supporting paths to home ownership for lower income groups.  Over 23,000 households were assisted through all measures between 2002 and 2006 with activity in 2006 up over 30% on the 2002 figure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">This includes paths from social housing such as tenant purchase and mortgage allowance, as well as house purchase loans.   The new incremental purchase scheme announced in Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities will provide a new option in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">In more recent years, there has been an emphasis on the provision of affordable housing.  The Affordable Homes Partnership (AHP) is assisting authorities to increase the delivery of affordable housing.  The AHP and local authorities are working to deliver some 17,000 new affordable homes over the period 2007 to 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106">It is evident that the needs of a broad range of home purchasers are being addressed through these schemes.  I am satisfied that they provide a strong foundation for achieving the Government's ambitious targets for the delivery of support to home purchasers in the coming years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1108">Kerry County Council's Castleisland Sewerage Scheme Stage 2 is included in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007 as a scheme to commence construction in 2007, at an estimated cost of €5.57m.  The scheme involves the upgrading of the existing town sewerage system in Castleisland and the extension of the sewer network to cater for unserviced existing and future development in the town environs for the next 25 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1109">In January of this year, my Department asked Kerry County Council to review certain aspects of the Preliminary Report.  Because of the large scale of the provision for future development in the current proposal the council was asked to review, in particular, the scope of the scheme and to consider carrying out the work in a number of phases.  My Department also asked the Council to review its Water Services Pricing Policy Report for the scheme.  This review will allow the value of the Exchequer and the non–domestic sector capital contributions towards the overall cost of the scheme to be determined and should result in a reduced cost to the County Council.   My Department is awaiting a response from the Council.</p>

The Regulations provide that such objections must be made within a three-month period of the site being notified and it is now necessary in the context of EU infringement proceedings against Ireland under the Habitats Directive to strictly enforce this three-month limit.   There are no proposals to amend the Regulations at this time.  However, I understand that a new mechanism for amending boundaries to SACs, post-adoption, is to be devised by the European Commission in consultation with Member States; at that stage the position will be reviewed.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_1115">I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 39 and 536 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1116">The total cost incurred to date in the development and roll-out of the electronic voting and counting system is €51.3 million (including some €46 million in respect of hardware costs, €2.6 million in respect of awareness and education initiatives and €0.1 million in training costs for returning officers and their staff). In addition, information provided by returning officers to my Department indicates that the annual storage costs for the electronic voting machines and ancillary equipment is currently some €706,000, with figures for 2005 and 2004 amounting to some €696,000 and €658,000 respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1117">Arrangements are now underway for the storage of electronic voting equipment at centralised premises in Gormanston and machines from a number of constituencies have already been transferred to the Gormanston facility. It is not possible to detail conclusively at this stage the total costs which will be associated with the centralised storage arrangements.  Arrangements have been made for the procurement of 48 metal storage containers and ancillary items for Gormanston Aerodrome at a cost of €112,750 (excluding VAT).  In addition, preparatory work has been carried out on the hangar at a cost of some €7,000.Responsibility for the security and safe storage of manual voting equipment is a matter for returning officers, who are statutorily responsibility for conducting the polls.  Accordingly, similar responsibility was assigned to them in relation to the storage of the electronic voting machines and equipment. In the majority of cases, returning officers entered into leases in respect of storage premises for the machines. I propose to circulate with the Official Report a tabular statement setting out information provided by returning officers regarding storage arrangements entered into by them in each of the 25 locations involved. It would not be appropriate to comment at this stage on detailed costs that might be involved in the buy-out of leases given the commercial considerations involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1118">The timing of the further use of the system is dependent on the outcome of the ongoing work of the Cabinet Committee on Electronic Voting, the associated decisions arising in this regard, and the dates on which future polls may be held.</p>

            <p eId="para_1197">The income limit for the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes was increased with effect from 1 January 2006.  Persons whose income in the previous tax year was €40,000 or under for a single income household or €100,000 or under for a two income household, using the formula of 2½ times the main income plus once the secondary income, are eligible for the schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198">The maximum loan a local authority may advance in respect of the share of a dwelling being purchased (minimum 40%) under the Shared Ownership Scheme is €185,000.  This maximum loan amount could facilitate the purchase of a home costing €462,500.  Accordingly, certain local authorities impose a maximum house price limit for shared ownership transactions in their area where they deem it necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1199">The core objective of housing policy in Ireland is to enable every household to have available an affordable dwelling of good quality, suited to its needs, in a good environment and, as far as possible, at the tenure of its choice.  While the take-up on the shared ownership scheme has declined in recent years, possibly due to the availability of affordable housing under other delivery mechanisms and the availability of cheaper finance in the market due to historically low interest rates, I am satisfied that the scheme, by assisting individuals seeking to acquire their own home, continues to play an important part in contributing towards the achievement of this objective.</p>

            <p eId="para_1217">Under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006, each local authority is required to prepare a housing strategy identifying the full range of housing needs in the authority's area and is obliged to zone sufficient land to meet the needs identified.  The housing strategy also provides the basis for determining the percentage, up to 20%, of land zoned for residential development or for a mix of residential and other uses that may be reserved for social and affordable housing purposes under Part V.</p>
            <p eId="para_1218">Part V establishes a firm legal basis through which a proportion of the benefit accruing from both the zoning and granting of planning permission can be captured to support the achievement of the desirable public policy objective of delivering social and affordable housing.  It balances the objective of focusing delivery with the requirement that needs in this regard are clearly identified in the housing strategy and that delivery takes place in a plan-led manner through each local authority fulfilling its statutory obligation to zone sufficient land to meet the identified requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1219">The overall approach underpinning Part V has been considered by the Supreme Court and found to be Constitutional.  I am satisfied that the balanced approach involved provides a robust basis for the effective operation of Part V, as evidenced by the increasing levels of delivery now being achieved.  Accordingly, I have no proposals to amend the legislation to apply Part V to unzoned land.</p>
            <p eId="para_1220">In relation to the minimum size threshold for sites to which Part V applies, the initial threshold of 0.2 hectares was reduced to 0.1 hectares under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002.  This change was made in order to take account of the potential for increased housing delivery on smaller sites arising from the implementation of policies in relation to increased residential densities.  I am not aware of any significant loss of delivery under Part V due to a widespread incidence of housing developments of 5 or more units being achieved on sites of less than 0.1 hectares.  Accordingly, I have no proposals to amend the legislation in this regard, but will keep its operation under review.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_1233">There has been a marked improvement in recycling performance in Ireland over the past ten years.  Government policy on waste management is set out in a suite of policy documents  — Changing Our Ways (1998), Delivering Change (2002), Taking Stock and Moving Forward (2004) and the National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste (2006) — published over the course of the past decade.  The provision of an expanded network of civic amenity sites and bring banks, the provision of segregated collections for dry recyclables to more households, the roll out of Pay-by-Use and increased awareness through the Race Against Waste have combined to help achieve many national and EU targets for recovery and recycling of municipal waste.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">National waste statistics for all waste streams are published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with the most recent National Waste Report being in respect of 2005. EPA waste statistics indicate the following progress in waste recovery and recycling in Ireland:</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">9% of our municipal waste was recycled in 1998; this has risen to 34.6% in 2005, essentially meeting the target of 35% set for 2013 in Changing Our Ways;</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">59.6% of packaging waste was recycled in 2005, compared with 15% in 1998.  This is some 10% in excess of the European Union target set for 2005 and essentially achieves Ireland's 2011 mandatory EU target of 60% six years ahead of schedule;</p>
            <p eId="para_1237">in 2005, construction and demolition waste recycling exceeded the 2013 target of 85% by 2%;</p>
            <p eId="para_1238">the quantity of waste deposited at bring banks and civic amenity sites in 2005 grew  by 12% and 25% respectively in comparison with 2004;</p>
            <p eId="para_1239">kerbside collection grew by 46% in 2005 while glass recycling jumped by 9% over the 2004 level to reach 64%;</p>
            <p eId="para_1240">2.3m items of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) was recycled in the first year of operation of a new Producer Responsibility Initiative and broke the EU target of 4kg per inhabitant by 2.7kg set for 2008;</p>
            <p eId="para_1241">the numbers of bring banks grew from 837 in 1998 to 1937 in 2005 and the number of civic amenity facilities grew from 30 to 81 over the same period;</p>
            <p eId="para_1242">since 2002 my Department has allocated almost €100 million in capital grants to assist local authorities in the provision of recycling and recovery services.  The projects assisted include bring bank networks, civic amenity sites, materials recovery, composting and biological treatment facilities;</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">the amount of waste going to landfill has dropped by 8.4% since 2001;</p>
            <p eId="para_1244">successive National Waste Reports suggest a decoupling of waste generation from economic growth.  Since 2001 economic growth has exceeded the rise of waste generation by 5.3%;</p>
            <p eId="para_1245">a farm plastics recovery scheme operated by the Irish Farm Films Producers Group has made consistent progress since its establishment in 1997 with an estimated 12,500 tonnes collected for recycling in 2005.  The arrangements for the scheme were enhanced in 2006 to improve collection and recovery systems, including the operation of local authority bring centres;</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">the Waste Management (End-of-Life Vehicles) Regulations 2006 governing the recycling of scrap cars were introduced in 2006 and came fully into operation on 1 January 2007.  Over 65 authorised treatment facilities are currently permitted by local authorities;</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">a multi-annual National Waste Prevention Programme was established in 2004 within the EPA.  This programme aims to deliver substantive results on waste prevention and minimisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1248">a Market Development Group was established in 2004 with the aim of realising the full potential of collected recyclable material by establishing new markets for that material.  The Market Development Programme is currently being finalised and will be published shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1249">The Government is determined to drive forward and build on these recycling achievements, supported by appropriate infrastructure to deal with waste that cannot be prevented or recycled.  Waste-to-energy treatment can make an environmentally valuable contribution in this context, given requirements on diversion of waste from landfill under the EU Landfill Directive.  The National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste, published in April 2006, sets out a series of measures through which these targets can be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1250">The following table summarises progress towards municipal waste recycling targets in recent years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1438">Draft Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Design Standards for Apartments were published by my Department for public consultation on 9 January this year, with the closing date of 5 March for receipt of comments and submissions.  Forty submissions have been received and are currently being considered by my Department.  It is intended to finalise the guidelines for publication as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1439">The primary aim of the draft Guidelines is to promote sustainable urban housing by ensuring that the design and layout of new apartments will provide satisfactory accommodation for a variety of household types and sizes — including families with children — over the medium to long term.  The guidance focuses on the apartment building itself and on individual units within, and sets recommended target average floor areas and a mix of unit types/sizes in apartment developments to help to ensure sustainable residential communities and facilitate integrated developments for different categories of occupants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1440">The new guidelines form part of a suite of guidance being prepared by the Department within a wider housing/planning context, which will also include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1441">new sustainable residential development guidelines which will incorporate a revision of the 1999 residential density guidelines;</p>
            <p eId="para_1442">a new best practice urban design handbook illustrating, with examples drawn from current practice, how the policies set out in the residential development guidelines should be implemented; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1443">the Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities guidelines (published last week) which revise and update the 1999 Social Housing Design Guidelines, focussing on the process surrounding the delivery of quality housing for sustainable communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1444">The final apartment design guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  This will require planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála to have regard to them in the performance of their functions.  However, pending finalisation of the guidelines, planning authorities are being requested to have regard to the recommended standards for new apartment schemes, when preparing or varying development plans and local area plans, particularly when their current plans incorporate older standards.</p>

            <p eId="para_1448">The process of breaking down the 20% commitment and allocating a 2020 target to each Member State has not yet commenced.  Therefore, it is too early to give an accurate indication of the likely 2020 target for Ireland or any Member State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">The National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012 presents two indicative scenarios based, respectively, on a 20% and 30% reduction, and assuming that the further cut required of Ireland, in comparison to its Kyoto target, is pro-rata to that of the EU as a whole.  Under those assumptions, further emissions reduction of between 9 million and 16 million tonnes would be required by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_1450">It is also too early to estimate the extent to which the Government may opt to use carbon credits to supplement domestic greenhouse gas emission reduction measures in the period post-2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_1453">I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 82 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454">The significance of the construction industry, including the housing sector, to the Irish economy is acknowledged.  In addition, the strength of Ireland's economic performance, which most commentators consider is likely to continue, is itself a key factor underpinning the strength and stability of the housing market.  Government policy is supportive of the continued stable development of the housing sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">A key policy objective has been to achieve an appropriate level of housing supply to meet demand.  The record shows that this has been achieved amidst unprecedented growth over the past ten years.  Moreover, high levels of housing output in recent years must be viewed in the context of a relatively low ratio of housing stock to population compared with other EU States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">Both economic and demographic factors are likely to continue to underpin demand for housing into the future with all commentators expecting that house completions in 2007 will be lower than 2006.  This would appear consistent with a view expressed by various commentators that housing output should ease to a more sustainable long-term pattern as supply and demand come into better balance.  Forecasts prepared for my Department suggest that the population could increase by one million over the next 15 years.  Commentators have, therefore, suggested that demand for housing may be for some 600,000 additional homes for the nine-year period up to 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">I would also expect that any easing in residential construction employment will be offset to a great extent by an increase in non-residential construction.  This will be partly underpinned by the impressive level of financial funding available under the largest ever infrastructure investment programme in the new National Development Plan 2007–2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">My Department will also be playing its part, and has already made a substantial commitment of over €18 billion investment, to ensure that 140,000 new households will benefit from housing programmes over the period of the NDP.  This will be done in a way consistent with market conditions and having regard for the building of sustainable communities.</p>

Factors such as fuel efficiency and safety are taken into account in making purchases for the Ministerial Fleet.  Hybrid vehicles which are electric/petrol combination vehicles have significantly better fuel consumption and significantly reduced emissions compared to equivalent conventional models.</p>

            <p eId="para_1467">I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 40 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1468">The recent report by the Environmental Protection Agency demonstrates the seriousness of the threat posed by climate change.</p>
            <p eId="para_1469">The EPS report clearly identifies a range of impacts on Ireland that could result from sustained temperature increases.  These include increased river and coastal flooding, water shortages in summer, negative impacts on water quality, changes in the distribution and viability of species in Ireland, and serious potential impacts on Irish fish stocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1470">These impacts highlight the urgent need for a global response to climate change.  The Government strongly supported the EU's call for a global and comprehensive post-2012 agreement consistent with meeting the 2 Celsius objective.  In this regard, the Government has endorsed the EU's proposal to commit to a reduction of 30% of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 as its contribution to a global and comprehensive post-2012 agreement, provided that other developed countries commit themselves to comparable emissions reductions and economically more advanced developing countries adequately contribute to the global effort.</p>
            <p eId="para_1471">Notwithstanding the significant international efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, some change in the global climate system is inevitable due to current and historic emissions.  Potential impacts in Ireland are already being addressed in a number of policy-making areas.  The Government has appointed the Office of Public Works as the lead agency to implement flooding policy in Ireland, which includes a combination of structural works where flooding is already a problem, non-structural measures and awareness raising.  Local authorities now have the power to consider adaptation initiatives in relation to their development plans and to provide that development in areas at risk of flooding may be regulated, restricted or controlled.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472">The National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012 commits the Government to developing a national adaptation strategy by 2009, to provide a framework for the integration of adaptation issues into decision-making at national and local level.</p>

            <p eId="para_1484">In addition to the funding provided by the ERTDI, my Department has committed Exchequer funding of €8 million over the 2007 — 2008 period for research into a range of projects related to climate change.

            <p eId="para_1486">The Mixed Oxide (MOX) Plant at Sellafield utilises plutonium, separated during reprocessing of spent fuel for foreign customers at Sellafield, and returns it, predominantly by sea, to those customers in the form of MOX fuel for use in their nuclear reactors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1487">Such shipments of radioactive material are subject to international maritime regulations including the right of innocent passage and to strict international safety standards applicable to the marine transport of such material.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">The continuing concerns of the Irish Government in relation to all transports of radioactive material through the Irish Sea are regularly and repeatedly conveyed to the UK Government at Ministerial and official level.  Ireland also co-operates on this issue with like minded coastal States at international fora such as the International Atomic Energy Agency.  Our concerns relate to safety, security and environmental risk from a potential accident or incident.</p>
            <p eId="para_1489">Arising from our efforts over the years, information is made available to Ireland on a voluntary and confidential basis by the Governments of shipping States, principally, Japan, France and the UK, in relation to shipments of radioactive material including MOX fuel.  The Irish Government in response makes clear that such shipments are unwelcome, and seeks and obtains assurances from shipping States that such shipments will not enter Irish territorial waters and that they comply with the stringent system of regulation established in line with internationally agreed standards and practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1490">During 2006, there were two shipments of MOX fuel from Sellafield.  In accordance with normal practice, information was made available to Ireland regarding each of these shipments.  The information received was made available to the relevant Government Authorities including the Coast Guard Service.  It is a matter for the Coast Guard Service to determine and carry out any monitoring or other requirements in respect of these shipments.  The Coast Guard has access to Naval resources (and other resources of the State) as and when required to address operational requirements on a case by case basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1491">The arrangements whereby information is made available to Ireland on a voluntary and confidential basis by the Governments of shipping States, including the UK, are long standing and welcome.  There is no reason to doubt the veracity of the information made available on a Government to Government basis to Ireland under this process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1498">The purchasing framework provides that purchases shall be made in accordance with a number of specific objectives including "that they contribute to the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, i.e. stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system".</p>
            <p eId="para_1499">In purchasing Kyoto Units, therefore, the key consideration is to ensure that projects from which allowances are generated have been approved by the relevant authority for the flexible mechanism concerned; for example, by the CDM Executive Board in the case of the Clean Development Mechanism.</p>
            <p eId="para_1500">As Purchasing Agent for the State, it will be a matter for the National Treasury Management Agency to develop and implement an appropriate purchasing programme, having regard to the purchasing framework set out in the National Climate Change Strategy.

            <p eId="para_1505">Consideration of the EU Commission's proposal for a directive establishing a framework for the protection of soil is in the early stages. The proposal for a directive is part of a package adopted by the Commission in September 2006 arising from the EU's 6th Environmental Action Programme. Although soil protection provisions exist in the body of Community legislation there is no specific legislation on soil protection. The package aims to fill this gap and has the objective of establishing a common strategy for the protection and sustainable use of soil based on the principles of integration of soil concerns into other policies, preservation of soil functions within the context of sustainable use, prevention of threats to soil and mitigation of their effects, as well as restoration of degraded soils to a level of functionality consistent at least with the current and approved future use.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">In general the Government welcomes the proposal and accepts that it is appropriate to have an EU wide initiative in this area but that, given the diverse nature and condition of soils in the Member States, policies should be flexible and adaptable.  My Department has had input from the Department of Agriculture and Food on the Commission's proposal and will continue to liaise closely with that Department as consideration of the proposal progresses.</p>

Details of an initial analysis of these data are contained in reply to Question No. 61 on today's order paper.</p>
            <p eId="para_1509">The key components of our housing policy, which are centred on ensuring that there is sufficient supply to meet demand and providing support to those who cannot meet their accommodation needs without assistance, are outlined in the Government's new housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1510">The housing policy statement and the National Development Plan 2007-2013 (NDP) also provide for a significant expansion of social and affordable housing to meet accommodation needs of households which are not served by the market, as already envisaged in Towards 2016.  The NDP provides the resources — some €18 billion in total which will enable needs of some 140,000 new households to be met in this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1511">These resources will be used to meet the needs of some 100,000 households seeking social housing by commencing/ acquiring 63,000 new social homes in the period 2007-2013, through a combination of local authority, voluntary and co-operative housing and new units for the Rental Accommodation Scheme.  Further households will benefit as they transfer to the Rental Accommodation Scheme with their existing landlords or from naturally occurring vacancies. Over the period   2007 to 2009 sufficient resources will be made available to commence/acquire some 27,000 new units of social housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1512">In addition over the period of the NDP some 40,000 households will benefit from affordable housing.  17,000 of these will be delivered in the first three-year period, in line with the agreement in Towards 2016. In accordance with the NESC report we are also ensuring that these new homes are delivered to a standard which will result in the kind of high quality integrated sustainable communities which are worth building.</p>

            <p eId="para_1516">I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 64 and 76 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1517">There has been remarkable progress in recycling in Ireland in the past decade.  National waste statistics for all waste streams are published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  National Waste Reports have been published in respect of the years 1998, 2001 and 2004 with interim reports published in respect of 2002, 2003 and 2005.  EPA waste statistics indicate the following progress in waste recovery and recycling in Ireland since 1998:</p>
            <p eId="para_1518">9% of our municipal waste was recycled in 1998; this has risen to 34.6% in 2005, essentially meeting the target of 35% set for 2013 in Changing Our Ways;</p>
            <p eId="para_1519">59.6% of packaging waste was recycled in 2005, compared with 15% in 1998.  This is some 10% in excess of the European Union target set for 2005 and essentially achieves Ireland's 2011 mandatory EU target of 60% six years ahead of schedule;</p>
            <p eId="para_1520">in 2005, construction and demolition waste recycling exceeded the 2013 target of 85% by 2%;</p>
            <p eId="para_1521">the quantity of waste deposited at bring banks and civic amenity sites in 2005 grew  by 12% and 25% respectively in comparison with 2004;</p>
            <p eId="para_1522">kerbside collection grew by 46% in 2005 while glass recycling grew by 9% over the 2004 level to reach 64%;</p>
            <p eId="para_1523">2.3m items of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) was recycled in the first year of operation of a new Producer Responsibility Initiative and broke the EU target of 4kg per inhabitant set for 2008 by 2.7kg;</p>
            <p eId="para_1524">the numbers of bring banks grew from 837 in 1998 to 1937 in 2005 and the number of civic amenity facilities grew from 30 to 81 over the same period;</p>
            <p eId="para_1525">since 2002 my Department has allocated almost €100 million in capital grants to assist local authorities in the provision of recycling and recovery services. The projects assisted include bring bank networks, civic amenity sites, materials recovery, composting and biological treatment facilities;</p>
            <p eId="para_1526">the amount of waste going to landfill has dropped by 8.4% since 2001;</p>
            <p eId="para_1527">successive National Waste Reports suggest a decoupling of waste generation from economic growth. Since 2001 economic growth has exceeded the rise of waste generation by 5.3%;</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">a farm plastics recovery scheme operated by the Irish Farm Films Producers Group has made consistent progress since its establishment in 1997 with an estimated 12,500 tonnes collected for recycling in 2005.  The arrangements for the scheme were enhanced in 2006 to improve collection and recovery systems, including the operation of local authority bring centres;</p>
            <p eId="para_1529">the Waste Management (End-of-Life Vehicles) Regulations 2006 governing the recycling of scrap cars were introduced in 2006 and came fully into operation on 1 January 2007. Over 65 authorised treatment facilities are currently permitted by local authorities;</p>
            <p eId="para_1530">a multi-annual National Waste Prevention Programme was established in 2004 within the EPA. This programme aims to deliver substantive results on waste prevention and minimisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1531">The Government is committed to continued support for recycling.  The following measures, which are being put in place by the Government, will support the achievement of higher recycling rates in future years:</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">the National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste was published in April, 2006 and sets out measures to progressively divert biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) from landfill in accordance with the agreed targets in EU Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste.  The Strategy is based on the integrated waste management approach established as Government policy since the publication of Changing Our Ways in 1998.  The preferred options for dealing with BMW are:</p>
            <p eId="para_1533">prevention and minimisation — avoiding generating the waste;</p>
            <p eId="para_1534">recycling — mainly of paper and cardboard but also of textiles;</p>
            <p eId="para_1535">biological treatment — mainly of kitchen and garden waste including composting ("brown bin" collections and home composting); and</p>
            <p eId="para_1536">residual treatment — thermal treatment with energy recovery or by way of mechanical-biological treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">The Strategy sets specific objectives for the contributions that each of these measures will contribute to the achievement of the 2016 target for diversion of BMW from landfill.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">a Market Development Group was established in 2004 with the aim of realising the full potential of collected recyclable material by establishing new markets for that material. The Market Development Programme is currently being finalised and will be published shortly;</p>
            <p eId="para_1539">the Best Practice Guidelines on the Preparation of Waste Management Plans for Construction and Demolition Projects, was published last July.  The primary purpose of the Guidelines is to promote an integrated approach to construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste management, throughout the duration of a project.  The Guidelines are designed to promote sustainable development, environmental protection and optimum use of resources.  They provide guidance on the preparation of construction and demolition waste management plans for certain classes of project which exceed specified threshold limits.  While the Guidelines may operate generally on a voluntary basis, planning authorities may attach a condition to permissions for the types of development outlined above;</p>
            <p eId="para_1540">to ensure the continued success of packaging waste in Ireland, new draft regulations which aim to optimise the recovery and recycling of packaging waste in Ireland were formally submitted to the European Commission in February 2007.  Under the formal notification procedures to the Commission, a three-month standstill period will apply before the draft regulations can be made.  This allows EU Member States and other interested parties to comment on the draft regulations before they come into effect.  The new Regulations are the culmination of a review of the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003 which has been taking place over the last two years in consultation with the industry and public sector stakeholders;</p>
            <p eId="para_1541">my Department is also working with the relevant sectors of industry in developing similar initiatives for other waste streams such as tyres, newsprint and batteries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1542">I am satisfied that implementation of the above measures, in conjunction with the successful initiatives put in place in recent years, will further enhance Ireland's strong recycling performance across all sectors.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1544">The Government's new housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, reiterates the Government's strong commitment to ensuring a sufficiency of housing to meet demand, particularly from first time buyers.  Investment in infrastructure and streamlining of the planning system, has underpinned the strong supply response to the unprecedented demand which has arisen due to economic and demographic changes.   2006 saw record housing output with over 93,000 completions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1545">The housing policy statement and the National Development Plan 2007-2013 (NDP) also provide for a significant expansion of social and affordable housing to meet accommodation needs of households which are not served by the market.  The NDP provides the resources — some €18 billion in total which will enable needs of some 140,000 new households to be met in this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1546">These resources will be used to meet the needs of some 100,000 households seeking social housing support, by commencing/acquiring 63,000 new social homes in the period 2007-2013, through a combination of local authority, voluntary and co-operative housing and new units for the Rental Accommodation Scheme.  Further households will benefit as they transfer to the Rental Accommodation Scheme with their existing landlords or from naturally occurring vacancies. Over the period  2007 to 2009 sufficient resources will be made available to commence/ acquire some 27,000 new units of social housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1547">In addition over the period of the NDP some 40,000 households will benefit from affordable housing.  17,000 of these will be delivered in the first three-year period, in line with the agreement in Towards 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_1548">To ensure that these programmes are delivered in a coherent and coordinated manner City and County Councils have put in place multi-annual Housing Actions plans which encompass delivery of social and affordable housing in their area, including Town Councils.</p>
            <p eId="para_1549">While it is a matter for individual local authorities to decide on the types of housing to be provided by them, having regard to the composition of their housing waiting lists, my Department continues to advise local authorities of the need to provide a reasonable mix of dwellings suited to the different kinds of households already on waiting lists and to plan their future programmes taking account of the estimated size and type of households likely to be seeking housing in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1551">The National Housing Conference, which was jointly organised by my Department and the RIAI, had as its central theme the Government's recently published housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities. The policy statement sets out a vision to guide the transformation of the Irish housing sector over the next ten years, by delivering more and better quality housing responses and by doing this in a more strategic way focused on the building of sustainable communities — as reflected in the agenda of the Conference.  This approach responds to housing need in a way that improves choice and encourages individual responsibility within communities and delivers housing programmes more effectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1552">The chief purpose of the Conference was to debate implementation issues which need to be addressed if we are to transform the Irish housing environment to meet the challenges ahead that are identified in the policy statement.  The conference and associated study tours, demonstrated considerable evidence of integrated approaches being made to the delivery of housing and greater consciousness of quality in urban design.  As part of the process, I launched new guidance on delivery entitled Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities.  This is part of a suite of guidance which my Department will issue to drive this critical quality agenda.</p>

            <p eId="para_1557">The total energy bill paid in respect of energy consumption in my Department's main offices in 2006 amounted to €502,036. I propose to circulate with the Official Report a tabular statement setting out details of electricity consumption in the Custom House for the period 2002 to 2006 inclusive. Increased consumption in 2006, following reductions in 2005, is mainly attributable to substantial refurbishment works taking place in the building during this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">As I indicated in reply to Questions Nos. 946 and 948 of 20 March 2007, ambitious targets for renewable energy in the electricity, transport and heating sectors are contained in the Government's recently published White Paper, Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland. The White Paper proposes that one third of electricity consumed in this economy will come from renewable sources by 2020.  In this regard, my Department is already committed to obtaining its electricity from renewable sources. Following a tender process, under the auspices of the Office of Public Works, a contract is in place since October 2006 with Energia for the supply of electricity from renewable sources to the Department's main offices and this accounted for 44% of the energy (kWh) consumed in these offices in the last quarter of 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_1573">I propose to take Questions Nos.  51 and 71 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1574">My Department's National Water Study audited 91 water supply schemes outside the Greater Dublin Area serving more than 5,000 consumers and operated by some 38 local authorities.  The study reported on all aspects of water supply, including availability of raw water, treatment capacity, water distribution systems and associated management issues. The study report published in 2000 found, inter alia, that unaccounted for water levels varied significantly between regions but were generally in the range of between 40% to 50%.   The corresponding figure in the Dublin region in 1996 was 42.5%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1575">Not all unaccounted for water is lost through leakage. Heretofore, a significant proportion would have related to unauthorised or unrecorded connections.  However, the universal metering of all non-domestic consumers, which is expected to be completed in 2007, coupled with ongoing improvements in local authorities' water management systems, will significantly reduce unaccounted for water levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1576">My Department has undertaken a number of initiatives over the years to assist local authorities to optimise the management, quality and efficiency of their water supply systems.   In 1996 capital funding was introduced under my Department's Water Services Investment Programme to help reduce unaccounted for water levels in local authority distribution networks, to improve the quality of supply to consumers, to lower operating costs and to maximise the value of investment in new treatment works.  A series of pilot schemes to identify potential improvements, as well as some network rehabilitation, was undertaken. Project locations included Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford, Limerick, Athlone and Clonmel.   Capital funding of €63m was provided by my Department. The results showed that the levels of unaccounted for water were reduced considerably.  For example, in Dublin they fell from 42.5% to 28.7%, in Donegal from 59% to 39%, in Meath from 47% to 34% and in Kilkenny from 45% to 29%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1577">A further €281m is now available to local authorities to identify and reduce unaccounted for water in public supply networks.  The bulk of this allocation, €194m, is for network rehabilitation or replacement works by authorities that have already carried out water management system studies under the earlier pilot phase.  The balance of €87m will enable the remaining authorities to complete water management system studies as a necessary precursor to structural rehabilitation works.    In November 2005, I increased the recoupment available to local authorities from my Department for certain water conservation activities from 75% to 90% to encourage and facilitate greater progress on water conservation generally.   Details of current allocations to individual authorities for water conservation measures are set out in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007 which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</b>
         his plans to amend the compulsory purchase order legislation to reduce the cost of new transport infrastructure; if he is satisfied at the prices that have been paid for parcels of land under existing CPO legislation; if it would be preferable to have land valued on the basis of existing use values rather than on hope values dependent on potential rezoning changes or a future planning application approval; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1579">In many cases in which a local authority compulsorily acquires land, the quantum of compensation is agreed between the parties concerned.  Where there is no such agreement, the matter is referred to an official property arbitrator for determination.</p>
            <p eId="para_1580">Generally, a claim for compensation in respect of the compulsory acquisition of land will comprise one or more of the following heads of claim:</p>
            <p eId="para_1581">the market value of the land;</p>
            <p eId="para_1582">damage to other lands of the claimant through severance or other injurious affection; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1583">disturbance and other matters not based on the value of land.</p>
            <p eId="para_1584">The market value of land is assessed in accordance with rules of compensation specified in the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act 1919, as amended.</p>
            <p eId="para_1585">In general, factors influencing an assessment of the market value of land include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1586">location, area and quality,</p>
            <p eId="para_1587">market conditions and trends,</p>
            <p eId="para_1588">development potential,</p>
            <p eId="para_1589">availability of services, and</p>
            <p eId="para_1590">planning status.</p>
            <p eId="para_1591">The Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 amended the 1919 Act to provide that in the assessment of any compensation, the value of any land lying 10 metres or more below the surface of that land shall be taken to be nil, unless the contrary can be shown by the claimant.  This provision is intended to reduce the cost of proposed Metro infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1592">I have no proposals at this time to further amend the rules of compensation.  However, the matter of land costs arising in the provision of transport infrastructure is to be considered by the Cross-Departmental Team on Housing, Infrastructure and PPPs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1594">In support of balanced regional development, a key aim the National Development Plan 2007-2013 (NDP) is to enhance the growth capacity of the nine Gateway cities and towns designated under the National Spatial Strategy (NSS), and to strengthen their role as drivers of the development of their wider regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1595">A Gateway Innovation Fund (GIF) is being established under the NDP to help fund targeted strategic investments that can trigger the accelerated development of the Gateways and their wider regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1596">The Fund will operate initially on a pilot basis over the three-year period (2008-2010) with €100m of Exchequer funding being made available per annum for qualifying proposals.  Lead local authorities, on behalf of each of the Gateways, will be expected to bid on a competitive and "added-value" basis for central funding for projects that stimulate Gateway development, with a significant element of co-funding to be provided locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1597">This dedicated funding will facilitate, encourage and accelerate Gateway development, and will be a powerful instrument in rewarding innovation and cooperation at local level from all the stakeholders in each Gateway, including local authorities, State agencies and the private sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1598">Following on the success of previous urban renewal programmes, the NDP also provides for a new, targeted urban regeneration programme with a particular focus on the NSS Gateways and Hubs.  Some €170m in funding will be provided in support of local authorities engaged in significant upgrading and renewal of the public realm.  Priority will be accorded to projects encompassing and demonstrating good urban design, innovation, appropriate scale and cost effectiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1599">The possibility of tax incentivisation in support of particular urban renewal objectives remains under consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_1601">The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is designed to cater for the accommodation needs of persons in receipt of rent supplement who have a long-term housing need. It is a collaborative project between my Department, local authorities, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Health Service Executive.  All housing authorities are now mobilised and practically all have begun to transfer cases.  Since transfers commenced in September 2005, 3,200 households have been provided with RAS accommodation and a further 2,450 rent supplement households have been allocated local authority housing.  To date over 20,000 cases equivalent of 60% of the current target of recipients of rent supplement of over 18 months have been reviewed by local authorities for transfer to RAS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1602">The Government have approved the drafting of the Social Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006, which provides, inter alia, for the Rental Accommodation Scheme.  The drafting of the Bill is being advanced as quickly as possible and it is expected that it will be published by early summer this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1706">The Local Government Act 2001 modernises the legislative framework, supports community involvement with local authorities in participative local democracy and underpins generally the programme of local government renewal including the position of county and city councils as the primary units of local government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1707">Under the Act, borough councils, such as Drogheda, and town councils which are former urban district councils, such as Dundalk, are responsible for a significant range of functions in their respective areas as well as contributing to local development in co-operation with their respective county council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1708">The Act takes account of the recommendations of the 1996 Report of the Reorganisation Commission Towards Cohesive Local Government — Town and County regarding improved accessibility, interaction and linkages for all boroughs and towns with their local county council areas as the way forward. A modernised legal framework and structures at both regional and local level are now in place and these provide the necessary powers and flexibility to local authorities to work in partnership to co-ordinate the provision of integrated public services.  In these circumstances I have no proposals for amending legislation, which would be necessary to establish new city councils.</p>

          <speech by="#DickRoche" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_568">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_1714">I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 558 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1715">Information on the quality of drinking water supplies is regularly compiled and provided by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The latest relevant EPA report The Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland — A Report for the Year 2005, which is available in the Oireachtas Library, confirms the fundamentally good quality of drinking water supplies in Ireland.  The report shows that public water supplies have an overall compliance rate of 98.9% with bacteriological standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1716">Management of public drinking water supplies is generally the responsibility of the local authorities, which have a range of instruments and measures available to them to produce and conserve sufficient stocks to meet anticipated needs and to ensure quality standards.  In addition, my Department coordinates and finances a major programme of investment in improved water supply infrastructure, active leakage control, telemetry and rehabilitation of watermains.  The Water Services Investment Programme 2005–2007, and previous phases of the Programme, are available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_1717">The schemes included in the Water Services Investment Programme are derived mainly from regular assessments of needs undertaken by local authorities, at my Department's request, as an input to the overall strategy for meeting water supply and treatment requirements.  Local authorities were requested to carry out new assessments in 2006 and these will inform project selection in the next phase of the Programme.  In undertaking their assessments, authorities were asked to have regard to specific criteria, including relevant national and EU environmental, public health and drinking water quality statutory requirements and standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1718">Contamination of drinking water by cryptosporidium is an ongoing risk in relation to which water authorities in Ireland and other countries must exercise constant precaution and vigilance.  In 1998, my Department published detailed guidelines for local authorities on Minimising the Risk of Cryptosporidium in Water Supplies. These guidelines were prepared in consultation with the Department of Health and Children and the Environmental Protection Agency to provide clear advice to local authorities on preventing cryptosporidium getting into water supply systems.  The guidelines cover all aspects of water supply management, including source protection, monitoring, treatment processes, storage and distribution as well as responding to an outbreak.</p>
            <p eId="para_1719">In November 2004, the National Disease Surveillance Centre published a report on waterborne cryptosporidiosis.  This was circulated to all local authorities by the EPA with the request that they update their risk assessments based on the revised methodology of the report.  Almost 400 such updated risk assessments were carried out by local authorities in response to this request.</p>
            <p eId="para_1720">Explicit requirements in relation to monitoring of drinking water for clostridium perfringens — an indicator of possible contamination of the water by cryptosporidium — are now set out in the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2007.  My Department's Water Services Investment Programme provides full capital funding for improvements of the water infrastructure of local authorities. Identified deficiencies posing relatively greater risk to human health or the environment would be prioritised in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1721">The overall Exchequer commitment to water services infrastructure is reflected in the very substantially increased funding provided for the sector in recent years.  Some €3.7 billion was invested in new and upgraded water services infrastructure under the National Development Plan 2000 — 2006.  €4.7 billion, an increase of 27%, has been provided under the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  Very significant improvements across the sector are being achieved on foot of this ongoing investment, including substantial increases in water treatment and storage capacity. Overall, the resources being put in place by my Department will ensure that the coverage and quality of the national water supply infrastructure is adequate to meet current and anticipated demands.</p>

            <p eId="para_1724">I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 97 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1725">I hosted a meeting of Environment Ministers from Iceland, Norway and Austria on 26 March in Dublin Castle.  We were joined by the Parliamentary State Secretary of the Environment for Germany who also participated in our discussions on our shared concerns in relation to nuclear energy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1726">I have for some time held the view that the recently renewed debate on nuclear energy, which has been prompted by concerns regarding energy security and climate change, has not reflected all the issues inherent in the nuclear energy option. I had on occasion raised these views informally at international meetings with international environment colleagues and I received significant support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">While Ireland is opposed to the use of nuclear energy, Ireland, Austria, Iceland and Norway all acknowledge that it is the sovereign right of countries to choose their own mix of energy supplies. The primary objective of the Ministerial meeting in Dublin was to express our collective concerns that nuclear is being put forward as the solution to the climate change problem. We are also concerned that the current debate often seeks to downplay the serious issues of waste, adverse environmental impacts, proliferation, liability and safety, that go hand in hand with the nuclear industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">We also discussed in some detail the issue of trans-boundary risks arising from nuclear.  We were agreed that the safety issues and environmental impacts from radioactive discharges to the sea arising from the Sellafield plant in the UK were of significant concern and that continued reprocessing operations at the plant are economically and environmentally untenable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1729">Ireland, Austria, Iceland and Norway issued a joint statement following this meeting which illustrates and underlines the importance we attach to the presentation of a different view of nuclear.  The very fact this joint statement was issued clearly shows that Ireland is not by any means alone in the views that we hold on nuclear.</p>
            <p eId="para_1730">We agreed to meet again in Vienna in the autumn, along with the Environment Ministers of other States that may be interested.  I expect that further meetings of concerned Ministers will provide a particularly important opportunity to contribute to a real debate on the nuclear option.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1732">The Census of Population results, which were issued by the Central Statistics Office on Thursday 29 March 2007, are the first of a series of reports that will issue over the coming year, all of which will have to be evaluated as part of policy development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1733">The CSO report indicated that about 266,000 dwellings were vacant on the Census night in April 23 2006. These statistics are derived from an analysis of the Enumerators' books in an attempt to capture the reasons why a Census form has not been received from a given housing unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1734">The housing stock data indicate that approximately 50,000 of the vacant units were holiday homes. For example, the highest rate of vacancies is recorded in counties along the Atlantic Coastal and Shannon regions where holiday homes are common. Such dwellings are an important part of the country's broader tourism infrastructure, and along with other forms of tourist accommodation such as Bed and Breakfast and Hotel accommodation generate employment and tourist activity in these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1735">The remaining 216,000 vacant dwellings made up about 12% of the total housing stock. In a growing dynamic housing market, fuelled mainly by rapid economic growth and demographic changes, it may be expected that a certain level of vacant dwellings will be recorded on any given night. This may arise, for example, when houses are used to accommodate family members closer to their work or study locations, when properties are for sale or during periods of vacancy between tenancies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1736">Further analysis of the data is required before drawing conclusions on the policy implications. My Department is in discussion with the CSO on this issue.  What is clear from the information, is that the policy of increasing housing supply has been a success with almost 300,000 dwellings completed in the inter census period — an average of 75,000 dwellings per year.  This is a phenomenal response to the rapid increase in our population and shows a strong capacity to respond to the continuing needs of our growing population.</p>

            <p eId="para_1738">In August 2006, my Department published a consultation paper on options for future regulation of the waste sector. Submissions were invited on whether there is a need for a regulator for the sector, if so on what model of regulator might be most appropriate and on what powers any such regulator should be given. Over fifty, many very detailed, submissions were received addressing the range of complex issues which surround the regulation of the sector. Following consideration of these submissions I intend to finalise further policy proposals.</p>

            <p eId="para_1741">In accordance with its Environmental Policy Statement, my Department is fully committed to the effective management of waste including prevention, reduction and recycling. This is a critical element of our ongoing accreditation to ISO 14001:1996 which we achieved for our headquarters offices in 2003.  A number of strategies guide our activities in this regard across the Department, including prevention and reduction in the amount of waste generated and maximising all opportunities for the re-use and recycling of all waste arising. A contract is in place for the collection and recycling of paper and cardboard packaging from my Department's main offices. In relation to redundant electronic IT equipment, the Department arranges for the reuse of suitable equipment and where this is not possible avails of the take back facilities under the WEEE Regulations for the dismantling and recycling of such equipment. Arrangements are in place in my Department's Headquarters under which cans and bottles are collected and recycled by Dublin City Council. There are also arrangements in place for recycling glass and for the safe disposal of batteries.  My Department is also availing of the recently introduced brown bin collection scheme being run by Dublin City Council, which provides for the segregation of organic kitchen waste for composting.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_1755">A review of the long-term options for radioactive waste management in the UK was undertaken by the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, an independent body established in November 2003 by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, along with the Environment Ministers for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1756">The Committee was not mandated to select a site or sites for long-term storage of radioactive waste and no site has to date been selected for this purpose.  This Committee's main task was to recommend, by July 2006, how best to manage the very significant stocks of radioactive waste held in the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p eId="para_1757">Ireland accepted a number of invitations to participate in various consultative fora put in place by the Committee. Most recently, departmental officials together with a senior scientific officer from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) met with the chairman of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management in June 2006. My Department has also contributed on a number of occasions to written consultation procedures put in place by the Committee as part of their extensive stakeholder engagement process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1758">My policy was to monitor closely the work of this Committee and to use the consultation process to articulate the views of the Irish Government in relation to any proposals arising for the management and disposal of radioactive waste in the UK insofar as they might have implications for Ireland.  My officials have consistently impressed upon the Committee that, given our proximity to the UK and our ongoing concerns and interest in relation to the management of radioactive waste in the UK, Ireland considers it has a significant interest in the issues under deliberation.  My officials have also emphasised that Ireland is a unique stakeholder with distinct responsibilities in terms of protecting its population from the risks of ionising radiation and for planning protective and remedial measures in respect of such risks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">In my view a primary consideration in addressing waste management issues of any origin or type must involve the question of waste reduction.  This is particularly relevant for the nuclear industry given the nature and toxicity of the wastes arising. The role of reprocessing within the industry requires particular consideration in this regard.  However, I understand that the remit of the Committee did not extend to this issue and on this basis the range of issues raised and addressed by the Committee must be considered less than complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_1760">The Committee delivered its recommendations to the UK Government on 31 July 2006. The principal recommendations of the Committee were that geological disposal is currently the best form of long term management of UK's high level radioactive waste and that there should be a commitment to the safe and secure interim storage of the waste during the time it will take to plan and construct the geological disposal facility. The UK Government accepted the recommendations of the Committee and decided that it will further develop and consult on the process for implementation of such recommendations including site selection criteria. It also decided that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority will be given the responsibility for developing and ensuring delivery and implementation of the programmes for interim storage and geological disposal. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority is the UK State Body charged with ownership of 20 civil public sector nuclear sites including Sellafield and ensuring they are decommissioned and cleaned up safely, securely, cost effectively and in ways that protect the environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1761">There is a clear need and obligation for the UK to manage the significant volumes of radioactive waste which have arisen as a legacy of their long standing nuclear programme safely and without adverse impact on the environment. Insofar as such plans could impact on Ireland, I will continue to engage proactively with all relevant UK Authorities and articulate clearly our legitimate views and concerns in relation to the development of long term radioactive waste management options in the UK so as to ensure that such options do not compromise the health or environment of Irish people.</p>

            <p eId="para_1782">Waste management services have traditionally been provided at a local level, with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances.  The present legal framework, as determined by the Oireachtas, reflects this. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver scheme, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.  Section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act, 1996 specifically precludes the Minister from any involvement in anything for which a local authority has statutory responsibility. However, my Department has asked local authorities to engage with commercial waste collectors to agree on arrangements to assist lower income households by offering alternatives to periodic lump-sum payments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1784">One of the main barriers to an improved and sustainable recycling performance is the lack of stable and economically attractive markets and outlets for recyclable materials and products manufactured from recycled products.  The need for the establishment of a Market Development Group, which would oversee the development of a Market Development Programme, was outlined in my Department's Delivering Change policy statement and the Agreed Programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1785">The Market Development Group was established in 2004 and has been working on the development of a National Market Development Programme.  Among the key issues to be addressed are promoting stable demand for recovered materials, supporting the achievement of economies of scale in the production of products made from recycled materials and the need for more recycling infrastructure in Ireland to reduce reliance on overseas markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1786">The National Market Development Programme, which the Group is developing, will identify new applications and markets for recyclable material and secondary recycled products.  While the Programme's primary focus will be on paper, plastics and organics there will be scope for initiatives in respect of recycled materials derived from other waste streams, including waste tyres.  The Group has been asked to identify barriers to the use and marketing of recyclable material and to develop strategies to address these.  The Market Development Programme is being finalised at present for publication shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1787">I have publicly stated my concerns about inappropriate practices in the way waste tyres are managed.  It is important that a proper regulatory framework be put in place to track waste tyre flows and to encourage the recovery and recycling of this waste resource.  My Department has had discussions with the Irish Tyre Industry Association (ITIA) with a view to establishing a Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI).  These discussions are continuing with the intention of concluding the necessary arrangements for such an initiative later this year.  Draft Regulations which will provide a regulatory framework for this PRI have been developed and were published for public consultation last month.  In preparing the draft Regulations the Department consulted with the tyre industry and the farming organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1788">The closing for submission of comments under the consultation process is 26 April. Following this my Department will examine the various submissions made and proceed with the process of finalising the Regulations</p>

            <p eId="para_1792">Ireland signed the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters on 25 June 1998.  Progress towards ratification of the Convention is closely aligned with work at EU level and, in that context, the European Union has adopted two Directives as part of the ratification process for the Convention.  These deal with public access to environmental information (2003/4/EC) and public participation in certain environmental decision-making procedures (2003/35/EC).</p>
            <p eId="para_1793">I have recently made the European Communities (Access to information on the Environment) Regulations that will give effect in Ireland to Directive 2003/4/EC (the AIE Directive).</p>
            <p eId="para_1794">The process to transpose Directive 2003/35/EC is already well advanced with legislation already completed to amend a range of consent systems. The remaining work will be finalised by the earliest possible date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1795">With regard to the access to justice provisions of Directive 2003/35/EC, I am satisfied, having regard to the legal advice available to me, that Irish law complies with these provisions and that no additional legislation is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1796">When full transposition of Directive 2003/35/EC is completed, the instrument of ratification of the Aarhus Convention will be submitted to Government and laid before the Dáil.</p>

            <p eId="para_1798">Reform and development of the private rented sector is an important element of the Government's housing policy and we have undertaken a range of action to promote greater quality in various aspects of the sector, including accommodation standards. The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides a modern framework of landlord and tenant legislation. The Private Residential Tenancies Board was established to provide a range of services for the sector, including dispute resolution, registration and information. Following on a commitment in Towards 2016, I have launched a comprehensive Action Programme to promote further improvement in standards of private rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1799">An important element of this Programme is the updating of the existing standards regulations in consultation with local authorities and other relevant interests. This work is progressing. Views on the updating of the regulations were invited from local authorities and relevant groups. To date a limited number of submissions on the matter has been received and these are being considered. Recommendations in relation to the regulations will also be provided by the Centre for Housing Research, which is carrying out a study of measures to promote improvement in private rented accommodation standards as part of the Action Programme. I hope to have draft revised regulations around the middle of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1806">Over the years, the Government, largely through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), has committed significant resources to assessing the incidence of radon throughout the country and highlighting public awareness of radon and the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to high concentrations.  These are core activities of the Institute.  The figure of €40,000 relates only to direct expenditure on awareness-raising and does not include all staffing costs and overheads associated with the Institute's radon related activities. The RPII estimates that its total 2006 expenditure in this area is approximately €190,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1807">In addition, during the 1990s RPII carried out a nationwide survey of radon in domestic dwellings.  The cost of this has been estimated at approximately €900,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1808">Other Government Departments are also involved in highlighting the dangers of radon and promoting remediation measures. For example, the Radon Remediation Programme in schools, which is funded by the Department of Education and Science, has cost approximately €6million to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1809">It is clear from the above, therefore, that considerable resources are being expended by Government on promoting public awareness of radon. Government efforts and resources, together with the RPII, will continue to focus on highlighting public awareness of radon and on improving information to householders and employers so as to enable and encourage them to address monitoring or remedial requirements effectively and economically.</p>

            <p eId="para_1858">Housing affordability is influenced by a range of factors such as house prices, interest rates and income levels. House prices have stabilised since the last quarter of 2006, following generally high rates of increase since the June 2005 quarter. ECB interest rates have increased from 2% to 3.75% since December 2005. Economic commentators do not at present predict further significant increases in interest rates. Recent house price moderation, increased mortgage interest relief, increases in take home pay and competitiveness in the mortgage market are assisting housing affordability. I expect that these factors and continuing economic growth will continue to have a positive effect on affordability in the coming year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1859">We are also assisting housing affordability by promoting housing supply, particularly affordable housing, as part of the integrated policy approach set out in the Government's new statement on housing policy Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities. We have put in place a range of targeted schemes to assist first time buyers, directed specifically at those who are unable purchase on the open market.  These include the Shared Ownership Scheme, the 1999 affordable housing scheme, affordable housing delivered through Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006 and the Affordable Housing Initiative.  The Affordable Homes Partnership is co-ordinating and accelerating the delivery of affordable housing in and around Dublin.  The increasing momentum of delivery, particularly through Part V, will be sustained and accelerated in order to support the achievement of the ambitious target set in Towards 2016 to deliver some 17,000 homes over the period 2007 to 2009.  This is a substantial commitment to meeting the needs of first-time buyers seeking affordable housing.</p>

As such waste to energy plants would at a minimum be subject to the very stringent emission limits provided for in the EU Incineration Directive and be required to undergo statutorily independent physical planning and environmental licensing processes which can rightly be regarded as among the most rigorous and transparent in Europe.</p>

While it is not the normal practice of my Department to assist persons who do not have residency in the State with a re-entry visa prior to travelling, in certain exceptional circumstances assistance may be given to the spouse of an Irish national.

            <p eId="para_1929">I propose to take Questions Nos. 112, 121, 132, 134, 136 to 140, inclusive, 143 and 144 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1930">The allocation and deployment of Garda officers are the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1931">The following table shows the numbers of Gardaí attached to the relevant stations in question on 31 December 1997, 31 December 2002 and on the latest date for which figures are available in 2007. The number of community Gardaí, where appropriate, in each District/Division on the latest date for which figures are available in 2007 is also shown. I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.  Garda Personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</p>
            <p eId="para_1932">Community Policing is a central feature of current policing policy and members of Community policing units are encouraged to engage with the local communities where they are assigned. Current policing policy is predicated on the prevention of public order offences; the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a quality policing service.  All Gardaí have a responsibility, inter alia, to be involved in Community Policing issues as they arise.</p>

            <p eId="para_3433">The person concerned arrived in the State on 21 December, 2003 and applied for asylum.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_3434">Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, he was informed by letter dated 29 October, 2004, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order. Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_3435">This person's case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement).  I expect the file to be passed to me for decision in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_3436">To date, no application has been received from or on behalf of the person concerned for Subsidiary Protection under the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006).</p>

            <p eId="para_5020">As the Deputy will be aware, a situation had developed in the Prison Service whereby the capital budget and every other budget within the system was being highly subsidised to fund overtime expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_5021">In order to reverse this wholly unsustainable dependence on overtime, on my appointment I put in place a number of measures including major cutbacks in overtime expenditure and new attendance arrangements.  Following prolonged negotiations the POA, in August 2005, accepted a proposal for organisational change eliminating overtime working and introducing new organisational and working arrangements which will provide long term savings to the Exchequer of up to €25m per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_5022">Accordingly, while overtime in respect of the Prison Officer grade amounted to €44.3m in 2002, the corresponding figure for overtime and additional hours payments in 2006 amounted to €23.8m.  This represents a saving, for this grade of staff, of €20.5m in cash terms.  Obviously,  this saving would be significantly more in real terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_5023">The average basic earnings and the average earnings including allowances and overtime of the Prison Officer grade in respect of each year from 2002 to 2006 are as follows:</p>

As the roll-out of the new system commenced towards the end of 2005 and continued into 2006, the full year impact will not be felt until 2007. The Deputy should also note that the above figures include year-on-year general round increases under the various National Wage Agreements and awards made under the Benchmarking process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5045">Finally, the Deputy should note that figures for 2007 have not been included in the table above because one quarter only would not provide a true reflection of Prison Officer earnings relative to 2002-2006 which are shown on a  year-on-year basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_5051">I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 13,178 following the attestation of 273 new members on Wednesday 14 March, 2007. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) on 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,476 (or over 23%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training on 14 March, 2007 was 14,258. Furthermore, I should say that on 19 December, 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_5073">Community Policing is a central feature of current policing policy and members of Community policing units are encouraged to engage with the local communities where they are assigned. Current policing policy is predicated on the prevention of public order offences; the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a quality policing service.  All Gardaí have a responsibility, inter alia, to be involved in Community Policing issues as they arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_5074">The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day,  the overall strength of the organisation may fluctuate due, for example, to  retirements, resignations etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_5075">I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_5099">The provisional headline crime statistics for 2006, published by the Central Statistics Office in 2006, show that the rate of increase declined from 3% in 2005 to 1.4% in 2006.  The quarterly figures for 2006 show a similar encouraging picture, with increases of 10.1% and 0.8% in the first and second quarter respectively and decreases of 1.5% and 3.2% in the third and fourth quarters.  The Garda Commissioner has reported that there was an increase in the detection rate in 2006, with the overall detection rate at 40%, compared with rates of 36% in 2003 and 35% in 2004 and 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_5100">It is instructive to examine some trends in crime.  For example, the crime rate per 1,000 of the population in 1996, the last full year of the Rainbow Government, was 27.8.  By contrast, over the period since 2003, the first full year of this Government, using CSO census data and inter-census estimates of population, the crime rate per 1,000 of the population dropped from 26 in 2003 to 24.5 in 2006, with the figures for 2004 and 2005 being 24.5 and 24.8 respectively.  The crime rate per 1,000 of the population in 2006 was therefore the lowest in the period of office of this Government, and compares very favourably with the record of the last rainbow Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_5101">The headline crime figures for the fourth quarter of 2006 show that there has been no increase in the number of robberies of cash and goods in transit, compared with the same quarter in 2005.  There were also decreases in the high volume crimes of burglary (down 14.6%) and theft from the person (down 22%).  Detections in possession of firearms increased by 34.1%, which I believe contributed to the reduction of 3.4% in discharges of firearms.  Detection of possession of drugs for sale or supply has increased by 32.3% .  These figures show that the trend in the third quarter of the year continued, and are part of the effect of Operation Anvil.</p>
            <p eId="para_5102">I am informed by the Garda authorities that local Gardaí management closely monitors crime trends in each Garda Division.  The Gardaí have put in place a series of initiatives within the South Eastern Region, of which the Carlow/Kildare Division forms a part, targeting criminal activity — in particular criminals travelling through the Region and burglary and theft.  These initiatives have contributed to similar reductions in headline crime in the Carlow/Kildare Division as have occurred at national level.</p>
            <p eId="para_5103">I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 13,178 following the attestation of 273 new members on  14 March, 2007.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) on 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,476 (or over 23%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  I am also informed that the personnel strength of the Carlow/Kildare Division on 31 December 1997 and on 31 March 2007 was 281 and 390 (all ranks) respectively.  The next allocation of Probationer Gardaí will take place on 8 June, and the needs of the Carlow/Kildare Division will be fully considered within the context of the overall needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_5104">I am further informed that it is expected that the continuing allocation of additional personnel in conjunction with special initiatives targeting criminal activity being introduced by local Garda management under the auspices of Operation Anvil, as well as the constant monitoring of crime trends in the Division by senior and local Garda management, will result in a continued reduction in crime levels.</p>

            <p eId="para_5117">I can confirm that the Garda Commissioner has appointed a senior officer at Assistant Commissioner level to investigate these allegations and the Garda Síochána would welcome the receipt of any information that would assist the investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5118">The Commissioner takes his responsibility to safeguard information in the possession of the Gardaí very seriously and every allegation such as this has to be investigated.  Anyone found to have been in dereliction of their duty in this regard will be subject to the full rigours of the law.</p>
            <p eId="para_5119">Serving and former members of the Force are subject to the prohibition on the disclosure of information contained in the Garda Síochána Act 2005.  Section 62 of that Act was enacted for the purpose of specifically prohibiting a person who is or was a member of the Garda Síochána or of its civilian staff, from disclosing information obtained in the course of his or her duties.  The section provides stiff penalties, fines up to €75,000 and/or up to 7 years imprisonment for conviction on indictment, for persons who contravene its provisions and receive any gift, consideration or advantage as an inducement to disclose any information.  These penalties are severe and I believe will act as a real deterrent and cause people to think twice before they consider releasing such information.  The provision, in its original draft form, attracted a considerable degree of public controversy during its passage through the Oireachtas on the grounds that it would be unnecessarily restrictive.  However, I am satisfied that the section as enacted strikes the right balance and I know that the great majority of members of the force would instinctively support its fundamental policy aspect.</p>
            <p eId="para_5120">In addition to section 62 of the Garda Síochána Act, serving and former Gardaí are also governed by the provisions of the Official Secrets Act and the Data Protection Acts.</p>

            <p eId="para_5155">While there is a broad consensus among the specific community engaged in research on the matter, that global warming will result in increased frequency and severity of flooding there is at this stage no specific guidance on the likely extent of the impact or on how it will vary between different regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5156">The Office of Public Works therefore, in designing flood relief schemes, design for the present climate condition but use measures that can be easily and economically altered for climate change, if and when it should occur.  These measures include building foundations of sufficient strength to allow for wall heights to be increased and similarly, embankment footprints are selected with a view to having the embankments heightened, if so required.</p>
            <p eId="para_5157">With regard to Enniscorthy, the Office of Public Works carried out a Feasibility Study to examine the viability of implementing a flood relief scheme in the town.  This study considered various options and was overseen by a Steering Committee comprising officials from OPW, Wexford County Council and Enniscorthy Town Council.  An Environmental Impact Study was also commissioned and copies of the "Draft Feasibility Report" together with a "Draft Environmental Options Report" have been forwarded to the local authorities for consideration.  A meeting of the Steering Committee is currently being arranged to discuss the recommendations of these reports and to agree the final format.  A decision will then be taken as to whether the preferred flood relief option will be proceeded with which will involve the preparation of a full Environmental Impact Statement for the preferred option and preparation of documents to take the scheme to Public Exhibition.</p>

            <p eId="para_5159">The Financial Regulator issued its Consumer Protection Code in August 2006.  The Code comprises a number of general principles and some more detailed requirements specific to particular financial sectors.  The general principles came into effect immediately. Since the introduction of the Code the Financial Regulator has been engaged in a programme to roll out the Code to industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_5160">One of the requirements of the Code states that:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5161">"A regulated entity may only increase a consumer's credit card limit following a request from the consumer."</p>
            <p eId="para_5162">The provision in question will come into effect on 1 July 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_5163">Since the Financial Regulator was established, it has been working to inform consumers about the risks of credit card debt. On 29 March this year, it commenced a new credit card campaign, highlighting the implications of using credit cards to meet longer term borrowing requirements.  The Financial Regulator has also produced a booklet on credit cards and has conducted and published the results of a number of credit card cost surveys. These surveys compare the interest rates and charges on cards in the Irish market and provide consumers with the information to select the card that suits them best.</p>
            <p eId="para_5164">As part of a wider project to improve the transparency of financial products, the Financial Regulator is currently examining credit card statements to assess the adequacy and usefulness of the information contained in them.</p>

It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on "other income" of employees such as rent and other investment income.  It also includes the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</p>

            <p eId="para_5359">(i)In calculating the figures in this column the estimated net receipt of income tax paid by full-time farmers in each calendar year has been divided by the number of full-time farming tax units assessed to tax for the income tax year corresponding to the calendar year e.g. the 2002 receipt is divided by the number assessed for the income tax year 2002. These numbers exclude cases who are not required to file annual tax returns and whose position is reviewed periodically because their incomes are clearly too low to attract a tax liability on an individual basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_5360">(ii)The figures for averages do not take into account the tax attributable to the farming profits of farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession.  Farm tax represents a fraction of their overall tax liability and the emerging average farm tax payments could not be regarded as representative of the normal average tax yield from the farming sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_5361">(iii)Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and because of this it cannot be precisely distinguished.  Accordingly, the figures shown for tax payments by farmers are estimated.</p>

            <p eId="para_5367">(ii)Some figures in the columns differ from those given previously.  This is due to more accurate information becoming available in the meantime.</p>
            <p eId="para_5368">(iii)Receipts of deposit interest retention tax and dividend withholding tax are not included in the calculations.

            <p eId="para_5388">The Office of Public Works is not aware of any widespread drainage pipes being installed alongside the Tolka River in the Dublin 15 area. If the Deputy can be more specific I will be happy to clarify OPW's position.</p>
            <p eId="para_5389">Most of the major works between Dunboyne, Co Meath to the East Wall area of Dublin City have been carried out except the required works in the Mulhuddart area, including the new wall and embankment which will be undertaken this year and the replacement of the bridge which will occur in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_5390">Works are also to be undertaken in the Huntstown area which will include the construction of an embankment and supplementary flood channel alongside and at a higher elevation than the riverbed.

            <p eId="para_5391">It is important to state that the works undertaken on the River Tolka so far will provide not only a greater level of flood protection to properties previously under threat, but will also have the effect of enhancing the river's fishing status.

            <p eId="para_5396">I presume that Deputy's question refers to the projected increase in Financial Regulator's expenditure for 2007 as compared to its estimated outturn for 2006.  This was raised in the Financial Services Industry Consultative Panel's observations on the Financial Regulator's budget for 2007, furnished to my Department in December 2006.  The 2007 budget is based on the activities which the Financial Regulator proposes to undertake to achieve the goals detailed in the Strategic Plan 2007 — 2009 published in November 2006.  I have been informed by the Chairman of the Regulatory Authority that the increase in the Financial Regulator's budget for 2007 is largely attributable to the objective, noted in the Industry Panel's submission, of filling of its full staff complement of 350 staff in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_5397">The Chairman of the Financial Regulatory Authority has advised me that the Authority views it as a critical part of its role to ensure that a robust annual budgetary process for the Financial Regulator is undertaken and, in addition, that costs are kept under regular review.  The budgetary process is, accordingly, conducted under the guidance of a Budget Committee consisting of non-Executive Members of the Authority.  The Chairman also pointed out that the Financial Regulator's projected expenditure for 2007 represents an increase of 6.1 per cent as compared to the budgeted figure for 2006 and that staff costs account for about 70 per cent of the Financial Regulator's overall expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_5398">As far as the issue of shared services is concerned, the relationship between the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank derives from the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003 which established the Financial Regulator. The corporate structure of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority enables the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank to share the corporate resources and support services of a single organisation. This sharing of resources and services achieves savings by avoiding unnecessary duplication of support services and corporate infrastructure. This structure promotes the highest level of cooperation and communication across the organisation and realises economies of scale through the sharing of services and resources. The Central Bank and the Financial Regulator have confirmed that they are committed to ensuring effective and efficient management of shared corporate and support services.</p>
            <p eId="para_5399">I understand that the Comptroller and Auditor General is undertaking a value for money examination of the Financial Regulator. The Deputy may wish to note that the Financial Regulator has undertaken to establish an action plan to address any recommendations arising from this report.  Finally the Financial Regulator is committed under its Strategic Plan 2007-2009 to the development of a more comprehensive set of indicators which will further enhance the monitoring of all aspects of its performance.</p>

            <p eId="para_5401">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that for the purposes of both Gift and Inheritance Tax, the relationship between the person who provided the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who received the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum tax-free threshold — known as the "Group threshold". Three Group thresholds were are based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer and these Group thresholds are indexed annually by reference to the Consumer Price Index. The following are the Group thresholds for 2007:</p>
            <p eId="para_5402">Group A: €496,824 — applies where the beneficiary is a child (including certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance from a child.</p>
            <p eId="para_5403">Group B: €49,682 — applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, niece, nephew, or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p>
            <p eId="para_5404">Group C: €24,841 — applies in all other case.</p>
            <p eId="para_5405">In relation to the specific question raised by the Deputy, it is important to note that all gifts / inheritances that might have been received by the niece or nephew in question from within the same Group B (i.e. from brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts or grandparents) since 5 December 1991 will also be taken into account when applying the threshold for the purpose of calculating whether any inheritance tax arises. If there have been none, other than "small gifts", then the maximum value of cash, which can be transferred to a niece or nephew, without a liability to Inheritance Tax arising, is €49,682, which is the current Group B threshold.</p>
            <p eId="para_5406">"Small Gifts" are gifts from any source of less than €3,000 in any one year.  These are exempt from Gift/Inheritance tax.</p>

            <p eId="para_5415">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their Customs Service has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs intended to be smuggled or illegally imported into the State. The Deputy will be aware of the numerous small ports, harbours, piers, landing points, creeks, etc. that exist along Ireland's long and indented coastline. Revenue has deployed Customs Officers at the following ports throughout the country: Letterkenny, Killybegs, Sligo, Galway, Limerick, Foynes, Tralee, Bantry, Cork, Waterford, Bellview, Rosslare, Arklow, Wicklow, Dublin, Drogheda, Dundalk and Greenore. In respect of airports, there is a permanent Customs presence at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports. Other smaller ports, airports and coastal areas are monitored by mobile Enforcement units on the basis of risk analysis.</p>
            <p eId="para_5416">Since the introduction of the Single Market in 1993, Customs Services, taking account of the Internal Market freedom of movement principles, have been required to adapt from a full gatekeeper mode of manning all internal frontiers of the EU to an approach based on intelligence led controls. In this regard Revenue has placed particular emphasis on developing its intelligence base through a strong risk analysis focus at national and regional level and deploying its resources at areas of highest risk. This risk analysis in turn is regularly benchmarked against good practice standards in other jurisdictions at European and global level.</p>
            <p eId="para_5417">The Customs Drugswatch and Memorandum of Understanding programmes, which are key supports to this work, seek to engage the maritime community and logistics sectors in assisting Customs by reporting suspicious activity on a confidential basis. The work of Customs Officers in detecting drugs is also supported by the deployment of the Revenue Customs Cutter Suirbhéir, a mobile X-ray scanner that can scan freight containers, and detector dog teams. In addition intelligence is exchanged and operations are conducted with other law enforcement agencies both nationally and internationally. The deployment of such resources and the fostering of such intelligence exchange and co-operation are wholly in keeping with Revenue's commitment to the Government's National Drugs Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5418">Since 1996, Revenue's Customs Service has seized illegal drugs with a total street value of over €470m. Customs Officers have also seized significant amounts of cash that was linked with drug trafficking and other criminal activity.</p>

I understand that the HSE proposes to issue Invitations To Tender to the shortlisted bidders shortly. Following receipt of the tenders the HSE will evaluate the tenders and select the successful bidders. Following that a "stand still" period of 2 weeks is required by procurement law before agreements can be signed by the HSE with the successful bidders.</p>

Another alternative drug Suboxone (buprenorphine and naloxone combined) was recently granted a European Medicines Agency licence.  Its use is currently confined to certain drug treatment clinics.  An expert group has been set up in the Department to consider the use of Subutex and the new drug Suboxone as alternative treatments for opiate dependency.</p>

            <p eId="para_5491">Over 120,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_5492">Demand for occupational therapy in the health services is very significant, hence the substantial investment which has been provided over the last number of years. The number of occupational therapists employed in the public health service has grown from 288 WTEs in 1997 to 928 WTEs at end December 2006, a growth of 222%. The Government has also committed to further investment in disability services — via the multi-annual investment plan — and in primary care services. These services will see further increases in the occupational therapy resources available.</p>
            <p eId="para_5493">A particular priority for my Department and the Department of Education and Science in recent years has been the expansion of the supply of therapy graduates, including occupational therapists.  Additional courses in occupational therapy were established in three universities. UCC, NUIG and UL each established courses in occupational therapy with an initial intake of 25 places on each of the 3 courses.  The UL courses are at masters level and the first cohorts graduated in 2005.  The first cohort from the bachelor degree programmes in UCC and NUIG will graduate this year.  This investment represents an increase in training capacity of 240% in occupational therapy.  The latest information available to my Department indicates that the total number of occupational therapy training places now stands at 120.</p>
            <p eId="para_5494">Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_5504">General Practitioners, including those who hold contracts to provide services to public patients under the terms of the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme, work in the private sector as independent service providers. General Practitioners are not employed by the State. As such, GPs, in common with other professional groups are, in the first place, solely responsible for making provision for many aspects of their professional careers including their pension on retirement from practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_5505">Many GPs, while operating as private practitioners, also hold contracts for service under the GMS Scheme. The vast majority of such GPs hold the GMS GP Capitation contract, the terms of which reflect the agreed outcome of negotiations between my Department and the GP representative body, the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO). This type of contract was first introduced in 1989. Included in the GMS GP Capitation contract is a provision relating to a scheme of superannuation as follows: ‘A scheme of superannuation shall be established which shall be administered by the Irish Medical Organisation. The Health Boards shall pay into such a scheme a sum equivalent to 10% of total capitation fees payable to medical practitioners under the scheme. In addition, each medical practitioner shall contribute 5%. which sum shall be deducted from the capitation payments due to the medical practitioner and shall be paid on his behalf and for his benefit into the aforementioned scheme by the Board'.</p>
            <p eId="para_5506">In accordance with this contract provision, the IMO appoints Trustees to administer the superannuation scheme which is known as the ‘GMS Superannuation Plan'. From October 2001, under the terms of the Plan, members were allowed to make additional voluntary contributions giving them the opportunity to augment benefits accruing at retirement. In 2005, the contribution made by the HSE to the ‘GMS Superannuation Plan' amounted to over €20 million. It will be noted that this was in addition to capitation payments and other fees paid to some 2,200 GPs under the GMS Scheme which (excluding the superannuation contribution) totalled over €382 million in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_5507">Seventeen GPs hold Fee-per-Item GMS Scheme contracts with the HSE. This contract for service was introduced in 1972 when the GMS Scheme was first established. The Fee-per-Item GP contract was also agreed on foot of negotiations between the then Department of Health and the IMO. It did not contain provision for a scheme of superannuation. It fell to each GP to make arrangements in this respect as they felt appropriate. It will be noted that in 1989, on the introduction of the GMS GP capitation contract, those GPs with Fee-per-Item contracts were given the option of taking up the former.</p>

            <p eId="para_5533">The Department of Health and Children has made efforts to address this situation referred to in the Deputy's question over the last number of months and have taken actions including the following: Detailed examination of archived files to verify what documentation currently exists in the Department of Health and Children in relation to the individual; detailed examination of the files generally to provide background information on the matter; initial examination of the possibility of the establishment of a panel of medical personnel to assess the individual should the need be required; contact with hospitals to provide facilities for such an examination should it take place; assessment of the financial implications of the issue; assessment of the archived files generally to provide historical context on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_5534">In regard to an initial examination of the possibility of the establishment of a panel of medical personnel to assess the individual should the need be required, the Department of Health and Children has identified two Irish based doctors willing to participate in this process. However, they have advised that recognised international expertise in Thalidomide needs to be resourced. To this end, the Department has sought to identify such expertise internationally with assistance from thalidomide organisations overseas.  While an appropriate professional could be available in the UK, it is noted that this individual has already provided medical opinion for the subject of this question and therefore cannot be utilised in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_5535">The Department of Health and Children has, over the last number of weeks, sought to make contact with one of two medical experts identified.

            <p eId="para_5543">The issue of an extension of the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 to provide free healthcare for the women referred to by the Deputies has been carefully examined and advice taken from relevant experts. While I am sympathetic to the women in question, the current eligibility requirements for a Health Amendment Act Card (Blue Card) are set in primary legislation.  It is therefore not possible to extend these requirements.   Following communication earlier this year with the Support Group representing the women in question and on recently receiving more details on these women, my officials have informed me that a proportion of the women have initiated cases with the Tribunal prior to 20 June, 2006 and any of these who receive an award through the Tribunal/courts process will be entitled to receive a Health Amendment Act Card.</p>
            <p eId="para_5544">Men, women and children who contracted Hepatitis C through the administration within the State of blood or blood products are entitled to a Health (Amendment) Act Card.  Cardholders are entitled to avail of a broad range of healthcare services, without charge. The requirements for eligibility for the Card are set out in the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006, which defines a positive diagnosis for Hepatitis C based on a positive Hepatitis C test result, or if the person displayed symptoms of acute infection by reference to the presence of jaundice or raised alamine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, not later that 16 weeks after the person was administered anti-D.  The person needs to show evidence of a positive ELISA, RIBA, or PCR test result at any time since the administration of the blood or blood product.</p>
            <p eId="para_5545">The Bill for the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Amendment Act was published on 20 June, 2006. The eligibility criteria set out in the 2006 Act do not apply in relation to claims for compensation made to the Tribunal before 20 June.  All applicants who receive an award in accordance with the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Acts 1997 and 1992 Acts, and the 2006 amended Act are entitled to receive a Health Amendment Act Card.</p>

            <p eId="para_5547">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_5548">Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_5549">As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular cases raised by the Deputy.

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_5560">Lyme Disease (also known as Lyme borelliosis) is an infection caused by a spiral shaped bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi that is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can sometimes be more severe.</p>
            <p eId="para_5561">Lyme Disease has been reported from North America, Europe, Australia, China and Japan.  They feed by biting and attaching to the skin and sucking blood, normally from animals such as sheep and deer.  Infected ticks are most likely to be encountered in heath land and lightly forested areas of North America and Northern Europe.  Ramblers, campers and those who work in such areas especially if they come into contact with large animals are at greatest risk of being bitten by ticks and of going on to develop disease.  Cases of Lyme Disease appear in Ireland every year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5562">Lyme disease is not a notifiable infectious disease in Ireland.  This means that there is no legal requirement on doctors to report cases to their local Director of Public Health, so this makes estimates of incidence difficult. The schedule of infectious diseases is reviewed on a periodic basis and inclusion of Lyme disease will be considered in the next review.</p>
            <p eId="para_5563">Many infected people have no symptoms at all.  The commonest noticeable evidence of infection is a rash called erythema migrans that is seen in about three-quarters of infected people.  This red, raised skin rash develops between 3 days and a month after a tick bite and spreads outwards from the initial bite site.  This rash can last up to a month and be several inches in diameter.  People can also complain of ‘flu-like symptoms such as headache, sore throat, neck stiffness, fever, muscle aches and general fatigue.  Occasionally, there may be more serious symptoms involving the nervous system, joints, the heart or other tissues.</p>
            <p eId="para_5564">In Ireland, researchers have tried to determine levels of Lyme borelliosis; it has been estimated that there were about 30 human cases per year in the mid-1990s.  Data, however, from the National Virus Reference Laboratory which is responsible for undertaking testing for B. burgdorferi has confirmed that there were only 11 positive cases in 2003; these numbers have been steady at that level for the last couple of years.  There were, however, more than 1,000 requests for testing for B. burgdorferi in 2003.  Over the last several years, the NVRL confirms that virtually all positive cases were associated with travel in the US.  It is felt that there is some, unknown degree of underreporting and under diagnosis of this condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_5565">It would, therefore, appear on initial review, that despite confirmed Irish cases of Lyme borelliosis having been principally associated with travel to North America, there is the potential for individuals to be exposed to biting ticks in Ireland.  It would seem sensible for this reason, to recommend that simple, straightforward information should be made available that will assist those who may potentially be exposed (whether as a result of occupational or leisure activities) to take necessary precautions.  As a response to this in 2004, the Vectorborne Subcommittee of the Scientific Subcommittee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre's (HPSC) Scientific Advisory Subcommittee was established.  One of its terms of reference was to identify and determine the burden of certain significant vectorborne diseases in Ireland and to make recommendations in relation to the provision of advice and guidance.</p>
            <p eId="para_5566">A fact sheet on Lyme Disease has been made available on the HPSC's website to provide members of the General Public and Media with advice on minimising the risk of Lyme Disease (additional incidence information appears here).  In addition, part of the work of the Vectorborne Subcommittee will be the development of Clinical Guidance on the management of Lyme Disease and raising awareness of this condition among clinicians.</p>

I have allocated additional revenue funding of €8 million for this year to meet the additional costs involved and I have approved an additional 69 posts for the roll-out.  BreastCheck appointed the Clinical Directors for the South and West last November and has recently appointed three Consultant Radiologists, two Consultant Surgeons and two Consultant Histopathologists, all with a special interest in breast disease.  The recruitment of Radiographers and other staff is underway.</p>

            <p eId="para_5596">Screening in individual counties will be dictated by BreastCheck's management and operational considerations.  In advance of the commissioning of the static unit in the South, BreastCheck is making every effort to achieve earlier roll-out through the use of a mobile unit.  Early deployment of a mobile unit in advance of the completion of the regional screening unit gives rise to particular and unique operational and recruitment challenges for BreastCheck in the South. At present these challenges have not been overcome and as a result it is not possible to indicate at this stage when an early mobile unit will be deployed. BreastCheck is continuing to make every effort to achieve early deployment in the South.</p>

            <p eId="para_5604">Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>

            <p eId="para_5624">There are a number of contextual factors which must be taken into account in interpreting this data.</p>
            <p eId="para_5625">The Health Strategy Quality &amp; Fairness committed to making improvements in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes eligible for the medical card and to give priority to families with children. In November, 2004 I set out my priorities for new health initiatives in 2005 including the provision of medical cards to an additional 30,000 people and GP visit cards to 200,000 people. Funding of €60 million was provided to the HSE  for these measures. The two initiatives were intended to assist those on low and moderate incomes in accessing GP services and to help remove disincentives to people taking up work or progressing to better paying work.</p>
            <p eId="para_5626">In recent years there have been significant improvements to the way in which people's eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is assessed. Since the start of 2005, the income guidelines used in the assessment of medical card applications have increased by a cumulative29%. Other significant changes in 2005 mean that, on a standardised basis nationally, assessment  is now based on an applicant's and spouse's income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child-care and travel to work. Initially the GP visit card guidelines were 25% higher than the medical card guidelines however in June, 2006 I agreed with the HSE to further increase the income  guidelines for GP visit cards and they are now 50% higher than those used for medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_5627">The HSE (and before 2005 the health boards) have undertaken a substantial programme of work in recent years to improve data quality in the GMS client database. For example, in 2003 and 2004, work carried out by the health boards led to a deletion of approximately 104,000 inappropriate entries where, for example, there were duplicate entries for the same person, the expiry date on the card had passed, the person had moved away or was deceased. This exercise did not involve any reduction in the actual number of people who held medical cards but rather resulted in a more accurate picture of the number of individuals in receipt of GP services under the GMS Scheme.</p>

In June 2006, I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those used in respect of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_5639">My Department and the HSE are at present considering whether any further changes to the guidelines are required, having regard to factors such as changes in income levels generally, the nature of typical household outgoings and also changes to the various social welfare schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5640">In assessing eligibility, the HSE uses national guidelines to assess people's means, which includes their income, certain allowable outgoings and the effect of  other factors which may impact on people's ability to meet the cost of GP services. Under the assessment arrangements, persons whose sole income is derived from Department of Social and Family Affairs payments or HSE payments, even if these exceed the assessment  guidelines, qualify for a medical card.</p>

            <p eId="para_5670">At present, medical cards are granted primarily on the basis of means and individual circumstances.  Under the Health Act, 2004, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  Persons aged seventy years and over are automatically entitled to a medical card, irrespective of means.  The HSE has discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.</p>
            <p eId="para_5671">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_5672">Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_5673">I have no plans to provide for the granting of medical cards to any particular group as a whole.  However, my Department is currently reviewing all legislation relating to eligibility for health and personal social services with a view to making the system as fair and transparent as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_5675">The Dental Treatment Service Scheme (DTSS) provides for a range of dental services for adult medical card holders from participating dentists holding contracts with the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p>
            <p eId="para_5676">The DTSS Review Group was established in May 2006 to undertake a comprehensive review of Primary Care Oral Health Services provided under the DTSS.  Represented on the Review Group are the HSE, the Health Service Employers Agency, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Finance and the Irish Dental Association (IDA).  The Group is chaired by Mr Finbar Flood.</p>
            <p eId="para_5677">Since the Group was established, a legal issue has arisen with regard to the Competition Act 2002 as it relates to the negotiation of professional fees.  My Department has sought legal advice from the Attorney General in this regard.  In the meantime, the management side has offered to continue discussions on the non-fee element of the review.  The IDA has not accepted this offer.</p>
            <p eId="para_5678">I understand that the IDA has balloted its members on a proposal to withdraw the association's support from the DTSS and that this proposal has been carried. The existing contractual arrangements with private dental practitioners under the DTSS for the provision of dental services to eligible patients remain in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_5684">BreastCheck, the National Breast Screening Programme, is currently available in fourteen counties in the Eastern, North Eastern, Midland and parts of the South Eastern regions.  The counties covered are Cavan, Carlow, Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, Longford, Laois, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Offaly, Wicklow, Westmeath and Wexford.  Screening is offered free of charge to all women in the 50-64 age group in these counties, which is approximately 56% of the national target population.</p>
            <p eId="para_5685">I am committed to ensuring that the BreastCheck service is rolled out to the remaining regions in the country as quickly as possible.  I have allocated additional revenue funding of €8 million for this year to meet the additional costs involved and I have approved an additional 69 posts for the roll-out.  BreastCheck appointed the Clinical Directors for the South and West last November and has recently appointed three Consultant Radiologists, two Consultant Surgeons and two Consultant Histopathologists, all with a special interest in breast disease.  The recruitment of Radiographers and other staff is underway.</p>
            <p eId="para_5686">I have also made available an additional €26.7m capital funding for the construction of two new clinical units and the provision of five additional mobile units and state of the art digital equipment.  The static units at the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital in Cork and University College Hospital Galway are on schedule for hand-over in September followed by a three week commissioning period.  They will be operational in October.</p>
            <p eId="para_5687">In advance of the commissioning of the static unit in the South, BreastCheck is making every effort to achieve earlier roll-out through the use of a mobile unit.  Early deployment of a mobile unit in advance of the completion of the regional screening unit gives rise to particular and unique operational and recruitment challenges for BreastCheck in the South.  At present, these challenges have not been overcome and as a result it is not possible to indicate at this stage when an early mobile unit will be deployed.  As regards the West, BreastCheck expects the roll-out to commence in April.</p>

As part of the competitive dialogue, with consortia who expressed an interest in the initiative in Galway, the pre-qualified bidders decided, for commercial reasons, not to continue with the process in respect of Galway.

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_5701">The Government is firmly committed to the development of an Irish biofuels market and to the development and deployment of bio-energy generally in Ireland. A range of initiatives is already in place to support the development of the biofuels sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_5702">The 2005 pilot mineral oil tax relief scheme for biofuels has resulted in eight projects being awarded excise relief for a two year period under the scheme. Building on the success of this scheme a further Biofuels Mineral Oil tax Relief Scheme II was introduced in 2006, valued at over €200m. Under this scheme sixteen projects have been awarded excise relief to the period 2010. The scheme will enable us to reach the initial target of 2.2% market penetration of biofuels by 2008. When fully operational the relief is expected to support the use and production of some 163 million litres of biofuels each year therefore increasing the market penetration of Biofuels to the public. As a result of this scheme, biofuels are already being mainstreamed in blends of up to 5% at existing petrol and diesel pumps, and higher blends are being sold to identified vehicle fleets. The Government has also introduced a 50% VRT relief on Flexible Fuel Vehicles, which are capable of running on blends of up to 85% ethanol in petrol. These vehicles are now available in Ireland from a number of car manufacturers. The National Climate Change Strategy also commits to a re-alignment of VRT and Motor Tax to favour more energy efficient cars. The planned introduction of a Biofuels Obligation by 2009, will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales.</p>
            <p eId="para_5703">Grants for the conversion of diesel engine vehicles to use Pure Plant Oil (PPO) have been made available by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), working with the four companies who were granted excise relief under the PPO category in the Pilot Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Scheme. The Department of Transport is also funding specific biofuels initiatives and will publish a Sustainable Transport Action Plan later in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_5704">In tandem with these developments the Bioenergy Action Plan commits to the introduction of biofuels in blends of up to 5% in existing Local Authority and CIE fleets and in the range of 30% in new vehicle purchases. As highlighted in the recently published National Biomass Action Plan it is the Government's intention to encourage the use of biofuels in public service vehicles and this will be done through the following: CIE transport companies to ensure that all of their new fossil fleet purchases are capable of using biofuels at blends of at least 30% by including the requirement for such technical capability to be specified in procurement tenders; CIE transport companies mandated to move as soon as possible towards a 5% blend in all their existing diesel fleet; Promote the use of biofuels at up to 5% blends in Local Authority fleets and when purchasing new fossil fuel vehicles ensure that they are capable of taking much higher biofuel blends, in the range of 30% and higher; Publication of a Sustainable Transport Action Plan before the end of 2007 which will identify further measures that will help a switch to biofuels and more energy efficient forms of fuel for transport.</p>

         the measures in place to encourage households to have greener homes; the grants available for improved energy efficient homes and the installation of renewable technologies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_5706">The Greener Homes Scheme is providing support to homeowners to invest in a range of renewable energy heating technologies including solar technology, wood biomass boilers and stoves, and heat pumps. Funding of €47m has been provided for the scheme. There have been almost 14,000 applications received since the scheme was launched. Grant aid of €1,100 to €6,500 is being provided under the scheme, depending on the individual technology used. The grant for solar panels is €300 per m 2. The scheme is being administered on behalf of my Department by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and all applications are being processed through SEI. Details and application forms are available on the SEI website (<i>www.sei.ie/greenerhomes</i>), and a dedicated low-call phone line is also open.</p>
            <p eId="para_5707">Funding is also provided, through SEI, under the Warmer Homes Scheme which provides insulation and other energy efficiency measures to low income homes across Ireland. Eligible householders are typically in receipt of the Fuel Allowance, Invalidity or Disability Benefit. The service is delivered principally through community based organisations that typically secure the labour through a FÁS or Rural Social Scheme. SEI provides funding towards materials and overheads for the operation of the service, which is provided at little or no cost to the homeowner.</p>
            <p eId="para_5708">The Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS) provides the following services to eligible households: Draught proofing, Attic insulation, Lagging jacket, Low energy light bulbs, Cavity wall insulation, where appropriate.  Since the start of the scheme in 2000 almost 13,000 low income households have benefited. Currently there are 18 such service providers approved for funding in the in the scheme with two each in counties Dublin, Donegal, Roscommon, Cork and Mayo, and one each in counties Cavan, Kerry, Leitrim, Galway, Westmeath, Limerick, Clare and Wexford.</p>
            <p eId="para_5709">The Warmer Homes Scheme is adding further capacity through two different initiatives. The first is a pilot which took place in Dundalk and has addressed 161 homes to date with private contractors with substantial insulation measures. The final phase is currently under way at the moment. Dundalk was an area which was not covered by a community based organisation and the insulation services were provided by two contractors appointed following a tender process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5710">The second initiative resulted from a Budget allocation of €2M, by my colleague the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, which allowed the expansion of the service through delivery by the private sector of a whole house approach, to addressing fuel  poverty The range of services included under this new initiative includes the installation of high efficiency central heating as well as substantial insulation measures. This initiative is currently underway in Waterford City and County in approximately 400 eligible homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5711">SEI's House of Tomorrow Programme provides funding to developers of groups of housing, where the housing units have energy efficient features that significantly exceed current building regulations. 1,187 new social housing dwellings, 3,198 new private dwellings and 365 social housing refurbishments have been completed to date under this programme. The range of renewable technologies installed include: Condensing oil and gas boilers (2922), Solar water heating (1634 homes,Heat recovery ventilation (2,065 homes), Ground source heat pumps (731 homes), Wood pellet boilers (724 homes).</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_5713">Under the current funding agreement, for the period October 2006 to October 2007, up to €312,138 is available to Energy Action to substantially address up to 600 low income households with energy efficiency measures. The measures provided include: Draught proofing, Attic insulation, Hot water cylinder Jackets, Low energy light-bulbs, Energy Advice. A further €25,000 capital grant was provided to Energy Action for the purchase of two vehicles for the services crews in February 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_5714">Since the start of the scheme in 2000 almost 13,000 low income households have benefited. Approximately 69% of the households were located in Dublin or the surrounding areas and were serviced by the two Dublin based community organisations, Energy Action and CHIP (based in Clondalkin).</p>
            <p eId="para_5715">The Warmer Homes Scheme is adding further capacity through two different initiatives. The first is a pilot which took place in Dundalk and has addressed 161 homes to date with private contractors with substantial insulation measures. The final phase is currently under w ay.

This initiative is currently underway in Waterford City and County in approximately 400 eligible homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5716">The current Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS) delivery is through community based organisations (CBOs). The CBOs receive funding from Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) as well as core funding from FÁS through Community Employment or other programmes, or through the Rural Social Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5717">The Energy Policy White Paper ‘Delivering A Sustainable Energy Future For Ireland' sets out 13 specific actions in relation to addressing fuel poverty. The two key actions relating to the Warmer Homes Scheme represent an ongoing commitment to the Warmer Homes Scheme with an increase in both the capacity and the range of services available. Specifically we have committed to finalising a framework for significant extension of the Low Income Housing Schemes which will accelerate the pace of remedial actions and to building on the results of the €2 million Waterford Fuel Poverty Research Project being undertaken by SEI.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</from>
            <p eId="para_5770">I propose to take Questions Nos. 282 and 297 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5771">The Department's Statement of Strategy 2005-2007 indicates that procedures will be developed for enhanced coordination and cooperation between public bodies on management of the coastal zone. This is in response to the increasing demands and pressures on coastal areas and their resources, and the fact that a wide range of public bodies and agencies have roles to play in managing and regulating various aspects and dimensions of the coastal zone.</p>
            <p eId="para_5772">The need for action in this area has been recognised at EU level also, with the adoption in 2002 of a Recommendation on Integrated Coastal Zone Management. This asks Member States to undertake a stocktaking of the laws, institutions, agencies/bodies etc that impact on coastal areas, and, based on the results of the stocktaking to develop a strategy or strategies for Integrated Coastal Zone Management. The stock take  for Ireland has been largely completed and will be published in due course. This stock take will allow work to commence on the regulatory framework to support an integrated approach to coastal zone management.</p>
            <p eId="para_5773">A consolidation and streamlining of the Foreshore Acts is also proposed. This will modernise these regulatory processes and procedures and provide a modern and effective legal framework for the management of the State's foreshore estate in the future. It will also allow for the provision of any necessary legislative underpinning of more integrated approaches to management of coastal areas. Preparation of these proposals will take account, among other things, of the principles in the EU Recommendation, the outcome of the EU Maritime Green paper and the EU Marine Strategy Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_5774">In addition, the Department will shortly commission a consultancy on the future development of coastal zone management in Ireland which will assist in a major strategic review of the legislative framework, structures, and procedures in place to manage the State-owned foreshore.</p>

            <p eId="para_5776">An application from Dublin Port Company for approval under the Foreshore Acts for the proposed reclamation of an area of some 21 hectares of foreshore was made to the Department in March 2002.  Since then, Departmental officials have held periodic discussions with Dublin Port Company's management regarding issues arising from the application.  This is a normal feature of most major foreshore applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_5777">The application is being considered in accordance with the appropriate procedures.  These include a process of public consultation in which it will be open to interested persons to make submissions on the proposal.  Developments of this nature require planning permission before any determination can be made on the foreshore application.  Issues associated with ownership of the foreshore as well as environmental matters will form an important part of the Department's consideration of the proposal.</p>

            <p eId="para_5819">A variety of instruments apply to the management of the wild salmon fishery.  In the case of the commercial fishery, there are two key instruments, the Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme (No. 2) Regulations 2006 — S.I. No. 672 of 2006 and the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order 2007 — S.I. No 129 of 2007.  The former contains provisions for the regulation of salmon river quotas and the latter details the number and type of commercial fishing licences that may be allocated in any fisheries district.</p>
            <p eId="para_5820">As that order contains no provision for the allocation of drift net licences and limits the number of other licences, this effectively closes the mixed stock fishery for salmon.  The tagging scheme regulations have been in operation since the beginning of 2007.  The Control of Fishing for Salmon Order 2007 came into force on 22 March 2007.  The commercial fishery does not commence until May this year.</p>

        <b>Mr. Broughan</b>

         if he has reviewed the European Commission’s 12th annual report on the telecoms sector which ranks Ireland 16th out of 25th for broadband take-up and with the highest monthly line rental charges across Europe; the measures he will put in place to address this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_759">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_5830">I have reviewed a copy of the EU Commission's 12th report on the EU's telecom markets.  I note the report's finding concerning Ireland that "broadband penetration is still below the EU-25 average, but has improved substantially."  I would like to point out that the speed of take-up of broadband in Ireland is extraordinary.  The data used by the Commission for the report shows that the rate of growth in broadband in Ireland was running at 105% per annum (to Q3 2006) while the rate of growth for the EU-25 was only 32%.  This means that Ireland is actually growing three times faster than the EU-25.</p>
            <p eId="para_5831">The latest official figures from the Communications Regulation (ComReg) which were released last week show that Quarter 4 of 2006 saw the highest number of new subscribers added in any single period since the launch of broadband services in Ireland, with an additional 80,600 new subscriptions added.  At the end of 2006 Ireland had 517,300 broadband subscribers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5832">The EU report also refers to broadband penetration of 10.3% for October 2006 compared to the EU-25 average of 15.7%.  As a result of Ireland's rapid growth in the last quarter of 2006 the penetration rate at the end of 2006 stood at 12.19%.  I am heartened by industry estimates that show that we are now very close to 14%.  Based on the current rate of growth, Ireland is on course to pass the EU-25 average of 15.7% by the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5833">While the provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, by private sector companies is a matter for the companies themselves, the Government has recognised that in some areas of the country the market has failed to invest in broadband roll-out.  To that end the Government has intervened with various initiatives to facilitate broadband in these regions.  So far, this Government has invested in (i) international connectivity; (ii) regional backhaul; (iii) metropolitan area networks (MANs); and (iv) group broadband schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5834">In addition to these interventions, I recently announced a National Broadband Scheme.  This scheme will target the last 10-15% of the population who are without a broadband service and who would remain without a service without intervention.  The Scheme will, when it is rolled out, ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband are met.  The Department will commence the tender process as soon as possible.  In addition, the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Bill, which has been passed by both Houses, will shortly be enacted into law giving ComReg enhanced powers which should help to alleviate the Local Loop Unbundling (LLU) bottleneck and result in even stronger broadband growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_5835">I have no function in relation to pricing, including line rental charges.  This is a matter for the service providers concerned, who are regulated by the independent regulator, ComReg.</p>

            <p eId="para_5837">An application from Dublin Port Company for approval under the Foreshore Acts for the proposed reclamation of an area of some 21 hectares of foreshore was made to the Department in March 2002.  Since then, Departmental officials have held periodic discussions with Dublin Port Company's management regarding issues arising from the application.  This is a normal feature of most major foreshore applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_5838">The application is being considered in accordance with the appropriate procedures.  These include a process of public consultation in which it will be open to interested persons to make submissions on the proposal.  Developments of this nature require planning permission before any determination can be made on the foreshore application.  Issues associated with ownership of the foreshore as well as environmental matters will form an important part of the Department's consideration of the proposal.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_5842">Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) the continental shelf is that part of the seabed over which a coastal State exercises sovereign rights with regard to the exploration and exploitation of natural resources including oil and gas deposits as well as other minerals and biological resources of the seabed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5843">Where the continental shelf extends beyond 200 nautical miles a State is required by the Convention to make a submission to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.  The Commission assesses the limits and data submitted by the coastal State and makes recommendations, which are final and binding.  For the purposes of preparing its submissions, Ireland has divided its extended continental shelf into three sub-areas — Zone A (Hatton-Rockall area), Zone B (Porcupine Abyssal Plain — "western area") and Zone C (Celtic Sea/Bay of Biscay — "southern area") and has made submissions in respect of Zones B and C (see below).</p>
            <p eId="para_5844">In relation to Zone B, or the "western area", Ireland made a submission for the central undisputed portion of its extended continental shelf in the area of the Porcupine Abyssal Plain in May 2005.  We expect final recommendations from the Commission in April 2007.  The preliminary findings of the sub-commission examining the submission indicate acceptance of the outer limits as submitted, with some minor modifications.  Although Ireland was the fourth country to make a submission (after the Russian Federation in 2001, and Brazil and Australia in 2004) this will result in Ireland becoming the first state to receive final and binding recommendations on an outer limit from the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_5845">Zone C, or the "southern area", was the subject of a joint submission to the Commission, made by Ireland together with the UK, France and Spain in May 2006.  It is hoped that the Commission will issue its final recommendations in August 2007.  It is expected that the major part, if not all, of the outer limit will be accepted by the Commission.  Thereafter, the question of delimitation of this zone established on the basis of these recommendations will be considered by the four states concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_5846">The current Irish designated area is set out in S.I. No. 657 of 2001 and the relevant legislation exists in the Continental Shelf Act No. l4 of 11 June l968.  Until the recommendations are formally issued by the Commission, Ireland is not in a position to amend its designated continental shelf.  Furthermore, until delimitation negotiations are completed in Zone C, the exact area in the Celtic Sea/Bay of Biscay — "southern area" under Irish jurisdiction is unknown.</p>
            <p eId="para_5847">The Irish designated continental shelf area has previously been mapped and surveyed under programmes undertaken by my Department under the Irish National Seabed Survey (INSS).  It is anticipated that these newly awarded areas would be surveyed by the INSS successor programme, INFOMAR, being undertaken jointly by the Geological Survey of Ireland and the Marine Institute.  Such surveys are the basis for the development of a comprehensive management plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_7803">Ireland and our EU partners apply a range of sanctions and restrictive measures to Burma, referred to as the EU Common Position. These measures, first introduced in April 2004, reflect our concerns about the political and human rights situation in the country, the continued detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political detainees, and restrictions placed on the operation of international organisations and NGOs. In view of the current political situation in Burma, and the lack of progress on democracy and human rights, Ireland supports the retention of these measures. The EU will reconsider the Common Position in light of genuine and substantial improvement in the political and human rights situation in Burma.</p>
            <p eId="para_7804">Ireland and the EU continue to raise the issue of the situation in Burma in all relevant fora, and to work closely with partners to effectively engage international organisations in addressing the situation in that country. The EU has supported action by the International Labour Office (ILO) to address reports of widespread and systematic forced labour practices, including child labour, and that individuals who lodged complaints of forced labour have subsequently been prosecuted and their appeals systematically rejected. I welcome in this context the supplementary understanding agreed between the ILO and the Government of Burma on 26 February to seek to enable victims of forced labour to seek redress, and urge the Burmese Government to ensure the full implementation of this agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_7805">The EU-ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Nuremberg on 14-15 March provided a further opportunity to raise the issue with our ASEAN partners, and also directly by Minister of State Noel Treacy with the Foreign Minister of Burma/Myanmar in a bilateral discussion. Ministers in Nuremberg encouraged Burma to make greater progress towards national reconciliation as well as to involve constructively all political parties and ethnic groups in an inclusive dialogue. Ministers also called for a lifting of restrictions on political parties and the early release of those under detention. I welcome ASEAN's continued efforts to encourage reform and reconciliation in Burma.</p>
            <p eId="para_7806">With EU partners, I strongly support the use of the UN Secretary General's good offices to bring about peaceful political change in Burma. It is vitally important that the Burmese government allow the UN to play a role in promoting common ground between the government and the National League for Democracy, so that the National Convention, whose task is to draft a new constitution, can proceed in a more inclu With EU partners, I strongly support the use of the UN Secretary General's good offices to bring about peaceful political change in Burma. It is vitally important that the Burmese government allow the UN to play a role in promoting common ground between the government and the National League for Democracy, so that the National Convention, whose task is to draft a new constitution, can proceed in a more inclusive way. Without broader representation, the usefulness of the National Convention will be very severely limited. This would, of course, be greatly facilitated by the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other opposition political leaders.</p>
            <p eId="para_7807">Clearly, other UN bodies should continue to monitor the situation in Burma, and I would see real value in the Human Rights Council (HRC) examining the situation in Burma at one of its sessions this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_7808">Finally, Irish Aid also supports human rights and democratisation in Burma through its Civil Society Fund and Multi-Annual Programme Scheme. From 2003 to 2005, Irish Aid has allocated Trócaire funding of €1,123,307 in support of its programme to strengthen civil society in Burma and in support of Burmese refugees in Thailand. Irish Aid is also providing over €290,000 to the Voluntary Service Overseas organisation for a three year programme promoting democratisation, human rights and reconciliation among five ethnic groups on the Burma/Thailand border.</p>

            <p eId="para_7821">The Interparliamentary Union already brings parliaments together and has regular meetings in the margins of the UN General Assembly. Irish parliamentarians are very active in its important work, of which I believe all of us in the Oireachtas are supportive. Therefore I do not see what value added a UN Parliamentary Assembly would bring. Furthermore, the 2004 Report of the High Level Panel on UN Reform did not come forward with such a proposal. Nor was there any support for the proposal from UN Secretary-General Annan in his reform initiatives of 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_7831">Funding is provided by my Department to local authorities towards the capital costs of a new or replacement public swimming pool or the refurbishment of an existing pool under the terms of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.  This Programme is funded from Subhead C2 of my Department's Vote, where the provision for 2007 is €25m.  The Programme provides for a maximum grant of €3.8million and there are four stages in the development of a swimming pool project.  These are, in order of progress, Feasibility Study/ Preliminary Report; Contract Documents; Tender and Construction.  Grant aid is formally allocated when the tender for the project is approved.</p>
            <p eId="para_7832">The current round of the Programme closed to applicants on 31 July 2000.  Of the 57 projects within the current round, 41 projects have been approved grant aid, of which 23 have been funded and completed.  The remaining 18 projects that are under construction or due to start construction shortly will continue to draw down their grant allocation in during 2007 and beyond.  3 projects are out to tender and are likely to seek formal grant approval in 2007.  The remaining 13 projects are at earlier stages in the approval process of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7833">The drawdown of moneys under the programme depends on the speed at which local authorities press ahead with projects and submit grant drawdown claims.</p>

The Review is examining, among other things, how the programme has worked to date and what changes, if any, are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery.  The Review is currently being finalised and it is my intention to publish it as soon as possible.  Following consideration of the recommendations in the review it is my intention to launch a new round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme as soon as possible.  When the Programme is re-opened and advertised, it will be open to all local authorities to submit applications under the terms that will apply.</p>

        <b>Mr. F. McGrath</b>
         asked the

         if he will come up with a plan to develop sports in disadvantaged areas. 
        [14013/07]

          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism" eId="spk_778">
            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
            <p eId="para_7917">The budget for sport has increased from €17 million in 1997 to over €295 million in 2007. By the end of 2006, the Government had invested over €900 million directly into sport since 1997, to support the promotion and development of Irish sport and the provision of a modern sporting infrastructure with high quality facilities catering for the participation, coaching, training and competition needs of all levels and types of sport.  Furthermore the National Development Plan 2007-2013 includes a commitment to provide €991m for sport under the aegis of my own Department during the period up to 2013.  This is an unprecedented level of funding in the history of Irish sport and is largely directed at ensuring that opportunities for participation in sport exist for all communities in every part of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_7918">The increased funding provided by the Government to the Irish Sports Council from €13 million in 2000 to over €54 million this year has enabled a number of significant interventions for the benefit of disadvantaged areas. Examples include the Local Sports Partnerships network, development officers in National Governing Bodies and special funding to the FAI, GAA and IRFU aimed at increasing participation among children and young people.</p>
            <p eId="para_7919">The Local Sports Partnerships have received over €16.2 million in Government funding since they were first set up in 2001 and they represent a major opportunity to engage socially disadvantaged people in sport. The Sports Partnership network will be a national network by the end of 2007. One major initiative for this network will be the investment of funds from the Dormant Accounts for disability officers and for areas of disadvantage, with €2 million available under each initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_7920">The Irish Sports Council's Buntús programme is now rolling out to primary schools in Local Sports Partnership areas. The programme aims to support the primary PE curriculum by providing equipment, resource cards and training to teachers. Feedback through the LSP network for the programme has been extremely positive. The Buntús approach to introducing children to sport has also been adopted by the FAI as Buntús soccer, by the IRFU as Buntús Tag Rugby and is also being delivered in programmes with golf, badminton and basketball. "Buntús Start" has also been introduced for pre-school children (3-5 year olds) and is delivered in cooperation with the HSE and County Childcare Committees.</p>
            <p eId="para_7921">The Irish Sports Council's investment in programmes, such as Women in Sport and Sport for Older People, is more evidence of the targeted approach to sports development, seeking to advance those who face the biggest barriers in sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_7922">The FAI, in particular, supported by the Government is carrying out valuable work in disadvantaged areas. A further €1 million is being provided by the Government to the FAI this year towards the continued implementation of its Technical Development Plan. Since the launch of the plan in 2004, the FAI has made excellent progress in increasing participation at all levels for all sectors of society thus making a positive impact on social and community issues throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_7923">Some of the key successes include the recruitment of more than 20 Football in the Community Development Officers, in cooperation with local authorities, to work in the most disadvantaged areas in the country through programmes such as Midnight leagues, inner city Futsal and street leagues targeting the at risk youth communities. The recently launched FAI Mini-Pitch Programme involving the FAI, various Local Authorities and my own Department and providing 64 enclosed small-sized pitches all around the country is another excellent example.</p>
            <p eId="para_7924">The sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country to put in place sporting facilities or purchase sporting equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_7925">As part of the evaluation process of the programme, prioritisation is given to projects from urban and rural disadvantaged areas.   Disadvantaged areas are those that have been designated by Government for special support through the RAPID, Local Drugs Task Force and CLÁR Programmes.  In addition, applicants from these areas only have to provide evidence of 20% own funding for the projects for which they are applying as against 30% for applicants from non-disadvantaged areas.  Furthermore, my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, makes available additional allocations to successful applicants from disadvantaged areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_7926">Since 2003, when the current system of prioritisation for applicants from disadvantaged areas was put in place, over €91.75 million has been allocated to projects from RAPID, CLAR and Local Drugs Task Force areas under the programme and additional allocations of over €12 million have been made by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_7927">The Government has invested heavily in capital and current programmes to support sport. Significantly, we have also responded to the needs of those who are viewed as being outside the traditional sports sector.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
            <p eId="para_7976">Under the relevant provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts, the Labour Court conducts a hearing on a trade dispute and then issues a recommendation setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it should be settled.  The law on industrial relations disputes does not generally seek to impose a solution on the parties to a dispute but rather seeks to assist them in arriving at a solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_7977">I understand that the Labour Court held a hearing in relation to the dispute referred to by the Deputy and its Recommendation on the matter issued in August 2006.  As it is a Court of last resort in the industrial relations process, it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to give serious consideration to the Court's recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_7978">Recommendations of the Labour Court are not legally binding however, and, under our voluntarist approach to industrial relations, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute ultimately rests with the parties to the dispute.  There are no plans to change the legislation in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_7979">Memoranda of Understanding between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission have been agreed which set out a formal framework for relations between the Department and the bodies.  These memoranda are concerned with the administrative operations of the bodies and have regard to the fact that both the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission are independent statutory bodies and, therefore, act independently of the Department in carrying out their statutory  functions. In accordance with Industrial Relations legislation, both bodies are required to submit an annual report to the Minister.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_7981">A wide variety of different trade activities is undertaken by Enterprise Ireland (EI) on behalf of my Department. This includes Outward Trade Missions, some of which  are led by a Minister, usually either by myself or by Minister Martin;   there have been 74 such Ministerial-led Missions since 2003.  In addition, Inward Missions organised by EI are made of behalf of  buyers and business  partners. EI also organises participation in Trade Fairs and other marketing activities on behalf of its client companies.  The latter make a financial contribution towards their involvement in most events.  The following table gives details of Enterprise Ireland costs in organising these various trade events since 2003, as well as the income received from participants.</p>
            <p eId="para_7982">The information set out in the table below represents the vast bulk of the expenditure on trade events over the years in question. The Deputy will appreciate that while there are likely to be some additional incidental costs, which have arisen in both the Department and EI, these are relatively minor in terms of the overall activity.</p>

            <p eId="para_8011">The objective of the Innovation Voucher initiative, which I launched in March and which is being administered by Enterprise Ireland, is to build links between Ireland's public knowledge providers and small businesses to create a cultural shift in the small business community's approach to innovation whilst creating greater synergies between the two.</p>
            <p eId="para_8012">This initiative, which is based on a recommendation by the Small Business Forum, will operate initially in pilot phase commencing April 2007. The target set for this phase of the scheme is to issue 200 vouchers worth €5,000 each. The vouchers can be exchanged for advice and expertise from the research provider and will be available to the widest range of small businesses in Ireland. On completion of the pilot, a full evaluation and review will be completed to see how the initiative can be developed and improved.</p>
            <p eId="para_8013">In order to be successful in an application for an Innovation Voucher, the company's project must require an innovative solution, provide additional value for the company and have on-going benefits. Enterprise Ireland's assessment process will ensure that those applications that demonstrate clear added-value for their business and that are innovative in nature will be awarded a voucher.</p>
            <p eId="para_8014">An advantage of this initiative is that a small business can continue to concentrate on running its business whilst its chosen knowledge provider works on the innovative solution to the firm's identified problem or business opportunity. Through the process of assigning the voucher to the knowledge provider in exchange for the provider's advice and expertise, linkages will be built between the small firm and the research organisation.</p>

            <p eId="para_8017">As at 4th April 2007, there have been 321 applications to decentralise to Carlow with my Department. There are 108 Carlow-bound applicants assigned within the Department, with a further 73 Carlow-bound applicants yet to be assigned to the Department. 140 applicants have for a variety of reasons withdrawn or changed their applications to decentralise to Carlow.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8030">To date, 3 staff members have re-located to Birr, Co. Offaly, and it is anticipated that between 40 and 50 staff will be located in Birr by the middle of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_8044">I propose to take Questions Nos. 324 to 326, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8045">The Health and Safety Authority is an independent statutory body  which is charged with the inspection and enforcement of occupational safety, health and welfare standards under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_8046">I understand that the Health and Safety Authority received a complaint which alleged that a rock bund at the place concerned was unsafe. The place was visited by an Inspector of the Authority in May 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_8047">The inspector requested a copy of a consultant's report on the structure which had already been prepared. On receipt of the report the HSA inspector took immediate action to prevent danger to workers, or to members of the public resulting from work activity, on the site, by issuing prohibition notices prohibiting work activity on top of the bund which might destabilise it.</p>
            <p eId="para_8048">I also understand that the inspector wrote to the local authority concerned informing them of the situation.  It appears that the structure was recently demolished.</p>
            <p eId="para_8049">Following the fencing off of the area in question and its non-use as a place of work the Health and Safety Authority had no further role in the matter. I am satisfied that the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 were fully adequate to allow the Authority to discharge its remit to protect workers and others from danger resulting from work activities in this case.</p>

            <p eId="para_8051">I understand that in 2003, the Drumshanbo Community Council received a grant for a Feasibility Study from Leitrim County Enterprise Board to a total value of €6,350.  The purpose of this grant was to investigate the feasibility of renovating the Laird/Kepak Food Facility into a food village, now known as the Drumshanbo Food Hub.</p>
            <p eId="para_8052">Drumshanbo Food Hub was also approved for assistance amounting to €300,000 in 2003 under Enterprise Ireland's Community Enterprise Centre Scheme.  Drumshanbo Food Hub opened in 2006 and there are currently three food enterprises operating from the Centre, employing a total of 13 people.  In addition, a number of site visits to The Food Hub by inward investors have been facilitated by Enterprise Ireland.  The agency will continue to promote this quality food production incubation space.</p>

            <p eId="para_8054">IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions.  The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</p>
            <p eId="para_8055">During 2006, there were 73 new jobs created and 176 jobs lost in IDA supported companies in Country Kerry.  At the end of 2006 there were 1785 people employed in seventeen IDA assisted companies in the County.  Total permanent employment in all enterprise agency assisted firms in Kerry stood at 6,928 at the end of 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_8056">The attractiveness of Kerry for inward investment has to be seen within a regional context.  In line with the National Spatial Strategy, the locations of emphasis for IDA in Kerry are the linked Hubs of Tralee and Killarney.  The Agency promotes the County as part of an integrated region with access to a population of approx. 140,000, as well as the expanded population of the Mid-West and South-West regions.  Based on the strengths of the region, IDA is particularly targeting the ICT (incl. software), and Globally Traded Business sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_8057">The Strategic Competitiveness Programme that is operated by IDA is designed to help consolidate and grow client companies existing operations in the region by achieving substantial productivity improvements or the addition of new business functions such as R&amp;D, marketing, logistics management, shared service centres and customer or technical support activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_8058">In addition, IDA Ireland is engaged with the Kerry Employment Action Team  and the newly formed inter-agency Expert Group on Kerry to plan for the County's future economic growth.  Both groups are focussed on how Kerry can best position itself in the context of the National Spatial Strategy, which is at the heart of the new National Development Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_8059">I am confident that the current policies and strategies in place will deliver the best results in terms of investment and jobs for the people of the region.</p>

            <p eId="para_8064">IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions.  The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</p>
            <p eId="para_8065">North Tipperary is marketed for inward investment within a regional context, with proximity to Limerick and Cork and its location along the Limerick/Dublin and Cork/Dublin corridors. The National Spatial Strategy (NSS) provides a framework for the achievement of this goal.  IDA Ireland's regional strategy reflects the NSS, with an emphasis on the gateway and hub locations.  International access through Shannon Airport continues to play a major role in the economic development of the Mid-West region.</p>
            <p eId="para_8066">The transition to a knowledge based economy both in Ireland as a whole and in North Tipperary, can only be achieved by winning new FDI in innovation driven, high value, high skills sectors.  The development of Gateway and Hub locations, as laid out in the NSS, is crucial to the development of the regions.  These regions must possess the population, skills base, business services, infrastructure and vibrant enterprise base that is capable of attracting and winning FDI in competition with similar locations internationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_8067">In moving the Mid-West to a more knowledge based economy, IDA Ireland is partnering with educational institutions in the region, in particular UL, LIT and TI, in developing the skill-sets necessary to attract high value-added employment in  activities such as R&amp;D, corporate services, shared services, supply chain management, treasury management,</p>
            <p eId="para_8068">Responsibility for the provision of industrial property solutions within the Mid-West region also lies with Shannon Development.  IDA Ireland works closely with Shannon Development in the promotion and marketing of these tailored property solutions. Initiatives undertaken by Shannon Development include the Development of the Tipperary Technology Park in Thurles.  Shannon Development has also acquired a 29 acre site in Roscrea with a view to developing a Business Park appropriate to the needs of the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_8069">At the end of 2006, there were five IDA supported companies in North Tipperary, employing 610 people.  I am confident that the policies and strategies currently in place will deliver the best results in terms of investment and jobs for the people of the Region.</p>

            <p eId="para_8071">The Early Warning System of potential job losses and firms in difficulty operating in my Department is an internal system based on material provided on a confidential basis through IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development.  Not only is the information confidential, but it is also very sensitive.  Indeed, the information is provided initially by the relevant companies on the basis that it will be treated as both confidential and sensitive.  It is important for the companies in question that no advantage is given away to their competitors.</p>
            <p eId="para_8072">Notification of firms in difficulty can range from a number of hours to a number of months.  Clearly, the earlier the notification the more time there is for the Industrial Development agencies to work with the companies to minimise potential job losses or avoid them completely if alternative business can be secured.  The actions of the agencies in this regard are handled on a one to one basis with each individual client and it is of the utmost importance that the client / agency confidential working relationship is upheld.</p>
            <p eId="para_8073">I am satisfied with the system that is currently in operation but I am acutely aware that it can only continue to operate if all parties continue to respect the sensitive and confidential nature of this work.</p>

         the criteria that will apply to the public sector R and D projects, which will receive funding under the Competitive Fund of the STI strategy; the parties outside of the respective Government Departments to be involved in the projects; the monitoring mechanism that will be introduced to oversee the proper execution of the fund; and the targets that have been set for the fund.

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_793">
            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_8075">The comprehensive STI Strategy launched by Government on 18 June last year, and supported to the amount of 8.2bn euro in the current National Development Plan, included a new Competitive Fund of 40 million euro for additional public sector research in 2007 and 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_8076">Following submissions to the Interdepartmental Committee on STI and consultation with the Minister for Finance, this Fund has now been allocated across the four research performing/funding Departments covering; agriculture and food, energy, the marine, environment and health research. The emphasis is very much on collaboration between relevant sectors for added value and this innovative Fund exemplifies our whole of government approach to STI policy. The Fund will continue in 2009 and 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_8077">Fundamental to this new Fund is its cross-cutting nature, promoting synergies between a number of departments and sectoral research areas such as food and health or energy and the environment. It is the first time that research funds have been allocated to the sectoral Departments in this way and it has proven to be a very effective and stimulating process for all concerned, leading to an exciting range of new projects and programmes. Examples of valuable cross-cutting research supported by the new Fund include the development of marine functional foods and research related to climate change, including aspects of early warning using the facilities of the Marine Institute. The Fund is also supporting linked research projects and programmes in the areas of Food &amp; Health, Agri-Environment, and Bio-Energy.  This research will underpin the development of Agri-Food &amp; Forestry policy in areas of shared interest between the Departments involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_8078">Apart from the Government Departments concerned the public sector research agencies who will draw on the fund include Teagasc, COFORD (National Council for Forest Research and Development for Ireland), the Environmental Protection Agency, the Marine Institute and the Health Research Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_8079">Monitoring of investment under this programme will, in the first instance, be supervised by the parent Department.  Like the rest of the STI Strategy, the Fund will be monitored by the Interdepartmental Committee on STI, lead by my Department, which reports to the Cabinet Subcommittee on STI, which I chair.  This is the first such allocation arising under the competitive fund.  The information to be gleaned from ongoing monitoring and from ex-post review will help us refine the Competitive Fund model for future tranches of investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_8080">Details of the agreed allocations for 2007 and 2008 are attached in tabular form and additional detailed information on the research supported by this Fund is available to the Deputy from the individual departments concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_8081">Over 2007-2008 an additional total €40 million funding is being provided for public sector research, having regard to the priorities and linkages between sectors identified in Chapter Six of the STI Strategy, the importance of competition and peer review and the strategic requirements of relevant Departments.  The agreed allocations from this fund are as follows:</p>

        <b>Mr. Eamon Ryan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
         the number of labour inspectors currently operational; the number of inspectors to be allocated to each regional centre; the number of the existing labour inspectors to be decentralised and the number of these that have agreed to decentralisation; and the overall cost of the relocation of labour inspectorates to the regional centres.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
            <p eId="para_8260">The number of Labour Inspectors will be progressively increased from 31 at present (two of whom are on extended leave) to 90 by end-2007 with the expectation that assignments will be made from the second quarter of 2007. An additional 7 new inspectors will take up appointment on the 16th April. The necessary arrangements and selection processes for the remainder are being progressed at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_8261">The number of inspectors to be allocated to each regional office is set out in the following tabular statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_8262">Existing Inspectors are currently considering decentralisation options.  When material in relation to the number of inspectors decentralising is available, I will arrange to have the information made available to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_8263">Accommodation for the regional offices to be located in Cork, Sligo and Shannon is currently being sought.  Inspectors based in the South East region will be accommodated in the National Employment Rights Authority head office in Carlow while Dublin based inspectors will be accommodated in their existing Dublin office.</p>
            <p eId="para_8264">Details of the overall costs of setting up the inspectorate on a regional basis are not available at this stage.  It is very early in the process and as actual office accommodation has not yet been secured in three of the locations, it is not possible to provide an accurate cost or an estimate of the overall cost at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_8310">Under social welfare legislation, three diverse scenarios could apply to a couple working together with different consequences arising. Firstly, where spouses are actively engaged in a commercial activity as a business partnership, they are treated as individual self-employed contributors and are liable to social insurance contributions at PRSI Class S — providing that income is above the annual threshold of €3,174. These contributions enable them to build up an insurance record in their own right and to receive accruing benefits — including Maternity Benefit. This would apply equally to unmarried couples.</p>
            <p eId="para_8311">Secondly, where a business is incorporated as a limited company, spouses involved in the business can establish a PRSI record either as employees or as self-employed contributors — depending on whether a contract of service exists or not. Again, this is equally relevant to unmarried couples working together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8312">Thirdly, where a person provides help and assistance to a spouse under a contract of service, i.e. as an employee, or in a contract for services i.e. as a self-employed person, the co-helping spouse is viewed as an ‘excepted' contributor under social welfare legislation. The exception applies to both men and women in family employments and recognises the practical difficulties in establishing the existence of a genuine contract in such circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_8313">The PRSI exception from liability where a spouse is working with the other is a longstanding provision and mirrors similar exclusions under employment protection legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_8314">With regard to whether these provisions are discriminatory, this issue will be considered in the context of a wide ranging review of the social welfare code which is currently under way and which will examine the compatibility of the code with the Equal Status Act, 2000 (as amended), and to identify any instances of direct or indirect discrimination on any of the nine grounds identified in that Act — including marital status. In instances where differences in treatment are identified, the review will examine whether they are justified by legitimate social policy objectives.</p>

            <p eId="para_8316">The person concerned applied for State Pension (Contributory) in September 1997.  According to the records of my Department, he has a total of 353 contributions recorded over the 36-year qualification period from 1953 to 5th April 1989, giving him a yearly average of 10 contributions.  This entitles him to 50% of the maximum rate of pension, payable at the current rate of €104.70 per week. In addition a further €10 per week is payable as he is over 80 years of age.  A yearly average of at least 48 contributions is required to qualify for maximum rate pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_8317">The person concerned has no social insurance contributions recorded from 1960 to 1989.  He was self-employed during this period and would not have been liable to pay PRSI up to the 6th April 1988, when PRSI for self-employed persons was introduced for the first time.</p>
            <p eId="para_8318">There is no record of any contributions paid by the person concerned for the period from 6th April 1988 to 5th April 1989.  Even if contributions had been paid for this period the rate of pension would not be improved as the additional 53 contributions, would increase the yearly average to 11 which would have no effect on the rate of pension payable.</p>
            <p eId="para_8319">The State Pension (Contributory) is based on a person's own social insurance record and not on their spouse's record.  A spouse's record can only be used when assessing entitlement to Widow(er)s pension.</p>

            <p eId="para_8322">I propose to take Question Nos. 341 and 342 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8323">In general, all contributions paid or credited, at the appropriate rate, on a person's social insurance record are assessed when his/her entitlement to a pension is being examined. There is a range of reduced rate and pro-rata pensions available to cater for people with less than complete insurance records, or where they have insurance from different countries or from different contribution classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_8324">However, while pre-1953 insurance contributions may be counted towards the basic number of paid contributions required for pension purposes, they may not be used to satisfy the average contributions test.  Contributions made prior to 1953 are different in nature to those made under the unified system introduced at that time, and do not contain any provision for pensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_8325">A special half rate state pension (contributory) was introduced in 2000 to enable people with pre-1953 insurance, who could not qualify for a payment under normal qualifying conditions, to receive a pension.  In order to be eligible for the payment, a person requires 260 paid contributions at the appropriate rate, which can comprise a mixture of pre and post 1953 contributions.  People already qualifying for pensions at less than half rate can also benefit from the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_8326">The pre-1953 pension is a special measure designed to benefit a particular group of people, with very limited social insurance records, who would not otherwise qualify for a contributory pension.  I consider that the pre-1953 pension, as it is currently structured, affords an appropriate recognition for the contributions which those in question have made. There are no plans to give additional recognition to pre-53 contributions or to introduce pro-rata pensions based on such contributions.</p>

            <p eId="para_8361">Illness Benefit is a payment for people under 66 years who cannot work due to illness and who satisfy the relevant PRSI conditions. A person who continues to work beyond age 66 may qualify for the State Pension (contributory), based on their social insurance record and this payment is not affected if the person subsequently becomes ill and is unable to work. Alternatively, a person who does not have the requisite number of contributions to qualify for State Pension (contributory) may qualify for the State Pension (non-contributory), subject to satisfying the means test. In recent budgets the means test for non-contributory pensions has improved significantly. The basic income disregard has increased to €30 per week and a specific earnings disregard of up to €200 per week has been introduced. Entitlement to the State Pension (non-contributory) is similarly unaffected in the case where a person who has been working becomes ill.</p>

            <p eId="para_8363">The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker's scheme which was introduced in and took effect from 1994. The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.</p>
            <p eId="para_8364">Women who left the workforce through the operation of the marriage bar were, in the main, public servants who were never insured for social welfare pension purposes. A person whose only contributions were at the modified rate paid by public servants up until 1995 will not benefit from the homemaker's scheme as such contributions did not include cover for contributory pensions. Accordingly, any loss of pension rights in their case relates more to their occupational position rather than social welfare pension entitlements.</p>
            <p eId="para_8365">It is estimated that there are some 47,000 people who are not receiving a social welfare pension payment in their own right, or as a qualified adult on the pension of their spouse or partner. These include people affected by the marriage bar, public servants in general, self-employed people who were close to retirement or had retired before 1988, when the self-employed were brought within the social insurance system, together with their spouses.</p>
            <p eId="para_8366">The issues in relation to this group will be discussed in the forthcoming Green Paper on pensions. Decisions regarding pension provision for them will be made in the context of the framework for long-term pensions policy which will be developed after the Green Paper has been published and a consultation process has been completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_8383">I propose to take Questions Nos. 354 to 356, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8384">The one-parent family payment is an income support scheme for separated, unmarried and widowed persons and also for prisoners' spouses who are bringing up a child or children without the support of a partner.  Expenditure on the one-parent family payment scheme was €751.1 million in 2005 and €834.3 million in 2006.  At the end of February 2007, the total number of one-parent family payment recipients being paid by my department was 83,780.  Included in this figure are payments to 848 widowed persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_8385">In every case where a one-parent family payment is awarded, other than those for widowed persons, the maintenance recovery unit seeks to trace the other parent, referred to as the liable relative, in order to ascertain whether he or she is in a financial position to contribute towards the cost of the one-parent family payment.  All liable relatives assessed with maintenance liability are contacted by maintenance recovery unit and issued with a determination order setting out the amount of contribution assessed.  Some 2,350 contributors have made payments directly to my department since the unit was established and approximately 700 liable relatives make contributions on a regular basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_8386">During the period June to August 2006 the maintenance recovery unit undertook an in-depth analysis of the cases referred to it to establish the number of cases where the liable relative was making cash or non-cash payments to the lone parent. Some 3,160 applications for one-parent family payment received during the period were examined and the liable relatives contacted.</p>
            <p eId="para_8387">It is not possible to give an exact number of one-parent family payment recipients who receive maintenance payments directly from liable relatives or the number receiving reduced payments as a result of getting maintenance payments.  In many instances contributions received by one-parent family payment recipients do not result in a reduced rate of payment.  However, findings from the project indicated that some 40% of liable relatives, i.e. 1,275 of the number contacted, were making a direct cash contribution to the support of their children, with a further 2% (62 liable relatives) providing contributions in indirect fashion by contributing to the costs of the child(ren)s' education, sporting activities, etc.  A further 42% of parents could not be identified or could not be pursued for other reasons.  The balance of 16% are those who could be followed up by the maintenance recovery unit but a proportion of those would not be liable to contribute because they are on low incomes or in receipt of a social welfare payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_8388">Arising from the work of the maintenance recovery unit savings, in the form of direct contributions by liable relatives and reductions/ terminations of one-parent family payment claims, to the value of €417.8 million in 2005 and €20.3 million in 2006 were achieved.  A total of €1,958,000 was received by the maintenance recovery unit in the form of direct cash payments from liable relatives during 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_8389">There are currently 15 staff working in the maintenance recovery unit.  While the precise overall operating costs of the maintenance recovery unit in 2005 and 2006 are not available, the estimated staffing costs of running the unit in 2005 and 2006 are of the order of €500,000 for each year.</p>

            <p eId="para_8391">Decisions regarding the location and operation of taxi ranks on public roads are matters for consideration by the relevant local authority.  Under section 84 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as substituted by section 15 of the Road Traffic Act 2002 and amended by section 42(10) of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, a local authority is empowered to make bye-laws in respect of any specified area in its functional area appointing the places at which taxis may stand for hire.  The making of such bye-laws is a reserved function of a local authority.   The provision of funding for taxi ranks is primarily a matter for local authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_8394">The legislative framework through which restrictions and prohibitions may be applied to traffic and parking of vehicles on public roads is contained in sections 35 and 36 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994.  Section 35 empowers me to make regulations for the control of traffic and parking while section 36 provides for the making of bye-laws by road authorities in relation to paid parking.  The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997 to 2005, made under Section 35 of the 1994 Act, set out the specific range of controls which apply to the parking of vehicles.</p>
            <p eId="para_8395">In the case of paid parking schemes, it is open to road authorities to provide for residents parking permits which can provide an exemption for holders from the need to pay for parking on roads where they live.  There is no legal provision permitting road authorities to provide for a preferential parking scheme to ‘reserve' a specified space on the public road for traders and their staff at spaces in front of shops and other outlets.  Such a provision could be seen to give proprietorial rights to parking in a specified location on specified public roads and there are no proposals to change this situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_8404">I refer the Deputy to my answer to Question Nos. 61, 69, 105 and 106 on 3 April 2007.  Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 responsibility for matters relating to vehicle standards has passed to the Road Safety Authority.  The Road Safety Authority has advised my Department that while it has not been provided with the report in question by the UK authorities it is aware of the situation relating to the performance of Irish vehicles inspected by the UK Vehicle Operating Standards Agency (VOSA) for compliance with vehicle standards requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_8405">While not wishing to excuse or down-play the seriousness of the findings in relation to Irish vehicles, I understand that the nature of the problems identified in the UK are not unique to Irish vehicles.  Insofar as improving vehicles standards and enforcement in this State is concerned, the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 strengthens the institutional framework for improving enforcement levels for vehicle and driver legislation and for increasing cooperation with the Garda Síochána, which has responsibility for enforcement of road traffic law, including vehicle standards. The Road Safety Authority, which was formally established on 1 September 2006, has now taken over responsibility for matters relating to vehicle standards, roadworthiness testing and enforcement of drivers hours, tachograph and licensing regulations.  The Chief Executive Officer of the Authority is putting in place the necessary resources to fulfil its mandate and in that regard four (4) vehicle testers have been recruited by the Authority. The addition of these testers will significantly strengthen the capacity of the Authority in relation to vehicle standards and it is the intention to provide further resources for that area. It is a priority for the Road Safety Authority in conjunction with the Garda Síochána to increase and enhance the arrangements for enforcement of vehicle standards. The CEO has met with the UK Department for Transport and VOSA to agree protocols for joint working.  Insofar as enforcement is concerned, the Garda Síochána has brought the Traffic Corps within a more unified structure, under the direction of an Assistant Commissioner. There has been a significant increase in the strength of the Garda Traffic Corps.  The Corps has been increased from 500 in early 2005 to 805 by the end of 2006 and will reach 1,200 by 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_8406">In August 2006 the Road Safety Authority engaged consultants to conduct a fundamental review of the scheme of compulsory periodic roadworthiness testing of goods vehicles and buses. My Department has been informed by the Authority that it has received the report from the consultants and that it is being examined by the Authority.  I expect to receive the report and recommendations from the Road Safety Authority shortly.</p>

            <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_8415">I propose to take Questions Nos. 365 and 366 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8416">I refer the Deputies to my reply on Tuesday last, 3 April 2007, to Dáil Questions Nos. 143 and 101 (answered together): The Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) began a public consultation on five potential routes, A to E, for connecting the two existing Luas lines in November 2005. During public consultation a new option, F, was identified.  Options A and F emerged as the better options and RPA launched a second phase of public consultation in January 2007 involving an open-day, display days, newspaper notices and distribution of newsletters focusing on the selection of the best of these two route options.</p>
            <p eId="para_8417">I also understand that the RPA engaged in dialogue with Dublin City Council, Dublin Bus and the Dublin Transportation Office in relation to the implications of the potential routes for bus services and other road users.  Arising from these discussions, Dublin City Council and the Dublin Transportation Office recommended that a traffic management plan for the city centre be initiated, to facilitate light rail, bus and metro development.  Dublin City Council will undertake the necessary traffic modelling and is committed to delivery of early results from this work, by Autumn of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_8418">The Board of the RPA recently decided that their preferred route option for the cross-city Luas line is option F.  The RPA now plan to commence detailed design work on the project based on this option.  This will take account of the results of the City Council's traffic modelling results as they become available.  Following completion of this design work, and subject to a satisfactory outcome to the city centre traffic management planning work, the RPA will submit a Railway Order application to An Bord Pleanala.  The construction timescale will be dependent on the outcome of this statutory approval process.</p>
            <p eId="para_8419">A second stage of this project will extend the line to Liffey Junction via Grangegorman and Broadstone.  The selection of an emerging preferred route for the cross-city link will facilitate the commencement of work on the route selection for the onward extension to Liffey Junction.  Subject to an enforceable Railway Order, the scheduled completion date for the overall project is 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_8420">It is untrue to say that funding has not been provided for the linking of the Luas lines in the 2007 Estimates.  My Department has allocated €173m towards the advancement of all Luas and Metro projects, including funding for the continuing planning and design work on the cross-city link.</p>
            <p eId="para_8421">Regarding travel between Heuston Station and St. Stephen's Green, I understand from the Railway Procurement Agency that while the operating pattern on the Luas system has yet to be finally determined, it is not currently envisaged that Luas services will operate between Heuston and St. Stephens Green without interchange.  However, the Deputy will be aware that Transport 21 also includes funding for a Rail Interconnector which  will connect the existing DART lines on the eastern side of the City to the lines running out from Heuston Station. New stations will be constructed at Docklands, St. Stephen's Green and High St. and these will link with Pearse and Heuston Station.  When the Interconnector is in place, passengers wishing to travel from Heuston Station to St. Stephen's Green and vice versa will be able to do so without changing trains. The Interconnector project is due for completion by 2015.</p>

They are now undergoing testing and commissioning and will be introduced into service later in the year.  The first train sets will enter service on the Sligo and Rosslare Intercity routes and will replace the modern commuter railcars currently operating on those routes.  The displaced commuter railcars will be redeployed onto the Northern Commuter line i.e. Dundalk/Drogheda services and the Western Commuter line i.e. Maynooth services.  As a first step, two sets of four carriages each will be redeployed to each line bringing all trains up to 8 cars sets thus increasing capacity.</p>

In addition, RAPID priority status was extended to Ballyfermot in 2006. This Department, with the support of Pobal, has overall responsibility for the co-ordination of the RAPID programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_8564">As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, it is a matter for individual Departments to report progress with their projects under the RAPID programme.  In support of my Department, Pobal collects data from each RAPID area in respect of funding allocations received by projects from Government Departments and local state agencies.  The latest data in respect of the programme is available on Pobal's website under the RAPID section (http://www.pobal.ie/live/RAPID). The Deputy may find it helpful to access this information.</p>
            <p eId="para_8565">The Deputy will be aware that I launched the RAPID Leverage Fund in 2004 to support small-scale projects identified by the Area Implementation Teams.  The Exchequer provides the funding for these schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_8566">I can confirm that a total of €599,503 has been allocated to Tralee RAPID area through Leverage funding to-date, for the provision of playgrounds, estate enhancement, traffic calming measures, health and sports facilities and CCTV provision. I can provide the Deputy with details of the various projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_8567">Following the enactment of the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2005, further funding was ring-fenced to support priority projects in RAPID areas under the 2006 round of funding and some €200,099 has been allocated to Tralee.</p>

         the supports available from within her Department for the development of renewable and alternative energies; if, in this regard, there are any incentive schemes available for the planting and growing of willows which then could be used for woodchip or similar type heating.

            <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_8735">Wood biomass is one of the most versatile of renewable energy sources and has the potential to play a major role in Ireland's future energy strategy.  My Department actively encourages the development of the wood-energy sector through a range of support measures.  These measures complement the schemes introduced by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources targeting the user side of the chain through the Pilot Bio-heat Boiler Deployment Programme and the Greener Homes Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_8736">A new capital grant scheme to support developing enterprises in the wood chip supply sector was launched earlier this week in my Department. The Wood Biomass Harvesting Machinery Grant Scheme will grant aid the purchase of medium-scale wood chippers and self-contained chippers by providing up to 40% of the purchase price of this equipment.  As more businesses switch to wood chip to meet their energy needs, this machinery grant scheme will provide critical investment to build our domestic woodchip supply.  Full details of the Scheme including application forms are available on the forestry pages of the Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_8737">My Department is also supporting a number of wood energy pilot projects which aim to encourage increased use of wood fuel, primarily in the form of woodchip, with a particular emphasis on the development of effective and efficient wood fuel supply chains from private growers to end users.   Examples of the pilot projects being funded include the County Clare Wood Energy Project and the Forest Link project in Donegal.</p>
            <p eId="para_8738">COFORD, (the National Council for Forest Research and Development), which is wholly funded by my Department, is running a series of thinning and chipping demonstrations across the country.  In addition, COFORD hosts and manages a website (<i>www.woodenergy.ie</i>) dedicated to providing factual information on using wood biomass as a carbon neutral, renewable energy source.</p>
            <p eId="para_8739">Biomass crops such as willow and Miscanthus can also contribute to Ireland's renewable energy strategy. Production of these crops in Ireland is relatively undeveloped mainly due to the initial high costs of establishment. For this reason, I have introduced a new Bioenergy Scheme to provide establishment grants to farmers for up to 50% of the costs associated with establishing willow. The aid is payable on set-aside land and on areas that have been subject to an application under the EU Energy Crops Scheme. The maximum payment rate is up to €1,450 per hectare and will be paid in two instalments:</p>
            <p eId="para_8740">A maximum of 75% of the aid (€1,088 per hectare) will be paid when the crop is established.</p>
            <p eId="para_8741">The remaining 25% of the aid  (€362 per hectare) will be paid one year after the payment of the 1st instalment grant, provided the applicant has adequately maintained and managed the crop, including the first year cut back.</p>
            <p eId="para_8742">Willow and miscanthus are also eligible for the EU premium of €45 per hectare available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme and for the new €80 per hectare national payment, which I intend to introduce in 2007. The €80 payment will be paid as a top-up to the €45 EU premium and increases the overall payment available to €125 per hectare. The additional €80 payment is available for 3 years and is subject to a maximum ceiling per producer over the 3 years. The current ceiling is 37.5 hectares per producer. I am pursuing EU approval to increase this ceiling.</p>
            <p eId="para_8743">REPS payments apply to the planting of willow or miscanthus up to a maximum area on REPS holdings of 10 hectares or 25%, whichever is greater, provided the overall area planted does not exceed 20 hectares per applicant. On the REPS area farmers growing willow or miscanthus can receive an adjusted REPS 3 payment of €155 per hectare, increasing to €189 per hectare under REPS 4 in addition to the establishment grant and the €125 premium. Following contact with the EU Commission, my Department has also received confirmation that land used for growing willow or miscanthus is eligible to benefit from the Single Farm Payment.</p>

            <p eId="para_8771">In the first instance, the issue of water meters on farms is a matter for the Local Authorities.   However, I am aware of the concerns expressed by the farming community in regard to this issue and I am conscious of the need to ensure that usage of metered water on farms for agricultural purposes is kept to a minimum.  Thus, for example, the technical specifications for farm buildings operated by my Department for the purposes of the Farm Waste Management Scheme require the installation of adequate arrangements for the separation of clean and dirty water as part of the conditions of any new investment.   In addition, I extended the terms of that Scheme in March 2006 to include the provision of grant-aid for the installation of guttering on existing buildings as a further new eligible item.</p>
            <p eId="para_8772">As far as the new 2007-2013 Rural Development Programme is concerned, I have provided that grant-aid will be available under the new Farm Improvement Scheme for, inter alia, the installation of water retention equipment on farms.   This Scheme will be introduced as soon as EU approval is received for the Programme.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_8774">The position is that the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme and my Department's commitment in the Charter of Rights for farmers to ensure maximum integration of inspections across schemes and for cross-compliance has resulted in a drop in annual farm inspection levels from 18,000 under the coupled regime to less than 8,000 in 2006. I agree that the inspection requirements linked to cross-compliance are complex and I am committed to negotiating significant changes in the context of the simplification exercise which is currently underway in the Commission.  I think it needs to be made clear however that the inspection checklist on cross-compliance is not a document for completion by the farmer but is an internal document for completion by officials of my Department carrying out inspections.</p>
            <p eId="para_8775">It is important also to bear in mind that the controls under the various direct payment schemes are set out in EU Regulations. Failure to ensure a satisfactory control environment leaves a member State open to serious financial penalty — a fact that cannot be lightly dismissed given the magnitude of annual payments of  €1.9 billion to Irish farmers under the Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and REPS. Nonetheless, I believe that the cross-compliance inspection requirements are overly demanding on farmers. It is my clearly held view that some practical amendments can be secured without in any way undermining the objectives of cross-compliance or putting accountability in the disbursement of EU and national funds at risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_8776">As I have made clear already, I have raised my concerns about the Single Payment Scheme — particularly the inspection arrangements and the need for advance notice  — with Commissioner Fischer Boel on a number of occasions. I have also discussed the problems with Minister Seehofer, the German President of the Agriculture Council and I am assured of his commitment to dealing with the issues over the next few months.</p>
            <p eId="para_8777">The Commission has finalised a review document on cross-compliance. The report will be formally presented to the Agriculture Ministers meeting on 16th April.  In tandem with this, my Department is carrying out a full review of the inspection arrangements and checklists for the Single Payment Scheme with a view to simplification of the arrangements (including paperwork) where possible while, at the same time, ensuring compliance with the regulatory requirements. The review of the inspection report forms together with the outcome of the Commission's review of the cross-compliance arrangements generally, will be fully discussed with the farming organisations before the Single Payment Scheme inspections for 2007 get under way.</p>

            <p eId="para_8789">I propose to take Questions Nos. 421 and 497 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8790">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_8791">Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2005 was 325 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0023/2006), which is available on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006/07 school year is a Principal and 12 mainstream class teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_8792">According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 305 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i> and has issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year will be a Principal and 11 mainstream class teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_8793">Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_8794">It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. They are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department's website. Hard copies of this circular will issue to primary schools as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_8795">It is proposed that the first meeting of the Appeal Board will be held in May, 2007. Further meetings will be held in July and October, 2007. The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 11 May, 22 June and 12 October respectively. Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department's website.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Minister and my Department and its decision is final.</p>
            <p eId="para_8796">I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent Appeal Board.</p>

Once the long term projection is finalised and agreed with the school authorities the Department will draw up schedules of accommodation and the project will be progressed in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_8827">There are twelve primary schools in the Lucan area with a combined 6th class enrolment of 501 pupils. With regard to post primary capacity, the four Post-Primary providers in Lucan had a combined first year enrolment of 481 pupils in 2006.  However, Coláiste Cois Life has capacity for 600 pupils in total but only enrolled 68 first year students in 2006.  In addition, a Design Team will be appointed shortly for an extension project for Lucan Community College.  The project will increase capacity at this school by 200 students overall. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that there is adequate provision at post primary level in Lucan into the future.  The Department will, however, continue to monitor the situation to ensure that any future emerging needs are addressed in a timely manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_8853">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The School Support Programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the SSP was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate. As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to participate in the SSP. These comprised 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools. A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the School Support Programme but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.</p>
            <p eId="para_8854">An application for review was received from the school referred to by the Deputy and was thoroughly examined by the Review Group. In accordance with the recommendations of the Review Group, the school has not been identified for inclusion in the School Support Programme and the Principal was informed by letter on 4 August 2006. Unsuccessful schools were advised at an early stage that they would be allowed to keep the supports that they have under pre-existing schemes for the current school year. I have also given a commitment that my Department will, for the duration of the DEIS action plan, continue to support these schools in their efforts to deal with educational disadvantage among their students. The school to which the Deputy refers will continue to receive grant assistance for the duration of the DEIS action plan to assist it with its level of dispersed disadvantage. I am satisfied not only that this Government has provided for a major increase in supports to our most disadvantaged schools through DEIS, but we have addressed the concerns of schools that did not qualify for the new initiative.</p>

            <p eId="para_8860">Teachers working in national schools have a contract of employment with the board of management of the school in which they are employed.  The board of management, as employer, has the power to appoint such and so many persons as teachers as the board from time to time thinks necessary for the performance of its powers and functions. An employee/employer relationship exists between the teacher and the board of management and the teacher is answerable to the board of management of the school. The numbers and qualifications of teachers who are paid from monies provided by the Oireachtas are subject to the approval of the Minister for Education and Science with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  Such teachers are regarded as public servants.  The terms and conditions of employment of such teachers, appointed by the board of management, and who are paid from monies provided by the Oireachtas are determined by the Minister for Education and Science with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_8861">Access to the disputes settling agencies- Labour Relations Commission, Labour Court and Rights Commissioner Service- is governed by the definition of "worker" in Section 23(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  At present teachers do not have access to these agencies as they are specifically excluded from the definition of "worker".  Teachers are instead served by an agreed scheme of conciliation and arbitration for teachers which operates to provide a means acceptable to the managerial authorities of national and second level schools, the teacher unions and the Ministers for Education and Science and Finance for dealing with claims and proposals relating to the salaries and conditions of service of teachers.  The scheme provides for conciliation, facilitation and, if agreement does not prove possible, arbitration by the Teachers Arbitration Board.  The Arbitration Board is appointed by the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_8862">An individual serving as a teacher continues to have a right to submit through the normal channels any statement he or she may wish to make to his or her employer on any matter affecting his or her official position or, if appropriate, to have the matter pursued through appropriate grievance procedures agreed between the teacher unions and the managerial authorities of schools.  Accordingly claims by or on behalf of individuals are excluded from the scope of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  The grievance procedures, agreed between the managerial authorities of schools and the teacher unions, provide access to a dispute resolution mechanism as the last stage of the procedure.  In addition individual rights based legislation such as the Maternity Protection Act 2004 provides that an employee (including teachers) may refer a complaint to a Rights Commissioner and on appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p>

            <p eId="para_8868">I recently received representations on behalf of the school to which the Deputy refers and a reply will issue shortly. Under DEIS, (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the new Action Plan for Educational Inclusion, which is currently being implemented by my Department, 80 additional posts have been allocated in order to extend Home School Community Liaison services to all 338 urban/town primary and 203 second level schools participating in DEIS that do not currently have a HSCL service, in addition to the 370 local coordinators already in place. To facilitate local HSCL co-ordinators working with the families of disadvantaged children, for the first time posts are being shared across the two sectors — primary and post-primary level. I have also given a commitment to schools not selected to participate in DEIS but already in the HSCL Scheme, that they will continue to receive HSCL services after 2006/2007. HSCL services will be provided to some 652 schools in total (282 second level and 370 primary schools) for the duration of the DEIS Action Plan. The school to which the Deputy refers was not selected to participate in DEIS, however, it will continue to receive grant assistance to assist them with their respective levels of dispersed disadvantage.</p>

            <p eId="para_8870">Section 24 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 requires a school to notify it's Educational Welfare Officer before expelling any student. The Educational Welfare Officer concerned is then required to make all reasonable efforts to ensure that provision is made for the continued education of the student, including consulting with the school authorities, the student concerned and his or her parents. Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board expels a student. Where a school expels a student, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. It is only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld that the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to re-admit a student. My Department has not received any notification or request for appeal in respect of the student referred to by the Deputy. The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The details provided by the Deputy have been forwarded to the NEWB for appropriate attention. The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p>

            <p eId="para_8872">Access to the disputes settling agencies- Labour Relations Commission, Labour Court and Rights Commissioner Service- is governed by the definition of "worker" in Section 23(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  At present teachers do not have access to these agencies as they are specifically excluded from the definition of "worker".  Teachers are instead served by an agreed scheme of conciliation and arbitration for teachers which operates to provide a means acceptable to the managerial authorities of national and second level schools, the teacher unions and the Ministers for Education and Science and Finance for dealing with claims and proposals relating to the salaries and conditions of service of teachers.  The scheme provides for conciliation, facilitation and, if agreement does not prove possible, arbitration by the Teachers Arbitration Board.  The Arbitration Board is appointed by the Government.  An individual serving as a teacher continues to have a right to submit through the normal channels any statement he or she may wish to make to his or her employer on any matter affecting his or her official position or, if appropriate, to have the matter pursued through appropriate grievance procedures agreed between the teacher unions and the managerial authorities of schools.  Accordingly claims by or on behalf of individuals are excluded from the scope of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  The grievance procedures, agreed between the managerial authorities of schools and the teacher unions, provide access to a dispute resolution mechanism as the last stage of the procedure. In addition individual rights based legislation such as the Maternity Protection Act 2004 provides that an employee (including a teacher) may refer a dispute to a rights commissioner and on appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p>

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism. A review in 2006 of a number of applications for home tuition highlighted some cause for concern regarding the qualifications of proposed tuition providers. Following the review of qualifications, which took place in consultation with my Department's Inspectorate, an extended list of qualifications acceptable under the scheme has been published. This list is available on my Department's website. Aside from recognised teaching qualifications such as the Bachelor in Education and approved Montessori training, the list includes certain qualifications in autism and in applied approaches to teaching children with autism, such as ABA, PECS and TEACCH. Third level qualifications in relevant areas such as psychology may also be appropriate depending on circumstances. I have requested the Special Education Support Service to put in place courses for teachers in the wide range of educational interventions available to meet the needs of children in their classes. To this end I am committed to ensuring that all teachers of children with autism will be enabled to implement a combined skills approach, including ABA, to meeting their learning and teaching needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_8893">Physical Education and sport, although closely linked, are not synonymous.  Sport begins with play and develops through games, competition and challenges.  Competition in sport contributes to the holistic development of the student, provided that the opportunities presented are such that he/she is progressing towards the achievement of his/her potential.

            <p eId="para_8910">Adult Literacy and Basic Education are my top priority in Adult Education.  The Adult Literacy services are funded by my Department through annual grants to the Vocational Education Committees, which deliver the services locally. The disbursement of funds is a matter for each VEC, which, subject to its budget, decides the nature and extent of the Adult Literacy services to be provided in its area and the manner in which funds for these services should be spent. The organisation and location of courses are also matters for decision by the VECs.</p>
            <p eId="para_8911">I am providing for an increase of €7.4 million, or 21%, this year for Adult Literacy and Community Education.  This will allow for 3,000 additional literacy places in 2007.  It will bring expenditure on adult Literacy up to €30 million, and the number of participants up to 38,000, compared to 28,000 in 2002, when expenditure on Adult Literacy was €16.7 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_8912">The increased provision this year also includes an additional €1million for an Intensive Tuition in Adult Basic Education Programme, bringing the total funding for this programme up to €2 million. This programme provides participants with 6-8 hours tuition, rather than the normal 2 hours per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_8913">To cater for the literacy and basic education needs of immigrant groups, literacy funds may be used by Vocational Education Committees to teach English to speakers of other languages.  Almost 10,000 students availed of tuition in English under the English for Speakers of Other Languages programme in 2005, comprising 27% of participants in adult literacy programmes.</p>

        <b>Mr. Quinn</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         the number of people who left school before sitting their junior or intermediate certificate exams currently participating in education or training; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_893">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_8915">According to the Quarterly National Household Survey carried out by the CSO in the Autumn (Q4; Sept-Nov) of 2006, approximately 19,600 persons aged 16-64 years, who had not attained either Junior or Intermediate certificates, were either students or apprentices in the 4 weeks prior to the survey. This number represents 5% of the total number of persons in the age group who had not attained either Junior or Intermediate certificates. Of these the vast majority, 87%, were aged 16-19 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_8916">Given the clear link between leaving the system without formal qualifications and continued socio-economic disadvantage in adult life, the Government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that children and young people get the opportunities and supports they need to enable them to complete their education and secure their future economic and personal well being. Against the background of our continuing economic success, our increasingly well educated population (with over 40% of 25-34 year olds having a third-level qualification, among the highest in the EU) and inward migration, those who leave school early without adequate qualifications face serious difficulties and challenges. CSO data show that the educational profile of 20-24 year olds in Ireland has improved steadily over the last five years, as increasing opportunities have been made available in the further education and training sector. By 2005, 85.8% of 20-24 year olds had attained upper second-level education or equivalent, up from 82.6% in 2000 and putting Ireland way ahead of the EU average of 77.5%.</p>
            <p eId="para_8917">My Department has adopted a broad-based approach to tackling early school leaving. We established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) to monitor attendance and help to get young people back to school. We have widened the range of curricula available to students by promoting the Junior Certificate Schools Programme, the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, and the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme in addition to the traditional Junior and Leaving Certificate curricula.</p>
            <p eId="para_8918">We have also put preventative measures in place such as the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL). Under the School Completion Programme children at risk of early school leaving are targeted for a variety of extra supports, educational and non-educational, during and outside of school time- all aimed at encouraging them to stay in school. The Home School Community Liaison Scheme helps to get parents involved in their children's education, which as we all know is a crucial component of convincing young people of the value of education.</p>
            <p eId="para_8919">Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central to DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion, which is being implemented at present. The action plan represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing a particular aspect of the problem, with the new plan adopting a multi-faceted and more integrated approach. This is the first time that an integrated educational inclusion strategy has been developed for 3-18 year olds in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_8920">In relation to second chance educational opportunities for young people who left school early, this Government has shown a sustained commitment to providing greater opportunities in the adult and further education sectors.  Many such young people take up places in Youthreach centres, while others pursue options such as FAS apprenticeships.</p>
            <p eId="para_8921">I would like to assure the Deputy that we have greatly intensified our efforts in recent years both to keep more young people in school and to provide increased educational opportunities for those who left school early. I will continue to prioritise further progress in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_8923">Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The details for the current school year (2006/2007) are currently being compiled by my Department and the information requested is not readily available.</p>
            <p eId="para_8924">As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now 5,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.  Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</p>
            <p eId="para_8925">Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_8926">As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_8927">A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</p>
            <p eId="para_8928">The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_8929">I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</p>

            <p eId="para_8944">The information is not readily available in the format sought by the Deputy for the period in question.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the Government has made a record investment of over €2.6 billion in the period from 2000 to 2006 in upgrading existing school infrastructure and providing new school accommodation at both first and second-level. Over 7,800 projects were delivered in this period. In addition the investment covered site purchases; the minor works grant issued to all primary schools annually, dust/asbestos and radon remediation programmes, science and technology initiatives, contingency works and grants for the purchase of furniture and equipment. This year alone over 1,500 building projects will be delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_8945">The capital budget for 2007, at over €540m for first and second level schools, is the first year of the rollout of the new NDP which will involve an investment of over €4.5 billion in school buildings over the next 7 years. This multi-annual funding is proof of my continuing commitment to educational infrastructure and will enable my Department to continue to take a proactive approach to the provision of modern school accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_8946">I am also pleased that over recent years my Department has streamlined its processes for delivering projects with a particular emphasis placed on devolving the delivery of projects to local school management level.

            <p eId="para_8983">Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The details for the current school year (2006/2007) are currently being compiled by my Department and the information requested is not readily available.</p>
            <p eId="para_8984">As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now 5,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_8985">Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</p>
            <p eId="para_8986">Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_8987">As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_8988">A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</p>
            <p eId="para_8989">The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.</p>
            <p eId="para_8990">But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_8991">I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</p>
            <p eId="para_8992">The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas including the impact of inward migration and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_8993">As you will be aware, the local area development plan for the N4/M4 corridor (running from Leixlip to Kilbeggan and including Maynooth, Celbridge, Kilcock, Edenderry, Enfield, Longwood, Kinnegad, Killucan, Milltownpass, Rochfortbridge and Tyrellspass), which was published in May 2005 by the Commission on School Accommodation, is the framework document for the Department's long-term educational strategy at both primary and post-primary level for the area concerned. The recommendations in the plan are being actioned in the context of the School Building and Modernisation Programme subject to the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.</p>

            <p eId="para_8996">I announced recently in this connection my intention to expand the number of NEPS psychologists by a further 31 in 2007.

            <p eId="para_9059">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). DEIS will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_9060">The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate. A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The closing date for receipt of review applications was 31 March, 2006. The Group submitted a report and the review is now concluded. Schools that applied for a review were informed of the outcome in August, 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_9061">My Department is considering putting separate arrangements in place to address exceptional situations arising up to the time of the next identification process which will be held in 2009/2010. These arrangements will apply to new schools, such as the school referred to by the Deputy, (including those created through amalgamation), opening in 2005/2006 or thereafter. The arrangements may also apply to schools located in certain communities which have suffered significant socioeconomic decline since the commencement of DEIS. Consideration will be given to such changes at the mid-way point between the 2005/2006 and 2009/2010 identification process i.e. in 2007/2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_9063">Each Board of Management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. Among other things, the current guidelines provide that Codes of Behaviour should be considered in the context of the school being a community in which mutual respect, co-operation and natural justice are integral features.</p>
            <p eId="para_9064">The Guidelines stress that poor behaviour can stem from a range of causes, some of them external to the school, some possibly arising from the home environment, and some from emotional or physical problems. It is important to identify problems as early as possible. Good parent-teacher and home-school links are vital in this context. The Guidelines advise that Parents should be encouraged to visit the school to familiarise themselves with the environment, to discuss their children's progress and, when necessary, aspects of their behaviour in a spirit of mutual co-operation.  The guidelines also advise that schools must ensure that the rules of natural justice apply. Pupils and, when necessary, their parents, should be advised of the nature of any complaint and be given an opportunity to respond.</p>
            <p eId="para_9065">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is at present developing further guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour, as provided for under section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. This work is nearing completion and I expect that the revised Guidelines will soon be available to schools.  Parents also have the right, under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, to appeal to the Secretary General of my Department, against a decision made by a school's Board of Management to expel a student or to suspend a student from the school for a period which would bring the cumulative period of suspension to 20 school days in any one school year.</p>

            <p eId="para_9068">I propose to take Questions Nos. 493 and 494 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_9069">Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and the Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_9070">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with Section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission of a pupil to the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_9071">Currently, under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, parents of a student who has been refused enrolment in a school may appeal that decision to the Secretary General of this Department. Such appeals are dealt with within 30 days of their receipt and where an appeal is upheld the Secretary General is empowered to direct the school to enrol the student. Otherwise, the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.</p>
            <p eId="para_9072">I am conscious that there is considerable pressure for school places in the Dublin 15 area in general. Adding to this pressure is the fact that a number of parents have enrolled their children in more than one school. This has the result of inflating the number of children apparently seeking places. Officials in the School Planning Section of the Department are liaising with school principals in the area with a view to ensuring that all eligible pupils seeking places for 2007 will have access to them.</p>

            <p eId="para_9074">This project referred to by the Deputy was listed on the 2005 School Building Programme to go to tender and construction for a new 10 classroom school building, when the architectural planning was completed. As this is a special school the brief for the project has evolved over time with input from the school, my Department's Technical staff and Inspectorate. My Department is anxious that the facilities to be provided will be of a very high standard and suitable for use by pupils with special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_9075">In June 2006 a meeting was held between the Board of Management, the project's Design Team and officials from my Department. The purpose of the meeting was to agree the brief for the project. It was also decided at that meeting that once the Board and the Design Team have indicated that the stage 3 documentation was ready for examination a round table meeting will be held, the main aim of which will be to try and approve the submission. In December 2006 the Design Team forwarded some revised drawings to my Department for review. A reply issued to the Design team on the 18th December 2006 instructing them to proceed on the basis of their submission and incorporating the comments of my Department's Technical Staff. My Department is currently awaiting a revised stage 3 submission. When this is received a meeting will be arranged with a view to getting the submission cleared.</p>
            <p eId="para_9076">My Department's main role is concentrated on ensuring that the design solution presented at stage 3 meets the requirements of the brief and complies with my Departments technical documents. Once the formal stage 3 submission is received, it will be appraised to ensure it meets these criteria and thereafter devolved approval will be given to the school authorities to deliver the project to planning permission, tender and construction.</p>

            <p eId="para_9080">Higher education in Ireland has come through a period of major expansion.  Overall investment in the sector on a per annum basis has more than doubled since this Government took Office in 1997.  In 1997, the amount of funding provided to the Higher Education level sector was approx. €850 million.  The funding being provided in 2007 represents an increase of over €1 billion or 124% on the 1997 provision.  Investment in the sector now stands at some €1.9 billion for this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_9081">Support for reform and development at third level and the creation of world class excellence at fourth level are now central Government priorities.  The new National Development Plan 2007-2013, recognises the critical role of higher education in the national innovation system that will be the basis of Ireland's economic and social development.  The Plan identifies the full funding of the sector — over €13 billion through the period — as a key strategic investment under the Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_9082">The ongoing development and expansion of the sector under the Plan will be supported by enhanced investments in the development of campus infrastructure — with an almost €2 billion dedicated building programme — and through further support for the programme of reform and development that is under way in the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_9083">Major improvements have been made by this Government in both the income limits for eligibility and the actual grant levels for third level student support.  This includes the introduction of the special rate of maintenance grant.  The higher rate of this grant is now at a record level of nearly €6,000 for the 2006/07 academic year — compared to just over €2,000 in 1996/97.  The allocation for student support schemes in this current year is in excess of €241m.</p>
            <p eId="para_9084">The targeted investments that this Government is now making in our higher education infrastructure, in promoting excellence through system wide collaboration and change, in widening access and in creating a vibrant fourth level sector is a clear demonstration of this Governments support for the higher education sector.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_9102">Following a detailed study of the needs of the Defence Forces in 2002 commissioned by the Dept of Defence, a comprehensive Waste Management Strategy was implemented for the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_9103">The Waste Management Strategy is based on a combination of recycling and where necessary disposal.  A Recycling Centre is located in each of our 23 main Barracks/Posts.  Each recycling centre has a compactor baler capable of baling dry recyclables, i.e. Cardboard, Paper, Plastic, and Aluminium Cans. They also have segregated storage areas for Wood, Metal, and an area for a Skip, Compactor Skip or Wheelie Bins for General Waste depending on size of the Barracks/Post.  Each Barracks/Post also segregates Glass Bottles, Waste Cooking Oil, and in larger Barracks/Posts only, Food Waste is collected for composting.</p>
            <p eId="para_9104">The Defence Forces Waste Management Strategy was first implemented in 2003 with the awarding of a Single Waste Disposal/ Management Contract for all of the Defence Force locations. Ipodec Ireland Ltd (now Veolia) held this contract from 01 August 2003 to 31 July 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_9105">Following a tender competition, a contract was awarded to Greyhound Recycling &amp; Recovery Ltd for a period of three years from 01 August 2006 to 31 July 2009.  I have been assured by the Military Authorities that Greyhound Recycling &amp; Recovery Ltd hold the relevant Environmental Protection Agency Licences and Waste Permits.</p>
            <p eId="para_9106">The Waste Management Strategy for the Defence Forces has been extremely beneficial both in terms of the environment and costs.  An average overall recycling figure of 37% was achieved in 2006.  It is intended to improve on this figure in the coming years. The total cost of Waste Disposal for the Defence Forces in 2006 was €648,000 compared to €1,300,000 in 2002 — a saving of over 50% in the space of 4 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_9107">The waste disposal costs for each Barracks/Posts for 2005 and 2006 are set out beneath in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</p>

            <p eId="para_9254">I assume that the Question refers to an area within the candidate Special Area of Conservation (cSAC) 001932 known as Mweelrea/Sheeffry/Erriff Complex.  The Croaghrimbeg bog area contains both wet heath and active blanket bog.  Most of the area was proposed for designation as an SAC in March 1997; and affected landowners were notified at that time.  The site was transmitted to the European Commission in May, 1999 and adopted by Commission decision of 7 December 2004, pursuant to Council Directive 92/43/EEC, as one of the list of sites of Community importance for the Atlantic biogeographical region.</p>
            <p eId="para_9255">The proposal to designate the SAC was re-notified on 1 December, 2006 to further propose the inclusion of a previously omitted short and narrow stretch of the Derrycraff River.  This proposed amendment was based on scientific advice that the river is an important habitat for salmon.  As the site has already been adopted by the European Commission, any amendment of the SAC boundary will require the agreement of the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_9256">Owners of bog in an SAC are permitted, subject to certain conditions, to cut turf for their own domestic use from the time of proposal for designation until the end of 2008.  My Department operates a scheme for compensation and purchase of turbary rights.</p>

            <p eId="para_9266">Septic tanks installed on or after 1 June 1992 must comply with Part H of the National Building Regulations which requires septic tanks to be so sited and constructed that they do not pollute, so as to endanger public health, any water (including groundwater) which is used as a source of supply for human consumption.  Guidance on septic tank drainage systems for single houses is contained in Irish Standard Recommendations S.R. 6: 1991 for Domestic Effluent Treatment and Disposal from Single Dwellings issued by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI).  For septic tanks serving groups of houses, British Standard B.S. 6297: 1983, a Code of Practice for the Design and Installation of Small Sewage Treatment Works, issued by the British Standards Institute applies.</p>
            <p eId="para_9267">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is developing a comprehensive Code of Practice on Waste Water Treatment Systems for Single Houses and expects to publish the draft code for public consultation shortly.  Following public consultation, the EPA will publish the document as a Code of Practice under section 76 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 as amended.  It is intended that this code will then supersede the NSAI standard for single house installations.</p>
            <p eId="para_9268">The Water Services Bill currently at Dail Report Stage contains a number of significant provisions in relation to the operation of septic tanks.  It places a duty of care on the occupier or owner of a premises to ensure that all drains, manholes and treatment systems, including a septic tank, serving the premises are kept in such a condition as not to cause a risk to human health or the environment or create a nuisance due to odours. It also requires the occupier or owner to notify the water services authority where any leak, accident or other incident occurs relating to discharges of sewage from the premises to a drain or treatment system, including a septic tank, where it is likely to cause a risk to human health or safety or the environment.  An authorised person appointed by a water services authority may direct the owner or occupier to take such measures as are considered by the authorised person to be necessary to deal with the risk. Refusal to comply with such a direction or obstruction of the authorised person is an offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_9269">In addition, it would be open to local authorities to make and adopt bye-laws to require periodic inspections of septic tanks and other on-site proprietary treatment systems under the general powers available to them under the Local Government Act 2001 to make bye laws.  Such bye-laws may require septic tanks to be inspected by a competent person at prescribed intervals and set out frequencies for de-sludging based on the number of residents in a household and the size of the septic tank.</p>

            <p eId="para_9271">To address the issue of accumulated backlogs of farm plastic, designated facilities are being provided on a temporary, once-off basis by local authorities where farmers may deposit stockpiled farm film plastic and silage wrap.  These special arrangements operated on a pilot basis in the first instance in counties Clare, Galway, Mayo, Offaly and Waterford during June and July of last year.  The service was provided free to the farmer and funding to assist the local authorities is being made available from my Department through the Environment Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_9272">The collections were well supported by farmers in the counties participating in the pilot phase, leading to large quantities of plastic being deposited at designated sites.  A significant finding from the pilot scheme was that it is not possible to operate collections in a large number of counties at the same time due to capacity constraints on the part of recovery operators.  Accordingly, it was necessary to roll out the scheme to other areas on a staggered basis.  Arising from a comprehensive examination of the information available, I approved further collections of waste silage / bale wrap in September last by Carlow, Leitrim, Longford, North Tipperary, Roscommon and Wicklow County Councils which concluded in January of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_9273">An estimated 9,300 tonnes of farm plastics were recovered by the five local authorities that participated in the initial phase of the pilot scheme.  The cost associated with the collection and recovery of this plastic amounted to circa €1.8 million of which €312,712 has been recouped by two of the local authorities to date.  A further 6,100 tonnes was estimated to have been collected for recycling by the six local authorities operating the second phase of the scheme at an approximate cost of €1.4 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_9274">Following a review of the outcome of the second round of collections, I have recently announced that collections of waste silage / bale wrap will now be put in place in the remaining 18 county council areas over the next 6 months.  When the final phase is completed, collections will have taken place in all 29 county council areas.  This arrangement allows for phased collections while at the same time creating certainty in the minds of farmers as to when their backlog will be cleared.  It also allows local authorities and local farming organisations sufficient notice to agree and put in place the necessary arrangements for collections in their areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_9275">The collections will now be rolled out as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_9295">The golf course referred to is not itself part of a designated area, but does border the  Ballinskelligs Bay and Inny Estuary cSAC (SAC 000335), which was designated in May 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_9296">In relation to the protected Gallauns, my Department was in contact last year with the County Archaeologist for Kerry County Council on how best to protect the recorded monument referred to (RMP No: KE098-044 Standing Stone). From enquiries made with the County Council it is understood that the Council inspected the site on 20 February 2007 and was of the view that there is no threat currently to this recorded monument. My Department is in regular contact with Kerry County Council on archaeological issues and is available to further advise the Council on this matter as appropriate. Enforcement of conditions attached to planning permissions is a matter for the relevant planning authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_9298">The Government has committed substantially increased funding for water services infrastructure over the past decade and again in the new National Development Plan (NDP).  Some €3.7 billion was invested in new and upgraded water services infrastructure under NDP 2000-2006.  €4.7 billion, an increase of 27%, has been provided under NDP 2007-2013.  Real improvements being achieved on foot of this ongoing investment include:</p>
            <p eId="para_9299">Rapid progress in meeting targets under the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive.  Compliance with the end 2005 deadline for the provision of secondary treatment, which stood at 25% in 2000 had risen to some 90% at the end of 2006, with all remaining schemes needed to ensure full compliance included in the Water Services Investment Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_9300">The extensive programme of wastewater treatment works has reduced the pollutant load from municipal discharges to rivers, lakes and sea (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand) by 45,000 tonnes per annum in a period of unprecedented economic and population growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_9301">Wastewater treatment capacity was increased since 1997 by an equivalent to the needs of a population of 3.3 million; the increase in drinking water treatment capacity over the same period was equivalent to the needs of a population of 1.2 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_9302">By the end of December 2006 of some 85,000 sites had been provided under the Serviced Land Initiative, with a further 100,000 sites at construction stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_9303">Massive investment under the Rural Water Programme has resulted in great progress in upgraded and renewed rural water supply systems and improved water quality in private group water schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_9304">Overall, my Department is committing sufficient resources to ensure that the coverage and quality of the national water infrastructure will be able to fully meet current and anticipated demand in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_9305">My Department provided a total of €119.87 million to Donegal County Council under the Water Services Investment and Rural Water Programmes in the period 1997 to 2006.  Major schemes completed during that period are set out in the following table.  In addition, many more schemes, smaller in scale, were completed under the devolved Rural Water Programme, of which details may be obtained from the County Council.  Full details of currently approved major schemes in County Donegal, including the value of the investment proposed in each case, are set out in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007, which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_9306">New Assessments of Needs were undertaken last year in response to the Department's request to all local authorities to review the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments.  The priorities adopted by the members of Donegal County Council will be taken into account in the framing of the next phase of the Water Services Investment Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_9348">The Government has committed substantially increased funding for water services infrastructure over the past decade and again in the new National Development Plan (NDP).  Some €3.7 billion was invested in new and upgraded water services infrastructure under NDP 2000-2006.  €4.7 billion, an increase of 27%, has been provided under NDP 2007-2013.  Real improvements being achieved on foot of this ongoing investment include:</p>
            <p eId="para_9349">Rapid progress in meeting targets under the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive.  Compliance with the end 2005 deadline for the provision of secondary treatment, which stood at 25% in 2000 had risen to some 90% at the end of 2006, with all remaining schemes needed to ensure full compliance included in the Water Services Investment Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_9350">The extensive programme of wastewater treatment works has reduced the pollutant load from municipal discharges to rivers, lakes and sea (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand) by 45,000 tonnes per annum in a period of unprecedented economic and population growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_9351">Wastewater treatment capacity was increased since 1997 by an equivalent to the needs of a population of 3.3 million; the increase in drinking water treatment capacity over the same period was equivalent to the needs of a population of 1.2 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_9352">By the end of December 2006 of some 85,000 sites had been provided under the Serviced Land Initiative, with a further 100,000 sites at construction stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_9353">Massive investment under the Rural Water Programme has resulted in great progress in upgraded and renewed rural water supply systems and improved water quality in private group water schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_9354">Overall, my Department is committing sufficient resources to  ensure that the coverage and quality of the national water infrastructure will be able to fully meet current and anticipated demand in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_9355">My Department provided a total of €79.73 million to Kerry County Council under the Water Services Investment and Rural Water Programmes in the period 1997 to 2006.  Major schemes completed during that period are set out in the following table.  In addition, many more schemes, smaller in scale, were completed under the devolved Rural Water Programme, of which details may be obtained from the County Council.  Full details of currently approved major schemes in County Kerry, including the value of the investment proposed in each case, are set out in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007, which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_9356">New Assessments of Needs were undertaken last year in response to the Department's request to all local authorities to review the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments.

         further to Parliamentary Question No. 602 of 27 March 2007, when he issued regulation or law that insisted that schemes such as Donaghmoyne were not entitled to grant aid due to the fact that they opted out of the newly introduced system; if consumers are not entitled to the long term savings due to them through a twenty year contract; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_9391">My Department published a Procurement Guidance Document for Small Water Services Schemes in November 2002 with the objective of ensuring that procurement in each case is fair and transparent and accords with national and EU procurement requirements.  The document provides specific guidance on the implementation of public procurement rules in the rural water sector and I am arranging to have a copy forwarded to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_9392">The procurement of the Donaghmoyne Group Water Scheme's water treatment plant did not comply with these requirements in relation to appointment of the client's representative, the submission and opening of tenders and the selection of the contractor.  In all such cases prior approval is required from both my Department and the local authority to the brief, the selection and appointment of the client's representative and the proposed scale of fees.   Local authority and Departmental approval of the Technical Specification and Contract Documents is also needed before tenders may be invited.  The Donaghmoyne Group Water Scheme did not seek or obtain these approvals.  Neither did the group comply with the requirement for sealed tenders to be submitted and opened by the local authority or for approval to be obtained to the award of a contract.  In the circumstances, and under the terms of the Rural Water Programme, no grant may be paid in this case.</p>

            <p eId="para_9394">The Government has committed substantially increased funding for water services infrastructure over the past decade and again in the new National Development Plan (NDP).  Some €3.7 billion was invested in new and upgraded water services infrastructure under NDP 2000-2006.  €4.7 billion, an increase of 27%, has been provided under NDP 2007-2013.  Real improvements being achieved on foot of this ongoing investment include:</p>
            <p eId="para_9395">Rapid progress in meeting targets under the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive.  Compliance with the end 2005 deadline for the provision of secondary treatment, which stood at 25% in 2000 had risen to some 90% at the end of 2006, with all remaining schemes needed to ensure full compliance included in the Water Services Investment Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_9396">The extensive programme of wastewater treatment works has reduced the pollutant load from municipal discharges to rivers, lakes and sea (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand) by 45,000 tonnes per annum in a period of unprecedented economic and population growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_9397">Wastewater treatment capacity was increased since 1997 by an equivalent to the needs of a population of 3.3 million; the increase in drinking water treatment capacity over the same period was equivalent to the needs of a population of 1.2 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_9398">By the end of December 2006 of some 85,000 sites had been provided under the Serviced Land Initiative, with a further 100,000 sites at construction stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_9399">Massive investment under the Rural Water Programme has resulted in great progress in upgraded and renewed rural water supply systems and improved water quality in private group water schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_9400">Overall, my Department is committing sufficient resources to  ensure that the coverage and quality of the national water infrastructure will be able to fully meet current and anticipated demand in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_9401">My Department provided a total of €456.8 million and €149.34 million respectively to Dublin City and Fingal County Councils under the Water Services Investment Programme in the period 1997 to 2006.  Major schemes completed during that period are set out in the following table.  Full details of currently approved major schemes in Dublin City and Fingal, including the value of the investment proposed in each case, are set out in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007, which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_9402">New Assessments of Needs were undertaken last year in response to the Department's request to all local authorities to review the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments.  The priorities adopted by the members of Dublin City and Fingal County Councils will be taken into account in the framing of the next phase of the Water Services Investment Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_9462">A range of State and local authority lands were assigned to the Affordable Housing Initiative provided for under the Sustaining Progress social partnership agreement.  These lands, together with 2,500 affordable homes to be delivered under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006, provide the basis for reaching the 10,000 affordable home target included in the agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_9463">While the agreement did not specify the target period within which the 10,000 homes were to be delivered, my Department has been working actively with the State agencies and local authorities concerned with a view to achieving the earliest possible delivery of completed homes.  To that end, in excess of 70 projects on State and local authority lands are being progressed, with innovative approaches, such as land exchanges, being utilised, where appropriate, to accelerate delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_9464">The data available to my Department, including provisional data for 2006, indicate that 3,125 homes had been completed under the Initiative up to the end of 2006, with a further 557 units under construction at that stage.  Significant work has also been progressing on the planning and procurement aspects associated with a range of other projects that have yet to get to construction, providing a strong platform for additional future delivery.</p>

            <p eId="para_9492">The Government has committed substantially increased funding for water services infrastructure over the past decade and again in the new National Development Plan (NDP).  Some €3.7 billion was invested in new and upgraded water services infrastructure under NDP 2000-2006.  €4.7 billion, an increase of 27%, has been provided under NDP 2007-2013.  Real improvements being achieved on foot of this ongoing investment include:</p>
            <p eId="para_9493">Rapid progress in meeting targets under the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive.  Compliance with the end 2005 deadline for the provision of secondary treatment, which stood at 25% in 2000 had risen to some 90% at the end of 2006, with all remaining schemes needed to ensure full compliance included in the Water Services Investment Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_9494">The extensive programme of wastewater treatment works has reduced the pollutant load from municipal discharges to rivers, lakes and sea (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand) by 45,000 tonnes per annum in a period of unprecedented economic and population growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_9495">Wastewater treatment capacity was increased since 1997 by an equivalent to the needs of a population of 3.3 million; the increase in drinking water treatment capacity over the same period was equivalent to the needs of a population of 1.2 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_9496">By the end of December 2006 of some 85,000 sites had been provided under the Serviced Land Initiative, with a further 100,000 sites at construction stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_9497">Massive investment under the Rural Water Programme has resulted in great progress in upgraded and renewed rural water supply systems and improved water quality in private group water schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_9498">Overall, my Department is committing sufficient resources to  ensure that the coverage and quality of the national water infrastructure will be able to fully meet current and anticipated demand in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_9499">My Department provided a total of €121.92 million to County Wexford under the Water Services Investment and Rural Water Programmes in the period 1997 to 2006.  Major schemes completed during that period are set out in the table below.  In addition, many more schemes, smaller in scale, were completed under the devolved Rural Water Programme, of which details may be obtained from the County Council.  Full details of currently approved major schemes in County Wexford, including the value of the investment proposed in each case, are set out in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007, which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_9500">New Assessments of Needs were undertaken last year in response to the Department's request to all local authorities to review the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments.  The priorities adopted by the members of Wexford County Council will be taken into account in the framing of the next phase of the Water Services Investment Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_9532">The extensive programme of wastewater treatment works has reduced the pollutant load from municipal discharges to rivers, lakes and sea (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand) by 45,000 tonnes per annum in a period of unprecedented economic and population growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_9533">Wastewater treatment capacity was increased since 1997 by an equivalent to the needs of a population of 3.3 million; the increase in drinking water treatment capacity over the same period was equivalent to the needs of a population of 1.2 million.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_9647">I propose to take Questions Nos. 540 and 547 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_9648">The Government has committed substantially increased funding for water services infrastructure over the past decade and again in the new National Development Plan (NDP).  Some €3.7 billion was invested in new and upgraded water services infrastructure under NDP 2000-2006.  €4.7 billion, an increase of 27%, has been provided under NDP 2007-2013.  Real improvements being achieved on foot of this ongoing investment include:</p>
            <p eId="para_9649">Rapid progress in meeting targets under the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive.  Compliance with the end 2005 deadline for the provision of secondary treatment, which stood at 25% in 2000 had risen to some 90% at the end of 2006, with all remaining schemes needed to ensure full compliance included in the Water Services Investment Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_9650">The extensive programme of wastewater treatment works has reduced the pollutant load from municipal discharges to rivers, lakes and sea (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand) by 45,000 tonnes per annum in a period of unprecedented economic and population growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_9651">Wastewater treatment capacity was increased since 1997 by an equivalent to the needs of a population of 3.3 million; the increase in drinking water treatment capacity over the same period was equivalent to the needs of a population of 1.2 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_9652">By the end of December 2006 of some 85,000 sites had been provided under the Serviced Land Initiative, with a further 100,000 sites at construction stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_9653">Massive investment under the Rural Water Programme has resulted in great progress in upgraded and renewed rural water supply systems and improved water quality in private group water schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_9654">Overall, my Department is committing sufficient resources to  ensure that the coverage and quality of the national water infrastructure will be able to fully meet current and anticipated demand in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_9655">My Department provided a total of €103.61 million and €195.23 million to Galway City and Galway County Councils respectively under the Water Services Investment and Rural Water Programmes in the period 1997 to 2006.  Major schemes completed during that period are set out in the following table.  In addition, many more schemes, smaller in scale, were completed under the devolved Rural Water Programme, of which details may be obtained from the County Council.  Full details of currently approved major schemes in Galway City and County, including the value of the investment proposed in each case, are set out in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007, which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_9656">New Assessments of Needs were undertaken last year in response to the Department's request to all local authorities to review the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments.  The priorities adopted by the members of Galway City and County Councils will be taken into account in the framing of the next phase of the Water Services Investment Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_9714">The Government has committed substantially increased funding for water services infrastructure over the past decade and again in the new National Development Plan (NDP).  Some €3.7 billion was invested in new and upgraded water services infrastructure under NDP 2000-2006.  €4.7 billion, an increase of 27%, has been provided under NDP 2007-2013.  Real improvements being achieved on foot of this ongoing investment include:</p>
            <p eId="para_9715">Rapid progress in meeting targets under the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive.  Compliance with the end 2005 deadline for the provision of secondary treatment, which stood at 25% in 2000 had risen to some 90% at the end of 2006, with all remaining schemes needed to ensure full compliance included in the Water Services Investment Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_9716">The extensive programme of wastewater treatment works has reduced the pollutant load from municipal discharges to rivers, lakes and sea (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand) by 45,000 tonnes per annum in a period of unprecedented economic and population growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_9717">Wastewater treatment capacity was increased since 1997 by an equivalent to the needs of a population of 3.3 million; the increase in drinking water treatment capacity over the same period was equivalent to the needs of a population of 1.2 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_9718">By the end of December 2006 of some 85,000 sites had been provided under the Serviced Land Initiative, with a further 100,000 sites at construction stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_9719">Massive investment under the Rural Water Programme has resulted in great progress in upgraded and renewed rural water supply systems and improved water quality in private group water schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_9720">Overall, my Department is committing sufficient resources to  ensure that the coverage and quality of the national water infrastructure will be able to fully meet current and anticipated demand in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_9721">My Department provided a total of €92.89 million to County Sligo under the Water Services Investment and Rural Water Programmes in the period 1997 to 2006.  Major schemes completed during that period are set out in the following table.  In addition, many more schemes, smaller in scale, were completed under the devolved Rural Water Programme, of which details may be obtained from the County Council.  Full details of currently approved major schemes in County Sligo, including the value of the investment proposed in each case, are set out in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007, which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_9722">New Assessments of Needs were undertaken last year in response to the Department's request to all local authorities to review the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments.  The priorities adopted by the members of Sligo County Council will be taken into account in the framing of the next phase of the Water Services Investment Programme.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_9806">The Government has committed substantially increased funding for water services infrastructure over the past decade and again in the new National Development Plan (NDP).  Some €3.7 billion was invested in new and upgraded water services infrastructure under NDP 2000-2006.  €4.7 billion, an increase of 27%, has been provided under NDP 2007-2013.  Real improvements being achieved on foot of this ongoing investment include:</p>
            <p eId="para_9807">Rapid progress in meeting targets under the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive.  Compliance with the end 2005 deadline for the provision of secondary treatment, which stood at 25% in 2000 had risen to some 90% at the end of 2006, with all remaining schemes needed to ensure full compliance included in the Water Services Investment Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_9808">The extensive programme of wastewater treatment works has reduced the pollutant load from municipal discharges to rivers, lakes and sea (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand) by 45,000 tonnes per annum in a period of unprecedented economic and population growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_9809">Wastewater treatment capacity was increased since 1997 by an equivalent to the needs of a population of 3.3 million; the increase in drinking water treatment capacity over the same period was equivalent to the needs of a population of 1.2 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_9810">By the end of December 2006 of some 85,000 sites had been provided under the Serviced Land Initiative, with a further 100,000 sites at construction stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_9811">Massive investment under the Rural Water Programme has resulted in great progress in upgraded and renewed rural water supply systems and improved water quality in private group water schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_9812">Overall, my Department is committing sufficient resources to ensure that the coverage and quality of the national water infrastructure will be able to fully meet current and anticipated demand in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_9813">My Department provided a total of €27.87 million to County Kilkenny and €31.78 million to County Carlow under the Water Services Investment and Rural Water Programmes in the period 1997 to 2006.  Major schemes completed during that period are set out in the following table.  In addition, many more schemes, smaller in scale, were completed under the devolved Rural Water Programme, of which details may be obtained from the County Councils.  Full details of currently approved major schemes in Counties Kilkenny and Carlow, including the value of the investment proposed in each case, are set out in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007, which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_9814">New Assessments of Needs were undertaken last year in response to the Department's request to all local authorities to review the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments.  The priorities adopted by the members of Kilkenny and Carlow County Councils will be taken into account in the framing of the next phase of the Water Services Investment Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_9916">New Assessments of Needs were undertaken last year in response to the Department's request to all local authorities to review the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments.  The priorities adopted by the members of Cork City and County Councils will be taken into account in the framing of the next phase of the Water Services Investment Programme.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_10016">The Government has committed substantially increased funding for water services infrastructure over the past decade and again in the new National Development Plan (NDP).  Some €3.7 billion was invested in new and upgraded water services infrastructure under NDP 2000-2006.  €4.7 billion, an increase of 27%, has been provided under NDP 2007-2013.  Real improvements being achieved on foot of this ongoing investment include:</p>
            <p eId="para_10017">Rapid progress in meeting targets under the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive.  Compliance with the end 2005 deadline for the provision of secondary treatment, which stood at 25% in 2000 had risen to some 90% at the end of 2006, with all remaining schemes needed to ensure full compliance included in the Water Services Investment Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_10018">The extensive programme of wastewater treatment works has reduced the pollutant load from municipal discharges to rivers, lakes and sea (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand) by 45,000 tonnes per annum in a period of unprecedented economic and population growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_10019">Wastewater treatment capacity was increased since 1997 by an equivalent to the needs of a population of 3.3 million; the increase in drinking water treatment capacity over the same period was equivalent to the needs of a population of 1.2 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_10020">By the end of December 2006 of some 85,000 sites had been provided under the Serviced Land Initiative, with a further 100,000 sites at construction stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_10021">Massive investment under the Rural Water Programme has resulted in great progress in upgraded and renewed rural water supply systems and improved water quality in private group water schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_10022">Overall, my Department is committing sufficient resources to  ensure that the coverage and quality of the national water infrastructure will be able to fully meet current and anticipated demand in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_10023">My Department provided a total of €295.26 million, €71.14 million and €100.43 million, respectively, to Limerick City and County Councils and Clare County Council under the Water Services Investment and Rural Water Programmes in the period 1997 to 2006.  Major schemes completed during that period are set out in the following table.  In addition, many more schemes, smaller in scale, were completed under the devolved Rural Water Programme, of which details may be obtained from the County Councils.  Full details of currently approved major schemes in Limerick City and County and in County Clare, including the value of the investment proposed in each case, are set out in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007, which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_10024">New Assessments of Needs were undertaken last year in response to the Department's request to all local authorities to review the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments.  The priorities adopted by the members of Limerick City and County Councils and Clare County Council will be taken into account in the framing of the next phase of the Water Services Investment Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_10082">The Government has committed substantially increased funding for water services infrastructure over the past decade and again in the new National Development Plan (NDP).  Some €3.7 billion was invested in new and upgraded water services infrastructure under NDP 2000-2006.  €4.7 billion, an increase of 27%, has been provided under NDP 2007-2013.  Real improvements being achieved on foot of this ongoing investment include:</p>
            <p eId="para_10083">Rapid progress in meeting targets under the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive.  Compliance with the end 2005 deadline for the provision of secondary treatment, which stood at 25% in 2000 had risen to some 90% at the end of 2006, with all remaining schemes needed to ensure full compliance included in the Water Services Investment Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_10084">The extensive programme of wastewater treatment works has reduced the pollutant load from municipal discharges to rivers, lakes and sea (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand) by 45,000 tonnes per annum in a period of unprecedented economic and population growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_10085">Wastewater treatment capacity was increased since 1997 by an equivalent to the needs of a population of 3.3 million; the increase in drinking water treatment capacity over the same period was equivalent to the needs of a population of 1.2 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_10086">By the end of December 2006 of some 85,000 sites had been provided under the Serviced Land Initiative, with a further 100,000 sites at construction stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_10087">Massive investment under the Rural Water Programme has resulted in great progress in upgraded and renewed rural water supply systems and improved water quality in private group water schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_10088">Overall, my Department is committing sufficient resources to ensure that the coverage and quality of the national water infrastructure will be able to fully meet current and anticipated demand in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_10089">My Department provided a total of €175.72 million, €107.63 million and €68.38 million respectively to Counties Louth, Cavan and Monaghan under the Water Services Investment and Rural Water Programmes in the period 1997 to 2006.  Major schemes completed during that period are set out in the following table.  In addition, many more schemes, smaller in scale, were completed under the devolved Rural Water Programme, of which details may be obtained from the County Councils.  Full details of currently approved major schemes in Counties Louth, Cavan and Monaghan, including the value of the investment proposed in each case, are set out in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007, which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_10090">New Assessments of Needs were undertaken last year in response to the Department's request to all local authorities to review the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments.  The priorities adopted by the members of Louth, Cavan and Monaghan County Councils will be taken into account in the framing of the next phase of the Water Services Investment Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_10164">The Government has committed substantially increased funding for water services infrastructure over the past decade and again in the new National Development Plan (NDP).  Some €3.7 billion was invested in new and upgraded water services infrastructure under NDP 2000-2006.  €4.7 billion, an increase of 27%, has been provided under NDP 2007-2013.  Real improvements being achieved on foot of this ongoing investment include:</p>
            <p eId="para_10165">Rapid progress in meeting targets under the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive.  Compliance with the end 2005 deadline for the provision of secondary treatment, which stood at 25% in 2000 had risen to some 90% at the end of 2006, with all remaining schemes needed to ensure full compliance included in the Water Services Investment Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_10166">The extensive programme of wastewater treatment works has reduced the pollutant load from municipal discharges to rivers, lakes and sea (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand) by 45,000 tonnes per annum in a period of unprecedented economic and population growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_10167">Wastewater treatment capacity was increased since 1997 by an equivalent to the needs of a population of 3.3 million; the increase in drinking water treatment capacity over the same period was equivalent to the needs of a population of 1.2 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_10168">By the end of December 2006 of some 85,000 sites had been provided under the Serviced Land Initiative, with a further 100,000 sites at construction stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_10169">Massive investment under the Rural Water Programme has resulted in great progress in upgraded and renewed rural water supply systems and improved water quality in private group water schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_10170">Overall, my Department is committing sufficient resources to  ensure that the coverage and quality of the national water infrastructure will be able to fully meet current and anticipated demand in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_10171">My Department provided a total of €22.92 million to County Longford and €62.01 million to Westmeath County Council under the Water Services Investment and Rural Water Programmes in the period 1997 to 2006.  Major schemes completed during that period are set out in the following table.  In addition, many more schemes, smaller in scale, were completed under the devolved Rural Water Programme, of which details may be obtained from the County Councils.  Full details of currently approved major schemes in Counties Longford and Westmeath, including the value of the investment proposed in each case, are set out in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007, which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_10172">New Assessments of Needs were undertaken last year in response to the Department's request to all local authorities to review the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments.

            <p eId="para_10670">The Environmental Protection Agency is required under section 61(3) of the Environmental Protection Act 1992 to report on a biennial basis on the quality of effluents being discharged from treatment plants, sewers or drainage pipes which are vested in, controlled or used by local authorities.  The Agency's latest report — Urban Waste Water  Discharges in Ireland — A Report of the Years 2004 and 2005, (which is available in the Oireachtas Library), reviews all agglomerations with a population equivalent exceeding 500 and trends for the period 1998 to 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_10671">Management of sewerage schemes is generally the responsibility of the relevant local authority, which has a range of instruments and measures available to ensure quality standards are maintained.  In addition, my Department coordinates and finances a major programme of investment in new and improved wastewater infrastructure, as set out in the Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007, (also available in the Oireachtas Library).  The schemes included in the Programme are derived mainly from regular assessments of needs undertaken by local authorities, at my Department's request, as an input to the overall strategy for meeting identified water services needs.  Local authorities were requested to carry out new assessments in 2006 and these will inform project selection in the next phase of the Programme.  In undertaking the assessments, authorities are asked to have regard to specific criteria, including relevant national and EU environmental and public health statutory requirements and standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_10672">Finally, I propose in the near future to make Regulations establishing a new authorization regime for discharges from waste water works operated by local authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_10674">Details of local authorities' receipts from development contributions for the period 1994-2005, based on annual planning statistical returns from planning authorities, are available on my Department's website.  Annual returns for 2006 are currently being compiled by planning authorities.  The table, which will be forwarded to the Deputy, sets out the projections that were provided by all City and most County, Borough and Town Councils in mid 2006 on the application of development contributions for the years 2007-2010.  A number of Councils were unable to provide projections; all local authorities will shortly be asked for updated projections.  Data for Borough and Town Councils are included in the county figures.  My Department does not collect information on development contributions demanded by planning authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_10675">Under article 16 of the Local Government (Financial Procedures and Audit) Regulations 2002, local authorities are required to maintain an adequate and effective system of internal audit of their accounting and control systems covering both capital and current expenditure and income.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_10864">The Planning and Development Act 2000 sets the framework within which planning authorities must take in charge estates.  Section 180 of the Act distinguishes between estates which have been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the planning permission and estates which have not been so completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_10865">In the case of the former there is no set time limit for taking in charge: the developer, or a majority of the residents, may request that the estate be taken in charge as soon as it is completed in accordance with the permission and on foot of such a request the planning authority is required to initiate the taking in charge procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_10866">Where estates have not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the planning permission, section 180 provides that, where the planning authority has not taken enforcement action within 7 years of the expiration of the permission, it will be required to initiate taking in charge procedures at the request of a majority of the residents.  This timeframe was granted to give planning authorities time, after the expiration of the planning permission, to take action to compel developers to finish estates in accordance with the planning permission.</p>
            <p eId="para_10867">In addition to the legal framework, my Department has also issued policy guidance on taking in charge of estates in the form of circular letter PD 1/06.  Planning authorities were reminded of their responsibilities in this area and were asked as a priority to establish a policy on taking in charge to be approved by the members of the authority, and reported on to those members on a regular basis or at least once annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_10868">On the issue of enforcement of planning control, the substantial powers already given to planning authorities to deal with unauthorised development have been significantly strengthened in the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.  This effectively reverses the burden of proof in relation to the refusal of planning permission to a developer who has substantially failed to comply with a previous planning permission.  Under the amended provisions, the authority may refuse permission in such a case and the developer will have to go to the High Court if he or she wishes to apply to have this decision annulled.  I am satisfied that planning authorities now have very substantial powers to compel the completion of housing estates by developers in accordance with the terms of the planning permission.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_10879">Considerable progress has been made by the relevant statutory agencies in dealing with illegal waste activity. In particular, since the establishment of the Office of Environmental Enforcement in 2003, enforcement has been better structured through the establishment of a national Enforcement Network. The OEE and the Enforcement Network has greatly raised awareness and brought about better practice and a more coordinated and consistent approach to environmental enforcement by the relevant authorities. Annual supporting funding from my Department's Environment Fund of over €7.5m has led to some 120 additional local authority enforcement personnel and a greatly enhanced response on the ground. Since its establishment the OEE has conducted 282 investigations into local authority statutory performance issues relating to waste management and served 142 advice and recommendation notices in relation to these investigations.  Four directions have been served on local authorities in relation to waste management issues and the directions have all been complied with.</p>
            <p eId="para_10880">In October 2005 the OEE published a major study, The Nature and Extent of Unauthorised Waste Activity in Ireland, which concluded that large scale illegal dumping is no longer occurring but local authorities now have to cope with problems such as fly-tipping and backyard burning.</p>
            <p eId="para_10881">Where illegal deposition is discovered, the policy direction which I issued in 2005 sets the standard in terms of the expected response from the regulatory authorities, who are obliged to ensure that the necessary remedial measures will be taken to ensure that sites are restored and that waste illegally deposited is appropriately disposed of or recovered.</p>
            <p eId="para_10882">In support of this policy a code of practice has been prepared by the EPA and will be launched later this month. This guidance elaborates on a number of issues set out in the direction and will provide a framework for assessing the environmental risk of both illegal and historic landfills so that informed decisions can be taken in relation to the optimal environmental outcome for these sites. As a further measure the Agency has also led the development of a new national complaints procedure to facilitate members of the public in reporting illegal waste activity, which embodies a national free phone number.</p>
            <p eId="para_10883">In addition, under regulations which I made in 2006, the landfill levy has been increased for illegal waste activities. The regulations provide that the levy payable on waste disposed of at an unauthorised landfill after 28 July 2006 is increased to €20 per tonne, an increase of €5 per tonne on the rate which had applied.</p>
            <p eId="para_10884">Finally the OEE, through the use of its own powers to oversee the statutory performance of local authorities, is ensuring that actions are being taken which will ensure that situations of general and persistent failure to act on illegal waste deposition will not in the future be allowed to happen.</p>

With an estimated 80,000 hectares of cutaway Bord na Móna bog to become available by 2050, I very much welcome any arrangement between Bord na Móna and local groups to restore the natural and amenity value of harvested bogs.  Such an arrangement already exists at Lough Boora, County Offaly.</p>
            <p eId="para_10889">The Mount Dillon land concerned is not currently prioritised for designation under the Wildlife Acts or the relevant European Directives.  Accordingly, its management would not be appropriate to the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department.

            <p eId="para_10901">As required under the Disability Act 2005, my Department's sectoral plan was approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas in October 2006. The plan, covering my Department, its partner bodies and local authorities, provides for a range of positive measures which will promote and pro-actively encourage equal opportunities for persons with disabilities to participate in the economic, social and cultural life of the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_10902">Under the sectoral plan each local authority is committed to carrying out an accessibility audit, by the end of April 2007, of all roads and streets, pavements and pedestrian crossings, public buildings, public parks, amenities and open spaces, heritage sites, public libraries and harbours within its control and to identifying  the remedial action necessary to make them accessible. The accessibility audits also cover access to services and information. Additional resources have been provided since 2005, as part of the National Disability Strategy multi-annual funding programme, to support work on accessibility audits and implementation undertaken by local authorities. I am providing a further €15 million in 2007 for this programme, which complements existing funding available to local authorities for mainstream public services. Each local authority will, within three months of completing the accessibility audit, draw up an implementation plan setting out a programme of actions and detailed costings to give effect to the commitments and objectives contained in the 2005 Act and in the sectoral plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_10903">Local authorities have been encouraged to build their own internal capacity to conduct accessibility audits, while making judicious use of external expertise as necessary, and the ongoing funding programme has supported this combined approach. As set out in the plan, roles and functions in relation to access for people with disabilities are assigned at local level to specified staff, cross-functional teams and groups building on existing local authority structures.  It is a matter for the City or County Manager concerned to make the necessary staffing and organisational arrangements for this  purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_10904">In line with Government policy on public service employment and subject to rigorous criteria, it is open to local authorities to set out priority short term staff needs and a number of local authorities have had short term posts approved to support the disability strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_10912">A levy of €15 per tonne on the landfill of waste was introduced on 1 June 2002 under legislation approved by the Oireachtas. The levy is designed to encourage the diversion of waste away from landfill and generate revenues that can be applied in support of waste minimisation and recycling initiatives. Similar landfill levies are being applied in other countries, and in particular by a number of EU member states having regard to the requirement of the EU Landfill Directive for significant reduction by member states in the use of landfill.  No such EU policy or legal requirement applies to the incineration of waste with energy recovery.</p>

            <p eId="para_10920">Following from the 2002 ECJ judgement in case C-316/00 that Ireland had failed to comply with certain micro-biological parameters of Council Directive 80/778/EEC relating to water intended for human consumption, my Department agreed on a number of measures with the European Commission in order to comply with the requirements of the judgment.</p>

            <p eId="para_10927">Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste (as amended by as amended by Directive 2004/12/EC) is based on the principle of producer responsibility, which is intended to require producers to contribute to the waste management costs at end-of-life of products which they have placed on the market. Under the Directive, Ireland was required to achieve a 25% recovery rate of packaging waste by 1 July 2001, increasing to a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005 and to 50% by 2011.  The Directive is transposed into national legislation by the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003 (as amended in 2004 and 2006) which replaced earlier regulations introduced in 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_10928">Under the regulations, ‘major producers' of packaging waste — i.e. manufacturers, importers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers (representing all participants in the packaging chain) who place more than 25 tonnes of packaging on the market each year and who have an annual turnover exceeding €1m excluding VAT — are required to take steps individually to recover their packaging waste (i.e. self-compliance) or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes set up to recover packaging waste.  Repak Limited was established by Irish industry in 1997 to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste with a view to achieving Ireland's packaging waste recovery and recycling targets under the Directive and is the only such approved compliance scheme in Ireland.  Repak membership income is used to subsidise the collection of packaging waste from both the household and commercial sectors. In the household sector, subsidy is provided towards the collection of packaging waste from bring banks and civic amenity recycling centres, as well as segregated kerbside collection of packaging waste from households.</p>
            <p eId="para_10929">Repak have reported consistent progress since 1997 and in 2001 Ireland met the 25% packaging waste recovery target required by the Directive. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reported in the National Waste Report 2005, published in January 2007, that Ireland exceeded the recovery and recycling targets for end 2005 by some 10%.  The number of tonnes of packaging waste recovered in 1998 was 93,259.  This increased six-fold to 554,632 in 2005. The number of households served by segregated collection grew from 70,000 in 1998 to over 560,000 by 2003.  In the period 1998 to 2005, the number of bring banks grew from 837 to 1,937 while the number of civic amenity sites grew from 30 to 81.</p>
            <p eId="para_10930">Last Autumn, Repak agreed with local authorities increased subsidy rates for the next five years.  This will give certainty to everyone involved — Repak, members of the compliance scheme, local authorities and waste operators – in relation to the level of resources that are available to support recycling over the period leading up to the 2011 deadline for meeting Ireland's latest recycling target. While the Department facilitated discussions between the local authorise and Repak on this matter, it is not a party to the agreement.</p>

            <p eId="para_10933">In the first 12 months of operation, 27,700 tonnes of household WEEE was collected.  This represents approximately 2.3 million electrical and electronic products or 6.7kg per inhabitant, surpassing the EU target of 4kg per person set for the end of 2008.  This contrasts to the 5,510 tonnes of this waste type which was recovered in 2004 and indicates widespread public support for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_10934">Under the terms of the WEEE Directive, financing the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment is solely a producer responsibility.  Two collective compliance schemes, functioning under the responsibility of producers, are operating in Ireland.  These compliance schemes, WEEE Ireland and the European Recycling Platform, are responsible for the recycling of all household WEEE deposited at designated collection points.  These include civic amenity facilities and retail outlets.</p>
            <p eId="para_10935">The compliance schemes are also responsible for ensuring that recovered WEEE is recycled in an environmentally sound manner and for putting in place tracking and auditing systems for materials recovery in line with the requirements of the Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_10936">An increasing proportion of this WEEE is now recycled in Ireland following the establishment of three new WEEE recycling and treatment facilities since August 2005.</p>

        <b>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</b>
         his plans to make changes in the regulation of waste charges such as those operating in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown whereby the annual waste charges paid by householders availing of the council’s own service is in effect subsidising the provision of public recycling facilities that are available for use by those who use a private waste company for the collection of their domestic waste; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_10941">Rapid growth and consolidation of the waste industry in recent years has enabled the private sector to expand its services in the domestic waste collection market. It is generally acknowledged that the involvement of the private sector in providing key waste infrastructure and services has benefited the environment and increased efficiency in the waste sector as a whole by providing a range of alternatives.  However, we also face challenges in balancing the right of the private sector to compete freely in a competitive market with the need to provide the most efficient and effective service for consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_10942">In August last year, my Department published a consultation paper on options for future regulation of the waste sector. Submissions were invited on whether there is a need for a regulator for the sector, on what model of regulator might be most appropriate and on what powers any such regulator should be given.  Among the possible powers discussed in the paper is the power to impose a public service obligation.  This is a feature of regulation in some other sectors, and effectively requires contractors to operate cross-subsidisation so that services can be provided where they would not otherwise be economically feasible.  Over fifty, many very detailed, submissions were received addressing the range of complex issues which surround the regulation of the sector. Following consideration of these submissions I intend to finalise further policy proposals.</p>

The Minister has no function in relation to the setting of waste charges either by local authorities or by private collectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_10947">However, to ensure that waste collection charging systems more fully embody the polluter pays principle, my Department asked waste service providers to move to a system of use-based charging from 2005 onwards. Service providers were given discretion as to the types of systems to be used, provided that the key principle of use based charging is respected.  Some service providers have opted for weight based charging while others have opted for volume based charging.  My Department does not routinely compile information on the charging methods employed by the many service providers but understands that local authorities generally have now adopted some form of use based charging as have most private sector service providers, whose regulation is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_10950">This is being achieved by means of a meter based volumetric charge to ensure water charging of users according to actual consumption.   Metering should also encourage water conservation.  This framework does not provide for the exemption of any classes of non-domestic users from the charging policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_10952">Waste management services have traditionally been provided at a local level, with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances.  The present legal framework, as determined by the Oireachtas, reflects this. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver scheme, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.  Section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act, 1996 specifically precludes the Minister from any involvement in anything for which a local authority has statutory responsibility. However, my Department has asked local authorities to engage with commercial waste collectors to agree on arrangements to assist lower income households by offering alternatives to periodic lump-sum payments.</p>

A further €10.5m will be allocated in 2007. Under the NDP 2007-2013 the Government will continue to prioritise landfill remediation by providing Exchequer assistance to local authorities towards certain landfill remediation costs.
