          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">The key promise made by the Government was that people would feel safer in their homes and on the streets, a record on which the Government would be judged. Everybody stands for that kind of society. The latest figures published for headline crime, however, suggest a serious situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">The reality is that crime is up and detection is down. Homicides are up from 98 in 2004 to 155 in 2005. Every week there are more than 1,000 thefts, amounting to 56,000 last year. In every one of the ten headline categories of crime the detection rate in 2005 was lower than in 2000 where similar figures are available. That means there is a lower detection rate of homicides, assaults, sexual offences, thefts, burglaries and robberies. There are ten categories within which to measure the Government's performance, amounting to ten failures.</p>

          <p eId="para_4">Does the Taoiseach believe that his Government's fundamental commitment to making people feel safer in their homes and on the streets is being fulfilled to this point?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_4">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_5">Yesterday's annual report to which Deputy Kenny refers sets out the statistics confirming the provisional headline crime figures which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform released in January. It shows an increase in headline crime of 2.7% last year compared with 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">The statistics also include non-headline crime — for the first time in the annual report — which increased by 12.2% in 2005. This covers several areas which I will go through if necessary. A significant part of the headline crime involved murders and manslaughter, the figure for which in 2005 was 58 as against 45 in 2004. There were reductions in 11 of the 25 headline areas and increases in 14. I have cited the figure for the significant increase in manslaughter. Aggregated sexual assaults were down 43%, robbery of cash goods in transit was down 27%, robbery from the person was down 23%, theft from the person was down 18%, possession of drugs for supply or sale was up 20%, and possession of firearms was up 16%.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_9">——there has been a substantial increase in the detection of crime in this area. That is to be welcomed by all of us who wish to see an end to the carnage on the roads, whether caused by drink driving offences, insurance offences or vehicles having difficulties. Detection in all these categories has substantially increased. The figures differ very little.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has asked me to clarify the figures in respect of firearms seized. The figures published yesterday in this category for 2005, if they stood, would show a substantial reduction over those for 2004. That would be surprising given the successes we heard about throughout 2005 under Operation Anvil, which was introduced that year. The Garda had difficulties with its system and will clarify its figures today.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">This Government stated that it would continue to run a strong economy, last year creating more than 80,000 jobs.</p>

He made a fundamental promise on behalf of his Government that people would feel safer in their homes and on the streets and that the Government would be judged on this. I have cited failure in ten categories in the nine years the Government has been in office. Is it not a fact that as a consequence of this our country is in many ways a much less civilised place in which to live? It is the responsibility of Government to deal with the issue of crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">Will the Taoiseach explain why 500 gardaí are doing civilian jobs? Why have the gardaí not been given a world-class system of communication? Why is it that many must ring into Garda stations on their mobile telephones and sometimes travel to the scene of accidents in taxis? Will the Taoiseach accept that this is the responsibility of his Government? I have been pursuing the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is not present, who self-combusted over——</p>

The Deputy raised the issue of the new digital phone system. I am unable to explain the reason that, when the Government granted approval for the system in 2002, a series of people within the Garda Síochána and various agencies and Departments have spent four years looking into it and looking out of it.

That issue has been dealt with, but it should not have taken so long.</p>

Deputy Kenny will agree that our population has increased from 3.5 million to 4.1 million. Every examination of the figures has shown that crime per thousand of the population is down. If the Deputy asks me whether I am happy that we are delivering on our promise to lower crime rates, I am happy the figures show a decrease in real terms.</p>

I always resent that in this country we always seem to speak against ourselves. Our crime figures are lower now, <i>pro rata</i>, than ten years ago and lower than practically any other city in Europe. We have more gardaí than the equivalent anywhere except in Spain and Portugal, yet we try to talk ourselves down. This is one of the most popular countries for tourism.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">As far as I am aware, all parties in the House are in favour of a rational planned programme of decentralisation. Deputies on all sides of the House privately concede that the plan announced in 2003 by the then Minister, Mr. McCreevy, is a shambles, is unworkable, is doing permanent damage to the cohesion of governance and is causing serious unjustifiable disruption to families who have long put down roots in this city.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">Why has a voluntary programme of decentralisation, announced admittedly off the top of the head and for political reasons, turned into a compulsory programme of relocation of civil servants and public servants working for agencies? In some agencies, nobody is offering to relocate. In FÁS six people out of 400 are offering to relocate. Specialist agencies will lose the undoubted skills accumulated over the years. Permanent damage will be done to the corporate memory in the Civil Service. We know that a parallel Civil Service will be developed at enormous cost — we do not know how much. In the words of my colleague, Deputy Burton, for the more than 5,000 who are determined not to move, they will end up being whitewalled in this city with somebody scrounging around to try to find work for them to do. That is utterly unjustifiable. However, what is most unjustifiable——</p>

The OPW and the committee dealing with decentralisation have sourced a number of sites and buildings and are dealing with the operational arrangements. Several thousands of civil servants want to move while others do not want to move. I understand for people who have children at certain stages of education such as second level or college, it may not be suitable for them. I accept it creates difficulties with promotional posts, as arose in FÁS which has been asked to move to Birr. The Government has been actively trying to address these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">I also readily admit there has been no appetite within the State agencies to move out of Dublin. The figures on the take-up in that regard have been very small. The reason for decentralisation now is the same as it was a decade ago, to achieve better balanced regional development. I am not arguing with what Deputy Rabbitte said but this city cannot continue to take the densities being forced on it and the traffic pressures without the Government responding by trying to move some people to other centres.</p>

The Taoiseach said the task is to take pressure off this city but when one checks the applicants applying for transfers to various Departments, a high percentage of them are civil and public servants living in parts of the country other than Dublin who wish to transfer to other parts of the country. How will such transfers alleviate the pressure in Dublin? What is the point in saying to people that such a transfer is voluntary when they are presented with Hobson's choice to either relocate or not be considered for promotion or to relocate because if they stay here they will have nothing to do? We will end up with a Civil Service similar to the Legal Aid Board, which has two head offices, one in Cahirciveen and one in Mount Street, with all the costs involved in personnel flying by Aer Arann to this city two or three times a week. That is the model we will have throughout the country. We will have a parallel Civil Service.</p>

          <p eId="para_68">The Government will continue to work with the Civil Service unions to relocate a substantial number of public servants. Deputy Rabbitte is aware that all these arguments were used previously. I remember dealing with sections of various Departments that did not want to move ten years ago. However, many of the Departments that did not relocate ten years ago are sorry they did not. They did not envisage the difficulties of population and traffic growth in the city. A sizeable number of public servants want to move. It makes sense to move services, on a balanced basis, to regional locations from where they can be effectively delivered to the public on a nationwide basis, as has been proven.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">I accept there are difficulties involved in doing that. If a person is working in Department A which is due to relocate and he or she wishes to remain in that Department and for that Department to remain in Dublin, we must be realistic and acknowledge that we cannot move 99 public or civil servants and leave one to remain in Dublin, and that that person can expect to stay and be promoted.

Young people will be in their 70s and still paying their mortgages. Is it any wonder the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is on a systematic campaign to undermine the entirely human and reasonable expectation that workers should retire at 60 or 65 years of age with a reasonable pension when Government policy on housing is utterly subservient to the capitalist marketplace and workers will be enslaved to the banks into their 70s merely to put a roof over their heads?</p>

        <speech by="#RoryOHanlon" as="#Ceann_Comhairle" eId="spk_157">
          <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
          <p eId="para_173">The House passed an order last Thursday to the effect that at 11 a.m. this morning, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, Deputy Deasy, would make a statement introducing Europe Day.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDeasyFG" eId="spk_158">
          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_174">I thank the Ceann Comhairle. Today in the Dáil we are celebrating Europe Day. If people were to ask me the main reason for the celebration, I suppose I would say all they have to do is look around their constituencies. There have been massive changes in all our constituencies over recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">We need to consider the relevance of this Chamber to the development of towns and villages throughout the country and to the European institutions which make our laws. The Chamber is not as relevant as it should be. We have neglected to underline the fact that European affairs are increasingly domestic affairs. The wider public is not engaged in debates on EU affairs. I accept that the Joint Committee on European Affairs deals with such matters. I heard the Taoiseach and the other party leaders making statements on a recent European Council meeting. The public is not connected with such debates, however. The levels of change being experienced in our society are not reflected in debate in this Chamber. People get a little sleepy when they start to hear European issues being debated. Regardless of the extent to which this Chamber is removed from people's day-to-day lives, the fact is that Brussels is a million miles away from most people's lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">For that reason, it has been decided, on a cross-party basis, to change the Dáil proceedings for a day. The objective of the changes is to liven up the Chamber. In many cases, this place is used for set-piece, formalised debates with very little spontaneity. On a cross-party basis, as I have said, it has been decided to try to change this by introducing some additional measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">For the first time, a European Commissioner will be in attendance during a debate in the Dáil Chamber. Deputies and Senators will be allowed to question the European Agriculture and Rural Development Commissioner, Mariann Fischer Boel, for an hour. The public will have a direct input into today's debates. A number of weeks ago, the joint committee placed an advertisement on its website asking the public to forward to it some questions to be put directly to the Commissioner and to various Ministers throughout the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">The length of today's speeches is to be curtailed. An emphasis will be placed on questions, interaction and intervention. There will be a liberal interpretation of intervention. It is obvious that the Ceann Comhairle will use his discretion, but Members will be allowed to stand up, stop people from speaking and ask them questions. It is hoped that this will allow for interactive debate between Members and liven things up to some extent. Scripts are not being encouraged, although Ministers and the Commissioner will be allowed to read from prepared statements. Generally speaking, we hope that Members will not rely on scripts in the House. I hope we will learn something from today's proceedings about how we do our business in the Chamber on a regular basis. Perhaps we will learn something from the proceedings that can be used on a day-to-day basis during normal Dáil business.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">The first item on today's agenda is a debate on the joint committee's report on migration to be introduced by Deputy Andrews. I will outline some of the report's main findings. The committee is of the view that the decision to allow free movement of workers from the ten 2004 accession countries was a good one. In fact, it was an excellent decision. There are gaps between Departments when dealing with issues relating to immigrants, however. There are problems with the collection of data, for example. Social issues such as workers' rights, integration and isolation also need to be addressed. The contribution to our society being made by immigrants cannot be overestimated. A massive proportion of Ireland's growth rate of 5.1% can be directly attributed to the immigrants who have come here, especially in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">The joint committee is concerned that there is so little co-ordination between the various Departments. It is neither surprising nor earth-shattering that the committee's main finding is that one Department and one Minister should be given responsibility for immigrant affairs in their entirety. When we asked Departments to state which is the lead Department dealing with a particular issue, they could not tell us in some cases. That is a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">The numbers involved are staggering. It is possible that 1 million immigrants will come to this country over the next ten years. The social aspect of such arrivals has been stressed repeatedly. It has been suggested that the figure of 1 million is an exaggeration. Some people have cited the example of France's problems with its immigrant population. The members of the joint committee have stressed that if we do not deal with the social issues which are faced by immigrants, we will encounter major problems down the road. We need to recognise that society is changing profoundly and to deal with those changes within our Executive and our Legislature.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">The second issue to be debated today is agriculture. There is a great deal of concern in the agricultural industry about issues such as the nitrates directive, animal welfare, animal medicines, the sugar beet industry and regulations. Today's debate represents a very good opportunity for those representatives who have interests in the farming sector to question the European Agriculture and Rural Development Commissioner directly on the decisions being made by the European Commission which affect Irish farming. They now have a chance, over 60 minutes, to directly question the EU Commissioner on Agriculture on the decisions being made that in some cases are having very serious consequences for Irish farming. The European Communities (Amendment) Bill affects the accession of Romania and Bulgaria. Outside the issue of when Romania and Bulgaria will be joining the EU, some of us will be interested to find out whether Ireland allows free movement from these countries. I have my reservations in this regard. The figures I have seen suggest we may have enough workers coming from the ten new accession countries and it may be a mistake to allow the free movement of workers from Romania. However, it will be interesting to hear what other Members feel about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">The scrutiny process will be talked about. That sounds pretty boring, but it is very relevant to everything we do here. The regulatory impact analysis we carry out on every directive from the EU will be looked at as well. To give an example, we were very concerned in the committee that there was no regulatory impact analysis carried out on the nitrates directive. The Office of the Taoiseach has written to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to inquire why that was the case. It is important we deal with the directives properly. In some cases the consequences for a particular industry may be potentially dire. The last topic we will be dealing with is Europe and the developing world and this will be taken by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">I want to thank a few people. I thank the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Kitt, for his help throughout this process and his officials, particularly Ms Alice Kearney. I thank the members of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, particularly Deputy Andrews and Deputy Quinn, the rapporteur today, who has put a great deal of effort into hopefully making this an interesting day. I thank Ms Anne-Marie Fahy and Mr. Myles Geiran from the committee's secretariat and the Clerk of the Dáil, Mr. Kieran Coughlan. More than anyone else, however, I thank the Ceann Comhairle for pushing forward this initiative from the start. His ideas and efforts at the Conference of Speakers of EU Parliaments allowed this to happen. Again I stress, that if it is considered successful, the hope is that all national parliaments will use today as a model for dealing with European affairs within their respective chambers. I look forward to today's proceedings.</p>

        <heading>Report of the Joint Committee on European Affairs on Migration: Statements.</heading>
        <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" eId="spk_159">
          <from>Mr. Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_185">I welcome the genesis of the idea of Europe Day in the Dáil. It gives an opportunity to all Members of the House to talk about these issues, as they directly affect everybody in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">I disagree with what Deputy Deasy had to say about Romania and Bulgaria. Only last week the Joint Committee on European Affairs met with the ambassador from Bulgaria. She was able to inform us that labour market movements within Bulgaria are completely different to the situation as described by Deputy Deasy. There is very little likelihood of any major rush from Bulgaria. They have had 5% to 6% growth on average over the last three or four years. There does not appear to be any likelihood, if immigration from the ten accession states has been moderate, measured and useful, that opening the borders to Bulgaria and Romania will be a regressive step. I take this opportunity to urge the Taoiseach and the Government to continue the open borders approach as regards EU member states. The debate has left those behind who have ideas about work permits for citizens of EU member states. It runs entirely against everything the European Union stands for, namely, free movement of workers, free establishment and all the basic principles we signed up to. We cannot begin to have an <i>à la carte</i> approach to the European Union because something does not suit us. I encourage the Government to continue its excellent work and leadership within the European Union. In the last couple of weeks another four countries have adopted the approach of allowing access to their labour markets for citizens from the ten new accession states. That situation will improve and continue until 2011 when all member states will allow access to their labour markets to citizens of the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">Having said that, it falls to me to introduce the report produced over the last five or six months by the Joint Committee on European Affairs. It has been a very interesting process. I have to acknowledge the work of Ms Katherine Meenan who put a vast amount of research into an area in which, as we discovered, there is a great lack of data and information that would allow us to make concrete visionary policies in the future. As Deputy Deasy said in his introduction, the debate emerges from great concern within this country as regards the challenge of so many people coming into Ireland in recent times and in the coming years. One startling fact we got from the head of FÁS is that there will be a requirement for 500,000 new workers over the next ten years if the economy continues to grow as at present. If we are to continue to absorb those workers the debate must move away from immigration towards integration. That is the real challenge of this report. It sets down a requirement that there should be a single Department with responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">As matters stand a large number of Departments have responsibility for immigration affairs and integration. The Department of Health and Children, for example, has responsibility, as we heard recently, as regards vaccination of people from third countries. We know the Department of Social and Family Affairs deals with those who cannot find work. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government deals with housing aspects. The Department of Education and Science tries to integrate young children into schools. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform deals with racism issues as does the Garda National Immigration Bureau, while the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment deals with work permits. That is seven Departments, and our research clearly shows there has been no co-ordination of approach among them. We are calling on the Government to consider setting up a single Department with responsibility for these affairs. We do not intend that all the functions should come within this Department, but rather that it should supervise all the functions I have described.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The report lays stress on the issue of immigration. Significantly, it notes that if we do not create far-sighted policies, we are in danger of repeating the mistakes that have been made in many other countries. One of the report's key recommendations is its call for a White Paper on the issue of citizenship. We should even go further and talk about a White Paper on multiculturalism and how people should be absorbed into our country. I read that Canada adopted multiculturalism into its constitution in 1988, as an ideal to be nurtured in terms of how to deal with migrant workers. That was a very important step. Given Ireland's history, where we have come from and the manner in which we were treated as citizens in other countries, from a moral viewpoint we must go down that road.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">I thank the other members of the committee for the great work they did and commend its Chairman, Deputy Deasy, for his idealism which brought the initiative forward in the first place. I recommend the report to the House.</p>

          <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_192">I join with Deputies Deasy and Andrews in saying it is timely to be discussing the report of the Joint Committee on European Affairs on migration in the same week in which Europe Day falls. I look forward to the question and answer session as regards some of the issues that have been raised in the context of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">We in Ireland have been full and enthusiastic participants in the European project right from the beginning. We have participated constructively in all of the major initiatives at European level, from economic and monetary union and the euro, to the opening of labour markets to new members of the European Union. Even though we are a small country in terms of scale, we have played an important part in the development of the EU, not least through the contribution our hosting of the EU Presidencies has made to making progress on key issues on the European agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">I welcome the fact the Joint Committee on European Affairs has made immigration part of its programme of work. I agree with the committee that immigration is a major issue for us and one on which we should focus. It represents a new challenge to Irish society. In many ways it is a sign of our success in growing the economy and creating jobs that our challenges have changed from emigration to inward migration. We have also experienced this significant inward migration in a relatively short period. A total of 9% of our workforce, or 170,000 workers, are foreign nationals. Other EU countries have similar proportions of foreign national workers but the difference is that in those countries these proportions were built up over a generation while we have reached this level within a couple of years. There is no doubt this provides us with challenges to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">Those from the EU-10 countries who joined the EU in May 2004 make up 3% of our workforce, or 62,000 workers. We know from Revenue data that the number of these nationals who have worked here at some time since May 2004 is greater — at about 135,000 — thus many of them will have worked here for a while before returning to their home countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">I agree with Deputies Deasy and Andrews that the decision by the Government to grant immediate free access to the labour market for nationals of the new member states from May 2004 was the correct one. In its recent study on economic migration, which was done in conjunction with Forfás, the expert skills group on future skills needs has identified key sectors of the economy that still remain problematic in terms of skills issues. Sometimes this gets masked in terms of the overall debate about displacement and other such matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">I do not say there are no issues to be addressed but we should focus on the fact that we still have significant shortages of people in information and communications technologies, health care, research and development and engineering. This poses a challenge to our education and training systems but, equally, highlights the ongoing need for a strong, properly managed economic migration policy. As Deputy Deasy stated, workers from these countries have been significantly contributing to our economic growth through a diverse range of activities and occupations. Many of them have been working in the construction sector in particular, and this has allowed us to address our infrastructural deficit more quickly than we would otherwise have been able to do. Many others have also been engaged in the manufacturing, catering and hospitality and agricultural sectors to the benefit of businesses and consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">As regards future accessions to the EU and our policy on labour market access for their nationals, in particular that of Romania and Bulgaria, the Government will take a decision in this regard before the accession of these countries and after consultation with the social partners, as has been agreed. As the Taoiseach stated, it is a pity the other member states across Europe have not opened their borders like Ireland, Sweden and the UK did at the outset. Deputy Andrews referred to this point also. Our decision on economic migration outside of the EU will be closely linked to labour market trends, which is defensible. It is important we would always have a clear linkage between economic migration and labour market trends.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">New arrangements for the labour market participation of workers from outside the European Economic Area will be put in place by the end of this year, after the Employment Permits Bill has been passed by the Oireachtas. I hope that will be done in the next couple of weeks. As part of these new arrangements, we will introduce a new green card system for workers from outside the European Economic Area for occupations where strategic high skills shortages exist which cannot be met from within the European Union. Under this system, green cards will be issued for two years initially and will normally provide a pathway to long-term or permanent residency and citizenship thereafter. This will help address the skills deficits which are likely to persist for some time in key sectors of the economy, particularly in the areas of information technology, health care and construction, and in the financial services, internationally traded services and pharmaceutical or biotechnology sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">In terms of the challenges before us, the integration of those who come from overseas is a major area of concern. Integration is a multidimensional process. I agree with the findings of the report of the joint committee that we need to deal with the economic and social issues which migration raises in a way that is joined up. The current response appears to be to create a Department to deal with particular problems that arise. I agree we need more co-ordination in the areas of housing, health and social welfare but we have expertise in existing Departments that deal very well with those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">My Department has teamed up with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to create a one-stop-shop facility in terms of work, residency and so forth for migrant workers. I would like to further explore the issue of co-ordination with committee members. We accept the matter must be addressed but I am not sure if it is necessary to create a new Department. For example, we could devise a similar model to that which was done in the area of children where a cross-cutting Minister of State was created.</p>

          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_204">I thank the Joint Committee on European Affairs and its Chairman, Deputy Deasy, for instigating this novel idea in the context of Europe Day. I congratulate all the committee members on the manner in which in they have organised such a ground-breaking new model for discussing an issue in the Dáil Chamber. The report is timely considering we have had two relevant items of legislation recently in the Oireachtas, namely the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Bill and the Employment Permits Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">Fine Gael has supported the liberal arrangements that have been brought forward by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure employers, but above all employees, have more discretion in regard to work permits and more opportunity to transfer from one place of employment to another. This proposed legislation is progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas and will, I hope, become law by 1 July. When enacted, those two Bills will be seen as a major step forward in providing measures that will integrate workers into the workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Migrant workers need considerable assistance in a number of areas, especially in terms of education. Irish people also need to be educated about the importance of migration. We have come a long way in economic terms, from a high level of unemployment to relatively low levels and many sectors of the economy require additional skills. In recent months it has come to the attention of those interested in enterprise matters that there are skills shortages in the areas of toolmaking, mechanics, nursing and the pharmaceutical sector. In all these areas, migration will make an important contribution to the Irish economy. We need additional workers. Recent figures released by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment show that the largest number of work permits are issued to people from South Africa, the Philippines and India. The type of skills shortages we have can be solved by people from the countries in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">One issue that has clouded the debate on migration in recent times has been the exploitation of workers from foreign countries. The Gama Construction workers from Turkey provide a perfect example which has been highlighted here on many occasions. The sorry debacle of the Irish Ferries dispute, which was brought about not by the foreign workers but by the employer involved, is disgraceful and highlights the fact that legislation on maritime law must be tightened not only at national but at European level to ensure workers are protected in this area as they are more open to exploitation than workers in other sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">The report before us makes a number of recommendations which include a network of drop-in centres for migrants and greater co-operation and co-ordination between the statutory bodies involved in inspection and enforcement of the range of legislation in place to protect workers' rights. I trust the Minister will bring forward new measures and regulations in due course arising from the partnership talks that will not only assist us in regard to the assimilation of migrant workers into our economy but will also contribute to removing some of the prejudice that has built up, particularly due to some union members in recent times in regard to the potential displacement of workers and their worries about employment standards. We want employment standards that are good for all workers, irrespective of whether they are Irish or from another jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">I commend the Polish Government which recently initiated a campaign to publicise the appropriate routes for finding jobs in Ireland and restricting the activities of unscrupulous and careless employment agencies. That model could be used by other member states, recent accession states or countries like Bulgaria or Romania that are seeking to gain access to the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">I raised the issue of the training of workers at another forum today. I am most concerned that workers from outside the EU arrive in this jurisdiction without being properly trained for work on construction sites in particular. There has been a significant increase in fatalities in the construction sector of 44% in 2005 over the 2004 figure. Employers have not taken responsibility for workers they know are not up to the job for which they have been employed and if workers do not have the necessary information and training, it is a form of exploitation. FÁS should provide migrant workers with basic training not only in the areas in which they work but also in English because language may be a barrier in providing the appropriate training, which is essential for all workers on sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Ireland is not properly prepared for migrants. It is clear the Government does not have an immigration policy but a policy is needed as soon as possible. I call on the Minister and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to address this as quickly as possible. Integration of migrant workers is essential to ensure the prejudices that arise through ignorance are eliminated. The debate on workers from applicant countries such as Romania, Bulgaria and Macedonia will come into play in the near future. These countries must fulfil economic and other criteria to prove they are fit to become Union members. However, as an enthusiastic member of the European project, the Fine Gael Party would like new applicant countries to be in position to join the Union as soon as possible rather than ensuring they are kept out of this important and successful project.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_165">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_212">I welcome the opportunity to contribute and it is appropriate we should debate this crucial aspect of European policy. In approaching this issue, it is important to recognise that the economic dimension is not the sole dimension. What is happening in regard to migration globally, at European level and nationally involves much more than the economy, as it also involves the movement of workers and their dependants. The Government does not intend to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Protection of All Migrant Workers and Their Families. The convention, which has been in place for a long time, has been signed up to by 34 countries but has been ratified by only two European countries, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Turkey. The reason the Government gives for not signing is that workers are entitled to other protections under the Constitution and other instruments signed by various Governments. The importance of the convention is that it recognises that migrant workers are more than labourers or economic entities. They are social entities with families and, accordingly, have rights, including that of family reunification.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">A long time ago when I researched migration, I found that Irish migration changed character several times from migration for a lifetime to north America to regular or circular migration to Britain with people coming and going all the time while leaving their families at home, which had clear implications for social policy. More elaborate models than the three suggested — multiculturalism, assimilation and exclusion — are needed and the appropriate model would have to handle circular migration. In today's conditions of immigration, the State needs to ensure all migrants are protected equally from a rights perspective as workers but a more comprehensive approach is needed for their dependants so that, for example, their children can learn the language and mix with children of the same age and older people can rejoin their families. Such an approach would be best structured on a rights basis. It is a mistake that Ireland and many other European countries are not moving towards ratification of the UN convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">The strength of the convention is that it establishes the responsibility of the international community through the UN to provide measures of protection. Over the past 25 years, the total number of migrants throughout the world has doubled but while we are concerned about the impact on economies and so forth, 40% of migrants are in the developed world with more than 60% of migrants in the developing world, comprising 49 million in Asia, 16 million in Africa and 6 million in the Latin America-Caribbean region. While the movement of people is an economic issue, it is also a people's issue. It is singularly inappropriate for Ireland to draw a distinction between such security the State will provide to workers earning more than a specified income and those earning less than it. The State is making arrangements from a simple and narrow economic perspective, which cuts across the broader rights-based approach favoured by the Global Commission on Migration and the UN and which is most appropriate to Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">It would be disingenuous to ignore, when considering the current literature on migration and the doubling of migrants in the past 25 years, that it has not been accompanied by favourable attitudes. In Europe, sometimes issues affecting migrants are mixed with refugee issues and so forth. The number of refugee applications to Ireland has reduced dramatically. However, these issues have resulted in a negative atmosphere in Europe and it is pointless suggesting otherwise. Migrants are affected by racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism, which are stronger now than 25 years ago. In addition, migrants are unequally affected by detention measures and other half-baked measures justified in the name of counter-terrorism. In every case, there is evidence that migrants and their families are more vulnerable than other population categories in the context of abuse and deprivation in housing, health and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">A proper understanding of migration as the movement of people is, therefore, needed to undo the fear attached to the receipt of people who have many sources of richness to offer us. Multiculturalism means those who move initially and their dependants who move subsequently are secure in their rights and can enjoy all the benefits of their host country.</p>

          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_217">I wish to share time with Deputies Cuffe and Ó Snodaigh.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this special day. Ireland was a country of emigration from the Great Famine in the 1840s until the early 1950s when the natural increase in population was offset by the population outflow. This was higher proportionately than in any other European country leading to a continuous decline in population for more than 100 years. Even after our accession to the EEC, Ireland's net immigration rate was insignificant. However, in the 1990s that began to change with the rate reaching 8%, the highest in the OECD. The unemployment rate in the early 1990s was 15% but the State is effectively operating at full employment now.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Immigration policy has been introduced on a piecemeal basis over the past 25 years. Ireland does not have a formal quota-based system, which uses country quotas or special immigration visas. Admission of immigrants has largely been controlled by employers with the onus on them to indicate the people they are bringing into the State have jobs. That led to difficulties because a number of employers retained the work permits. Can an audit be undertaken to determine the foreign worker needs of the agriculture and service industries? Could more effective co-ordination between Departments on immigration issues be achieved? We should address the possibility of a quota-based approach to certain countries to deal with the incidence of economic migration among asylum seekers.</p>

        <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_167">
          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_220">I wish the Cathaoirleach a belated happy Europe Day on behalf of the Green Party. I am sure he is aware that the Green Party is looking to join the European Movement, which I have championed for a long time. I remember in 1973 seeing graffiti on walls stating "EEC No", which was changed by some wag to "BBC No. 1". That reflected a wish among the plain people of Ireland to gain exposure to foreign media and culture. They also wished to share in the economic, social and environmental benefits of European membership.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">I welcome the interim report. I want to see its recommendations implemented without delay. It is similar to the Green Party's immigration policy which was launched in August 2005. However, I am concerned that the Government does not have a policy in that area. The committee was unable to trace responsibility among different Departments for the different aspects of immigration and integration. This <i>ad hoc</i> approach is very worrying and the Government should create a Minister of State for immigration, based in the Department of the Taoiseach. I was concerned that the Progressive Democrats Party representative, Deputy Sexton, blocked that recommendation on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">There is no comprehensive strategy to combat trafficking of women and girls into this country. Ireland is the only EU member state with no legislation that makes trafficking for sexual exploitation a criminal offence. Such legislation must be fast-tracked.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">Kennedy George is an immigrant who came from Sierra Leone. He has had to report to the Garda National Immigration Bureau 25 times in the past 18 months. Whatever we may say about Guantanamo Bay, this is psychological torture from our Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We must ensure that we are not subjecting this young man to psychological torture on an ongoing basis.</p>

The issue is about the large number of people who have come to Ireland from the new accession countries, which I support fully, as I support the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.

          <p eId="para_228">The decision on Bulgaria and Romania will be made following a decision of the EU to grant accession to these countries in the first instance. We will make a decision in the autumn, if the decision to allow accession goes ahead. We will consider it in the context of the labour market trends in our economy and the fact that a number of EU countries have still not granted access to new EU citizens to their labour markets. We will consult the social partners and Members of this House before coming to that decision. There is a provision in the Employment Permits Bill 2005, currently going through the Seanad, which will enable us to make a decision by regulation one way or the other.</p>

          <p eId="para_229">I welcome the initiative to have this focused debate in the Dáil on the European Union. I hope it will continue and that other states follow suit.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">It seems strange that 3% of our workforce — 62,000 — are from the ten accession countries, reflecting fewer than half the number that came to this country since 2004. That consists of less than a third of all non-nationals working in this country. There seems to be much circular migration on a very rapid basis. Will this factor influence the Government's decision in allowing Bulgarian and Romanian workers full access to the workplace? In his remarks yesterday, the Taoiseach was vague about supporting a particular date for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.</p>

          <p eId="para_231">The countries that have contributed most to circular migration are Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, with reduced numbers coming from the other accession states. Some of these people come here and then leave. There is a need for more data and information on this issue. The National Economic and Social Council is completing a major study on the management of migration in Ireland which takes on board the economic and social aspects of migration. My Department has been doing some work on the social side of migration and the NESC report will be completed in the next few weeks. We can use the report for further policy initiatives in the area of migration. As I pointed out to Deputy Mulcahy, the principal areas of consideration when making a decision on Bulgaria and Romania are labour market trends and the position of other EU states.</p>

          <p eId="para_233">Romanian and Bulgarian nationals can currently come to Ireland but have to apply for work permits. We could continue that arrangement and decide to give them preference over non-EEA nationals or issue work permits on the basis of job offers without the requirement to advertise with FÁS. A variety of options are available to us. We could decide to grant freedom of movement from January 2007, January 2009 or January 2012, with the comfort of a safeguard clause in the event of labour market disturbance, which would be negotiated with the Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">We have raised this issue at meetings and other member states are aware of Ireland's stance. The UK, Sweden and some other countries share our views. The immigration levels of many of these countries are similar to ours but we are different in terms of the rapidity by which migration to Ireland has increased. While we issued a mere 5,000 permits in 1999, we issued 50,000 by the end of 2003 and 165,000 by May 2004. By any objective benchmark, that is a significant level of immigration in a very short period of time. The issue now arises of managing immigration through integration and by developing sound policies on all fronts.</p>

The Minister alluded to this earlier but is he willing to take the matter further? The report strongly recommends that one Department should co-ordinate immigration matters. My party believes a Minister of State based within the Department of the Taoiseach should be given responsibility for immigration and ethnic affairs. Given that the report makes reference to the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, Arts, Sport and Tourism and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, would the Minister agree to the appointment of a Minister of State within the Department of the Taoiseach to facilitate co-ordination between these Departments in meeting the needs of this vulnerable group?</p>

Does the Minister agree that the huge changes which immigration has fostered in our society have given rise to challenges which need to be addressed as a priority? Does he agree with the recommendation of the committee that clear responsibility to support social and economic integration of immigrants should be given to one Government agency? That agency would be separate to Deputy Cuffe's proposal for a junior Minister because a Minister should also be appointed to deal with migration and related issues.

          <p eId="para_240">Will the Government revisit the issue of signing and ratifying the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families? According to the replies I have thus far received, the convention is being examined by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The reason given for not signing it is that protections already exist, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, but that is not quite the case. If families and dependants are able to accompany immigrants, migration patterns change from a circular movement to a more manageable system. The Human Rights Commission has strongly recommended that Ireland should give a lead in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">The convention was signed in 1990 and 34 states have since ratified it. However, a terrible impression is left by the fact that no EU member state has signed or ratified the convention.

These pressures are giving rise to prejudices and resentments which we are only beginning to measure. Against that background, has the Minister any intention of revisiting the social employment schemes and active labour market measures to enable those who are on the margin of the labour market to find the jobs they seek? By definition, immigrant workers are more hungry and tend to be more agile and better qualified.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">I concur with Deputy Ó Snodaigh that challenges exist in the area of social and economic integration which need to be urgently addressed, although we have already made significant progress in that area. While the legislation on work permits pertains to economic migration, it dovetails with the immigration and residence Bill which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform plans to bring before the House. This will mean there will be faster family reunification, which has strong social implications for the families and individuals concerned. Our <i>ad hoc</i> practices in this area were untenable, particularly when we were short of researchers in areas like nanotechnology. In one case a person’s family and children were not allowed in for months. We need to sharpen that up and this will be the impact of the Act. Deputy McDowell agrees with that. On the co-ordination question raised by Deputy Cuffe and the committee, it cannot all be solved by one agency. The Government is working with Ministers who have specific responsibilities in migration, for example significant advances have been made on education provision in terms of language and participation rates for children of immigrants. Deputy Michael Higgins raised the issue of the ratification of the UN Convention. I will have a more detailed look at that. Originally he said there were 34 signatories to ratification.</p>

          <p eId="para_253">Deputy Quinn raised the point about pressures on the indigenous markets and asked if we would look at the community employment schemes. We reformed those last year to try to facilitate the continuation of people on community employment programmes. I transferred the social economy scheme to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs with a view to seeing that as a social support which leads to the employment of people and recognising that it was there to support communities and not as a labour market intervention. Approximately 24,000 people are on CE schemes. Some counties report that they cannot fill the schemes. I was recently on the Inishowen Peninsula where the supervisors of CE schemes said they had difficulty getting people to participate.</p>

          <p eId="para_256">County Donegal has a live register of 7% and it is not the only county with high unemployment statistics. Across rural Ireland people ask that we keep the participants on the schemes longer because they cannot get new people to fill them. We are revisiting the CE scheme with FÁS. My one worry is for unskilled workers who may be vulnerable to globalisation and the shift of low-cost manufacturing outside the country. Their re-employability is an issue if we do not upskill. That is why we have allocated substantial resources to FÁS to move on the one-step-up initiative and to get people upskilled in the workplace. In-company training will be a significant part of that into the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">We must always be careful of the language we use, particularly on migration. Before the last general election the main political parties worked together to keep the lid on that situation. Deputy Quinn would have been involved in that. Life goes on and we must all work together despite temptation. Deputy Andrews asked two "haymakers" and I do not have time to deal with them in terms of my ultimate view of the European idea, the enlargement project and how far it can go. On the former, at times I wish Europe would better embrace some of the founding principles, such as the free market and opening up the internal market. There is an occasional outburst of economic nationalism when it affects some of the major players and this causes a lack of consistency. Member states should embrace the Lisbon Agenda more enthusiastically. Europe is not moving fast enough to respond to the profound transformation of the world in terms of competitiveness and globalisation. Europe tends to be too inward looking and this could undermine our future competitiveness. The enlargement project will continue to strengthen, which has benefits for Ireland, including political stability. As we are outward looking and export almost everything we produce, we depend on a liberal world market.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">Deputy Allen asked about workers' rights. The social partnership process will result in an enhancement of the compliance mechanisms at our disposal to ensure compliance with workers' rights. On EU accession by Bulgaria and Romania, the European Commission still has issues with both countries and has deferred judgment on whether they accede until autumn. On the financial limits raised by Deputy Lynch, my Department does not impose financial limits. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform deals with migration issues although as a result of the passage of the work permits legislation and the Immigration Bill we will have a more family-friendly policy on immigrants.</p>

          <p eId="para_263">Is cúis mhór áthais dom a bheith anseo agus an Bille an-tábhachtach seo a chur faoi bhráid na Dála. Tá mé ag súil go mbeidh díospóireacht iontach againn agus spéis mhór ag mórchuid na ndaoine ann.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The Bill amends the European Communities Act of 1972, enabling certain parts of the treaty, providing for the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union, to become part of the domestic law of this State as soon as Ireland ratifies the treaty. The content of this Bill is in line with earlier amendments of the European Communities Act 1972 through which provisions of previous EU treaties have been given domestic legal effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">The Bill may be short but it is significant. The forthcoming accession of Bulgaria and Romania, will mark the completion of the Union's fifth and by far its largest, most ambitious and most important enlargement to date. Ireland has been positively associated with this process from its inception to its completion. Shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the communist regimes in central and eastern Europe, a special meeting of the European Council was convened in Dublin in April 1990 during the Irish Presidency. At that time, it was decided to enter into agreements with the emerging democracies in those countries. This marked the first step along a path, that has led to their EU membership.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">It was a source of great pride to us that, almost 15 years later, Ireland hosted the Day of Welcomes for the ten new members states who joined the Union on 1 May 2004. This was a defining moment in the history of the Union. It was a day that will live long in the memory. However, work remained to be done. Under the Irish Presidency, accession negotiations were significantly advanced with Romania and provisionally closed with Bulgaria. So it was that Ireland assumed a lead role in completing the historic fifth enlargement.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">On 13 April 2005, the accession treaty for Bulgaria and Romania was approved by the European Parliament. The treaty was later signed by Ireland, our fellow member states and the acceding countries on 25 April 2005. The passage of the Bill before the House is one of two necessary steps towards Ireland's ratification of the treaty. The House has been requested to pass a motion approving the terms of the treaty. This was referred to the Dáil select committee yesterday. Ireland's formal ratification can proceed when these two steps have been completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">To enter into force, the treaty must be ratified by Bulgaria and Romania and by all the current EU member states by 31 December 2006. The Bulgarian and Romanian parliaments ratified the treaty in May 2005 and, since then, 14 member states have ratified it. Those yet to ratify have confirmed that they will complete the process in good time. It is important that Ireland should keep pace with our EU partners in ratifying the accession treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">As member states move to fulfil their obligations under the accession treaty, important work remains to be done in the two acceding countries. Today's debate comes at a crucial time for both Bulgaria and Romania. Their accession to the European Union is not in doubt and our objective is to welcome both countries as members on 1 January 2007. However, under the terms of the accession treaty, the Union could postpone the accession for one or both countries for up to a year if either is not ready to meet the requirements of membership in 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">A decision on the date of accession will be taken by the European Council on the basis of a recommendation from the European Commission. Its decision will be based upon the findings in the European Commission's comprehensive monitoring reports which will become available for both Bulgaria and Romania on Tuesday next. These reports will provide an objective assessment of the progress made by them and will identify any remaining shortcomings and obstacles to their early membership of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">On 3 April last, the Enlargement Commissioner, Mr. Olli Rehn, presented a preliminary assessment to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the European Parliament. At that time, he noted that many positive developments had taken place in both countries since the Commission's last reports in October 2005. He commended both countries on their achievements so far as part of their democratic and economic transformation. However, he indicated that the forthcoming monitoring report would focus on some important areas where further reform is still required.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">In particular, significant progress will need to be made in judicial reform and the fight against corruption. In Romania, the focus in these areas is very much on consolidating the steps already taken and ensuring that the pace of implementation is maintained. On Bulgaria, Commissioner Rehn noted that judicial accountability, efficiency and transparency needed to be enhanced. The structures supporting the fight against corruption and organised crime are seen as being in need of further reinforcement. The adoption, however, of important constitutional amendments in late March and of a new penal procedural code on 29 April represent encouraging steps. These positive developments will require solid implementation leading to tangible results in the months before accession.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">Commissioner Rehn touched on other issues of common concern in respect of both countries. Bulgaria and Romania both need to continue their efforts to combat the trafficking of human beings and to step up the integration of minorities. They must ensure that their administrative structures can cope with EU Structural and Cohesion Funds and they need to address some outstanding concerns in the field of agriculture. Most crucially, however, Commissioner Rehn emphasised that the target of accession in 2007 remains achievable for both Bulgaria and Romania so long as the necessary reforms are completed and implemented. Both countries are clearly committed to maintaining the pace of reform and they are being encouraged to make full use of the time available to them to address those issues highlighted by the Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">As the date of accession approaches, it is easy to focus only on what remains to be done. However, one should never lose sight of what has already been achieved by these countries. The task of negotiating and agreeing the terms of membership has been a mammoth one. It involved alignment with tens of thousands of pages of EU legislation. In the process, Bulgaria and Romania were required to make difficult economic choices and brave political decisions. The transition in both countries from the oppressive and corrupt regimes of the communist era to the functioning democracies they are today has been nothing short of spectacular. The speed and conviction with which this has been achieved is a reflection of the commitment in both countries to the values and ideals shared by all member states. The prospect of EU membership has been a major driver of political and economic change. In the course of the accession negotiations and in the intervening period, Bulgaria and Romania have emphatically shown that their true place lies within the European Union. They have been attending all EU meetings for more than a year now and contributing to debates at all levels. They are, in practice, already very much part of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Their comparatively rapid transition, reflects positively on the Union's enlargement strategy. It must be doubted whether their advancement would have been quite as rapid or as profound without the lure of EU membership. Throughout the process, the EU has worked closely with them, measuring their efforts against the exacting conditions of membership. For our part, Ireland carefully monitored the entire process, especially the conduct of the accession negotiations in policy areas of particular significance to us such as agriculture, regional policy and institutional questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Ireland has taken a constructive approach to helping both countries with their preparations for EU membership. As major beneficiaries of the first EU enlargement, we have had much experience to share with our future EU partners, especially in areas such as ensuring the optimum use of Structural and Cohesion Funds. The Government has allocated over €1 million annually for the provision of training and assistance to the candidate and acceding states. This has been money well spent. Our accession training programme has provided real benefits to the beneficiary countries and has proved to be an effective way of building up new contacts which will serve to benefit both sides when we work together as full partners within the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">As both Bulgaria and Romania have progressed towards membership, our bilateral relations with them have deepened considerably. New embassies were opened in Sofia and Bucharest last year and we have seen notable increases in bilateral trade in recent years. These may be relatively less developed countries but both have considerable growth potential. For example, trade with Romania increased from less than €5 million in 1992 to over €175 million last year. Trade with Bulgaria has multiplied more than eightfold since 1994. Last year alone, trade with Romania increased by 75%, while trade with Bulgaria showed an 11% rise. The number of Irish tourists travelling to Bulgaria doubled in 2005 and that trend is set to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">As can be seen from these figures, we are learning to engage more fully with two countries with which our traditional links have been very modest. There is clearly considerable scope for further mutually beneficial interaction with them in the future. I would expect them to grow in importance as economic partners for Ireland once they settle into the EU and begin to reap the benefits of membership.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">Although the fifth enlargement has pushed Europe's geographical boundaries further from us, we are satisfied that our economy possesses the strength and vigour to take full advantage of the opportunities provided by a Union of 27 member states. Moreover, a stable and unified Europe is in our best interests. The spread of characteristic EU values and standards throughout Europe is a major achievement and is something from which Ireland manifestly benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">The free movement of workers has proven to be one of the most sensitive issues surrounding the fifth enlargement of the Union. In 2004, most of the EU-15 chose to maintain restrictions on workers from the ten new member states. Ireland was one of only three countries to fully open its labour market to the EU-10, with Sweden and the United Kingdom. It is a pity that more countries did not follow Ireland's lead in this respect. We are proud of our positive attitude and of the success that has been achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">As a result of Ireland's decision to facilitate the free movement of workers, the number of nationals working in Ireland from the EU-10 rose dramatically to reach an estimated 2% of the working age population in 2005. While this has been a novel experience for Ireland, as we have no history of inward migration on this scale, the effects have been positive for the most part. In particular, there has been little or no negative impact on unemployment, which remains at a historically low level. The availability of workers from the new member states has helped our economy to sustain strong growth rates. Concerns have been expressed about possible exploitation of migrant workers and there is unanimous agreement that such abuses must not be tolerated.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Earlier this year, the European Commission published a report on the functioning of the European labour market following the accession of the ten new member states. It showed that labour mobility is conditioned not so much by the restrictions put in place by governments but by the demand for labour in the receiving states. In other words, workers from the new member states come to Ireland because there are jobs available and not because there is no requirement for them to have a work permit. In light of the Commission's findings, it is disappointing that only four other countries have chosen to join Ireland in fully opening up their labour markets from 1 May last. I hope the remaining member states will decide to follow suit before too long.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">The European Commission has observed that Ireland, Sweden and the UK have experienced better employment performance than those who maintained restrictions. Our decision in 2004 to open up our labour market was taken on the basis of a combination of practical and moral considerations. Our economy needed an increased workforce, but we also felt a need to be supportive of people who had experienced many decades of economic and political hardship. We could clearly remember a time when Ireland was a less fortunate place than it is today, a time when emigration cast a sombre shadow over Irish society.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">While Ireland took a decision to facilitate the free movement of workers in 2004, I wish to make it plain that the Bill before the Dáil today does not prejudge Ireland's decision on whether to allow Bulgarian and Romanian workers to enter our labour market without work permits. This decision will be taken closer to the date of accession and will be based on full consideration of all the relevant issues. The prevailing labour market conditions and the intentions of our fellow member states will be among the factors to be taken into consideration when arriving at this decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">It is sometimes argued that the Union's post-Cold War enlargement, of which the accession of Bulgaria and Romania forms part, has been achieved at the expense of the Union's coherence and against the interests of its existing members. This is not the case. Last week, the European Commission presented a paper to the Council entitled, Enlargement, two years after — an Economic Success, which sets aside the political-strategic dimension of the last enlargement and focuses on its economic impact. Overall, the paper shows that the recent enlargement has created the conditions for the whole European economy to become stronger and more dynamic. Europe's strength as a trading bloc has been increased and it is now better equipped to face stiffening global competition. There has been steady economic growth and a significant increase in trade. The emerging market economies have added new vitality to the financial sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">The paper also addresses the fears commonly held in the EU-15 that companies would choose to relocate to the new member states in search of more competitive labour. The Commission's paper concludes that while there has been a substantial increase in investment from the EU-15 in the new member states, this has largely occurred in the context of privatisation programmes and new, fast-growing markets which are being serviced as a result of new opportunities. It has not to any great extent involved the transfer of activities previously carried out in the home country.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">Moreover, it appears to be the case that the labour market skills in the new member states broadly complement those of the EU-15. As a result, the outsourcing of parts of the production process to the new member states has often allowed firms in the EU-15 to strengthen their competitive edge, resulting in a net favourable impact on employment. Recent research in the EU-15 has indicated that relocation to the east has accounted for less than 2% of the overall annual job turnover.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">It is clear that the fifth enlargement has brought new economic dynamism into the European Union. By and large, the economies of the new member states are growing more robustly than those of the EU-15. Average GDP <i>per capita</i> in the EU-10 has grown from 44% of the EU-15 level in 1997 to 50% in 2005. The EU-10 have very open economies in which trade represents 93% of GDP, compared to the EU-15 average of 55%. Nevertheless, the EU-15 continue to run a large trade surplus with the EU-10. A number of the new member states are already planning to join the euro in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Last year, the prophets of doom had a field day at the expense of the European Union. First, there was the rejection of the EU constitution in France and the Netherlands and then the June European Council failed to agree the Union's budget for 2007-13. It was gleefully argued by some that a Union of 25 had overstretched itself fatally and was destined for institutional paralysis and, possibly, ultimate dissolution. Enlargement was widely seen as the culprit on both fronts.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Happily, the Union's horizons have brightened considerably in the interim and the challenge of enlargement can now be seen in a more positive light. In December last, the European Council agreed a budgetary package amounting to €860 billion over a seven-year period. This means that the enlarged Union now has the budgetary resources to support its key policies, notably in agriculture and economic and social cohesion which will benefit the new member states. This will afford them the opportunities from which Ireland has profited so richly during the past three decades of our EU membership. The EU's 2004 enlargement represented a win-win situation in which the enlarged Union is a stronger Union. I expect the accession of Bulgaria and Romania ultimately to strengthen us also.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">Any discussion of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania inevitably raises broader issues about EU enlargement. Ireland is in an ideal position from which to survey the pros and cons of enlargement. After all, we were part of the EU's first intake in 1973 and have witnessed several subsequent stages as the Union extended itself successively to the south, the north and the east.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">When Ireland joined the European Community in 1973, it was the poorest Community country and among the least developed in Western Europe. Many Europeans at the time saw Ireland as an odd man out and an outpost of economic under-achievement in a Union of wealthy, advanced societies. At home it was argued that we would be structurally incapable of living with the competition from our highly developed neighbours. In 1972, the common sense of a great mass of people dismissed the scare stories of the pessimists, who favoured isolation over active engagement, with more than 80% voting "Yes" for EC membership.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">At that time it was suggested that Irish culture was doomed to extinction. How could the seemingly fragile plants of our distinctive traditions in music, literature and art survive the relentless European forces to which they would be subjected? More than three decades later, our culture has never been more vibrant. From 2007 onwards, Irish will become an official and working language of the European Union. By embracing the values of the wider world, we have grown in confidence and national stature. Our writers, musicians, dancers and artists play to a global audience and combine critical acclaim with popular success. It is clear, on reflection, that the pessimists sorely underestimated the ability of the people to cope with what Europe had to offer. They were, however, correct in one sense in that they predicted that Ireland would be transformed beyond anyone's wildest imaginings, which has been the case. Even those who most ardently supported the European project could hardly have dared hope that Ireland would, in a little more than three decades, become the vibrant, prosperous, future-oriented place it is today. This is the destiny to which the peoples of Bulgaria and Romania rightly aspire with our full support.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">It is not my purpose to pretend that everything in the intervening period has been plain sailing. Few, however, could doubt that joining the EC has provided an indispensable framework for Ireland's emergence as a successful modern European economy. Membership will act in a similar manner as a catalyst for Bulgaria and Romania in their future development. While Ireland's record within the EU has been an undoubted success story, it is just part of a wider European achievement. Despite the setbacks surrounding the ratification of the EU Constitution, today's EU is a very different entity from the one Ireland joined in 1973. It has an internal market in which goods and services flow freely and the euro is a well established currency shared by 12 EU countries, with more to join in the coming years. Perhaps, most significantly, the Union has 25 members, including countries that were still military dictatorships or communist autocracies only a generation ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">EU enlargement, therefore, has transformed the Union and has helped to transform Europe. In the process, Europe has become a much better place in which to live than it ever could have been during the dark years of the Cold War or in the heyday of Franco, Salazar and the Greek colonels. While Europe has experienced more recent traumas in the Balkans, these are also being addressed actively and the EU is playing a significant role in promoting peace and stability in the region. As it has developed and expanded, the Union has become increasingly respected as a force for peace, security and prosperity in Europe and throughout the world. The desire of many of our neighbours to join is a testimony to the success of a great visionary experiment that evolved from such modest beginnings in the 1950s. Meanwhile, its critics have oscillated between, on the one hand, deriding the notion of greater European unity as hopelessly utopian and, on the other, sounding the alarm about sinister plots to deprive Europeans of their sovereign rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">As we complete the Union's fifth enlargement, it is critical that we show the same faith in the future of Europe as earlier generations. It is imperative that we do not become disheartened by the inevitable setbacks that crop up from time to time. It is in the nature of things that periods of optimism and progress will be interspersed with moments of doubt and stagnation. We are living in the aftermath of last year's negative referendum results in both France and the Netherlands. While fears about enlargement were a contributory factor in these results, we should resist the temptation of ascribing the outcome solely to that factor. The question of enlargement is a sideshow in the bigger picture of the challenges that confront Europe in the period ahead. The global scene is undergoing a period of rapid change. Europe needs to face up to a range of issues, including the threat of terrorism, the energy crisis, the dangers of climate change, the aging of Europe's population and the dramatic rise of new economic powerhouses such as China, India and Brazil. Consideration of enlargement needs to be viewed against this more expansive backdrop.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">The five previous enlargements have, in their turn, given the Union a new energy and a renewed ability to deal purposefully with changing agendas and emerging challenges. Each enlargement has increased its global weight. This needs to be borne in mind when we look to the future. Those who imagine that we can retreat to the certainties of a mythical past are sorely mistaken. We cannot rely on past glories and must deal with the realities that lie ahead. The Union is part of the solution to Europe's needs and a failure by the EU to come to terms with the dynamics transforming the world economy could result in increasing marginalisation. We must be careful that our horizons are not obscured by excessive navel-gazing and undue negativity. Europe's future is there to be shaped and there are important arguments to be won.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">With the completion of the Union's fifth enlargement, our minds inevitably turn towards Europe's outstanding commitments. Accession negotiations have opened with Croatia while the other countries of the western Balkans have the prospect of eventual EU membership, although this is still a long way off. Negotiations are also under way with Turkey, although it may take a decade or more for them to meet all the criteria for membership. It is natural that doubts should arise about enlargement. Much work needs to be done before new members can be accommodated following the accession of Bulgaria and Romania. In the meantime, the Union needs to prove its worth and offer EU citizens a clear strategy for future enlargement. If Union membership is to be further extended, it will need to acquire the economic, political and institutional wherewithal to make this possible. The public will have to be convinced that a further expansion of membership will bring benefits akin to those generated by previous enlargements.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">The careful preparation of the Union's most recent enlargement was a key factor in its success. As a result, the EU's most ambitious and symbolic enlargement was also its best prepared. The "big bang" did not result in a catastrophic crash. There is an important lesson in this, as we turn our minds towards the Union's future strategy. Concerns about the functioning of the institutions, worries about the Internal Market and fears about the Union's budget have been part and parcel of every enlargement process. Each time the EU has confounded its detractors and learned to succeed with a larger number of members. The original design for Europe was a Union of six members. As far back as 2001, with the launch of the European Convention, it was recognised that an enlarged Union would need to adjust its workings to ensure it could continue to function effectively. The European constitution was a product of an open, transparent and inclusive negotiating process and it provided for carefully calibrated reforms, designed to meet the demands and needs of an expanded Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">The House will be more than familiar with this Government's position on the EU constitution. The provisions of the European constitution represent the best option for creating a more efficient and effective Union capable of meeting the challenges of enlargement and a rapidly changing world. It offers a blueprint for a Union, with structures updated to take account of its increased membership. No alternative proposal could come close to commanding the unanimous support of all member states. In this connection, I warmly welcome yesterday's ratification of the constitution by Estonia. It became the fifteenth member state to complete the ratification process and it was highly appropriate that it chose to do so on Europe Day. With regard to enlargement, the Union will need to reconcile the misgivings that clearly exist with its obligation to honour existing commitments and to take account of its obligations towards its fellow Europeans.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">There is much to debate. Ireland has profited from enlargement and we have been consistent in our support for all those wishing to accede to the Union. The Government recognises the opportunities of membership and believes these should be extended to others. Our immediate concern is to complete the fifth enlargement and to welcome two new members to the Union. We have an obligation to ratify the accession treaty by the end of this year and this deadline applies regardless of whether the date of accession is 1 January 2007 or a year later. The Bill will enable Ireland to ratify the treaty and will help to pave the way for a Union of 27 member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">Bulgaria and Romania suffered greatly as a consequence of Europe's past divisions. It is completely fitting that they should become Members of the European Union. Their accession will complete the Union's post-Cold War enlargement and this represents a major historic achievement for Europe, one in which Ireland has played a proud role, especially during its 2004 Presidency. The time has come to welcome them back into the European family where they belong. In the years ahead, I am confident they will benefit from membership and contribute to the Union, as Ireland has done for the past 33 years. I am also confident both Bulgaria and Romania will enhance the European Union in the years ahead.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardAllen" eId="spk_199">
          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_303">As a representative of a pro-European and pro-enlargement party, I fully support the provisions in this Bill. When we deal with this Bill, we must look at the background and its context. The referenda in France and in the Netherlands were a shock to the system. However, the results represented a warning signal that we could not take the people of Europe for granted. It was rightly decided to have a period of reflection, but I wonder whether we are reaching out to those people who have worries about the future of Europe and the direction it is taking. We should not have a smug attitude. We should not lecture people on how good we are doing in Europe. We should listen to their concerns and deal with them as they arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">It is not a matter of glossy magazines, brochures or a single information campaign. We must convince European citizens that the issues we confront on their behalf will improve their quality of life and their standard of living. We must turn the European Union into a more democratic framework, ready to communicate with citizens and to deal with them in a realistic way, rather than in a patronising manner. Events of recent months have improved things and some of the decisions made relating to the EU budget, to European technology and to energy policy show that the European Union is on track despite the reversals. However, there is still a problem of communication and democracy. During the reflection period, we must listen to our citizens, our social partners, all of the political parties — irrespective of their opinions about Europe — the national Parliament and the local authorities, without prejudging the outcome of the dialogue and the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">Listening to the people I represent in Cork, I hear many things that concern me. If we had held a referendum in the past six months, I am not too sure that we would not have reached the same decision as that of the French and the Dutch. There are issues that worry people at the moment, such as the loss of industrial jobs on a weekly basis. People are equating that loss with a move of industry from the west to the east in the new Europe. It is not relevant whether people are right; we need to address their worries. The farming community, rightly or wrongly, believes that Europe is eroding its livelihood through the nitrates directive and other directives. People also question the ability of the EU to absorb enlargement to 25 and 27 states. I was in Macedonia a few weeks ago with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the people there feel it is only a matter of having an election in July and they will then be on board for further enlargement. The issue of Turkey will also be very difficult. People have concerns and the worst thing to do is to lecture them. We must listen and deal with those fears, explaining that such fears are groundless.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">This Bill which amends the European Communities Act 1972 to allow for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union, is important. These two countries have been moving ever closer to membership of our Union in recent years, and have been taking steps to ensure that they will be ready to assume the responsibilities of membership when the time comes. This enlargement follows the historic enlargement which took place on 1 May 2004, when ten new member states joined the European Union. Recent reports from the European Commission indicated that the economic benefits that have accrued to these member states through their membership of the Union have also been echoed in other states such as Ireland. These reports confirm that the decision to allow the citizens from the ten member states the freedom to travel to work in Ireland has paid dividends to both Ireland and to these new member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Fine Gael has always been a pro-European and pro-enlargement party. The enlargement of the European Union offers Ireland, as well as all EU member states, considerable opportunities. By spreading the economic prosperity and stability of the EU throughout Europe more widely, the continued stability and growth from which we have benefited can be enhanced and maintained. Without any shadow of a doubt, Ireland has benefited hugely from membership of the European Union, economically, socially, and politically. Ireland's membership of a common market for goods and services has been critical in our recent successes, and following the last EU enlargement Irish exporters have had open access to new markets in ten European countries, allowing access to tens of millions of consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">Our membership of the Single Market has been the main factor in encouraging foreign direct investment — notably from the United States — upon which the Celtic tiger was founded. We have less than 1% of the EU population yet a quarter of all American investment in the EU is in Ireland. Those firms would not be in Ireland if it was not a part of the EU. Ireland's exports of goods and services amount to approximately 90% of GDP, a high proportion by international standards. The EU Single Market has allowed our export trade to grow and to diversify. It has weakened the traditional over-dependence upon a small number of markets which hampered growth so much in the past. In January 2006, Irish exports were worth more than €7 billion. This amounted to an increase of more than €700 million since January 2005. The value of Irish exports to a number of the newer EU member states showed strong growth over that 12 month period, especially to the Czech Republic and to Poland. The enlargement of the European Union enlarges the Single Market area. As a nation heavily reliant upon export markets, this is good news for Ireland as long as we seize the opportunities that enlargement presents.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">Ireland's membership of the European Union is about much more than simple economics. Citizens of all member states continue to benefit from membership. The EU has been successful as a guarantor of rights and freedoms and we possess rights as EU citizens as well as Irish citizens. Irish people have not only benefited from the freedom to travel, work, reside and use a single currency throughout the EU, but also from recognition of their qualifications by other member states. Ireland's membership of the EU has helped us to challenge the inequalities that were endemic to our society. The principle that we are all equal, regardless of sex, has been advanced. The EU continues to bring forward equality directives designed to combat discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">Ireland's membership of the EU has also helped us to realise our environment must be protected and that economic development can no longer equal environmental destruction. Substantial Structural and Cohesion Funds have helped to finance investment in infrastructure, education and training and in the production sector. EU reforms in areas such as deregulation have transformed the marketplace by helping to expand our economy and increase the value of our exports. These are tangible benefits which affect all of us on a daily basis and we should be aware of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">When considering the course Ireland should take with regard to the European Union in future referenda, our citizens should consider these real benefits in making decisions on future treaties. Public benefits from Ireland's membership of the EU have not automatically accrued overnight. These benefits flow from the adoption of European treaties and the transposition of directives into Irish law. Unfortunately, the Irish Government lags behind other member states in this area. For example, the latest edition of the Internal Market scoreboard, a report which rates the speed at which EU member states implement Internal Market directives, ranks Ireland an unimpressive 19th for compliance out of the 25 EU member states.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardAllen" eId="spk_203">
          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_315">The Minister of State should not raise matters of history. We are looking to the future. Ireland is one of eight EU member states that have not met the targets they were set for the implementation of Internal Market directives and faces 51 separate legal cases arising from its failure to adopt legislation in this important area. Over the second half of 2005, the Government's performance in the implementation of Internal Market directives deteriorated and Ireland was specifically called upon to take steps to address this unacceptable situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">Irish people are losing out because of the Government's lackadaisical approach to EU directives. Some directives are long overdue for transposition, including directives pertaining to health and safety requirements — an issue which only yesterday brought people onto the streets of Dublin — engine pollution and emissions, as well as directives which could drive down the price of gas and electricity for consumers. At a time when energy prices are increasing, these directives should be transposed quickly and effectively. The delays must be addressed and the problem acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">We should also recognise that the European constitution will deliver benefits for Ireland and other EU member states. Enhancing the role of national parliaments in the European decision making process makes sense and the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights as a key European treaty is welcome. The Minister of State should clarify the current position and indicate whether he is confident that a way through the current impasse can be found.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Returning to the question of enlargement, Romania and Bulgaria are the next states to join the EU. It is clear these countries, as with all applicant countries, must meet the criteria for entry. These criteria, commonly referred to as the Copenhagen criteria, stress that applicant countries must meet three key requirements before membership can be extended. Applicant countries must demonstrate that they have a functioning market economy, that the rule of democracy and respect for human rights and the rights of minorities is upheld and that they can meet the legislative standards and requirements put on all members of the EU. These three criteria are vitally important and must be applied equally and fairly in all cases. Reports suggest that the European Commissioner for Enlargement, Mr. Olli Rehn, may delay until autumn his announcement regarding the timeframe for accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the EU. I acknowledge the considerable work that has been done by both countries to prepare for membership but the Commissioner's concerns regarding the strength of organised crime and reform of the judiciary in Bulgaria will have to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Last week, members of the Joint Committee on European Affairs had the pleasure of meeting the ambassador from Bulgaria, Mrs. Benisheva, who outlined her view of the situation. Some members raised concerns about aspects of Mrs. Benisheva's presentation and questioned her on issues such as the rights of minorities and the independence of the judiciary. I inquired about the regulations in place to govern the operations of banks and financial institutions in the context of the allegations of money laundering which had been made last year. I also raised concerns about a number of outdated nuclear installations which need to be safely decommissioned but I did not receive a clear response on that from Mrs. Benisheva. As the EU may be forced to inherit the enormous cost of decommissioning the installations, I would like to have that matter followed up because, although my concerns may be found to be groundless, they were not addressed by the ambassador. However, I compliment her on the clarity she brought to other aspects of her contribution and hope we can say "yes" to Bulgaria and Romania at the earliest possible date.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">I missed the Romanian ambassador's presentation, as I was discussing related matters in Macedonia when she attended the Joint Committee on European Affairs. The attitude in Macedonia is that, if the country holds an open and democratic election in July and addresses its ethnic divisions in a democratic manner, its path to membership is all but assured. I would welcome a country such as Macedonia if it passes the litmus test for entry. It is a small and historic nation which has been torn by ethnic tensions over the years and has suffered a great deal from the economic embargo recently imposed by Greece but its people are full of hope and ambition. They have crossed hurdles such as an earthquake in 1963 which levelled the capital, Skopje. I hope the Bulgaria-Romania expansion and Macedonia's application will be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">The western Balkans must be addressed. The question is whether one should balance the problems that enlargement will have for the structural absorption factors against peace and stability in the Balkans. Once Croatia can deal with the issues raised and has dealt with the war criminal, it would be in our long-term interest to deal with that. We must lead and bring our people with us and convince them that an expanded, strong European Union is in their interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">As I said about Bulgaria and Romania, membership brings responsibilities to the European Union and to the citizens of all member states. We are focused on the steps being taken in prospective member states such as Bulgaria and Romania in their moves to meet the criteria for entry but are not as critical of our own responsibilities. For example, the Irish Government has allowed Ireland to be the only EU member state in which human trafficking is not a crime. We saw "Prime Time" on Monday night and one question that occurred to me was how young people from a non-EU state, targets for the sex trade and victims of human trafficking, got through the security and passport controls at the boundaries of the State. I would like to see the status and definition of human trafficking as a criminal act addressed in our legislation. Failing to categorise it as a crime is an abdication of our responsibilities to women here, in all member states and outside the EU. While there are proposals for all sorts of legislation, this is one of the most basic. It is not Deputy Treacy's responsibility. However, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who seems to have an answer to everything, should have an answer to this most basic principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">A decision must be made on the level of free movement granted by individual member states to the citizens of Bulgaria and Romania upon accession. I stated earlier, and recent reports from the European Commission confirm, that the move to allow citizens of the ten accession States freedom to work and live in Ireland brought with it considerable benefits, for us and for them. That was outlined in the good document on migration that we discussed earlier, albeit over a limited period. I remain disappointed, however, that other EU member states still retain work restrictions for people from these states and I acknowledge that this situation will have to be considered by Ireland when it reaches its decision later this year. Can the Minister clarify when the decision will be taken whether to allow citizens of Romania and Bulgaria the freedom to work in Ireland and what that decision is likely to be? One of the concepts we must impress on some of the stronger states in the EU is that they have responsibilities to abide by the fundamental principles of the EU: they are, the right to work and the freedom to move from state to state. We have adhered to our responsibilities and I hope we can continue to do so in the context of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria. I would like the Minister to address that in more detail in his response.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_204">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_324">I, too, welcome and fully support the Bill. I noted the Minister's upbeat, stirring and rhetorical remarks. He is positive towards Europe. Many of us who were previously Euro-sceptics have seen the significant benefits of EU membership for Irish citizens, producing a better quality of life and economy and general improvements for the country. That must be acknowledged and should be the context in which we examine the contents of this legislation in which we propose to ratify the accession treaty to begin the statutory process to allow Bulgaria and Romania access to the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">EU membership has been enormously beneficial for Ireland. It provided Ireland for the first time in its history with a secure and diverse market which allowed an island nation, which had to export to survive, to get prices that reflected the real value of its products. It provided structural and social funding, which underwrote many of our training and education programmes. It gave women equality in the workplace and before the law. The recent difficulties on the Nice treaty and the proposed constitution reflect not dissatisfaction with Ireland's membership of the EU but concerns among our citizens that the European project lacked transparency and accountability in its decision making, that it was becoming over bureaucratic in its structures and was not providing sufficient information to the citizens. The present "period of reflection" is important, and the national forum on Europe, an Irish invention, is doing sterling work bringing the European issues to people throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Romania and Bulgaria await entry to the EU in 2007 and today we, as member states, are taking the first statutory step towards ratification of that accession. There should be no delay in granting that accession next year as the logical extension to the ten member states that joined in 2004 when Ireland held the presidency of the EU. The period of reflection should continue and all member states should establish the equivalent of our national forum on Europe, so that when the European movement advances again, it has a well-informed membership whose fears have been allayed and who are confident that the democratic deficit has been redressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Concern has been expressed that the European Commission is trying to delay the entry on 1 January next year. Speaking in the European Parliament yesterday the president of the Party of European Socialists said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_328">Bulgaria and Romania should enter the European Union in 2007 and I am concerned by claims circulating in Brussels that Bulgaria might not make it. Bulgaria must not become the victim of a right-wing anti-enlargement backlash. It would be grossly unfair on the new Bulgarian Government, led by Sergei Stanichev, which has passed a remarkable 60 laws in the eight months that it has been in office. A rejection or delay for Bulgaria would merely fuel the vicious anti-EU, anti-foreigner, anti-minority campaigns led by the populist Attaka. Bulgaria is the Balkan success story achieving stability and economic growth in an unstable region, now largely in need of massive reconstruction. Both countries have made remarkable progress [Bulgaria and Romania] and both have more progress to make. They are both more likely to make that progress within the European Union than being pushed back out of it. So I expect the Commission to give the green light to both countries to become EU members from 1 January 2007. Any post-accession monitoring or safeguard clauses must be based on further evaluation in the coming months and be agreed at the Council meeting in December and in talks with Romania and Bulgaria. I say the European Union must say "come inside" to Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">That reflects my views. Bulgaria has made significant progress in a short space of time, particularly with its new government, and it would be a shame if it were not allowed to join at the same time as Romania. This process is essentially an extension of the one that led to the accession of ten countries on 1 May 2004. The fifth enlargement process should be completed in 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">Commissioner Olli Rehn, to whom the Minister of State referred, completed his report on enlargement in 2006 and acknowledged that both Romania and Bulgaria had achieved quite a lot. He stated Romania has made progress in the fight against corruption and that reform of the judicial system is at an advanced stage. Non-governmental organisations acknowledge that much has been achieved in the area of child protection and rights for the disabled. Mr. Rehn also stated that while there are still problems in Bulgaria, it is clear that progress has been made in the area of human trafficking. As we have heard, both countries have problems with human trafficking. Mr. Rehn concluded as follows: "We all win as the citizens in the new Member States see their standards of living increasing."</p>
          <p eId="para_331">When Bulgaria and Romania join the Union — I hope it will be in 2007 — the Union will have a population of approximately 484 million, 30 million more than it has now. It will also increase its membership to 27 and add two more official languages, namely, Bulgarian and Romanian. The Bulgarian language will be the first official language of the European Union to be written in Cyrillic script. This is another first for the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">Let me list the main advantages of enlargement, which the Commission presented in its report of April of this year. The newcomers will accrue an increasing number of benefits from EU regional aid, which totalled €28 billion over the past 15 years and which is bound to soar thanks to the recently approved EU budget for 2007-13. This will be a major boost to the economies of both countries. The existing members of the Union will continue to benefit from the large surpluses in trade with the newcomers and the latter will easily finance the resulting current account gap by foreign direct investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">The Minister of State referred to the increase in trade between Ireland and Romania in recent years. It amounted to less than €5 million in 1992 and to over €175 million last year. Trade with Bulgaria has multiplied more than eightfold since 1994 and there has been great emphasis on tourism in that country. I have no doubt that Irish tourists, property developers and home or villa purchasers will be heading to Bulgaria and Romania, just as they went to some of the ten countries that acceded to the Union in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">By opening up opportunities for legal work in the pre-2004 member states, the 2004 enlargement has helped reduce the grey economy and black labour market. Legal workers are less prone to exploitation and poor labour standards, and they also pay taxes and make social security contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The European Union requires the new member states to adopt its health, safety and other labour standards, thus improving working conditions for people in those countries and contributing to fair competition between companies. There is no evidence that enlargement has caused any serious social dumping. On the contrary, through enlargement, harmonised social standards are slowly but surely spreading across the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">Enlargement enables the EU to extend its police and justice co-operation to the new member states, thus making the fight against crime and terrorism more effective. The more EU members integrate their crime-fighting efforts with their neighbours, the better they can protect European citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Security and justice are areas in which the European Union can clearly do more to protect its citizens than any one country alone. The Union has developed police, customs and judicial co-operation to tackle terrorism, organised crime, drugs, trafficking in human beings and illegal migration. These developments are now part of the common rules that all member states must apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Co-operation with Romania and Bulgaria in recent years and co-operation with Turkey, which is engaged in talks with the Union, has involved many educational institutions. There has been much participation in programmes such as the SOCRATES programme in universities and schools. Adult education institutions are involved in exchanges of policy and modes of practice through ERASMUS, COMENIUS and GRUNDTVIG. Such co-operation has been very beneficial to Irish teachers and students. There is a substantial level of exchange involving schools doing projects on the Internet, groups of three or four schools working together and teachers and pupils participating in exchange programmes. In this context, the European project has begun regarding Bulgaria and Romania. The teachers and students of these countries are already visiting Ireland and communicating with the Irish over the Internet, and they are also engaged in joint projects. These developments are very helpful in improving the relationships between the various member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">People have questioned whether we look towards Berlin or Boston and sought to determine Ireland's commitment to social and economic values. Those of us who grew up in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s or 1980s will know that in those decades, the Irish by and large looked to England or the United States and that had been the case for a century theretofore. However, that was not always the case. The Vikings, in addition to coming to Ireland, crossed the Danube and went as far as Turkey. The first contact with what is now the United States was by St. Brendan. In spite of his having done so, Ireland has generally looked towards Europe. It was known as the island of saints and scholars and it placed great emphasis on education and scholarship, which it transmitted to Europe during the Dark Ages and Middle Ages. Those involved in the Flight of the Earls or the Wild Geese went to Europe for assistance, resulting in the Spanish Armada.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Looking to Europe was the trend until the famine in the middle of the 19th century. Why did the Irish turn their eyes from Europe at that time? They had no choice because famines beset much of the rest of Europe also. The Swedes, Danes, Poles and others were also fleeing their countries because of famines of varying severity. In very recent times there has been a very significant refocusing on Europe. Historically, Ireland has always looked east more than west and this must be taken into consideration in determining where our future lies.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">Since 1972, the benefits of membership of the European Union have accrued to Ireland. When we consider the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, we bear in mind, perhaps while wearing rose-tinted glasses, what has been achieved by Ireland. We note the enormous transfer of €35 billion in CAP funding alone, not to mention social and infrastructural funds. All these moneys benefited Ireland greatly, including in terms of education and training. One should remember that throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Ireland was a basket case in terms of employment and it had not made much progress in the areas I have mentioned. There was very little investment in the country at that stage but we emerged from that period with a bang in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This momentum was provided by infrastructure, training, education, funding and investment by companies seeking a stepping stone to Europe. These factors will have a bearing on the new accession states, poor eastern European countries formerly of the Soviet bloc, that have sent sons and daughters to this country, more so from Romania than Bulgaria. We should look at what is happening in a positive light. We had fears about migration in 2004 when ten new countries joined the EU and only Ireland, Sweden and Britain allowed free access to the workplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">Interesting figures provided by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, show that 3% of the workforce consists of those from the ten new accession countries. This is slightly different to the figure of 2% provided by the Minister of State. Some 9% of the workforce is made up of non-nationals and two thirds of these are not from the new accession countries. The Minister stated that only 62,000 of the 135,000 who entered our workforce in 2004 are still here. Some 73,000 workers have returned home or gone elsewhere. The pattern of migratory activity is cyclical and perhaps these workers have moved to another EU state. The projected growth in the economy is 4.6% to 5%, which allows for an additional 60,000 workers. If ten countries have provided 62,000 workers over the past two years and the optimistic growth projection is 5%, providing for 60,000 workers annually, we should scarcely be afraid of two new countries with a combined population of 30 million. This is in contrast to the population of Poland which is 45 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">Based on this analysis we should not be unduly worried about displacement in the workplace or a race to the bottom. Commissioner McCreevy's social directive has been amended, making it more difficult for firms from other countries to usurp the standards, values and conditions of the workplace in the host country. I wish to see the effect of the accession of ten new member states clearly identified before the autumn. The National Economic and Social Council is conducting a survey on the management of migration. It is important to separate myth from reality and it is important that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment can publish statistics on those coming here from accession countries. Are these people coming for a month as students? Why do they not stay longer if they are entitled to do so? Is it true that those from the accession countries make up between 2% and 3% of the workforce?</p>
          <p eId="para_344">The downside of migration is trafficking, drugs, crime and the number of accidents on our roads. The number of those from Eastern Europe involved in serious accidents is disproportionately high. This must be examined and addressed. As an island nation we should be more protected from criminal activity, such as drugs, trafficking and the increased proliferation of weapons but the sea is no barrier to the arrival of such elements. Many weapons in this country are of Eastern European origin as well as some from Northern Ireland. Much of the trafficking of drugs, women and children to Ireland comes from accession countries and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">There have been attempts to increase co-operation between the police forces but it has not been entirely successful and must be examined closely. When I was the Labour Party spokesperson on justice I saw a number of directives of this nature considered as well as legislation from Europe. The reality is that police forces do not operate in a sufficiently coherent and co-operative fashion. I refer to the "Prime Time Investigates" programme in which we saw some of the extent of the trafficking problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">I welcome the two new countries that are close to joining. They are part of the fifth enlargement process. We have reached the stage where we cannot assume that any further enlargement proposal or treaty will be easily passed. Any new referendum will be treated with suspicion. The Treaty of Nice had a major effect on this country's psychology, and the proposed constitution withdrawn after being rejected by the Netherlands and France also had a substantial psychological impact. There is no sense whatsoever in putting a referendum to the people in the future unless one does so with a great deal of information on the provisions and substance of the text. All the political parties must line up to say that they support it, otherwise the people will not accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">From that perspective, the National Forum on Europe is extremely important, and work done under the chairmanship of Senator Maurice Hayes has been invaluable. There have been regional meetings around the country, with involvement on the part of youth and various pillars and organisations. The main point is that it has been brought to the people, something that must continue. If Europe is to be promoted as the way forward economically and socially — "sold" is perhaps the wrong word — it must be promoted with the people. It must be made clear that the democratic deficit is being eradicated and that the structures have the necessary element of democracy, with no decisions made that lack accountability or transparency.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">That is the problem. Too many people took for granted the fact that decisions could be made quickly and short-cuts taken. That will not work, and in this country we have at least acknowledged that, since the Treaty of Nice in 2002 hit home very quickly. However, in other countries, where no attempt has been made to supply information to the ordinary citizen, I can imagine the problem that will occur, and the situation that arose in France and the Netherlands will be multiplied when there are further treaties or attempts to enlarge the Union in circumstances more controversial than the present.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">I am delighted to support this legislation. As I said, I hope that the accession date determined is the earlier one of 2007 rather than 2008.</p>

          <from>Ms Harkin</from>
          <p eId="para_352">I am very pleased at the opportunity to speak on the Bill to facilitate the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union. The question for those two countries is when will accession take place. Despite the fact that comprehensive monitoring reports will be placed before the European Parliament in Strasbourg next week, it seems unlikely that they will receive an answer in the near future. If reports are to be believed, it may be next autumn before a final decision is made. I hope that is not the case since such uncertainty is in no one's interest. However, it seems that President Barroso has decided to postpone the decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">From the perspective of Romania and Bulgaria, delaying entry will not solve any residual problems and might strengthen anti-European sentiment in those countries, which I believe is growing. There are issues regarding Romania and Bulgaria. There are concerns about corruption and organised crime in Bulgaria that must be dealt with more firmly. A great deal of progress has been made and one hopes that it will prove sufficient. We will have a much better idea next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">In a broader context, we must consider the impact of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, asking how it will affect the EU, which is still coming to terms with the accession of ten new member states. Concerns were raised in today's debate about the many worries of Irish people regarding EU enlargement. From my perspective, having listened to people, they feel that the pace of enlargement is an issue and that there has not been enough time for consolidation. There is a sense that we are moving too fast.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">I support the entry of Romania and Bulgaria next January if the monitoring reports are favourable. However, thereafter we may have to press the "pause" button, not the "stop" button. Otherwise, I would be concerned that we might lose control over the European project. I know that many other countries are knocking at the door, and they have every right to do so. They see EU membership as an ideal. Many of them look to Ireland as a model.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">However, the European project needs the support of its citizens, and people, not only in Ireland but, judging from what my colleagues have said in Parliament, across Europe, are currently a little unsure. The "No" votes in France and the Netherlands reflected that. I agree with a previous speaker that if we had staged a referendum in Ireland — something that we may still do — the result would have been very close, regardless of the fact that most major political parties would have supported it. In that context, we politicians must listen as well as lead.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">Today I took the opportunity to read some of the questions and contributions from the public and it might be worthwhile mentioning some of those comments, since today is about informing people regarding Europe. Comments from the public on the issue of enlargement included how far we can go with the European ideal, what the Irish position is on Turkey's application for membership of the EU, how far the enlargement project can go and whether there are borders to it. Particular consideration should be given to Turkey's desire for inclusion in the EU. However, it must be stated that Turkey is not a European country. How many more Asian or even African countries will seek to join a so-called European Union? The last question is why the citizens of Ireland cannot vote on new countries joining the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">Those questions and others deserve to be heard. After all, today should not simply be about talking to or at Irish or European citizens, it should be about listening to them and engaging with those concerns. Regardless of how we view them, we must respond. In that context, a major concern for many Irish people will be what decision the Government takes in the context of workers from Romania and Bulgaria coming here. According to the Taoiseach, that decision is being postponed until all other EU states open their labour markets to immigrants from the new member states. I believe that he was reported as saying that yesterday in the press.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">I agree with the Taoiseach on that question, since we need a properly managed economic migration policy. Ireland's economy has benefited greatly from immigrant labour, which has helped fuel our continued growth. We are a small country and must manage migration policy very carefully. The Minister told us this morning that in 1999, 5,000 work permits were issued. In 2003, that figure had jumped to 50,000 and by the end of 2004, it was 160,000. As I said, Ireland is a small country facing the issue of absorption and capacity. That has not yet become a problem, but it must be managed.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">Today there are several students from Mercy College in the Visitors Gallery, and they and their parents will be concerned about their future and jobs. People require certainty or at least an element of predictability regarding their future. I agree with Deputy Costello that we need not be afraid, but we must manage the process, examining labour market trends and introducing some system that allows reasonable access for workers from Romania and Bulgaria while allowing the Irish economy to grow. It is a win-win situation for everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">I believe that Deputy Finian McGrath is supposed to be in this slot so I will finish now.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_208">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_362">I welcome the opportunity to speak to the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2006. The Bill is necessary to amend the European Communities Act 1972, to provide that certain parts of the treaty concerning the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union shall form part of the domestic law of the State once Ireland ratifies the treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">Before going into the details of the Bill, it is important, on Europe day, to reflect on the whole European project and the direction in which the EU is going. It is essential that those in the EU respect and listen to the dissenting voices on this issue and not dismiss those of us who challenge the EU as a bunch of euro-sceptics. Many of us have concerns about the direction of the EU. We are normal sensible taxpayers who want full co-operation, and political, economic and social security. However, we do not want a super state. We want to make our own laws and we want more respect for our Parliament. We do not want to be a county council in the EU. We are democrats and internationalists. I am an Irish citizen and I respect on an equal basis French, Bulgarian and Spanish citizens. I do not want that citizenship undermined by a so-called European constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">I have concerns about outside forces trying to subvert or undermine our national Parliament. To those who say I am wrong I challenge them to read the 1916 Proclamation to see that there is a complete sell-out when it comes to these core principles. We need a new vision for Ireland; we need a new vision for Europe. This new vision should be built on equality, respect and diversity without sticking one's nose in the State's internal affairs. I will use the tax issue as an example. Deputies on all sides of the House object whenever the EU hints it might or wants to interfere in our taxation policy and I agree with them. Why does this not happen with regard to other areas? I certainly do not want to share a common foreign policy with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, on Iraq or with the nuclear power brigade in the EU. Let us call a spade a spade and stop trying to con the people. We should be honest and open. A constitution means a state. The Government should tell the people that and stop trying to drag them along hoping they will not notice.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">The Commission and the European movement desire us to celebrate today the Schuman Declaration of 9 May 1950, which is why we are having special debates in the House. I draw Members' attention to the phrases in the declaration which state that it is "a first step in the federation of Europe" and that the proposal "will lead to the realization of the first concrete foundation of a European federation". These political objectives are usually omitted when the declaration is referred to and most people do not even know of their existence.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">A federation is a state. However, for decades the champions of the EC for EU integration have all been swearing blind that they have no knowledge of any such plans. This is a lie they have been telling the people of the different European countries as the EEC, the EC and the EU have steadily acquired even more features of a super-national federation. We have a flag, an anthem, a parliament, a supreme court, currency, laws, battle groups and a code of fundamental rights. Now they hope to have a constitution with real citizens and citizenship obligations. This would leave the power to levy taxes as the only major power of government to remain at national level. The eurocrats clearly desire to obtain this right in time.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">The Irish people do not want to become citizens of a federal Europe, which the Commission and its ideological hangers-on in the European movement have sought to construct for decades while pretending they are only concerned with jobs and economic growth. Do Members of this House want to become citizens of such a federation? Was that in the minds of the men and women of 1916, whom the Government purported to honour a few weeks ago? Already the EU is the source of two thirds of our laws, a matter not mentioned regularly in this House. Under the proposed EU constitution that proportion would increase. The power of the European Commission would increase correspondingly, as it has a monopoly in proposing all laws in the EU. It is no wonder the Commission has the gall to lash out millions of our money on Europe Day, with gimmicks, special supplements in our newspapers and political advertising in the print and broadcast media, all with the aim of persuading us to give it more.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">On the Bill, I fully welcome the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania. I also encourage respect for nations and their citizens. I totally reject racism and I challenge those in this House and outside to tackle racism, like sectarianism, head-on in our communities. The problem exists: all we need to do is watch the rise of the BNP in England. We need to be vigilant and strong, and honest with our citizens. We need an urgent and honest debate on the European Union.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_209">
          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_369">I am sharing time with Deputy Ó Snodaigh. I welcome the legislation and I hope that at some stage Bulgaria and Romania will join the European Union. In 1979 I went to Germany for the first time to earn money. I went there because, in the words of one Deputy, I believe Deputy Costello, Ireland was a basket case at that stage and it was possible to earn up to four times as much money in Germany. Many Irish people had the same aspiration. We went there and earned money. I subsequently put myself through college with that money. It was a very good experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">It is interesting to look back on that period and consider how many Irish people remained in Germany. When migration patterns in Europe are analysed, it is clear that it does not resemble the United States of America, which probably relates to the greater cultural differences, language barriers etc. People in Europe emigrate for a period of time, do what they need to do and then return home. We will see that pattern with many people from the accession states, Poles, Latvians etc., coming here. We must respect them for coming here to try to better themselves — that is what it is about. I wish them all the best. I wish the Bulgarians and Romanians all the best because they are in the same situation as we were back in the 1970s.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">It has always been assumed that the widening and deepening of the European Union was what the European citizen wanted. However, as we have seen from referendum results in France and the Netherlands, that is not necessarily the case. People have major concerns about the enlargement project, in particular the proposed accession of Turkey. I learnt this lesson recently when I appeared on a programme with the Turkish ambassador. I have never received so many phone calls about an issue, particularly from women who seem to be very concerned about the matter. I believe it will be a long time before Turkey will join the European Union. While in terms of diversity of the Union and building bridges with Islam, it would be good, it is a long way off and it may not be possible politically.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, mentioned that enlargement may not have been the major factor in the defeats in France and the Netherlands. However, it certainly was an issue. The Minister of State referred to another issue, which is the perception among European citizens that they were alienated from the centre in Brussels, and that the Commission and other institutions had embraced the neo-liberal agenda.</p>

They want the European Union to be a bulwark against globalisation and not a vehicle for it. This is the crucial debate into which we are now facing. While we talk about the Lisbon Agenda, all the analysis shows that we are moving in a direction away from Berlin and towards Boston, which is not something I want to see. I believe in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and support it. It is interesting that the Government's White Paper states that principles are not directly justiciable but may be implemented either by the Union or by member states in their legislative or executive acts and only become significant to the courts or judicially cognisable when such acts come to be interpreted or reviewed. Examples of articles containing principles are those relating to the rights of the elderly, the integration of persons with disabilities and environmental protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">I would like to see those social and environmental rights being justiciable but that is not what the Government wants. Major questions arise, however, because it seems there are different interpretations. For example, I recently attended a meeting with someone who would describe himself as a federalist, John Palmer, who said as far as he is concerned, it will be justiciable once the court gets its hands on it. Tony Coughlan agrees with John Palmer's interpretation, which is interesting. An eminent barrister and constitutional lawyer in Trinity College, Gerard Hogan, agrees with those two gentlemen and disagrees with the Government's interpretation. How can the Government go to the electorate and say this is what the charter and constitution mean when there are so many different interpretations? We need clarity on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">This is important because the potential strength of the European Union rests on members coming together to tackle major issues such as the environment and the defining issue of our age, the energy crisis. This is where the European Union can and must play a role yet individual states refuse to play ball. It makes sense to have Europe-wide energy and ecological taxes. Imposing them on an individual basis will no longer work.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">If the European project is to be successful we must empower the citizen and reconstitute the convention. We need a new constitution which must be put to a Europe-wide referendum. I am concerned by statements today suggesting that somehow at a later stage we can give the same constitution back to the French. That shows a lack of awareness of the human condition and of the French people. If that is done, the recent riots in France will look like a picnic. It is not in the French psyche to take things lying down.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The French Greens are split down the middle on this referendum and harbour a legacy of continuing bitterness to the extent that when their delegate was nominated for a position on the committee of the European Greens, her own people did not vote for her. The Minister of State should not underestimate the level of antagonism that continues there. He cannot succeed by giving the same treaty back to the French. I spoke recently to the ambassador from the Netherlands who said that as far as the Dutch are concerned, that constitution is over.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Several aspects of the constitution were moving in the right direction in regard to empowerment of the citizen, namely, the citizens' initiative. When I attended the convention I was asked to draw up the first draft of that initiative and I was happy to see it included in the constitution. It can happen without the constitution. I suggest that we proceed with that amendment to empower the citizen so that we can collect signatures and move away from the idea of the militarisation of the European Union which does not interest most citizens. They want to see action on the environment and energy. If the Government moves in that way, there is a chance of re-engaging the citizen and making the European Union relevant once again.</p>

I too supported the call for her to speak here. While today's exercise was marginally useful in respect of the debate on agriculture within the European Union, it dramatically highlighted the hypocrisy of Deputies Kenny, Rabbitte and Harney, and their respective parties who have venomously opposed affording the same rights to democratically elected representatives of the Irish people living in the six north-eastern counties.

          <p eId="para_395">If that is to set the standard for elected members of the European Union, including Romania and Bulgaria, it is a sad day.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">My second point refers to the Minister of State's comments about allowing the free movement of workers. It is a disgrace that the Minister of State, despite what the Taoiseach has said and the stance taken by Ireland, England and Sweden to allow free movement of people, has not told the Romanians and Bulgarians that on accession they will be granted the same rights that we enjoyed when we joined the EEC. They should enjoy those rights from the first day and there should be no two-tier system. I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach had a go at the other EU countries which have not opened their borders to the last group of accession countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">I call on the Minister of State to state that there will be no block and that on accession the Romanian and Bulgarian people will enjoy the same rights as the people from the last ten accession countries in Ireland and that we encourage all members of the European Union to be equal. That demand should go out from this House to the rest of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The Roma people are the most disadvantaged ethnic group in Europe. We need to put more pressure on the Romanians and Bulgarians to address this disadvantage. The Travellers are our own nomadic and ethnic group but Ireland does not stand up as a model to either Bulgaria or Romania because we still discriminate against Travellers. We should encourage both countries and the European Union to do much more to address the disadvantage this group of people face. They lag behind in the areas of housing, education, employment, infant mortality and so on. A recent World Bank study found that many Roma live in conditions similar to those found in sub-Saharan Africa. In eastern Europe in particular there are Roma camps which would not be out of place in Calcutta or Bangladesh.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">There is no easy solution to the plight of the Roma people. No one is under any illusion that this disadvantage can be erased overnight. This is also the case for Travellers in this State, even though we have had a longer time than the Romanian and Bulgarian authorities to deal with the issue. I hope they will not study our record on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Sinn Féin has a positive view of an independent Ireland in a Europe of equals that is a fully and truly inclusive Union in which all states, regardless of their wealth, population or military strength, have an equal say in planning to work together. Sinn Féin is eager to welcome all applicant states that fulfil the Copenhagen criteria of democracy and respect for human rights. Our vision is of a socially just, accountable and transparent EU that respects and promotes the equal and human rights of all and is run democratically from the bottom to the top, not controlled by large nations, powerful bureaucratic elites and transnational capital, as is the case today. Our aim is a demilitarised and nuclear-free EU with a renewed emphasis on the primacy of a reformed United Nations in international affairs so that this fully inclusive international forum can reach its full potential as a force for international unity, justice and peace.</p>

          <from>Mr. Eoin Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_403">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2006 which deals with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria into the EU. Romania and Bulgaria have made significant progress in preparing themselves for accession to the European Union for which they deserve to be congratulated. It is to be hoped they can reach the targets set for them by the agreed date and then join the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">However, we would be foolish to ignore certain reports which deal with the manner in which these countries deal with crime and corruption and these reports are of concern. We would be foolish not to debate the reports openly and state that certain criteria must be met before such countries can join the EU. These reports will be made public next week in Strasbourg and many people will be very interested in reading them. I hope the two countries will overcome these problems in time for their accession on the agreed date. Considering some of the issues which have been raised by Deputy Costello such as drugs and organised crime in Europe, such issues do not seem to have been properly dealt with in Bulgaria and Romania but I hope they can be dealt with before the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Before the EU was enlarged to 25 member states, many people were of the view this would cause huge problems for workers in the original 15 member states, but this has not happened. In recent weeks, Commissioner Almunia published a detailed report which showed there had been very significant economic benefit for both the new accession countries and the original 15. Poland and Czechoslovakia were the chief beneficiaries but other accession countries have also benefited, as have the original ten member states. Some people warn that terrible things will happen when the EU is enlarged but if it is properly planned and properly done, it can and will be of economic benefit to all the citizens of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">The services directive was the cause of much concern in this House. I wish to correct Deputy Costello and inform him it was the Bolkestein directive, not the McCreevy directive.</p>

          <p eId="para_408">He did not. When he spoke about it for the first time in the European Parliament last year, he said that it did not have, to use the term, a snowball's chance in Hell of being passed in its original form. He decided to put it before the Parliament for amendment, which has happened. It returns to the Commission and later to the Parliament. This was a good way of doing it and it was a good compromise. Serious challenges to the European Union can be overcome if we work together.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">One of the greatest challenges facing the Union is the drift towards tax harmonisation and we cannot allow that to happen. If it happens, many international companies will no longer stay in Ireland. Part of the problem in the European Union is not that Ireland has low taxes, even though many countries complain this is the reason we are doing so well. If they want to have low taxes, we are not stopping them and they can do so. However, they must reform their own economies. Globalisation is a reality. We can react to it by putting our heads in the sand but we cannot ignore America or China or India. That is the economic reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Most people in this House want to strengthen the European social model but we must have a vibrant economy within the European Union. The people who most defend the European social model are people in France. Is it right to have more than 20% of people under 25 unemployed? I do not think so. We know what that is like because we experienced it in this country. It brought poverty and social exclusion on an horrific level to Ireland. We made fundamental changes in our economy to ensure we do not have those conditions any more. Is it right to have 50% unemployment in immigrant communities in France? The way to go is to be more flexible in one's economy which will in turn create jobs which is the best way of tackling poverty. Money can then be spent on enlightened social projects. I would rather have job creation and low unemployment than pretend to protect a European social model with a level of youth unemployment of more than 20%.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">I refer to two opinion polls taken recently in France. They showed that more than 70% of people under 25 wanted to become civil servants. This gives an idea of how low people in France feel about the future if this is their ambition. France is a great nation.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardAllen" eId="spk_234">
          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_415">The starting point for any discussion on the European Union invariably should be that it has been a successful journey from war and destruction to peace and relative prosperity. That journey has not ended. Institutional, evolutionary and increasing expansion has left some citizens asking legitimate questions about the Union. We dealt with those earlier in the discussion on the proposed legislation. Citizens of member states cannot be expected to be taken on the European journey without being kept informed of the destination and the itinerary.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">The success of the European project has been primarily grounded in economic success and its legitimacy derived from the support of the citizens of member states. That legitimacy has been questioned in recent times and the Convention on the Future of Europe considered the options as to how best to underpin the institutional processes of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">The constitutional treaty was drafted following a uniquely open and transparent process. It represents a carefully balanced compromise between the member states. It was, therefore, appropriate that the constitutional treaty sought to advance the existing work of the national parliaments in monitoring respect of the principle of subsidiarity. The role of national parliaments with respect to subsidiarity was previously recognised in the Amsterdam treaty and the Joint Committee on European Affairs Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny takes its role seriously under the current legal arrangements in that regard. It is therefore regrettable that there is not a greater appreciation of the work of the committee, the dedicated efforts of its members and those of the staff who support it. I am amazed at the volume of work two civil servants must go through in preparing for these meetings on a regular basis and that they can deal with that volume of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">In October 2002, the oversight work of the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny began under my predecessor Deputy Gay Mitchell who is also an MEP. Under my chairmanship and the chairmanship of my predecessor the committee has considered more than 1,500 legislative documents, a considerable achievement by any measure. In terms of the sub-committee's work load last year, 440 documents were dealt with, which included 105 from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, 109 documents from the Department of Foreign Affairs and 39 from the Department of Agriculture and Food ranging over many issues. It amazes me how even the preparatory work for the sittings of the sub-committee can be undertaken by such a small group of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">It is unthinkable that Ireland would be outside the European Union and accessing the Single Market as a legislative taker rather than as a member state with the ability to influence the legislative process. Part of that process, and a part that will increasingly have its voice heard, is the scrutiny process within the national parliaments of the Union. Each national parliament, in conformity with the principle of subsidiarity, determines how it will play its part within the European institutional architecture.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann have determined that the membership of the sectoral joint committees bring their expertise and experience to bear on the European legislative proposals, which will impact directly on the lives of the citizens of the Union. Without the co-operation of the sectoral committees, the scrutiny system in the Houses of the Oireachtas would be far less effective. I pay tribute again to the considerable work the sectoral committees have undertaken since 2002. I also thank those in the Departments who assist in the scrutiny through their ongoing co-operation and assistance, particularly the officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs who assist in co-ordinating the circulation of the legislative proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Scrutiny within the Oireachtas is also part of a Europe-wide process that operates under the umbrella of COSAC, which will meet in Vienna on 20 to 21 May. Through this body the Joint Committee on European Affairs has made its views on subsidiarity issues known to the European institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The scrutiny committee has considered many worthwhile and valuable proposals that were correctly advanced at the level of the European Union, such as those in regard to environmental protection. Given that pollution knows no boundaries, there is a need for co-operation among all member states and other countries on this issue. It has also considered matters on which there was a broad consensus that the issues might be better determined at national level such as the proposals concerning GM foods and the third railway package.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">As chairman of that committee, I do not believe there is a one size fits all mechanism to deal with the questions that come before us. Each parliament must address the position based on its experiences.</p>

          <p eId="para_424">The Progressive Democrats is a strong supporter of the EU project and recognises the positive impact the EU has had on Irish development and society and the positive role Ireland has played and continues to play at EU level.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">Today, Europe Day, is only one small part of the important larger project, that of encouraging and engaging the citizens of Europe to inform them about European affairs and to demystify and clarify the relationship between the Union and Ireland, particularly in light of the proposed constitutional referendum and its recent rejection in France and in the Netherlands.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">The Third Annual Report of the European Union Scrutiny Act, the subject of the discussion, reviews part of the work of the Oireachtas, in an attempt to be more transparent to the citizen and to highlight the relationship between the Union and Ireland. The EU Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny has dealt with nearly 1,500 documents originating at EU level and the Joint Committee on European Affairs has held many pre-Council meetings with relevant Ministers, all necessary and important work, but in regard to the most pressing challenge facing Ireland and the Union, they are in some ways peripheral.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">The focus of the White Paper on European Communication Policy is on delivering tangible results in areas that are important to the European citizen, the secondary objective being to make the EU framework more democratic. While the second objective complements the scrutiny role, it becomes somewhat academic if we do not get the first part right. The work of the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny, the new communication action plan, the so-called D plan on democracy, dialogue and debate, and the White Paper are all welcome, but are they enough in the current context?</p>
          <p eId="para_428">Ireland's relationship with the Union is changing. During the years we have benefited greatly from the EU, particularly in agricultural subsidies and Structural Funds. However, because of reforms of the CAP and our improved economic performance that picture is changing. Coupled with the fact that Ireland will soon become a net contributor to the EU, there has been and will continue to be immediate consequences for our citizens as a result of developments at Union level.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">I refer to three examples. The European Central Bank interest rates will increase by a percentage point over the next 12 months, and Irish home owners will feel the financial impact of that increase. Second, changes at EU level to price structures and support subsidies for the sugar beet industry have meant the closure of the sugar industry here. Third, people in this country have increasing fears about so-called jobs displacement. I welcome the proposed review of the period of reflection by EU Foreign Ministers at the June meeting. One could ask what <i>de facto</i> tangible results have emerged from the work that has been done to date. What results are evident for the ordinary citizen? If the objective of the period of reflection, and the subsequent review to take place this June, was to help to clear the way for progress on the successful ratification of the proposed EU constitution, how far have we come in that respect?</p>
          <p eId="para_430">It is worth examining a recent measure of how the EU is perceived in Ireland. I refer to a survey that was conducted in autumn 2005. I remind the House of the three issues I mentioned earlier — interest rates, the sugar beet industry and the displacement of jobs. I acknowledge that statistics can be interpreted in many ways. One report might point out that 75% of people are happy, whereas another report will say that one in four people is discontent. The same is true of Eurobarometer figures. I am concerned that, during this period of evaluation of the benefits of Ireland's membership of the EU, there has been a four-point decrease in the percentage of Irish people who regard EU membership as a good thing. The findings of the survey have some other worrying aspects. While the absolutely fantastic work of the Forum on Europe and other groups which promote the EU is to be commended, we need to consider whether that work is having an impact. Could it be argued that we are engaging with the usual suspects — Departments and local, regional and national Government agencies? Some 56% of Irish people are in favour of the proposed EU constitution, 31% are undecided and just 13% are opposed to it. These figures are extremely good by comparison to our European neighbours, some of which have turn-outs of just 35% in elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">During the recent series of statements on the March meeting of the European Council, it was interesting to hear the Council's view that since the French and Dutch referendums on the proposed EU constitution there has been a particular focus on showing EU citizens that the EU works on their behalf. The relaunch of the Lisbon Agenda and the renewal of the EU's emphasis on jobs and growth took place in that context. What tangible results have been realised as a result of this focus, however? It was intended that the period of reflection and the new White Paper would represent adequate responses to the concerns which have been voiced by EU citizens and would clear the way for the progress to be made in respect of the ratification of the proposed constitution. Are we making progress with cynical and disinterested citizens, those between the ages of 18 and 25, who have been statistically shown to be less likely to be in favour of the proposed constitution, or those who have fears of jobs displacement? How will the placing of renewed emphasis on the Lisbon Agenda, as well as on jobs and growth, encourage the three groups of people I have mentioned to support the proposed constitution?</p>
          <p eId="para_432">The Third Annual Report on the Operation of the European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002 highlights some of the efforts being made in this House to clarify the relationship between Ireland and the EU. That is important, as is the celebration of Europe Day, but specific efforts have to be made to show Irish and EU citizens who have a negative view of the European project that such matters are as important as we think they are. I do not agree with the suggestion in the White Paper that it is too simplistic to think that advertising is the way to breach the confidence deficit. While it might be true to suggest we should not concentrate our efforts to contact or target young people on newspapers, never mind White Papers, we could make better use of the Internet, podcasting, the Bebo website, text messaging, sports events, fashion, popular presenters, television shows and funded youth exchanges, all of which are popular mediums which are widely accessible and accessed by the young. If we cannot think outside the box to address these serious matters, we will continue to preach to the converted. Not only will we risk a repeat of the result of the first referendum on the Nice treaty, but we will also put in danger what the EU has to offer to Ireland and Ireland has to offer to the EU in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_433">I congratulate Deputy Allen, Chairman of the Sub-Committee on EU Scrutiny, on all the work that has been done by the committee under his remit. The Third Annual Report on the Operation of the European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002 is a most impressive document. It highlights the sub-committee's enormous workload, including the number of meetings during which documents were considered, issues which were decided on and discussions with various officials took place. Page 11 of the report gives a breakdown of the number of adopted measures, legislative proposals, directives, regulations, decisions, Green Papers, White Papers, Common Foreign and Security Policy measures, Title 4 measures and early warning notes which were considered by the sub-committee. Such a workload would be quite onerous for any committee. It is a particularly enormous workload for the staff who work on the sub-committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_435">We must pay tribute to the incredible work that has been done by the sub-committee, as well as by the various joint committees which consider the documents and directives which are referred to them. The figures quoted in the report are quite startling. In the four years since 2002, approximately 1,452 documents of one type or another have passed through the hands of the sub-committee. Some 75%, or 329 of the 440 documents which were considered in 2005 were legislative documents, such as directives, regulations or decisions. For the sub-committee to examine such an enormous number of legislative provisions requires an incredible amount of work. I often wonder whether the sub-committee, and the various joint committees to which the various matters are referred, are properly resourced to deal with such a workload. One could contrast the sub-committee's workload with the number of Bills which have been passed in this House over the last four years since the Government took office.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_437">Just 148 Bills have been passed in that time, which is approximately one tenth of the 1,452 documents which have been considered by the sub-committee since 2002. Not all of the 1,452 documents are legislative provisions, but approximately three quarters of them are. That means, in effect, that we are being legislated for from Europe. This House spends most of its time dealing with and teasing out domestic legislation, while EU documents appear on the Order Paper only to be referred to the sub-committee without debate and considered by the sub-committee in the bunker before being sent back to this House to be passed without debate. EU legislation never sees the floor of this House to any great extent unless EU directives have to be formally transposed into legislation. Ministers take or do not take direction on a given matter from the sub-committee, before making or not making an input on the matter at the Council of Ministers. We have no way of checking whether a Minister makes an input at EU level. We do not really have any full and thorough pre-scrutiny and post-scrutiny mechanisms. We have to consider whether the current process is able to deal adequately with the enormity of the material that comes before the Oireachtas. Are the resources in place to deal with such material? Have we considered sufficiently the seriousness of the work that is being done?</p>
          <p eId="para_438">I compliment the Minister and Deputy Allen on the enormous amount that has been done in this respect. This is the third annual report. I suggest that a future report should involve an examination of and a statement on whether the sub-committee has the resources it needs to conduct its work properly and tease out the various matters sufficiently. Can we be sure that what is being done is being followed through? Perhaps the next report should include a set of recommendations on the further actions which might be needed to ensure the full terms of the 2002 Act are fulfilled in their entirety.</p>

          <p eId="para_439">I wish to share time with Deputies Eamon Ryan and Morgan.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">Once again I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words about the work of the scrutiny sub-committee. I was a member of the scrutiny sub-committee in the Oireachtas for two years. It is appropriate we are discussing this matter on Europe Day, when we are talking about bringing Europe closer to the citizens. In some ways people can be reassured that national politicians have a small input into European legislation. At least they can make comments and somehow feed into the system. Of course the fact the Minister of State attends meetings of the Joint Committee on European Affairs before Council meetings is important. He can act as a conduit for the views of the national representatives so that when he attends those meetings at least he is aware of what is being said.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">I agree with Deputy Costello that there is an enormous workload for the sub-committee. We had a presentation once from the House of Lords where they spoke of the system that obtained there. They said EU scrutiny was almost full-time work for a number of members. The truth is, however, that no Deputy has the time available to him or her——</p>

          <p eId="para_443">That is true as well. The Deputy has hit the nail on the head because one could spend all day or night scrutinising European legislation and this effort means nothing to the public. The issue is about work that needs to be done, and done well, and that people may be reassured of this, but because of the system we operate we are not able to give them that guarantee. One of the recommendations in the proposed constitution was what was called the "yellow card system" whereby if a government had an issue about a subsidiarity principle being breached, this could be referred back. That is one of the positive matters that we should look at, perhaps, even if the constitution is not in place. If a million citizens were to sign a document, we might be able to have some legislative proposals put forward. Those are some of the good things that are in the constitution and perhaps we might look at bringing them forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_446">It is the gulag of the willing. God bless them — I hope my day will not come. My experience has been interesting in terms of operating it. We have, on occasion, chosen legislation and had it discussed by departmental officials. This has been beneficial, I suppose, but I do not believe it has had much real effect. The Minister and his or her Department officials pass over the information, there is a nice, gentle discussion for up to an hour, but as to whether this has any real effect, I do not really believe so. We never brought in witnesses. The system might start working if persons from outside a Department were brought in. That is something we should do more regularly.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">On the one occasion we had direct experience of the European Union in my four years in the House, it was inadvertent. One of the Deputies opposite was seeking to make a point on fisheries so he brought in his friends, as I shall put it, from the European Parliament to back up an internal war that was going on between the Minister and himself. That actually proved to be useful because it meant the Members of the European Parliament who were involved in the fisheries group were present in the same room as Members of the Oireachtas who were responsible for fisheries. There was a good ding-dong. I pointed out that since an individual was present who was on the relevant committee at European level, he or she should be aware of such and such. He or she could then come back and say that we should know this and that. That is one structure in which this procedure might work better if we had formal arrangements whereby Irish MEPs were statutorily required to return here to parliamentary groups that mirror the same responsibilities and give quarterly reports.</p>

The EU Scrutiny Act 2002 has become counter-productive as a means of democratic oversight. It has been abused by the Government to allow for less debate on EU matters, not more as promised. Under the present scrutiny Act, the Dáil does not debate matters before intergovernmental conferences, for example, EU summit or Council meetings. Deputies do not vote on proposed Irish Government positions. Those positions should be placed before the House and debated. Debates on these matters only occur after the fact——</p>

On the whole question of resources, I join in the praise for the herculean efforts of the staff of the scrutiny sub-committee and ask the Minister of State whether he accepts it is under-resourced in terms of the amount of work it has to do in terms of the detail it must follow through? When we tell our European colleagues about the small number of officials and experts that are on the sub-committee to do the work, they are absolutely astounded.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">My second question is a broader one about the scrutiny of Council meetings. Deputy Treacy will know that as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, he comes before the joint committee pre-GAERC, and we discuss Council meetings before they happen, which of course are not open to the public.

It is also good for the committee and those Members who are involved in debates here, including Members of the European Parliament, who are able to attend here from time to time as it provides them with extra information on the common position of Ireland. We take on board the advice, guidance and consensus that is usually there on European issues across this House. I would not have any difficulty coming back to discuss the outcome of various Council meetings but in many cases no absolute conclusion is reached on each issue on the agenda at these Council meetings. These issues can remain on the agenda for a long period and reappear at subsequent meetings of the joint committee.

It is very important that strict criteria be laid down and that all banks operate in a transparent way to ensure that equity and choice will prevail for consumers, that they can change banks if they so wish, and that there be no prohibition for any bank operating within the eurozone in particular, and the European Union in general, to operate in any member state or deliver a service to that member state.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_488">(d) When will decisions of such importance for all of Europe be debated in the European Parliament?</p>
          <p eId="para_489">I do not know if the Minister was at that meeting. I suspect he probably was not because the issue relates to foreign affairs. However, this question could apply to many issues. The European Union had been sustaining and supporting the Palestinian Authority as part of the quartet but a decision was made by the Foreign Ministers to suspend payment because of the position of Hamas — the recently elected government of the Palestinian Authority — which refused to recognise the legitimacy of the state of Israel and which vowed and is prepared to physically eliminate it. This citizen's question relates to how the decision was made by the Foreign Ministers and how the formality of its communication was conveyed to the wider public. Is there a voting list?</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Anybody can come into this Chamber after any debate and by viewing the necessary records see which way any of us have voted here. The same question is being posed in regard to how decisions are reached in Europe. I do not know if the Minister of State is in a position to answer this question.</p>

          <p eId="para_491">I am not in a position to give a <i>de facto</i> answer to the question but from experience I am aware that once a decision is taken, the decision is reported, but information is not given on what way people voted. I do not think it is revealed how anyone votes in any of the communications or conclusions that are arrived at.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Ireland and the European Union are very much at one on the situation in the Middle East. We regard the democratic decision taken by the Palestinian people to elect a new government as a legitimate decision. The government is in place and the desire is that people would respect that fact, and that the Palestinian Authority in turn would respect the sovereign government in the adjoining state of Israel and that there would be mutual respect. As we speak there is a European Union initiative through the Austrian Presidency where every effort is being made to engage in dialogue to ensure we can continue to find a formula to transfer resources so that the Palestinian people will not be the victims of a change of government <i>vis-à-vis</i> the cash transfers from which the country has benefitted from the European Union and other countries.</p>

          <p eId="para_496">The situation is most obvious. There is a clearly defined structure of institutions, such as the European Parliament, the various councils and the European Council which take their decisions. A conclusion is arrived at and is published. Apart from the European Parliament, the councils sit in private. We fully support the European constitutional proposals to open up the process so that there will be a transparent communication and that people can see the decisions being taken. That is what we want to achieve in the future.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_497">I welcome the intervention. Because the constitutional treaty has been stopped by virtue of the decisions in a couple of member states, is it not now opportune for the actual process of decision making — this is but one example but the question applies to any Council decision being made — for the European electorate to hear how individual member states voted on any particular measure, as they can in Galway or Dublin city councils and in Dáil Éireann? People can tune in and find out which way people voted and, accordingly, draw their own conclusions.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">What the Minister of State said about the past is correct, that institutionally it was a bit like having confidentiality, there was a frank and full debate internally when the decision was made but there was no breakdown as to who voted in what way. This is a question from the public, it is not from Deputies Ruairí Quinn or Eamon Ryan as to why, how and who. Deputy Treacy is an experienced Minister. Following the period of reflection, what institutionally can prevent Council decisions being published with a description of how people voted to illustrate them?</p>

          <p eId="para_499">I presume there is a legal impediment under treaties or otherwise. The decision making process remains the same as when the EEC was established. The European constitution will address this issue once it is implemented. I do not have a problem with this because it is important that every citizen should know his or her representative's position prior to arriving at a decision at European Council on any topic.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">When we conclude meetings of the Council, we are obliged by tradition rather than by rule to meet the Irish media. We are asked questions on the issues and we outline our stance on them. We must justify why we took that stance and how the conclusion was reached. It is a matter for them to communicate that to the people. However, we do not respond on the view taken by other states on an issue. Two large countries could adopt an attitude on an issue while three countries could take a different attitude. That is not obvious or clear but it is important that decisions should be publicised so that every citizen in the Union is aware of the representation made on his or her behalf and how the decisions were reached. That is good for democracy and fair to each citizen.</p>

          <p eId="para_501">We should have a better opportunity in future to put the public's questions to the Government. For example, members of the public cannot find out how the Minister for Foreign Affairs voted on the Palestinian issue nor can I, despite searching for a number of weeks. If it is difficult for us, as Members, it must be impossible for the public. The issue will be raised on the Adjournment later and I hope clarity will be provided on Ireland's position on the Palestinian Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">Like previous speakers, I would like to ask a few questions submitted by the public. One person asks why they have to pay vehicle registration tax on a second-hand camper van imported to Ireland from the EU. If they export from Ireland to the EU, they do not have to pay. Another person says there is too much interference from the EU in local affairs, asks why the EU seems to think all areas of life must conform to one model, for example, food, medicines, etc. and rejects both the proposition that the European Union is competent to be involved in most areas and any moves to a federal and more united Europe. A third person, while commending the Forum on Europe's work with transition year students, would like to know what efforts the Government intends to make to stir and harness the interest of young people in European affairs.</p>

          <p eId="para_505">I commend the committee's initiative and it is a matter for the committee to reply. However, the Department will do everything it can to assist in providing the necessary information in reply to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">The vehicle registration tax rate is based on a Government decision taken a number of years ago, which was approved by the House, to provide sustainability in the revenue base and to ensure the domestic market would not be flooded with second-hand cars from different parts of the world. The tax is under review and can be kept under review over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">On the question of the EU involving itself in local affairs, the Union is clear that it has no desire at any time to meddle in the affairs of a member state unless there is a desire within that state for the Union to get involved. The Union only gets involved where national governments do not take the necessary action to protect the interests of their citizens in particular areas of activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Equality legislation has been one of the Union's greatest successes. It was a European initiative because national governments were not taking decisions to provide equal rights, pay and opportunity to women in society. A major culture change resulted for the benefit of mankind and each member state and tribute must be paid to the Union in this regard. The Union sometimes gets involved as a result of complaints by individual citizens that their local authority or government has not taken action in a certain area. In addition, if legislation is not in place, the Union will create a basis on which laws can be introduced through different directives. They are examined by the scrutiny committee, debated in national parliaments, enshrined in legislation and become uniform throughout the Union. That is the only reason the Union takes action. It has no desire to get involved unless we, as a Government, are not taking the necessary action.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">The European Commission and every European leader are anxious to involve young people. Margot Wallström, the communications Commissioner, is responsible for the communicating Europe initiative and she is anxious to ensure young people are engaged in European affairs, activities and politics so that they are fully aware of their rights and the opportunities available and the importance of the Union for all member states. A number of initiatives aimed at young people have been taken since the foundation of the Union and additional resources are provided in the budget annually, including the most recent budget agreed last December. More money was provided for exchanges and new initiatives. It is critically important for the good of our political system and democracy and the good of Europe that we all ensure we engage significantly with young people. Great progress has been made and I pay tribute to the Forum on Europe in this regard. It is playing its part to ensure we engage with our young people. That is only as it should be and we all have a duty to support the forum.</p>

The Minister for Social and Family Affairs is examining other opportunities to expand the scheme. There is a demand that there should be equity in the system on an all-island basis. If the scheme is expanded, all European citizens will have to be offered free travel in Ireland. However, the system is usually flexible to take account of a particular situation so that if somebody is seriously ill, he or she would get a concession.

          <p eId="para_514">I have knowledge of this area because when I was Minister for Finance and Proinsias De Rossa was Minister for Social Welfare, we attempted to extend the free travel scheme to cover pensioners in the North. When efforts were made in recent times to extend the same facility to Irish-born people living in England — the DION constituency — we ran into a problem because a state cannot discriminate between one nationality and another within the Union. One cannot discriminate between one nationality and another across the EU. If free travel for pensioners was to be extended, it would have to be for all 25 member states. There could be capacity implications resulting from that. Surely the number of people across the EU that might qualify for free travel due to a health impediment will be smaller than the cohort of pensioners. Their physical condition is such that they will not be doing long-distance journeys for the sheer fun of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">This is about rights. If a European citizen has a right to free travel by virtue of a health impediment, that person should have that right across the Union, even though it is unlikely he or she will exercise it from Malta to Finland. However, a Polish family may be living here with a relative in Poland who has that entitlement. These rights would help to consolidate families in those circumstances. This question has clearly come from a citizen of this State who has a direct experience of this impediment.</p>

It states that wherever decisions are made, the process of arriving at them should be fully transparent and the decisions should be adequately explained to the public. The President of the Commission and various national figures in a number of member states have referred to the fact the EU is frequently undersold. National ministers often attribute the blame for unpopular EU decisions to the EU institutions, but they claim the credit for popular decisions for themselves. This member of the public states that the European Council should adopt a code of practice, to be followed by member state governments, in conveying and commenting on EU decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">We are discussing the purpose of European Union scrutiny in the operation of this Act and the Minister of State should take on board the recommendations that are made. Is there any mechanism to show that a relevant Minister takes on board any recommendations that come through from the scrutiny process? Can we have a review of the pre-decision making scrutiny? What about scrutiny of Council and Commission decisions after they are made? The Act makes provision for a Minister to make a report to each House of the Oireachtas not less than twice yearly for all measures within his or her jurisdiction. That report is not debated on the floor of this House.</p>

However, it is not just committees and Ministers who carry out this work. Our ambassadors at EU level are currently involved in these negotiations.

The Department of Foreign Affairs co-ordinates these and they are sent to the sub-committee. I meet the officials before the documents are presented to the committee and then they are delegated to the relevant sectoral committees. These committees examine them and their implications for the country and they make a judgment on the contents of those reports. That is fairly in-depth scrutiny. My only reservation concerns the resources being made available to civil servants attached to the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny, who face a horrendous amount of work.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_529">For a number of reasons, 2005 was a vital year for development. The donor community committed itself as never before to a massive scaling up of aid, partner countries to the Paris declaration agreed on a set of aims and principles to make aid more effective and donors agreed to put the plight of Africa at the forefront of development efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">EU leadership was the motor driving this major mobilization of the international community towards the achievement of the millennium development goals, which aim to halve world poverty by 2015. In May 2005, development Ministers mapped out a timetable for member states to achieve the 0.7% target by 2015, including an interim target of 0.56% by 2010. Ireland is committed to reaching the 0.7% target by 2012 and is on track to do so. I have described the timeframe in this House as realistic and achievable and I am confident it will be met. We are well above the less familiar UN target of 0.15% for aid to least developed countries as a percentage of gross national income. Arguably, this is a better benchmark for the focus on poverty of our overseas development assistance policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">Last year, in order to make its aid more effective and responsive to the concerns of its partners, the EU launched a major new development co-operation initiative, the European consensus for development. This initiative commits the main institutions of the EU to the same set of basic principles and values in the field of development co-operation. These principles include poverty reduction, partnership and country ownership, human rights, peace, democracy and good governance.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">Proper governance will determine whether the increased levels of aid will be effective in the long run. The stress on democracy and governance at EU level is reflected in our bilateral programmes. Support for good governance is a major priority area of expenditure in Ireland's development co-operation programme and includes assistance for building democratic systems of government which are underpinned by free and fair elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">I have already pointed out that 2005 was notable for the focus given to the special plight of Africa. This initiative was also driven by EU leadership because not only did the EU pledge half of its increased aid volumes to that continent, it also agreed on a long-term framework for its relationship with Africa. This new strategy for Africa was adopted by the European Council last December after extensive preparatory work between the EU and African regional organisations. It provides a comprehensive and long-term framework for EU relations with Africa. In addition to support for national plans for economic growth and poverty reduction, the strategy will promote African leadership on peace and security issues. A key component of this is the EU's African peace facility, which has already proven to be an effective mechanism for delivering peace support on the African continent.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">Last year, I launched an Irish Aid capacity building programme for the ten new EU member states, the object of which is to share Irish Aid's experiences in building its own programmes over the past 30 years. As part of the mentoring programme, delegations from the new member states visit Dublin for an intensive series of seminars on different aspects of Ireland's aid operations. The fact they are keen to learn from Ireland is a tribute to the Members of this House and the previous holders of my office. Irish Aid is recognised as a success story at EU and world levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">Trade has the potential to lift millions out of poverty. Last December, I spoke in the Dáil about the EU's expectations for the Hong Kong World Trade Organisation ministerial meeting in the area of trade and development. EU leadership was crucial to securing a strong development package in Hong Kong. In particular, Ministers agreed that all developed countries, as well as developing countries in a position to do so, would extend duty and quota free access to 97% of imports from least developed countries. Ministers also made decisions on cotton, TRIPS and aid for trade which will address some of the pressing concerns of least developed and low income countries. In parallel with the WTO negotiations, the EU is negotiating economic partnership agreements, EPAs, with six regional groupings of African, Caribbean and Pacific states. The EU Commissioner for Trade, Mr. Peter Mandelson, has stressed that EPAs will be geared toward south-south economic integration, with an emphasis on market building within the ACP. Trade liberalisation will be gradual and will flow from the agreements.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">I value the support and solidarity given by Members of the Oireachtas to the work of Irish Aid and set great store by their continued attention to various aspects of our bilateral aid programmes. This parliamentary engagement brings many benefits. It helps to create public support for development and poverty reduction and holds the Government to account for the commitments it makes. As we expand our enormous and well regarded Irish Aid programmes, we need closer and better parliamentary scrutiny of our efforts. Informed parliamentary scrutiny of development policies ensures the most effective use of the unprecedented level of resources being made available for poverty reduction in the poorest countries and amongst the poorest people.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">In the context of a rapid expansion in overseas aid, I welcome the views of the Oireachtas committee and of Members in general on how their involvement with Irish Aid might be deepened. We should continue to discharge this responsibility in a spirit of common purpose. All Members of this House and, in particular, those with former ministerial responsibility for development assistance have made enormous contributions to the building of an aid programme which is the envy of many other donor countries. The programme we have built brings credit to this country. <i>Per capita</i>, Ireland is now the world’s tenth largest donor of overseas aid. The OECD, in its peer group review, praised our aid programme by putting it at the cutting edge of development policy. Action Aid, an independent NGO based in London, stated that Ireland’s aid programme is of the highest quality. In its examination of the efforts of various donors, it made a unique distinction between phantom and real aid. Ireland has a reputation for delivering real aid which is of real benefit to really poor people.</p>

          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_538">I thank the Minister of State for his contribution but, while his statement contained a bit of self-praising propaganda regarding Irish development assistance targets, he neglected to note that these targets fall far short of the commitment given by the Taoiseach at the millennium summit in 2000. The poor of this world will have to wait many more years before they receive effective aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">Much of our business with the Minister of State can be conducted through the committees on foreign affairs and european affairs, so I want to use this debate as a vehicle to ask the questions the public would like us to raise. Before I do so, however, I call on the Minister of State to bring us up to date on the biggest threat to Ireland's development assistance programme, namely his hamfisted attempts to force through the decentralisation programme, thereby threatening the institutional memory of Irish Aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">I also raised the question of the development fund for Iraq and the misappropriation of massive amounts of money in Iraq therefrom. What has happened, what investigations have taken place and what questions has the Government asked about these allegations? This money was earmarked for the Iraqi people but it seems to have gone into the pockets of well-placed contacts of political figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">The other issue about which I wish to inquire is the decision made at European level to stop humanitarian funding to the Palestinian Authority. This was raised earlier and will be raised again. Was Ireland a party to that appalling decision and would it be possible to have some transparency in respect of it?</p>
          <p eId="para_542">I will use the remainder of the time available to pose some of the questions that have been coming through to us on the EU and the developing world and I will give the Minister the opportunity to prepare answers. Why, somebody asks, does the Commission continue to pursue aggressive trade tactics at the WTO and through economic partnership agreements to open up developing countries despite its commitment to use trade to enhance development?</p>

It includes the following sentence, "If Europe is to be a ‘responsible' player on the world stage, the evolution of its policies as they affect developing countries in particular, is of crucial significance."

          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_549">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this matter. I wish to put some questions to the Minister of State. While I have wished him well in all of his endeavours to date, some conclusions might be drawn from an earlier presentation that affect what has been said on one of the topics with which he is dealing, namely, the resumed WTO talks. The latter have been described by some of the NGOs that will be represented at the talks as taking place on the eve of a disaster. Although the meeting in Hong Kong produced a better offer for most of the developing countries than the one made at Cancún, it is regarded by every NGO dealing with trade as far short of what is needed. For example, while we have heard in this debate about the elimination of export subsidies for agricultural products, they comprise approximately 3.7% of the EU basic activity and, therefore, we must be vigilant in all the other areas. I do not have time to go into detail but we can deal with particular questions later. On the demands for flexibility and access to markets and services, what has been offered on agriculture in the developing world is perceived as minimal. That creates an issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">It is time that some hard evidence was provided in respect of the millennium development goals. Time is running out. It should be stated publicly in parliaments that the budget for the response to the AIDS crisis in Africa has not been met by the countries that committed to it. Neither the amount pledged nor that delivered approach what is required to make significant progress. I do not have the detailed figures but I think the highest point funding reached was 40% of what was required to achieve the goal. We need reports on the progress of the millennium goals. There is evidence that few of the goals will be met on the continent of Africa. That creates a crisis and there is no point stating otherwise. The 110 that came together to extract a slightly better package in Hong Kong than they had in Cancún are likely to conclude that they will do better on trade by delaying an agreement rather than by accepting what is on offer.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">I cannot understand why the name of Irish Aid has changed again. What was wrong with the original name? I am weary of being unable to answer queries on how individuals might take part, as competent persons, in volunteering or working in different parts of the developing world. These questions have been submitted to me by fine people who, or whose friends, have given fine service abroad for APSO. It is difficult to get a straight answer in respect of this matter, which is not to be disposed of by saying that we like to pass on responsibility for the various projects to local people. The latter is an approach that I support.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">I was interested in the Minister of State's combination of human rights and their integration into the development project. Following the election of Hamas in Palestine, Ramallah is besieged with development workers. When I was there last year, one could hardly move without bumping into such individuals. They ask why the EU, which like the Minister of State, talks about human rights, refuses to address the illegality of the occupation. Development work is carried out in an atmosphere in which it will always involve responding to victims and will never be about basic rights and the need to address difficult situations. The situation is not assisted by the actions of Hamas, although it must be remembered that elections took place. Why are EU governments silent on the simple illegality of occupation and the expansion of Jerusalem, which has been expanded by an area one and a half times the size of Paris?</p>

          <p eId="para_554">These issues will not go away.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">On the Minister of State's reference to the EPA negotiations between the EU and developing countries, in many cases the EU was seeking more than originally envisaged. That approach was rejected in the initial WTO talks. The developing countries, particularly those in Africa, sought time, flexibility and exemptions for developments they wished to provide by way of universal availability, such as those in the area of education. We heard today that anything conceded in agriculture will come about at the price of concessions on services and being obliged to open markets quickly. That starkly contradicts what was offered by the EU Development Ministers and what the Minister of State said. His contribution contained the suggestion that there will be an opportunity for countries to be flexible and respond slowly to their markets. That is not what the Commissioner stated. The NAMA condition is a fundamental demand concerning the reciprocity the Commission is seeking from developing countries. It is unreal and will lead to the rejection and failure of the talks, and rightly so, because no developing country could accept it as it stands.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">There is a raft of other issues I could discuss. I welcome the expansion of our aid and also the thinking of the European Union. However, its thinking on Doha and Palestine and its silence in the international legal atmosphere in which it is working is quite appalling. The European Union has no credibility among those who are seriously concerned about justice and law in the Middle East. The volume of the Union's money is welcome, as are its development workers, but its silence and disgraceful following of the United States in removing aid from the Palestinian people will be long-remembered, and rightly so.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_559">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to make a short contribution to this debate on aid and the developing world. Ireland has a moral duty to assist the poorer countries of the developing world, particularly those in Africa. When engaging in development projects, we have a great responsibility to ensure that those distributing aid are of the highest calibre. It saddened, annoyed and hurt me in recent days to hear that child abuse and sexual exploitation are being carried out by certain elements of the aid community. It is a scandal that very poor young girls of 13, 14 and 15 in a country ravaged by conflict are being exploited by people sent to help them. This abuse should always be challenged and we should all speak out against it. I demand a reaction and a proper vetting system for those involved in aid distribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Bearing in mind our history, including the advent of the Famine and the impact of imperialism on this island, we should instinctively be on the side of poorer countries. I urge the European Union to become more involved and to be proactive. Some EU countries have had a very bad relationship with Africa historically. The Belgians, French, Spanish and British had colonies in Africa and they have a responsibility to combat exploitation.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, on the work he is doing to address these issues. Although we have not reached the aid target of 0.7%, much work has been done. This work must continue and be developed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_318">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_562">We need to examine the role of the EU in respect of the developing world. Disappointment must be expressed at the collective role of EU member states in meeting their millennium development goals, which will not be achieved. Ireland has failed to protest against this and has not met its own goals. The reality is that, in many respects, there is no common EU standard of aid. The aid and trade issue is not being addressed. Many EU countries export military hardware to developing countries, which become inflamed and whose misery and poverty become entrenched as a consequence. Ireland, because of its history, should be more trenchant within the European Union to ensure that more coherent and consistent policies are developed in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">The main point I want to make concerns the role of the European Union in respect of Palestine, as mentioned by Deputy Michael D. Higgins. I refer not only to the Union's failure to protest against the occupation of Palestine but also to its failure to protest when the infrastructure of that country, in which it invested, was destroyed in the name of the security of another country. My party and I protest at the European Union's current policy of withholding money from Palestine, notwithstanding the difficulties the Hamas movement poses for many in this part of the world. The people suffering from this policy are individual Palestinians. The failure to provide resources and the shortage of medical supplies will ultimately increase fundamentalism, fanaticism and military and terrorist activity in the Middle East. Ireland, as a member of the European Union, should take no great pride in this policy, which is wrong and dangerous.</p>

        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_319">
          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_564">As I have a farcically short time in which to address the issue of Europe and the developing world, I will confine my comments to the role the European Union must play in challenging the malign influence of the international financial institutions in developing countries. I agree, in particular, with the comments of the previous three speakers.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">The plight of developing countries has been demonstrably aggravated by the policies and actions pursued by the IMF and the World Bank. These organisations pursue neoliberal and free market policies that take no account whatsoever of the social and human costs to developing countries. Their policies in recent decades have contributed to the overwhelming burden of debt under which developing countries toil.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Voting rights in the IMF and the World Bank are stacked in favour of the developed states, particularly the USA, and against developing countries. The selection procedures for IMF and World Bank leaders are totally undemocratic. These institutions are little more than sophisticated tools of modern imperialism. The European Union must take a lead role in pushing for the abolition of the World Bank and the IMF and, importantly, for the creation of new financial instruments under the control of a democratised UN.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">The European Union must also use its position of power and influence to advance the demand for the immediate abolition of the IMF-imposed structural adjustment programmes, which force Governments in developing countries to open up their states' economies to export more and spend less, thus reducing public spending drastically, cutting social budgets in areas such as health, education, housing and infrastructure, and ending subsidies on products and services of primary necessity. The so-called structural adjustment programmes have had drastic consequences for local populations in the affected countries because living conditions have deteriorated substantially since their introduction.</p>

          <p eId="para_569">I welcome the Minister of State and his initiative to build capacity and help states that have recently acceded to the Union to build their own overseas development programmes. Using Ireland as a mentor is a very good initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">I wish to raise two points, the first of which concerns conditionality and aid. As we all know, this issue can pose real dilemmas for donor states such as Ireland. Perhaps the problem is most acute in the occupied territories in Palestine. Will the Minister of State outline clearly to interested Members the position of Ireland and the EU, as part of the Quartet, in regard to the suspension of aid? This poses a dilemma for those of us who are extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in the occupied territories. There is deepening poverty in the occupied territories and the population there faces a possible collapse of infrastructure and of the institutions of the fledgling state. Will the Minister of State outline the threat this poses to the vision of having two viable states, namely, Palestine and Israel? How has Ireland articulated its position on this matter internationally? Is it appropriate that we should abandon the Palestinian people through the suspension of aid to the extent that millions of people will suffer from food shortages and a lack of basic services, sanitation, water, etc.?</p>
          <p eId="para_571">I wish to raise a matter of a more domestic nature that is of concern to Members of the House. Self Help, a long-standing partner organisation of the Irish Government in its overseas development programme, has unfortunately become embroiled in a controversy concerning the proportion of its public funding that has been spent on promotion and administration in Ireland rather than on projects for the needy in Africa, as was intended.</p>

          <p eId="para_572">Deputy O'Donnell's question on Ireland's position on Palestine is serious. I made Ireland's position clear in the Seanad recently and will give a longer answer on the Adjournment. Ireland favours the continuation of aid to the Palestinian people rather than interruptions to that aid. However, Ireland, along with the EU, expresses deep reservations about the recognition of Israel and the principle of non-violence. Along with the Quartet, Ireland is monitoring the situation but Irish aid to Palestine will continue. We spend €4.5 million at present and are examining ways of ring-fencing funding to help the poverty stricken people in their great difficulty. Our programme focuses on helping people out of poverty. If there are problems with institutions or administrations in Palestine or in Africa, it is our policy to remain engaged and identify ways in which we can give aid without Irish taxpayers' money being construed as assisting terrorists. We will remain engaged but we must examine the modality of how aid is delivered. We provide assistance to the Palestinian delegation in Ireland, predicated on support for President Mahmoud Abbas.</p>

          <p eId="para_600">This story is not told. Americans parade themselves as great benefactors but contribute tied aid and armaments. Young people may not be interested in domestic issues but every Member knows they have not lost the sense of passion about politics. Bob Geldof and the Make Poverty History campaign have mobilised young people on the question of global equity and justice. The major hero in this story is the EU, along with Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">I have monitored a number of elections in Africa and have been involved in politics in Namibia, South Africa and Niger. The bulk of European aid in Africa over the past 30 years has been wasted and much of it has been transferred to Swiss banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">Unless we deal with the problem of corruption in Africa we will not solve the problem of poverty. The Irish Aid programme should have a democracy building capacity as an integral part of the aid programme. Would the Minister of State consider the models that can allow this to take place? One option is the British model, the Westminster fund, where political parties can apply to fund programmes with international sister parties. Another is the US model, where individual political parties can establish foundations. Civil servants cannot teach political parties to run smart, clean machines. They have other skills.</p>

          <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_603">Deputy Quinn's suggestion is a fine one and I challenge the Members to devise a mechanism to exploit the undoubted talent within the Oireachtas. I refer to Deputies, Senators and those who work for political parties. These people have skills that could be used to in our aid programme. I would like a foundation entitled "The Oireachtas Foundation" to facilitate this and seek contributions from donors, as other countries have done. Now, because of affluence, we in Ireland have the capacity to do that. I recently read in <i>The Economist</i> that, on an international index, we are insufficiently provided with institutes and think-tanks of that kind. It is very important that it now start, and there is no better place than the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">I am not convinced the bulk of European aid has been wasted over the years, but we are all very open regarding the fact that a great deal of aid generally has been wasted over the last 20 or 30 years. A great deal was corrupted in a moral sense because of the Cold War conflict. In other words, aid was applied for the wrong purposes. I believe that Deputy Boyle referred to people adopting the sleazy agenda of supplying military hardware or political advice that was rather dubious in its strategic nature and make-up. We in Ireland are lucky enough, in that our hands are clean. The aid we provide is healthy and untied and not linked to the purchase of Irish commercial services.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">On the wider issue of European aid, it is true that for years it has not been the most efficient; let us be honest about it. There is now a process of tightening up, and last year saw the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. It would be criminal for what I have described as the donor world, of which we are a leading part, to increase the scale of aid and assistance without addressing corruption, governance and the effectiveness of our actions. There will be great pressure for rationalisation between donors, and we will very much be part and parcel of it. That was among the reasons I set up a mentoring initiative. We must learn in advance of very significant rationalisation and the removal of duplication in the efforts of various countries that donate to the developing world.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">Regarding the untold story of European aid, I wholeheartedly agree it is very appropriate on Europe Day that we state this very clearly. Some 60% of the increased aid flows coming as a result of the momentous development in 2000 are from the European Union and its donors. They are not coming from the G8 or elsewhere. Together with many other Ministers with responsibility for development, I decided regarding the timeframe of 2010 and 2015 for the collective European target of 0.7%. That alone will bring €20 billion into play for development by 2010. One can see the size of the European contribution, for example, in the debt relief package, which provided €25 billion. The increased flow of aid from Europe alone is almost as large as the relief aid package.</p>

          <p eId="para_612">Like other colleagues, I warmly welcome these statements on Europe Day. I know some of the questions have come from the public, and my question is linked with one of those. There is a reference to coherence in EU policy and talk of the need for constructive engagement between Europe and the developing world.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">My question is very much in the context of the earlier discussion with the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Fischer Boel. For Ireland, agriculture, development and trade form a very important debate. Ms Fischer Boel put some very useful points to us this morning in her honest, upfront answers to questions. I genuinely believe we have worked out a good, coherent policy on agriculture, trade and development regarding the WTO talks, although there are some difficulties with agriculture. I speak of the journey from Seattle to Doha, Cancún and Hong Kong. Is the Minister of State satisfied with the coherence at EU level on agriculture, trade and development?</p>
          <p eId="para_614">Regarding Deputy Quinn's comments, our position on development is good, but we can do much more at EU level to support developing countries to trade out of poverty. There is a much stronger need in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_616">Can we do more to encourage greater partnership, trade and investment between Europe and the developing world, especially Africa? There are fantastic agricultural products in many of the countries that I and other Members with experience of development have visited. Can we do more to promote greater constructive engagement with the developing world, especially Africa, and greater support? Can we call it "aid for trade" when it comes to supporting their products and developing partnerships between the European Union and Africa?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ConorLenihan" eId="spk_359" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs">
          <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_617">Deputy Kitt was my predecessor as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs. There is now much more co-ordination between agriculture, trade and development Ministers in the EU. That was very evident at Hong Kong in the private meetings, and also in some more public pronouncements. Obviously, one would hope there would be more and that we in Ireland could be more coherent. We will address that subject in our White Paper, which I intend publishing in September. We hope to conclude work on it during the summer and then put it to the Cabinet.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">Regarding the Private Sector Forum, there is room for much more involvement from Irish private sector companies. The Private Sector Forum, which was established by Deputy Kitt, has borne fruit. I do not mean that facetiously, since it is focused on a Ugandan food project involving fruit and biscuits and how they can be brought into retail outlets in Ireland and Britain. That has become a practical success story, and we are very proud that such engagement can be continued and improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">The broader issue of coherence concerns the European Union. There were very coherent discussions in Hong Kong, and people are becoming more coherent and talking more for the precise reason that Deputy Quinn outlined. Europe is doing great things on development but receiving very little credit for it. The Everything but Arms initiative has had an enormous impact on least-developed countries, and it is now being extended, albeit haltingly, since other countries are adopting it. Europe took the lead in granting total quota- and duty-free access to the wealthiest markets in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">The others present at Hong Kong and in those countries can learn from Europe, which is taking the initiative. A great many simplistic rationales are thrown at European agriculture, which is being reformed very vigorously. The Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, has stated that people, including farmers, need time to trade out of their subsidy regime, and that will happen between now and 2013. The Taoiseach is right to take that view from both a European and a national interest perspective.</p>

          <p eId="para_626">I am asking a simple question. What is Ireland's stance on humanitarian aid to Palestine? How did Ireland vote on the decision taken by the Council of Ministers? Was yesterday's UN decision a slap in the face for the EU regarding its original premature decision, which has seriously harmed services in Palestine and its people? Has anyone questioned Israel's attitude to withholding taxes that it should have paid to the Palestinian Authority? Some do not like the election result, but it was conducted fairly, and we should not penalise people for exercising their democratic right, even as we condemn Hamas. The Minister should give a straight answer regarding who made the decision, what side we were on, and whether we were for or against it.</p>

          <p eId="para_631">The key point, as Deputies Allen and Quinn are aware, is that there was no vote. Matters at European level are generally pursued by way of consensus. I have only been in this post for two years, but I have never been in a situation where there has been a vote at a gathering of European Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">Deputy Allen posed some serious questions and while I wanted to respond earlier, the procedure did not allow it. The Deputy inquired about decentralisation. I am glad that of the 124 posts we will relocate to Limerick, 34 have already been filled by officers who wish to move with the decentralisation project to Limerick. A further 17 posts will be filled in the coming months by staff from within the Department of Foreign Affairs who are due to return from overseas postings. We are very confident that we will meet our targets. The Office of Public Works has indicated that it has reached agreement on the terms of lease for our premises in Limerick. We are confident that the project will proceed and we are very happy with the numbers we are achieving. Clearly, we will need to monitor the issues of risk management and the protection of corporate management to which the Deputy referred. That is being done. Within my office, I have seen new people joining who are being inducted into the organisation and knowledge is being shared. I am confident that this project will be well executed and that it will reflect well on both the Department and the original decision to decentralise.</p>

          <p eId="para_638">The economic partnership agreements have, to a large extent, been misconstrued by many people in civil society and in the Dáil. The EPAs are development instruments designed to help these countries. They have not yet reached the deadline by which they are to be finished and operational. We have until 2008 in that regard. I am reassured by personally having raised the matter at various ministerial meetings and directly with Commissioner Mandelson. I was particularly encouraged by the remarks he made to the EU Development Ministers in Leeds that these are primarily viewed as development instruments, designed to encourage south-to-south trade, which is the key issue. While considerable talk and guff is engaged in regarding the WTO, one crucial point cannot be forgotten in this regard, namely, that 60% of levies and customs duties of various kinds are charged by developing countries against other developing countries. The important focus of EU aid efforts will be on how we can create regional integration within the continent of Africa. For example, east Africa has very ambitious plans to integrate its economies, namely, those of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, in a common market-style approach, which was how Ireland, as a country, gained from Europe.</p>

          <p eId="para_654">Deputy Carey referred to his recent visit to Ethiopia. We will continue our operation in Tigré and will consider the regional presence of our programme in that country. We are actively considering how we can spread our aid more regionally. Tigré is our only regional involvement. As the Deputy correctly stated, the safety net project saves up to 6 million people from dying as a result of famine. It is a very successful programme, of which other donors now want to be part.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">We are very strong on following up on and being concerned about human rights and other issues. We act in concert with our EU donor partners and with the Nordic plus group, of which we form a part in terms of our involvement in Addis Ababa and Ethiopia generally. Nobody has a magic answer as to how we could tidy up and make the Ethiopian Government improve its treatment of and respect for the opposition. At the recent meeting of the world's richest donor countries in Paris, the assistance committee of the OECD, this subject perplexed virtually every donor Minister who spoke. The OECD gave the simple advice to stay engaged and maximise the diplomatic pressure that can and should be applied to the Prime Minister, Mr. Meles Zenawi and his government. We will respond directly to Deputy Carey regarding the Action Aid lawyer.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">I have raised the problem of unspent aid numerous times, particularly in regard to humanitarian interventions. The EU was very slow to commit money to many high-profile human disasters in 2005. We criticised this, as did some of the Nordic donors. There is a problem around the European Union quickly disbursing aid both in the humanitarian sense——</p>

          <p eId="para_658">I do not know. It has perplexed us all that the European Union does not seem to make people aware that the money is there, or have it drawn down and disbursed. We have a good reputation in this regard but not all donors do. The European Union has been slow and we have put as much pressure as we can on the Commissioner, Mr. Michel, to disburse that money in a timely and efficient fashion.</p>

They want the EPAs to work but they also want the level of compensation they expect and deserve, and we are raising that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">Deputy Deasy raised the vexed issue of Zimbabwe. I cannot present a positive view of what is occurring there. I applaud the Deputy for holding a discussion and hearing on this in the Joint Committee on European Affairs, which he chairs. There is no easy answer. The European Union and other donors around the world have been urging, pressing and pushing African leaders, who are best placed to deal with this issue, to sort the matter out and bring pressure to bear on Robert Mugabe. This has not worked. Many people wonder how we can confront issues of governance and the renunciation of the democratic rights we take for granted but which are being routinely abused in Zimbabwe and elsewhere.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_702">My comments are directed at the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Treacy. I would like his opinion regarding the formation of one Department to deal with immigrant affairs. I listened to the contribution of the Minister, Deputy Martin. It is not good enough to say there is some co-ordination between Departments and that this may be sufficient. In the committee's experience there is very little co-ordination in some areas for dealing with immigrant affairs. It is not good enough to say it might not be a good idea to take responsibility from a Department just because it has particular expertise in an area. The committee made a unanimous decision with regard to the way in which immigrant affairs should be dealt with, whether that be the collection of data, information on working rights or an integration policy. There was clear concern that enough was not being done. The committee does not believe there is sufficient joined-up thinking between Departments to deal with an issue that is complex and diverse and which is growing daily.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">Our society is undergoing enormous change. The committee believes the traditional methods of administering these changes are not evolving quickly enough and this must be stressed. There is a need for a centralised approach for dealing with issues which affect immigrants. Over the course of approximately nine months the committee had many hearings on this topic and listened to many people. It became clear to us, week after week, on an all-party basis, that there was not sufficient joined-up thinking between Departments. The Minister of State will need to come back with a more acceptable answer than just stating it is not possible to infringe on another Department's jurisdiction because it may have expertise in a particular area.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">At the very least the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development was given a taste of the passion and concern that is present in this country regarding farming issues, and this will be helpful at the very least in any negotiations with the EU Commission from now on. She will understand the real concern in this country about the future of farming. It is curious she can point the finger at representatives in this House and almost accuse them of being responsible for some of the problems in farming while in the same breath agreeing that excessive EU regulation is directly responsible for some of the concerns of farmers. This is not so. Knowing this has been the case for ten or 15 years, one would need to come up with some solutions to deal with it because it is an extremely difficult issue for farmers. Farming is in massive decline and EU directives are contributing to that decline. It is not just as a result of globalisation and the Brazilians.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">With regard to the format for Europe Day, this House is a very conservative place and change of practice makes for a very lonely figure. At the least this House has demonstrated it can do things a little differently. However, with regard to justice, I still have my doubts whether this Government would go along with changes in the format of the debate. This was a change in the right direction and we have demonstrated we can do things in a different way but I still have my doubts as to whether there is an appreciation that changes in the format of debate are needed in this House. Debates in this House are usually set pieces. The format is formalised and there is very little spontaneity. The last couple of hours have not been too bad but the House needs to think long and hard about the involvement and interaction of the public. If the purpose was to reinforce the notion that European policy underlines domestic policy matters, then we have had a relatively successful day. National parliaments of member states were, for too long, the poor relations when it came to European matters. They have been the missing link in the European institutional architecture.</p>

          <p eId="para_707">For those not familiar with the term, the rapporteur is the person charged by his peer group to write a report of the day's proceedings. I will undertake that responsibility and circulate the report in due time. I associate myself with the words of thanks and appreciation.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">I offer the House some brief personal assessments of the day. The presence of the Commissioner in this Chamber, detached from either Opposition or Government, answering questions from both sides, was a major political innovation in which we should take some pride. Her personality and her engagement with the issue of the reality of decline in farming, is to be celebrated. She dealt more with the broader agricultural issues than the peculiarities of Mallow and the beet factory and we could have had much more time with her. I suggest that, in future, questions should be grouped three together. I doubt whether the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, needed to speak for 20 minutes today as she has other occasions to make a speech. I agree with other speakers that it was a courtesy to the Minister that she should speak, but she can speak anytime in this House whereas we will not have a Commissioner in the House for some time. Changes in the procedure of this House will only be by agreement so this is not a party or partisan issue but rather an issue of Oireachtas democratisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">It became clear during the debates on the European Constitution and on the treaty that the relationship between national parliaments and the European institutions is uneven and unequal and the balance needs to be re-established. One way to re-establish that relationship or to put it on a new level is to bring players from the European Commission who have the sole right of legislative initiative within our system, into this Chamber and ask them to explain their decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">Deputy Hayes cited the example of the directive on veterinary practices. The problems related to administration, bureaucratisation, specialisation, and the advantage given to the veterinary profession, did not originate in Brussels. They were compounded in the Department of Agriculture and Food because that Department along with the veterinary profession saw an empty train they could jump on and earn more fees by charging farmers to administer something which farmers used to do themselves. The committee has had this debate. Irrespective of what Administration is in office, every Department will tend to use legislation coming from the European Union to freeload onto it extra carriages that happen to suit a domestic agenda and then we blame the European Union for doing it. It would be timely to look at what happened in the Department of Agriculture and Food in the context of that example.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">I will circulate a report which will be signed off by the committee. We can then give it to the Ceann Comhairle so he and his officials can bring our experience of this shared exchange to the assembly of Speakers of the 25 member states to show them how it was done in Ireland. I am delighted to acknowledge the presence in the Chamber of the Government Chief Whip, whose help in this project was particularly constructive. If this experiment works, I propose that the House holds a Europe day or days in every one of the three sessions and that this would become part of the normal business of the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_713">In particular, public engagement of the type we have had today is exactly what Europe needs at this time. Quite a number of important questions from the public have been received by the joint committee, all of which deserve attention and individual responses. I pledge the Government's support and assistance in dealing with those responses through the committee. Many of the questions have been addressed in the discussions which we have had on specific topics in the House today. The Government has taken careful note of all the opinions and ideas expressed during the debates, as well as the points made by Deputies Quinn and Deasy in their concluding statements.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">In summing up, I would like to keep the emphasis on the future. As to what lies ahead, two upcoming events are worthy of mention, the informal Foreign Ministers' meeting in Austria this month and the European Council Meeting in June. Both have the future of Europe as their overarching theme. The phrase, "future of Europe", has often been seen as exclusively referring to the Union's structures and rules. The Union's structures are extremely important in underpinning the continuing effectiveness of the enlarged Union. The European constitution in terms of the period of reflection was carefully framed with that in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">However, as the topics for today's debates have proved, the future of Europe involves much more than the Union's structures. It is vital that the June European Council should seek to set a broad agenda for Europe's future, even if that future cannot be mapped out with full precision at this stage. We need to envision the future in terms not only of structures and rules but of real policy decisions, which will add value to our citizens' daily lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">This brings me to the question from the public, namely, whether EU legislation is relevant to ordinary citizens. That question struck a chord with me. This is a seemingly straightforward but important question. The short answer is: it is relevant. The problem is that citizens may not perceive the same connection with EU legislation as they do with national laws. If the European Union fails to communicate the reality of EU legislation and its democratic provenance, there is a real risk of public rejection of European integration.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">Communication on EU issues needs to be greatly improved. For this reason, I warmly welcome the Austrian Presidency's current emphasis on two simple mottoes, "Europe listens" and "Europe at work". We must listen to our people, as we have today, and we must then work hard on their behalf. To answer that question further about relevance, many concrete actions can be identified across policy fields such as the environment, transport, agriculture, food safety, research support, equality and development. Our citizens already benefit from tangible measures in place ranging from the euro to smaller-scale projects such as the European health insurance card.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The House will recall that the Taoiseach proposed another such concrete action at the March European Council, that of reducing or removing mobile phone roaming charges across the EU. I was happy to read yesterday of significant roaming price reductions already having been proposed by some major operators. Let us hope this is only the start of another EU inspired achievement with immediate benefits for our citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">I strongly believe the key to reconnecting Europe with its citizens lies in proving its value to them through real and relevant measures. I have a strong sense that this requirement is fully appreciated across the Union and I expect EU leaders to continue to stress the need for effective delivery of real benefits in the months ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">In our enhanced engagement with European issues through Europe Day, we have noted that the future of Europe and Ireland's place in Europe necessarily covers considerable ground. This includes the Union's structures; how and where decisions are made, a matter on which there was a serious debate during which many good questions were asked — some of which were not answered; the Union's size and membership; the movements of its citizens between member states; and EU external policies, including those on trade, development and humanitarian aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">It is apt that Europe Day has taken place in this House at this time of the year. On 10 May 1940 the war on the Continent's mainland intensified dramatically, as the fighting extended as far as its Atlantic borders. Three years after the end of the war the Hague Congress met from 7 to 11 May 1948 and brought together 1,000 delegates from 20 European countries to consider new forms of co-operation in Europe. That led to the setting up of another valuable body in which Ireland is proud to play its part, namely, the Council of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">Yesterday was Schuman Day, now known across the Union as Europe Day. Deputies Quinn, Carey, Costello and myself participated in some wonderful events on the streets of Dublin yesterday, most memorably perhaps at the <i> Café d’Europe</i> event at Bewley’s on Grafton Street. Europe Day marks what many consider to be the birthday of the European Union when Robert Schuman made his historic speech on 9 May 1950 outlining his and Jean Monnet’s vision for co-operation between European states.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">More recently in our history on 3 May 1998 the European Council approved the entry of Ireland and other member states into the single currency. Perhaps most significantly 1 May 2004 was that historic day when, here in Ireland, Europe's leaders gathered to formally mark the Union's biggest ever enlargement of ten new member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">I sincerely congratulate Deputies Deasy, Quinn, Allen and all their colleagues on the Joint Committee on European Affairs. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his vision and co-operation, the Government Chief Whip and everybody who co-operated to make this a truly important, relevant, unique and special parliamentary day for our citizens with the attendance of the European Commissioner and everybody involved. I also thank Members for their contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">Thankfully, the past 60 years have shown that the month of May when we celebrate Europe Day has become a time for bringing Europeans closer together. Without doubt, the challenge now is to bring the Union closer to its people. Today's sessions, involving those of us privileged to be Ireland's elected representatives, have been a most valuable step in that direction.</p>

          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mary Coughlan)</from>
          <p eId="para_746">I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this motion. As the House heard last evening, my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is leading a cross-departmental cross-agency approach in developing and implementing our renewable energy policy. That Fine Gael has ignored the range of initiatives taken by the Government means either that it is not up to speed on this important area or that it is simply trying to be opportunistic. The Minister made it clear last night that the Government is pursuing a coherent and joined-up approach to the promotion of renewable energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">The promotion of biofuels is one element in the development of renewable energy. As agriculture can play a central role in supplying raw materials for biofuels, the Department of Agriculture and Food has been working closely with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The agriculture and forestry sectors have the potential to be the sources of many feedstocks for biofuels. Oilseed rape, wheat and sugar beet have the potential to be used for the manufacture of liquid transport biofuels, while forestry by-products and other farming and food by-products such as meat and bonemeal and tallow can be used for energy and heat generation. Tallow can also be used for biodiesel production. Other energy crops such as short rotation coppice and miscanthus can be used for heat and electricity generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">Biofuels are being developed not only because we need to decrease our dependence on fossil fuels for environmental and cost reasons, but also because the growing of energy crops for the purposes of the development of biofuels offers new opportunities to rural communities and economies. The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which was agreed in 2003, gives farmers the freedom to exploit new farming opportunities, including agricultural production for non-food uses. Supports may be granted to farmers for the growing of energy crops only in accordance with EU regulations. Such support is currently provided by means of the energy crops scheme which was introduced under the CAP reform programme and is administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food. Under this scheme, energy crops may qualify for aid of €45 per hectare as long as they are intended primarily for use in the production of biofuels and electric and thermal energy produced from biomass. In addition to this scheme, set-aside land can be used for a variety of non-food uses, including the growing of crops for energy purposes. Therefore those who use such lands in that way can qualify to activate set-aside entitlements under the single payment scheme. The EU has agreed that sugar beet will be eligible for aid under the scheme and may also be grown as an energy crop on set-aside land. Fine Gael does not appear to be aware of this.</p>

          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_750">I accept the €45 per hectare available under the energy crops scheme is a small enough incentive for the growing of energy crops and is not sufficiently attractive in itself to stimulate the growing of such crops. I called for a review of the premium at the February meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council for that reason. I am pleased the European Commission has undertaken to review the operation of the scheme, which was reiterated today by the Agriculture and Rural Development Commissioner, Mariann Fischer Boel, on the floor of this House. The production and utilisation of agricultural products for energy purposes can be sustained in the longer term only if biofuels generate a more favourable return than traditional market outlets. I am confident the extension in the last budget of excise relief of €205 million, which will support the use and production of 163 million litres of biofuels annually when it is fully operational, will help to drive additional demand for the production of energy crops.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">Following the decision by Greencore to cease sugar production in Ireland, it has been suggested that bioethanol production might provide an alternative outlet for the sugar beet crop, possibly using the facilities in Mallow. The agreement on the reform of the EU sugar regime provides for a restructuring scheme under which a sugar manufacturer that renounces its quota and completely dismantles a sugar factory may receive 100% of the restructuring aid available, of which at least 10% is to be reserved for growers and contractors. The option of partially dismantling a factory and using it for non-sugar production, while continuing to attract 75% of the aid available, is also open to sugar manufacturers. During the negotiations leading to the agreement, I argued strongly that the provision in the agreement relating to partial dismantling should be extended as an incentive to the production of bioethanol. I am glad we achieved that aim. The question of full or partial dismantling and the continued use of the Mallow plant for bioethanol production are matters for commercial decision by Greencore. Under the relevant regulations, the initiative in this regard rests with the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">As the Minister for Agriculture and Food, I hold a single special share in Greencore. The share does not empower me to get involved in the company's operational matters or normal business decisions. I refer to a decision to use the facilities for bioethanol production, for example. However, I raised the possibility of using the Mallow plant for ethanol production with Greencore having regard to the option under the restructuring scheme, the inclusion of sugar beet in the energy crops scheme and the expanded excise relief scheme. The company informed me it does not intend to produce bioethanol in Mallow, but the framework remains in place whereby other potential developers could consider the option.</p>

          <p eId="para_755">The importance and significance of biomass is increasing within the wider agenda of agriculture and energy policy generally. Most biomass energy in Ireland is derived from wood products which are converted into heat. The exploitation of wood resources, especially pulp wood, sawmill residues and harvestable forest residues, offers enormous potential and could contribute significantly to meeting our energy and heat requirements. Ireland has an excellent climate for growing and an ongoing supply of raw materials for wood fuel. The Minister for Finance has confirmed that the existing income tax exemption for forestry will not be changed, as its significant environmental benefits have been verified by a cost benefit analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">Wood residues are being used to produce heat for sawmills across the country. The wood energy market is poised for growth with the emergence of a number of commercial start-ups and a supply chain. The €27 million "greener homes" grant programme for the domestic sector, which was announced by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources recently, will help to drive demand for wood biomass. The levels of grant aid to be made available for commercial scale biomass boilers, which will be announced in the coming weeks, will stimulate demand further. The Department of Agriculture and Food is actively promoting the use of wood biomass through grants to promote and develop sustainable forestry, including alternative timber uses. It is close to finalising a scheme of supports for the purchase of specialist wood biomass harvesting equipment. It is directly promoting the use of wood biomass by installing a wood-using heating system in the Department's offices at Johnstown Castle.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">Short rotation coppice and miscanthus have considerable potential for heat and electricity generation. The production of short rotation coppice is relatively undeveloped in Ireland, however. Therefore, the costs of production, especially the substantial initial establishment costs, will be high due to the economies of scale. The Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, is pursuing a proposal to reactivate establishment grants for short rotation coppice. I have received a number of proposals for the introduction of establishment grants for miscanthus and they are being considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">The Department of Agriculture and Food, in conjunction with Teagasc and COFORD, has examined the potential of energy crops, wood biomass and farming and food by-products. Last year, it started to provide direct funding on a competitive basis to support priority research projects relating to biofuels. This funding is channelled through the Department's research stimulus fund programme. Three of the projects selected under the 2005 call for proposals, which relate directly to biofuel and energy crops, received grant assistance of €900,000. The funding available under the programme has been substantially increased. A further call for projects was recently advertised in the national press. This call also relates to the non-food uses of agricultural land.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">Apart from purpose-grown energy crops and wood biomass, several by-products of the farming and food processing industries can be recovered and used in various ways as biofuels. I refer mainly to animal by-products such as meat and bonemeal, tallow, animal manures and food by-products. Some of the many significant opportunities for the use of animal by-products as biofuels are being considered actively. The proposals in question are being driven by commercial realities. As the disposal of by-products imposes a cost on industry, it makes economic sense to offset this cost by realising the potential of the by-products as energy sources. Tallow is used as a biofuel in thermal boilers in rendering plants and larger meat export plants to provide energy. A recent EU regulation provides for the conversion of tallow to biodiesel. Some rendering plants are considering building biodiesel plants for this purpose using various combinations of tallow, recovered vegetable oil and rapeseed oil. The importance of biofuels and bioenergy is recognised in the agri-vision 2015 action plan. The Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, and I will continue to work closely with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to ensure agriculture contributes to the development of biofuels as part of a coherent energy policy.</p>

          <p eId="para_788">In every great journey, the first step is the most important, and we have taken several important first steps. People talk about the bigger picture, but sometimes the smaller picture can add to the bigger picture. The smaller picture is sometimes as important, as I thought last night when I walked the two miles to where I stay and saw the number of people stuck in their cars who were making probably a very small journey.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">We talk about the rising price of petrol and diesel and the use of cars. One of the first things that we have to do is think about the small steps that we can take to reduce the number of times we use our car and go for that walk when we can rather than creating more traffic. I do not underestimate the fact that one of the biggest industries in my constituency is in selling diesel and petrol, with many people coming from the Six Counties not only to see our beautiful area but to avail themselves of the cheaper petrol. A big step is needed to get fit by getting out of our cars and using our feet and walking or cycling rather than always driving. Last week someone called in to collect me from Monkstown. It took one hour and 15 minutes to come in and one hour and 10 minutes to go back out. I could have walked it faster.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">Windmills as a source of energy are being supported in many parts, and I hope that continues in areas such as Donegal which I am told has the best wind potential in the country. I want to put on notice that a windmill was applied for in the Tunes Plateau near Lough Foyle. I do not think wind energy has to be accepted just because it is wind energy. In areas where there is a natural sea fishery, that can be as important as the ability to have wind energy. In those situations, the sea has uses. There is tidal power and there are other hydro schemes that would be as efficient and not as intrusive as windmills in that location.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">Why do we not use the sea more for freight? While we have invested a significant amount of money in harbours and piers, I still think there is an opportunity to maximise the use of freight by sea rather than road. At the same time, I accept that fishermen and boating companies alike suffer from the same issue of rising fuel costs, but it is something that should be examined. It also comes within the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">The natural gas link from Dublin to Belfast and the one from Belfast to Derry have been very important in giving alternative sources of energy. Will the Minister continue that pipeline from Belfast through Derry and on into Donegal because we would benefit in our energy uses from that? There are other ways in which to reduce the freight costs by using the train system. We have a very good Dublin-Belfast service, but it could also lead on to Derry, and there could be a Dubln-Derry freight service via rail which would provide alternative transport to the significant investment that we have given Derry through the airport, which has improved access anyway.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">While we have had significant and important improvements in public transport within Dublin with the Luas, for example, at the same time there is the alternative of people using their feet rather than driving short distances. They can do that in their own areas and not just in the big cities.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">I commend the Government on the insulation grant and the different grants that have been made available down the years to improve old houses to make them more energy efficient. I congratulate the Government on the €27 million spend on the recent environmentally friendly homes initiative. That is very important. I was asked recently by a person who is going to build a home next year whether water turbines would be included as well as the current parameters. It is important that all aspects of environmentally friendly energy saving issues be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">I encourage more forestry and welcome the Minister's remarks on biofuels. I raised the issue today with Commissioner Fischer Boel because it is important that the drive to biofuels is not at the total expense of people moving out of food agriculture into biofuels. I commend the Government on what it is doing. There is still a way to go, but we are going in the right direction.</p>

        <speech by="#JimmyDevinsFF" eId="spk_479">
          <from>Dr. Devins</from>
          <p eId="para_796">I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on this important issue. We are all well aware in this House of the impending shortage of fossil fuel. Recent increases in petrol and diesel prices are a salutary reminder of how exposed Ireland is to any variation in worldwide oil prices, which we can do absolutely nothing about. The upward spiral in petrol costs poses a major difficulty to the continuing successful management of the economy which this Government has been undertaking for several years. That is one potent argument in favour of the development of alternative fuels. Equally potent and perhaps more important in the long term, is the ever-present and increasingly real threat of global warming. Fossil fuels produce carbon dioxide, which hastens global warming with potentially disastrous effects on the world climate, and by implication on economies and lifestyles. It is therefore essential that a coherent, viable and impenetrable energy policy is in place in Ireland,</p>
          <p eId="para_797">The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dempsey, has such a policy in place, as he outlined in the debate last night. Time does not allow me to discuss in detail the various innovative and sustainable developments the Government has initiated. I will confine myself to two important measures. The first of these is the €205 million biofuel excise relief package announced in last year's budget. Three different types of biofuel are available. In the budget last December a five-year package of excise duty relief was introduced. Uptake of these tax reliefs is driving the production of biofuels. At present it appears the level of production is such that by 2008 we will have a market share of more than 2% in biofuels.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">This represents a real achievement when it is considered that Ireland is starting from a very low base. Already there has been enormous interest in the scheme and currently various manufacturing facilities for biofuel are up and running throughout the country. There is no doubt that the potential for transfer from fossil fuel to biofuel is enormous. I urge the Minister to allow further excise relief on biofuels being placed on the market in the near future. A recent report on biofuels suggested that excise relief is the most effective short-term measure for developing this market. Other initiatives, however, such as renewable energy obligations, might be more beneficial in the long term. I am sure the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, will give due consideration to all this implies.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">The second measure is the recent announcement by the Minister of grants payable to domestic homes. These grants will allow individual householders to obtain money for the installation of technologies to use renewable energy. Grants can vary from €1,100 to €6,500, depending on the technology being used. For example, there is a grant of €4,200 for the provision of a wood chip or pellet boiler to provide heating in a house. Ireland has an excellent climate for growing timber. There has been an enormous increase in the Irish forestry sector and already wood residue is being used to supply heat in various situations. This is a renewable energy source provided from within Ireland and is a good example of bio-energy. The grant of €4,200 towards the provision of boilers that use wood residue would be of great help to householders who want to use a renewable energy source while at the same time saving a considerable amount of money in the future as the price of oil and gas continues to rise. I understand there has been a considerable take-up of these greener home grants and this reflects the willingness of the public to embrace renewable energy technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">I congratulate the Minister on his initiatives. I urge him to continue down this road and I  commend the Government amendment to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnCartyFF" eId="spk_480">
          <from>Mr. Carty</from>
          <p eId="para_801">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak to this motion. I commend Deputy Dempsey on the initiatives he has taken since becoming Minister. The most important one was reflected in the budget for 2006 where a five-year package of excise relief valued at €205 million was announced for biofuel schemes. These schemes will allow Ireland to achieve 2% market penetration of biofuels up to 2008. Funding is also being provided towards the capital cost of developing the processing facilities for biofuels. In my region the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology is involved in processing recovered vegetable oil. If this project is successful, it will contribute greatly to energy savings.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">Farmers, too, have an opportunity in producing wood and copse for biofuels. It is most interesting that the by-products of meat, bonemeal and tallow can also be used, because there is a major problem as regards getting rid of such products. We had to export them in the past, and it would be an ideal opportunity to utilise them at this point. I also commend the Minister on the €27 million for the greener homes domestic grants scheme. That is part of a multi-annual finance package of €65 million for renewable energy, which will include grants for a range of renewable heat, electricity and transport initiatives. One of the good parts to this is that the number of applications received by the Department within the scheme's first month was 1,600, and some 1,100 have already been approved. This shows the scheme is being availed of by householders who must be complimented on taking the initiative, as must the Minister for putting it in place.</p>

          <from>Mr. Callanan</from>
          <p eId="para_803">I am grateful for the opportunity to address the House on what will be one of the major political issues of the next ten years. Since the introduction of the greener homes grant by the Government, I have been surprised at the level of interest among the public for alternative energy heating sources. The current oil price has certainly alerted most of the public to the critical need to lower our reliance on fossil-based energy sources such as oil and gas. All politics is local and on Monday night I spoke to the Mountbellew active retirement group and explained the grants that were available — the geothermal heating systems, wood-pellet burners and stoves and the solar panels. More than half the group had requested application forms. Elderly people are most in need of assistance as they spend relatively large amounts on home heating oil.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">As a farmer I have lived my life actively aware of the need to protect the environment. Many urban dwellers may be somewhat sceptical as regards a farmer claiming to care about sustaining the environment. Without sustaining the environment, however, farming cannot survive. The future of rural Ireland lies in the willingness of the people striving to make farming profitable to embrace new trends. The explosion of organic foods and the regeneration of farmers' markets all indicate a trend towards the return of farming allied to the opportunities for renewable energy crops in the tillage area. I compliment Teagasc on the great work it is doing in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">A campaign is under way in south Galway to lobby for a resource recovery park similar to those that already are to be found in Australia and Canada. I have been impressed by the arguments in this regard and the ability of such initiatives to create employment, while helping to recover waste from what, too often in the past, could not be reconditioned or recycled. I hope my ministerial colleagues in the area of environmental and natural resources and Galway County Council will give the group all the assistance it needs to bring the project to fruition as the town of Gort is in need of new employment opportunities. The west of Ireland, too, is in need of innovation as regards waste management.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">I raised the issue of refineries for renewable energy crops in the media last week, based on the towns that once had sugar beet factories. In particular, I hope the western refinery will be based in Tuam. I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to speak and I compliment the Government on the great work it is doing.</p>

          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_809">The Fine Gael motion is timely and I congratulate its Deputies for bringing it forward. It dovetails nicely with the motion brought forward by Independent Deputies last week, which forced the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to have a change of heart as regards the better exploitation of our natural resources by the people. The finite nature of carbon resources has been well flagged. This makes it imperative that the State invest heavily in alternative sources of energy which do not change the environment, are sustainable and indigenous. The potential is all around us — wind power, wave power, tidal energy and solar power. What has been lacking is vision on the part of Government to face up to a critical situation. The small amount of energy generated from alternative sources is evidence of that failure. We are all aware of alternative energy projects that did not get the go-ahead. For example, wind farm turbine projects are constantly being refused planning permission.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">One essential missing ingredient in this area is meaningful community involvement. I do not speak of token involvement but of true partnership between the community and the State in bringing these projects to fruition and in their ongoing running.</p>

          <p eId="para_812">The Government has lacked vision in terms of involving communities. One needs only look at the evidence provided by group water schemes to show how keen people are to be involved at community level. Communities set these up and have been involved in running them on a voluntary basis with very little help from Government, particularly in the past. Those communities are willing to get involved and I urge the Government not to miss the opportunity but to accept the challenge to involve communities. We could have a bright future in this regard.</p>

          <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_813">This motion has identified the need to incentivise the use of biofuels, which is welcome. However, I am surprised that given the widespread public concern about the price of gas and home heating oil the list of demands was so limited. The two areas that absorb the greatest amount of energy are transport and our homes. Clearly, we need to adopt an energy policy that looks at changes in these two key areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">Given that €20 million of taxpayers' money has been set aside in this year's budget under the heading, carbon trading, which allows developed countries buy pollution permits from poorer countries, it makes economic sense that our dependence on imported energy sources, which is currently as high as 90% and is something of which this Administration should be ashamed, should have been attacked aggressively in the lifetime of the Government. Despite a huge increase in energy use, the fact that alternative energies contribute less than 3% to that demand is scandalous.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">It makes complete economic sense for us to make significant inroads into changing our ways. We need to stop focusing on shunting vehicles around and consider how we can move people and goods much more efficiently. There is no better way to do this than by building a comprehensive public transport system. While there are many positive proposals in Transport 21, a delivery timeframe of ten years is too long and must be reconsidered.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">Renewable energy comes in many shapes and forms. Some types, such as solar energy, can be generated in a home setting. With gas and home heating oil prices set to rocket, there is no doubt that some householders will be in a position to change the energy they use in their homes. Clearly, this was the intention of the grant package announced recently. I repeat the complaint I made last week about the difficulties being encountered by some people in trying to ascertain if they need planning permission for such projects. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has not issued guidelines to local authorities. We need joined-up thinking in this area if people are to get involved. A campaign to inform the public must be initiated on how people can reduce their energy consumption, together with action packs on changing to renewable energies.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_817">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on energy costs but we must also look seriously at the public health issues which are involved. I call on all Deputies and the Government to be radical, creative and sensible on the issue of energy. We need to be proactive in developing policies. Dithering or delaying is no longer an option. The Independent Deputies will always support sensible, clean, creative energy policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">My concerns are basically the increased costs of energy arising from global instability and the threat this presents to our economy, coupled with the economic impact of our failure to meet our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. I condemn the Government for its failure to act in a meaningful way on the alternative energy agenda. The current measures in place to improve Ireland's renewable energy output are totally inadequate.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">I strongly support the section in the motion which calls for the removal of excise duty on biofuels to stimulate production. It is most important that an appropriate agency would be set up to co-ordinate the research required for the development of the renewable energy sector. I warn those who are trying to sneak in nuclear energy by the back door that they will be challenged most strenuously in this House. I welcome the debate and call for radical, new and creative policies on energy.</p>

          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_820">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. We are now six years into the 21st century and Ireland remains heavily dependent on the fuel that powered us more than 100 years ago. Since that time we have sent rockets into outer space and put men on the moon, yet we are still dependent on this fuel. In recent months President Bush went so far as to state that our dependence on oil is an addiction. The only solution to an addiction is to recognise one has it and then to take steps to cure it. That is the situation with which we are now faced.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">If one is in a situation where a car can run at 120 km/h up until the last second before it runs out, the moral of the story is that energy shortages can happen almost instantaneously. We only have to examine the situation in the Middle East which is most unstable and the threat of war is ever present. This leads to increases in the price of oil and, in turn, to it becoming scarcer. Every so often we get trapped in a vicious cycle in this regard. I suspect another such crisis is imminent.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">When Saudi Arabian oil production peaks, oil production around the world will enter a period of irreversible decline. There is rising demand for oil in India and China, which is in second place in terms of worldwide demand. Demand is rising at a rapid rate and an oil production peak is fast approaching. The worst thing we can do is be in denial. We must recognise we have a problem and begin to address it.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">Cambridge Energy Research Associates expect oil supplies to hold out for the next 20 to 30 years before the decline impacts. Recent forecasts have predicted oil prices will climb to $120 a barrel and this will have serious consequences for the price of goods and services which will hit us right across the board. The cost of heating an average home will rise significantly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesBreen" eId="spk_490">
          <from>Mr. J. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_824">Our dependence on imported energy sources is currently as high as 90%, something of which this Administration should be ashamed. This dependence should have been attacked aggressively in the lifetime of the Government. It is scandalous that despite a major increase in energy use, alternative energies contribute less than 3% of that output.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">We have known for years of the dwindling oil reserves around the world and the associated rise in cost of supply, yet nothing constructive was done to address this shortfall until recently when — as with everything else this Government eventually addresses — reports and inquiries were sanctioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, stated last evening he would shortly announce the establishment of an energy research council to advise on the development of an energy research policy. This should have been established nine years ago when this Government first came to power. The simple fact is that this Administration has no idea of energy policy, how best to maximise alternative energy supplies and at 5% has failed to meet or even come close to its requirements under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">I stated previously in this House that in a written reply to a parliamentary question tabled by me, the Minister stated he hoped to have interconnectors operational by 2012. These interconnectors should be a priority. We should currently be in advanced consultation with our British counterparts to determine the best way forward for putting them in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">We are all aware of wind as a natural resource but action needs to be taken to advance its use and to increase the construction of wind farms. We need to tackle the delays and the high costs of obtaining connections to the national grid for wind farms. We then need to ensure the urgent installation of those interconnectors with our EU partners in the event that wind temporarily fails us.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">Renewable energy has to supply 13.2% of total energy consumption by 2010 and currently we are not even halfway there. At total of 13.2% is approximately 1,450 MW of installed energy capacity. Biomass technologies currently supply about 30MW. Budget 2006 announced grant aid of €65 million over the next five years for renewable energy schemes, that is €13 million per year. If this grant aid amount were ten times higher I would think the Government was serious about its supposed energy policy.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_491">
          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_830">I am happy on behalf of the Green Party to support this Fine Gael motion. First I will make a couple of technical points. While I agree with the motion, the call by Fine Gael for a requirement on all filling stations to use a biofuel mix is a proper long-term development the Government should undertake. If that could be achieved, it would remove the requirement on the State to abolish excise duty on such fuels. The cost of the biofuel support would, therefore, be borne by the oil companies rather than the taxpayer. The State should seek to do this quickly once the industry has been established. The Department must be clear on what is possible in designating fuel sources to provide the supply for such biofuels and on whether a requirement can be set under WTO rules for domestic or European farmers to produce such fuels. Such clarity would give farmers certainty when investing.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">Energy policy must consider the broad picture of energy use, which is generally divided into three categories — transport, heating and electricity generation. Because fuel is interchangeable and the price varies depending on global supply, the issue must be addressed across all areas. The motion concentrates exclusively on transport, which is valid because it is very important, but if one takes a broader perspective and analyses what our land and resources can be used for, one may take a different position. While the provision of biofuels would be useful in securing supply, ensuring money is invested in domestic farms rather than in Saudi Arabia and reducing carbon emissions, a policy issue arises because if Irish land is used to develop biomass crops for heating and power generation, a higher return may be achieved in carbon reduction, energy efficiency and revenue for the farmer. Power is used in a more efficient manner in this context and a broad, integrated policy must be developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">It has been argued that parties have taken on green clothes, but the issues of peak oil and climate change, which are linked, are of such fundamental importance that radical changes are needed and every Member needs to take on such green thinking. This would lead to further change. The Minister's response to the motion was comical and his failure in this area is farcical, with people crying rather than laughing. He stated, "The Government has delivered an ambitious programme of renewable and sustainable development and it has a comprehensive and holistic strategy in the area." That, unfortunately, is a scandalous disgrace.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_492">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_833">It is important that a clear message is sent to the Government that radical and sincere changes are needed, as my colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, stated. People are trying to establish businesses such as Ecofuels Limited in Killarney, County Kerry. I received a letter from the owner when I visited Kerry a month ago about his experience of trying to set up a biodiesel business. He states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_834">I have been working on the project for several years to produce biodiesel from used cooking oil but, as you know, it is not viable without excise relief. I have everything in place — premises, equipment, permits, supply of oil, etc. — but cannot produce any biodiesel for sale because Customs and Excise are insisting on €36.805 cent per litre plus VAT. I have to export my oil where it is used to produce dog food in the UK rather than biodiesel in Ireland. I have received absolutely no assistance from government to date, only a lot of harassment from Customs and Excise. Brian Cowen announced €20 million of excise relief in the December budget but there has been no movement in granting this excise relief to producers. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is the Department responsible for administering this relief. Even when they do get around to granting excise relief, I have no guarantee of benefiting from it. The Department are notorious for attaching crazy conditions that might make it impossible for my business to secure excise relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">That is the reality on the ground. I ask the Minister of State and the Government to closely examine the difference between their rhetoric and delivery because they are not the same. This company can only sell biodiesel as a lubricant, yet it has a full tax clearance certificate and has the capacity to produce 1 million litres. Meanwhile, the waste oil from restaurants is, in many cases, poured into drains causing pollution and logistical problems for local authorities, which are exacerbated by the Government turning a blind eye to a significant resource. The Minister of State should take direct action to ensure companies in a position to roll out the production of alternative fuels, such as pure plant oil and making use of waste products, can do so without being impeded by the Government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_493">
          <from>Mr. Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_836">I support the general thrust of this motion. Sinn Féin has advocated an even more radical approach focused on production as well as the fiscal incentives proposed in the motion. The production of the energy crops necessary to produce biofuels is a vital component. It is welcome, therefore, that the Government has altered its approach to the grant scheme covering such crops and removed the previous exclusion of sugar beet. I suggested this two years ago and pointed to the potential of sugar beet crop and the current processing facilities at Carlow and Mallow for the production of biofuels, given that the sugar sector has been sacrificed at EU level.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">The importance of the production aspect was highlighted in the report on biofuels strategy published in 2004 by Sustainable Energy Ireland, which pointed out that the State would only be capable of producing 23% of the requirement if the 2010 target of 5.75% biofuels was to be met. The report concluded, therefore, that substantial imports would be required. In other words, a large gap could be filled if an appropriate grant structure was in place and if substantial research and development was conducted to encourage farmers to move into this area. The redirection of the sugar beet crop accounts for part of this but the growth of energy crops could also have been more attractive to farmers since the introduction of the single farm payment. In the new context, where that source of funding is no longer dependent on the old subsidies system, farmers have more freedom to plan their production to meet new and potentially valuable demands.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">Energy crops is one such area. It is also important that Ireland should have its own energy crop and biofuels sector for broader economic reasons. The sugar plants, for example, could provide a viable source of alternative employment, as would the industrial production of these fuels at new locations. It is also vital, especially given renewed concerns over future energy needs and security of supply, that as much of our demand as possible is supplied from domestic sources. If that is not the case, biofuels will become another source for which we will be dependent on imports.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">It is also uniquely suited to this country as, unlike with most fossil fuels, we have the potential to supply our requirement for energy crops. This also provides a potentially large alternative new sector for Irish farmers, which might well contribute to a reversal of the current trend in the rapid decline of family farming. As the Sustainable Energy Ireland report highlighted, while difficulties are impeding the expansion of the scope for the growth of such crops, none is insurmountable in the context of CAP reform. As with the inclusion of sugar beet under a grant scheme, therefore, it mainly requires the political foresight and will to ensure those barriers are removed. Above all, they require that this should be made an integral part of a new strategy for Irish agriculture, which is urgently required if the sector is to adapt and prosper under the new order.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_494">
          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_840">I am delighted to speak on this issue for two reasons, namely, because I am Fine Gael spokesperson on agriculture and because I am from the west. With petrol prices creeping towards 125 cent per litre and with the associated impact on electricity and gas costs, many jobs in the west and in the northwest are under threat, unless serious action is taken to develop alternative energy sources. The west and north west are the most vulnerable regions because most of our employment is based on primary production or manufacturing, which is the sector most vulnerable to price increases for energy. Unless the Government is prepared to acknowledge that a problem exists and adopts the principles outlined in this motion, there will be significant job losses in the west and the northwest. In this scenario, jobs will migrate to lower-cost locations in other parts of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">We are in the most exposed region in the country and we do not have adequate energy sources. We should try to develop combined heat and power sources in the region, as well as developing the woodchip and renewable energy sector, yet none of that has happened. We do not have gas pipelines, nor do we have the basic electricity infrastructure in place and the cost of that is a serious threat to many jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">The Minister for Agriculture and Food stated that the Mallow sugar factory will attract 75% of the compensation that may be made available through the sugar reforms. Can the farming community receive the maximum level of compensation available to it if the plant in Mallow is retained for the processing of bioethanol? The Minister states that the regulations are in place, but the reality is that the regulations have not yet come from Brussels. There is still an opportunity to impress on the Commission the need to ensure that there is flexibility for that compensation, that farmers get the maximum level possible and that we develop an alternative industry based on those plants. There is an onus on the Minister to impress on the Commission the need to look at the rules, to ensure that there are no barriers to the development of an alternative fuel industry. The proposals, as they stand at the moment, are a barrier to the development of a bioethanol facility here.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">Deputy Fiona O'Malley raised a point about excise duty on biofuels. She stated that there are problems with implementing it, such as changing the legislation to blend 2% of biodiesel and 5% of bioethanol into petrol and diesel. There are no problems with it, but the difficulty is that every time a proposal is made, the Government finds a way to put a barrier against the development of the renewable energy sector. There is an easy solution to the problem of imports from Brazil, namely, to put duty on all imported fuels. Fuel created in Ireland from renewable energy sources can be exempt from duty if duty is put on fuels at the point of entry. That would solve the problem, but the Government is not prepared to consider addressing problems, it would prefer to come up with more of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">Fine Gael has published a practical and realistic blueprint for renewable energy. There are two strands to it. The first is to create demand and we have outlined some of those proposals in the motion before the House. The second strand is to create capacity, especially in the area of biofuels, by encouraging the establishment of producer groups, in which farmers and private industry could put forward proposals for the development of alternative processing facilities. We would encourage a public competition for farmers and the private sector to develop such proposals, which could be grant-aided. I commend this motion to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_495">
          <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_845">There is nothing more important facing this country than the issue of having a proper plan for alternative energy. Energy costs are going through the roof and they will affect employment and people in their own homes. We in Fine Gael have a coherent plan, which we announced months ago and long before the Government made a few announcements on the issue. These ideas have been thought out clearly and we will pursue them with vigour when we get into office. We must have a proper alternative energy structure and its implementation will be as urgent as the current need for a proper road network. It is vital that we put a planning process in place that can cope with that need.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">The Dutch system of planning can offer Ireland a very important lesson in this area. The Dutch Government decides the infrastructure projects that are needed on a national basis and the best area in which to locate them. It consults with parliament, local authorities and the people themselves about its plans after they are published. It amends its plans accordingly and publishes binding guidelines on infrastructure construction for the immediate future. Local authorities are then required to implement the plan, dealing with local complaints about major infrastructural projects. Local authority members do not take the blame for those decisions, but national politicians accept full political responsibility for nationally vital infrastructure. Such a system is part of a major change that Fine Gael will make in Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">Fine Gael will amend the national spatial strategy to include major renewable energy infrastructure projects. This will involve identifying the areas that are most suitable for each type of project. A draft of the amended strategy will be published and submissions invited, before a final version is presented to the Oireachtas for its approval or rejection. Alternative energy infrastructure will constitute an element of regional development plans. This will help avoid the exertion of pressure on local authority members when dealing with necessary alternative energy infrastructure, as they will be required to implement the development plan as it is set out.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">As this new agenda is rolled out, it is vital that local communities hosting infrastructure of importance to the national alternative energy programme are given the necessary reward. Those communities close to developments such as wind farms should be the beneficiaries of community facilities above and beyond those communities that are not located close to the major developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">That is why Fine Gael will legislate for the provision of a community dividend for those communities located close to new infrastructure. This will act as compensation for those communities living close to important infrastructure that aids the entire country in reaching its alternative energy commitments. The dividend will take the form of improved sporting and cultural facilities in those areas. The dividend will be put in place before the development of the energy infrastructure and the upkeep will be paid for by the private company or State body responsible for that energy infrastructure. This will turn on its head the current system of planning that encourages protest, dither and delay and that offers communities no incentive to welcome any new development.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">I welcome the commitment of Fingal County Council, led by members of the Green Party, the Labour Party, Fine Gael and others working together, to identify significant proposals for alternative energy for future housing developments in its local area plan. Every local authority should identify a percentage of energy for housing developments that must come from alternative energy sources.</p>

        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_496">
          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_851">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I am pleased to raise the issue of promoting miscanthus in the context of the environment because I raised it during a recent adjournment debate in the context of agriculture.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">The first crop of miscanthus grass in Ireland was harvested in Adare, County Limerick. This grass should be supported with substantial grant aid because it has much to offer in terms of farm crop replacement and renewable energy. An Adare company, JHM Crops Limited, was formed to promote miscanthus as a viable alternative crop. The company has identified the growing of miscanthus as an alternative farm enterprise and has established crops for rhizome and cane production. A feasibility study carried out by Dr. J.J. Leahy at the University of Limerick shows the project has excellent potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">Miscanthus is a low input, high yielding multipurpose crop, suitable for production across large areas of Ireland. The grass is undergoing much research in Europe, the United Kingdom and more recently, Ireland, as a renewable energy crop to produce heat and power. Miscanthus has other environmentally positive applications, such as use in equine bedding or garden mulch. The establishment of more processing facilities to meet the needs of growers and end users is essential to provide an opportunity for farmers to maximise returns, especially in the early years.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">Miscanthus is a woody perennial grass which originated in south east Asia and is commonly known as elephant grass. The non-flowering forms are of interest agriculturally as they grow rapidly, have low nutrient requirements, produce high yields, suffer from no known pests or diseases and conventional agricultural machinery can be used to plant, maintain and harvest them.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">Miscanthus is grown commercially as an energy crop for use in power generation. Commercial power generation projects using biomass crops such as miscanthus commenced some time ago in the United Kingdom and Europe, with more due to come on stream in the next number of years. Ireland is only now waking up to the potential of biomass power. JHM Crops Limited, in Adare, is committed to supplying crops for a similar market in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">The crop is propagated by rhizomes, will grow to three metres in height within three years of planting and remains viable for at least 25 years. As the plants are sterile, there is no danger of proliferation of the crop onto adjoining lands. The crop is perennial, with stems emerging from an underground rhizome complex annually, in March or April, reaching its maximum height of three metres towards the end of August. Cooler temperatures in autumn trigger senescence and translocation of reserves below ground. The crop is left in the field over winter and, during this phase, leaf material falls to the ground, recycling nutrients and providing mulch which suppresses weed growth. By spring, the cane is ready to harvest, typically using a forage harvester similar to that used for maize. It can also be harvested using mower conditioner power prior to baling. Detailed information on the agronomy of miscanthus can be supplied.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">Miscanthus differs from short rotation coppices in that it provides an annual harvest and, therefore, an annual income for the grower. In Ireland, long-term arid harvestable yields from a mature crop will exceed seven tonnes per acre per year and will, in many cases, amount to eight or nine tonnes. Markets are being explored and developed for miscanthus in areas as diverse as equine bedding, plywood and sustainable composites materials for car parts and plant plots. The crop is supported through the energy crops scheme, which only provides €45 per acre to farmers. I urge the Government to consider further support for this crop.</p>

        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_497">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_858">After listening in my office to the arguments made by all sides, I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this motion. Fine Gael's proposals must be striking a chord because the Government has launched an unprecedented attack on Deputy Durkan's motion. The Government's response was obviously written by civil servants, who normally write factual material but in this instance have used extraordinary political language.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">For the past six years, I have helped people to develop a wind farm, so I have first hand information about what is involved. The people concerned have already suffered an exercise in frustration and now that everything is ready, they have discovered they must wait two years for delivery of the turbines they ordered. Turbines, which are manufactured in Germany and the Netherlands, are in massive demand in America, where it is easier to enter the electricity grid than in Ireland. The conditions on grid compliance are far more stringent in Ireland than in America. As a result, Dutch and German companies are selling significant numbers of turbines in the American market.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">A turbine producing 2.3 MW costs €1.8 million and the aforementioned people plan to install 16 turbines, which represents a major investment. They also have to pay a 25% deposit on the machinery. Wind farms are said to be attractive to farmers but I wonder how many farmers will be able to afford that level of investment. The real world should be acknowledged because it is not that simple and significant outlays are required.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">The people concerned have also been discouraged by bureaucratic obstacles. It took them a considerable length of time to reach a purchase agreement and it is not a simple matter under the REFIT programme to find somebody who will take energy. Planning permission has been granted under gate 1 for 4,000 MW of wind energy, which is sufficient to satisfy demand until 2013. Anyone who wants to produce wind energy will have to wait until then to do so unless Government policy changes to allow more wind energy in the grid. It is obvious that an interconnector is needed and the sooner one is built, the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">As I told the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism today, provision should be made in the capital grants programme for solar heated water and dressing rooms in the country's sports centres. My club has installed solar panels and, as a result, we have no oil bills and even during the winter the water is hot. This could easily be done elsewhere.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_863">I am delighted to have this opportunity to address the House on the issue of renewable energy development in Ireland. The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, outlined many of the important initiatives already introduced as part of this Government's integrated strategy to promote a sustainable and renewable energy development in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, gave details of our ambitious biofuels excise relief programme and noted that the 2005 pilot mineral oil tax relief scheme for biofuels has resulted in the emergence of eight innovative biofuel projects which will produce 16 million litres of biofuels by the end of next year. A further targeted package of excise relief valued at €205 million was announced in the last budget. The new excise relief programme, underpinned by capital grant aid, will be rolled out from this year to 2010 and will enable us to exceed 2% market penetration by biofuels by 2008. The programme, which was developed and supported by several Departments working in close consultation, will support the use and production of 163 million litres of biofuels each year when fully operational.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">Deputy Broughan mentioned that the bulk of the money for the biofuels excise relief programme would be rolled out in 2008. If he would like us to front-load this financial commitment in 2006, he would deliver most of the excise relief to imported biofuels. Few biofuels developers can produce 163 million litres of biofuels in the space of less than a year since the programme was announced. Deputy Broughan is forgetting that large-scale production facilities will require finance, planning and other permissions which do not happen overnight.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">I note that Fine Gael calls for a mandatory blending of 5% bioethanol in petrol and 2% of biodiesel in diesel at all fuel outlets. While I have no difficulty with this aim which is worth pursuing, the Opposition is out of touch with EU legislation which specifically precludes such a provision.</p>

          <p eId="para_870">We will work closely with the Commission and member states in achieving any change needed but Ireland cannot make these changes unilaterally. An alternative in the longer term would be to introduce a biofuels obligation. Such a system takes considerable planning and would not necessarily support Irish biofuels developers because two thirds of Irish transport fuels are already imported fully refined. We need to ensure policies in these areas are fully integrated and fully thought out.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">The Government's policy is to support the development of a new biofuels sector through a targeted excise relief and capital funding programme. The programme will deliver quantities of biofuels that can support and develop the agricultural sector, ensure that biofuels comply with EU standards and provide an opportunity for Ireland to develop a biofuels sector that could ultimately compete on the European market.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">Deputy Broughan also mentioned the EU biomass action plan. Ireland has engaged proactively with the Commission in developing its biomass action plan and strongly supports this initiative. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources intends launching a major bioheat grants programme in the coming weeks which will assist commercial and industrial users to switch to lower cost, cleaner biomass heating systems. This in turn will stimulate demand and is one of the key recommendations of the bioenergy strategy group whose report will be published in the coming weeks. That group was established by Government, comprises representatives of all the relevant Departments and interests as well as industry representatives, and has produced a concrete series of recommendations to promote biomass development across the entire processing and supply chain in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">We will continue to work closely with the European Commission on the development of new opportunities for bioenergy production across the electricity, heat and transport sectors. Working with our European colleagues, we will press for new and ambitious policies to encourage greater use of biomass resources across Europe in line with the strategic objectives of the European Commission's Green Paper.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">The development of a sustainable energy economy requires us to pursue two key policy objectives: renewable energy and energy efficiency. The Government is giving priority to increasing energy efficiency significantly and through Sustainable Energy Ireland is making a major contribution to increase energy efficiency through its various programmes. The industry energy programmes, energy awards, public sector, house of tomorrow and warmer homes programmes are all resulting in greater awareness and lower emissions from the industry, commercial, public and domestic sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">Deputy Olivia Mitchell noted that we had done nothing on energy efficiency or renewable energy in the building of new houses.</p>

          <p eId="para_877">This is clearly untrue. My colleagues have already spoken about the high level of uptake of the Government's greener homes renewable heat grants programme for the domestic sector. This programme aims to provide renewable energy in more than 10,000 homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">The Government is pleased to have had this opportunity to set out comprehensively its successful track record and continued ambitions for the national renewable energy resource. By contrast I do not detect that the Opposition has a great deal of strategic thinking to offer.</p>

          <p eId="para_883">I wish to share time with Deputies Kenny and Durkan. In the limited time available I want to record some of the facts about what has happened over the past ten years. If they are any guide, we face a grave future. I spoke to one young man who in 1997 started to organise a windmill unit in County Cavan involving 35 farmers. I want to announce progress. The bases are going in and it is hoped the windmills will be in by Christmas. However, it was like pulling teeth all the way.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_885">Every obstacle was put in the group's way and the company that is doing it, Airtricity, is now doing most of its business in Scotland because of the difficulties that arose in this case. I have raised this several times in this House. The scheme will provide significant additional income to 35 farmers in a hard-pressed rural area and will save the Government in assistance what it might have had to pay otherwise. If we are to move forward to provide proper assistance in such areas, we must ensure there is minimal red tape and obstruction. Some help would be a major move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">Last week I listened to Teagasc, our national organisation, advising the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food on what it had done on investigating what power could be provided from poultry litter or pig manure, which it said was not viable. In part of its presentation it suggested that alternative energy was good in the UK and Germany. We asked how that alternative energy is produced in those countries and we found out that there is a Fibrowatt poultry litter biomass fuel power plant at Thetford, Norfolk, giving 40 MW; one at Eye, Suffolk, giving 12.5 MW; Westfield Power Station in Fife giving 10 MW; and there is a fourth one the name of which I cannot recollect. Those have been in operation since the early 1990s. The people who are supposed to do research in this country say such ventures are not viable although we deal with the same EU structures. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, may find it funny that such sources should be used——</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_888">It is serious when one is up against a nitrates directive about which nothing has been done and other problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">I pay tribute to the Ceann Comhairle and to his colleague, former Deputy Jimmy Leonard, who worked with me through three Governments to try to get this through the competition, but the ESB and others blocked it. We then went to Europe — we talked about Europe in this House all day — and it was helpful and brought us through the fifth framework programme. When we returned, Forfás, which had promised the land for the project outside Monaghan town in the mid-1990s, suddenly found that all its land was used and could no longer be given. The land is for sale at present and this is the truth of the matter. The Government put the obstacles in the way. The company applied for planning permission on its own farm but had not got it 27 months later, and the matter is now before the court. A letter for the attention of the company dated 4 May states: "I refer to the above Judicial Review and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government wish to have the relevant Minister joined as a Notice Party to these proceedings", between Monopower and Monaghan County Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">I hope this will help establish the powerplant, but I doubt it. I believe it is just another obstacle being put in the way by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">If we are serious about meeting deadlines and implementing proposals, we must surely start within the Departments and ensure that there are sufficient personnel to help people who are prepared to invest their own money and to encourage them to do so properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">The issue of the Monopower plant is now a judicial one. The planning process has been engaged in and I have no involvement in the matter, good, bad or indifferent. The failure of the Government to allow the company to use the site it was promised has caused a lot of friction in the area, as the Ceann Comhairle will confirm. This friction was caused by the Government, not by me or anybody else.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_514">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_893">It is chilling to think that within a decade and a half, all the gas imported into Ireland will come from one field in the Russian Arctic, which will also supply China and the United States. This will leave us in a very vulnerable position at the end of a 3,000 km pipeline.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">Later this year the Government is to produce a Green Paper on energy, which is to be welcomed. This motion is timely in that it brings into focus the crisis we face and indicates how unaware people are of how great it might be. I spoke some days ago to the director of a multinational firm in the midlands and discovered that it uses 27,000 litres of oil per day. Its energy bill has increased by €1 million in the past 18 months and it faces the prospect of meeting a T-junction because of competitive rates, internal competition and incentives offered by other countries. This issue is beyond mere party politics and is in the national interest. A solution should be sought at individual and State levels. This is essentially why Deputy Durkan tabled the Fine Gael motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">I believe very much in Airtricity's supergrid concept and proposal to have 2,000 offshore turbines as part of a 3,000 MW prototype scheme involving The Netherlands, the United Kingdom and France. An interconnected grid would allow for wind-powered electricity production wherever the wind is blowing. This could be developed over 20 years, thus allowing electricity production wherever wind blows in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">One of the saddest sagas in recent history was the one associated with the Corrib gas development. The mediator appointed by the Government, Mr. Peter Cassells, should be allowed to mediate in the case without interference from the political sphere or from persons whose motives might not be focused entirely on the question of safety and the capacity of development throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">I welcome the fact that the energy regulator has made it somewhat easier for towns to avail of a stable supply of natural gas from the Corrib field as an incentive to attract industry, particularly in the north and north west. The Government must, in the Green Paper, consider balanced regional development through putting in place electricity infrastructure with the capacity to carry an industrial load that will balance the pressures on Dublin with the opportunities that exist in other parts of the country. This is very necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">The Government should consider wind potential very seriously. In the Corrib case, the mediator should be allowed to mediate. Lessons were learned from the handling of the matter by the multinational company, the local authority and the Government. I expect the company involved will participate demonstrably in developments with the local community over the next 20 years — it is a question of the future of a very scarce resource. As I stated, the stand-off some time ago between President Putin and the authorities in the Ukraine was rather chilling. It is only when the lights go out that one will realise the difficulty of the matter. The 53 amber alerts last year and the closure of the power station in Shannonbridge because of corrosion problems have a bearing on the bigger picture. Individuals have a part to play, as outlined by Deputy Durkan in the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_899">I thank my colleagues on both sides of the House for their contributions to this debate. The motion is timely and it is appropriate, following the debates of last week, that the House should focus on an issue such as that referred to by my party leader, Deputy Kenny.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">I congratulate Deputies O'Dowd, Naughten, Olivia Mitchell and Bruton on making a major contribution to our policy in this area. I presume it has been replicated on the Government side because one needs the co-operation of the various ministries in respect of further policy in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">Let me correct one or two of the points made. While the Government speakers spent ages downgrading, decrying and denigrating the Fine Gael policy, and while they must have spent the past few weeks examining it, it is a pity they did not read it very carefully.</p>

          <p eId="para_904">There seems to be some confusion on foot of the briefing the Government gave to the press after last week's motion. Some members of the Government do not seem to know what they voted on at the end of the night. They voted on the same issue that they will be voting on tonight, a Government amendment. This amendment, which will become the motion, can be voted on afterwards. Somebody should explain to all parties on the Government benches what they will be voting on before the vote takes place so they will know exactly what they are doing. They will not have to brief the press incorrectly any more and they will know what they are talking about.</p>

          <p eId="para_909">The issue raised by all Members of the House is the most serious facing us at present. Every single house, including every farmhouse, and every factory, office and building depends on energy. If in the next few weeks, months or years there is an energy crisis in which the supply is cut altogether, which could well happen for all we know, Government policy should kick in immediately. Instead of denigrating the Opposition and its so-called inadequacies, the Government would be far better taking on board what it has to say and putting it into operation. After all, this is what it is attempting to do in any case.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">Over the past four years, the Government, with everybody else, has been aware of the international difficulties that have arisen, but it did nothing about them. It could have done so and could have focused research on this area. All the research was done by private individuals and third level institutions of their own volition. Only in recent times did Sustainable Energy Ireland do its bit. The Government has stood aloof regarding the matter and it is only in the past few weeks that it suddenly woke up to the fact that there could be an energy crisis. If there is one, we will be heavily dependent on imports, which is not desirable.</p>

The Minister has a problem for every solution and is being snowed under by them. All of these matters can be resolved. This motion is progressive and pragmatic and addresses all areas. The Government has paid our motion the greatest tribute by imitating it. The Government imitation is not as well researched as the Fine Gael motion but we will help Government in any way we can, in the hope that the Government Members will not be as sceptical and cynical as they have been. They should spend more time researching the subject and less time berating the Opposition.</p>

However, I also repeat my call for the European Union to reverse the decision it took last month to suspend aid payments to the Palestinian Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1052">In making its decision to channel aid to the Palestinian territories, the Quartet, of which the EU is a member, has recognised the pressing need for aid and the appalling conditions in which many Palestinians now live. However, that welcome action highlights inconsistencies in the European position and contrasts starkly with earlier decisions to suspend aid payments. It is clear that a growing humanitarian crisis in the region will do nothing to aid the development of greater peace and stability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053">Ireland, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, should now take a lead role in calling for EU aid to be fully restored. In addition, the Irish people deserve an explanation for the lack of action taken by the Minister when the decision to suspend aid was taken at European level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">We all know that building a lasting peace in the Middle East will be incredibly difficult. Hamas must move away from terror as a means of achieving political aims, and all EU member states, including Ireland, are right in demanding real movement on that front. However, in suspending aid to the Palestinian Authority, the EU is backing key players into a corner, deepening the humanitarian crisis in the region, and adding to instability. Instead of allowing time and space for developments with Hamas, the EU's decision to suspend aid was a knee-jerk reaction that may undermine tentative moves forward, embedding deprivation and strengthening the influence of extremists.

            <p eId="para_1057">We have dealt with this at some length today, and several participants in today's statements asked about Ireland's position regarding this decision.

            <p eId="para_1058">I thank Deputy Allen for raising this matter. This is a day for EU scrutiny and debate, and I feel that such an important decision was probably discussed as a matter on the agenda before the Council. However, I am sure the Minister would not object to appearing before the Committee on European Affairs once again to discuss it. It is entirely appropriate that we monitor this. I wish to be associated with Deputy Allen's remarks. There were democratic elections in that part of the world, and there is no reason for the EU to change its rules on assistance in this regard.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1059">I will deal with the issues raised by Deputy Allen in the final part of my contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1060">The Government shares the concerns expressed about the increasingly difficult situation of the Palestinian people. Ireland has been a long-standing supporter of the rights of Palestinians. The Government has been consistently active in promoting a lasting and peaceful settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I assure the House that we remain firmly convinced that the only route to a just and lasting settlement is through a negotiated, two-state solution. Unilateral action to change the situation on the ground is simply not a viable option. The Quartet roadmap continues to provide the principles and the parallel steps on which Israeli and Palestinian leaders must act if there is to be a settlement. On this basis, the EU and the Quartet have set out very clearly for the new Hamas Government the moves it must make if it is to engage with the international community. We understand fully the difficult transition Hamas now faces in government. We have asked that it renounce violence, recognise Israel's right to exist and respect agreements already reached by the Palestinian Authority with Israel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061">If Hamas continues to refrain from violence and shows a willingness to move on these essential conditions, the Government will argue very strongly for an appropriate positive response from the European Union. So far, the response from Hamas has been very disappointing. It should listen to the consistently courageous advice of President Mahmoud Abbas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1062">However, the EU has not terminated its aid to the Palestinians. The EU has been the strongest supporter of the Palestinian people internationally. It is also the largest donor to Palestine — providing an average of €500 million annually to support Palestinian institutions, NGOs and civil society and for humanitarian assistance. The Council decided on 10 April to review this assistance against the Palestinian Government's commitment to the principles set out by the EU and the Quartet. The Commission has already this year provided more than €100 million in vital humanitarian aid, but since early April it has temporarily suspended direct payments to the Palestinian Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1063">The EU is firmly committed to continuing necessary assistance to meet the basic needs of the Palestinian population. In the review under way, Ireland is arguing strongly for a flexible and wide-ranging definition of what constitutes this necessary assistance. We are particularly concerned about the health and education sectors. It is not reasonable to argue, however, that the EU should continue its capacity-building support for the Palestinian Government while it refuses to commit to the peace process. The reduction of international assistance has undoubtedly contributed to the hardship in the West Bank and Gaza. However, the Israeli decision to withhold the customs duties and taxes, which it collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority and which amount to €50 million per month, has had a particularly negative effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1064">It is important that the Palestinian people should not face further hardship as a result of the reluctance of their Government to respect the peace process. The Government welcomes the agreement reached by the Quartet yesterday to support a temporary international mechanism for the direct delivery of assistance to the Palestinian people. The EU will meet its responsibilities and is now taking the lead in the early establishment of the mechanism. Ireland will play a constructive role in this process. We believe it must include provision for the payment of salaries to public sector personnel providing vital services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1065">It is essential that the Israeli Government also now meets its responsibilities. It must take this opportunity to resume the transfers due to the Palestinians, through the international mechanism. The Government is determined to play its part in keeping alive the prospect of a just settlement for the Israeli and the Palestinian people. We will also maintain our close links with the Palestinians, and continue to provide much-needed assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1066">I repeat today the commitment I have already given that there will be no reduction this year in the assistance provided by the Government, which amounted to more than €4 million in 2005. Already this year, since the Palestinian elections, I have allocated €1.5 million to UNRWA and I hope to be in a position to make further allocations soon. I had originally hoped to be in a position to increase assistance to Palestine very substantially this year. I sincerely hope political developments will make this possible in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1067">In response to Deputy Allen's question of earlier today, there was no vote in the European Council on this matter, which proceeded by way of consensus. It is important to remember the distinction between the Council and the Commission. The Commission of its own volition and right can suspend aid. It did so. The Commission can do that in its own right without interference from or reference to the Council. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, pushed the Irish view very strongly. I totally reject any suggestion that we were guilty of inaction on this matter. We believe the widest possible definition of what constitutes humanitarian relief should be used. We are pushing this matter very vigorously at a European level so that the people of Palestine are not punished for the misdeeds of their Government.</p>

            <from>Mr. M. Moynihan</from>
            <p eId="para_1068">I appreciate the opportunity to raise this important issue in this week, which sees the closure of the Mallow sugar factory for the last time. It is a very sad day for north Cork and the entire region. While the Mallow sugar factory is synonymous with the town of Mallow, many of the people who have been working for generations since the foundation of the sugar factory in the 1930s have come from my constituency, particularly from what we would call western Duhallow. Part-time workers have worked there seasonally, particularly in the winter when farm work is quiet. That work supplemented their incomes enormously.</p>
            <p eId="para_1069">What are the plans for the allocation of the compensation that was negotiated at EU level in November when the sugar regime was reformed, which ultimately led to the demise of Irish sugar? We will have considerable difficulties in the future. On the one hand the agricultural land used for the production of sugar beet will now be brought into the main stream for the production of cereals etc., which will obviously lead to a glut in the market. The budget provided funds to give an incentive to the production of green energy, biofuels etc. What discussion has the Minister had with Greencore on the production of biofuels on the site in Mallow? As the Acting Chairman will know, the Mallow sugar factory is probably one of the best industrial sites in the country. It is supplied by an extensive road and rail network. Very few sites have such advantages. We need to use all the State agencies to ensure that a viable alternative industry is put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1070">I know discussions on compensation are taking place. I would like the Minister of State to outline to the House the status of the discussions. In summary I have three questions. What, if any, discussion has the Minister had with Greencore on the future of the sugar factory in Mallow? What, if any, discussions have taken place on the production of biofuels? What is the status of compensation? I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue not only for east Cork, but also for my area in north-west Cork.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Ms M. Wallace)</from>
            <p eId="para_1071">The compensation package negotiated in the context of reform of the EU sugar regime is worth more than €310 million to Irish stakeholders. It will be drawn down in accordance with the regulations governing the new EU sugar regime, which comes into effect from 1 July 2006. There are three elements to the compensation package.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072">The first element is the compensation to beet growers of up to 64% of the reduction in the minimum price for beet. This compensation, which will be incorporated in the existing single payment scheme and will be payable from 2006, is worth approximately €123 million to Irish beet growers over the next seven years. The amount of the payment will be calculated on the basis of the average of the farmers' contracted quantities with Irish Sugar Limited during a three years reference period, consisting of the 2001, 2002 and 2004 marketing years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1073">However, it is possible for farmers to have their average based on one or two years if they submit a successful application to have the average contracted quantity established on the grounds of <i>force majeure</i>. It is also possible for farmers who commenced farming during the reference period to have their average based on one or two years. It will, therefore, not be possible to establish the rate of payment per tonne until my Department has processed all applications under these measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074">The second element of the compensation package is the restructuring fund covering the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring the sugar industry, including factory closure and renunciation of quota. In Ireland's case, this would be worth up to €145 million. The fund is subject to the submission of a detailed restructuring plan for the industry following consultations between the processor and the beet growers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">The reform agreement provides that at least 10% of the restructuring fund shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors. That proportion may be increased by member states after consultation with interested parties, provided that an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan is ensured.</p>
            <p eId="para_1076">Where restructuring takes place in the first year of the new regime, an application for restructuring aid must be made by 31 July 2006 following consultations between the processor and the beet growers. This application must include a detailed restructuring plan for the industry. A decision on the granting of the aid must then be made by the member state by 30 September 2006. Where aid is awarded in respect of restructuring in the first year, payment will be made in two instalments, the first instalment of 40% in June 2007 and the second instalment of 60% in February 2008. Depending on the financial resources available the Commission may decide to split the second instalment into two payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">Payments of restructuring aid to growers will be based on beet deliveries in the relevant period but pending a decision on the percentage of the aid to be reserved for growers it is not possible to calculate payments per tonne of beet delivered. The Commission is working on detailed rules for the implementation of the restructuring scheme and it is anticipated that the relevant Commission regulation will be adopted later this month. A decision on the percentage will be made in due course following the adoption of this regulation and after consultation with the relevant interested parties, and payment arrangements will then be announced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">The third element of the package is the diversification aid. The reform agreement provides for the introduction of aid for diversification measures where sugar beet production completely ceases. This aid, worth almost €44 million in the case of Ireland, would be drawn down in the framework of a national restructuring programme to be elaborated in due course when the Commission's implementing regulation has been adopted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">I understand Deputy Michael Moynihan's concerns on behalf of his constituents and those who are directly involved in the Mallow sugar factory and I hope that the information provided this evening will be of assistance to him.</p>

          <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_533">
            <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
            <p eId="para_1080">The trafficking of women for sexual exploitation is a serious and rapidly growing worldwide phenomenon. This trade in human beings for monetary gain is an extremely lucrative business earning several billions of euro a year at the expense of innocent lives. Women's human rights are violated when they are bought and sold, raped, falsely imprisoned and tortured. It is estimated that more than 120,000 women and girls are trafficked into western European countries every year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081">Ireland has failed to transpose into law the 2002 EU Council framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings which obliged all member states to legislate to criminalise the trafficking of human beings for exploitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">The deadline for member states to enact this framework legislation was August 2004. Ireland is the only EU member state not to do so. Why is it taking so long to move to draft this legislation? Can the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform assure us that the legislation will be victim-sensitive and will punish only the traffickers, similar to the Swedish legislation in this area? The UN committee on the elimination of discrimination against women stated that it was concerned at the trafficking of women and girls into Ireland, the lack of information on the extent of the problem and of specific legislation in this area and the lack of a comprehensive strategy to combat it. The committee recommends the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive strategy to combat trafficking in women and girls which should include preventative measures, the prosecution and punishment of offenders and the enactment of specific legislation in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">Ireland must also ratify the 2005 Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. This convention was opened for signature and ratification at the Council of Europe's third summit of Heads of State and Government one year ago in Warsaw. The action plan at that summit contained a call for the early entry into force of the convention and the widest possible ratification. Will the Minister say when he intends to sign and ratify this convention?</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">It is vital also that the victims of trafficking are not treated as criminals. These women and girls are highly vulnerable and have suffered terribly at the hands of the traffickers. Victims of trafficking should not be immediately deported to their countries of origin where they face the possibility of falling victim again to the traffickers. They should be advised of the asylum process and the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner should adhere to the recent UNHCR guidelines when determining status for a victim of trafficking as gender persecution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should fund assistance programmes and safe accommodation centres for victims of trafficking. On 28 April the <i>Irish Examiner</i> reported that a north African minor whom gardaí had rescued from a brothel was put into HSE care in Dublin. Without adequate staff to watch over her 24 hours a day this vulnerable girl went missing again from the centre within days. In <i>The Sligo Champion</i> on 26 April there was the story of a 17 year old west African girl who came to the attention of gardaí after she had been working as a prostitute. It subsequently emerged that she was a minor who had been trafficked to the country specifically to be exploited by an organised prostitution ring.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086">The <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 25 January 2006 carried the story of a young woman who presented herself to gardaí in County Meath telling them that she was being forced to have sex with hundreds of men over a six month period. She informed the gardaí that she had been tricked into coming to Ireland by a man who promised her legal employment and then took her passport. She was forced to have sex at a house in the region. When the gardaí searched the house they recovered the documents and thankfully arrested that man.</p>
            <p eId="para_1087">Last Monday's "Prime Time Investigates" documentary on RTE showed that the trafficking of women is happening here. Some of the most vulnerable women in Ireland need the Minister's help. He must act, legislate to criminalise trafficking and ensure that the Garda Síochána is given the resources and apply the laws that exist. I plead with the Minister to protect the women whose voices have been silenced.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_534">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_1088">Action is being taken to combat this crime which my Department and the Garda Síochána take very seriously. The Garda Síochána is proactive in this area and from its intelligence gathering, surveillance and investigations to date, there is no evidence to suggest that trafficking of persons into Ireland for the purposes of sexual exploitation is widespread. To date, Garda operations have uncovered relatively few trafficking cases. The examples cited by Deputy Cuffe show that the gardaí deal properly and appropriately with the cases in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089">In the recently published United Nations report Trafficking in Persons: Global Patterns, Ireland ranks at the low end of destination or transit countries in western Europe. We are, however, still at risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090">Last Friday I published the report of a working group on human trafficking comprising representatives of my Department and the Garda Síochána with regard to the situation in Ireland and the State's response to this issue on a number of fronts, including immigration controls, law enforcement activity, protection of victims and legislation. Last Friday I also launched a poster campaign to assist in addressing trafficking, which is facilitated by Crimestoppers and will help raise awareness of trafficking among the public. It will provide an important point of contact for those who may be victims of, or vulnerable to, this insidious crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1091">Members of the Garda Síochána attend relevant international meetings to facilitate the exchange of information and best practice between EU member states, Europol and Interpol and to devise strategies capable of combating immigration-related criminality, including trafficking in human beings. The Garda Síochána has built up a network of bilateral contacts and participates in operations to combat trafficking activity. The Garda also participates in the Interpol working group on trafficking in women and children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092">A training programme has been prepared for delivery to key Garda personnel throughout the State to ensure members fully understand the complexity of this phenomenon and ensure victims receive appropriate assistance from all the relevant agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1093">As regards prosecutions, I am glad to be able to clear up some misunderstandings about the ability of the criminal law to deal with trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation. An impression may have been given over recent days that a legislative vacuum existed in this country which gives traffickers <i>carte blanche </i>to pursue their evil trade here. Nothing could be further from the truth. We do not as yet have a tailor-made specific offence of trafficking in adults for the purpose of sexual exploitation but we have extensive criminal law provisions which can be used depending on the circumstances of each case that comes to the notice of the Garda Síochána. I wish to clarify that there is no crime that is not prosecutable under our law as it stands.</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 creates an offence of trafficking persons under 17 years of age into, through or out of the State for the purpose of sexual exploitation. The maximum sentence on conviction is life imprisonment. Under the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 it is an offence to organise or knowingly facilitate the entry into Ireland of a person who is reasonably believed to be an illegal immigrant or a person who intends to claim asylum. In this case the maximum prison sentence is ten years. As the "Prime Time Investigates" programme demonstrated, in all cases of trafficking other offences will be committed, such as rape, sexual assault, assault and false imprisonment. A person cannot be trafficked into Ireland for the purposes of prostitution without the commission of an offence. Successful prosecutions, no matter what legislation is in operation, will depend on the existence of evidence that will stand up in court and for that to happen, persons must be willing to co-operate with Garda investigations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">Legislation creating an offence of trafficking in persons for the specific purpose of sexual or labour exploitation is contained in the draft criminal justice (trafficking in persons and sexual offences) Bill which is at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department and will be published later this year. This Bill will comply with the EU framework decision on combating trafficking in persons for the purpose of their sexual and labour exploitation, to which Deputy Cuffe referred, and will also fulfil the criminal law requirements of two other international trafficking instruments to which he referred. The immigration and residence Bill being prepared in my Department will also contain a number of proposals which will assist in the fight against trafficking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1096">I recognise that victims of trafficking, who are often highly traumatised by their experiences, require care and protection. The current immigration system in Ireland allows the authorities to deal with these victims in a sympathetic and pragmatic way and they are so dealt with. It is recognised that it is in the interests of both the victims of trafficking and the authorities to co-operate with a view to ensuring the protection of victims and the prosecution of perpetrators. Any necessary assistance is provided to victims, including through the services of the Health Service Executive. Victims of trafficking can also be assisted to return and re-integrate in their countries of origin with the assistance of the International Organisation for Migration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">The issue of Ireland's non-participation in the European Council directive on residence permits for victims of trafficking has been raised. In practice this directive will not require us to do anything which we cannot already do under our existing immigration legislation and practice. I am keeping an open mind on future participation in this directive which will not give us any new powers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1098">I am equally aware of the recommendations made by CEDAW in July 2005 on the increased levels of trafficking of women across the world. These recommendations are being taken into consideration in the further development of Irish policy and legislation on the prevention of trafficking to which I referred.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099">As for signing and ratifying the Council of Europe Convention against Trafficking in Human Beings, as I outlined earlier I am taking the necessary steps to bring Irish criminal law into line with the requirements of the convention. I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.</p>

          <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_535">
            <from>Mr. Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_1100">I welcome the Minister to the House. Last November in a parliamentary question I asked the Minister whether he was aware that a gambling casino had opened up in the vicinity of Grafton Street. He replied that he was aware that such type of facility had been opened. It would be difficult not to be aware because it opened with a great fanfare of publicity and some well-known figures were present.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101">I further asked the Minister whether he was satisfied that the casino was operating legally and whether the legislation governing the operation of casinos covered this casino. He replied that this private club had been recently visited by a senior Garda officer and no irregularities were detected that would justify a prosecution under the Gaming and Lotteries Acts 1956 to 1986, the relevant legislation for such matters. He assured the House that the premises would continue to receive Garda attention but that there were no proposals to amend the law at that stage. It is obvious that since that time the Minister has developed some proposals. He stated with reference to the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 that he would table amendments to provide for the prohibition of gambling.</p>
            <p eId="para_1102">The Gaming and Lotteries Acts prohibit gambling unless it is a game of chance or partly a game of chance. It is a question of the definition of a game of chance or partly a game of chance. A wide range of gambling takes place in the country. We are all familiar with gambling on horses, dogs, the national lottery, bingo and slot machines. The State is involved in some of those activities. It runs the tote at race courses and is the sole beneficiary of the national lottery.</p>
            <p eId="para_1103">The Minister stated that casinos offered an advantage to the casino over the gambler in casino-type operations. If the State were the owner of the casino, it is difficult to see how the matter would not be regulated in an even-handed fashion. I am not putting forward an argument for bringing casinos into existence but I ask the Minister whether he will proceed with a bald prohibition or whether he will regulate the area. All gambling is a game of chance. I understand that Ireland is only one of two countries in the European Union that does not have casino-type gambling and that a number of countries in the European Union, such as Austria, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, have casinos run by the State. Casino-type activities include roulette, poker and blackjack. Are these casinos more prone to criminal activity or prostitution or any form of crime or are they so biased against the punter that they create an offence by relieving the punter of his money? I have not seen too many poor bookies so there seems to be an inbuilt factor against the punter in most gambling because it is a game of chance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">My point is to determine whether there is a principle involved, whether some gambling is different from other gambling, whether lottery gambling is worse than gambling on horses or whether roulette gambling is worse than playing cards. In all cases the punter can lose his shirt and perhaps win something every now and again.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">The Gaming and Leisure Association of Ireland came to my clinic recently to raise the issue with me. I told the representatives I would raise the issue with the Minister. They would like to meet the Minister to discuss the issue and to argue the case whether it would be best to regulate the industry or ban it entirely. If it is the latter, it may then be forced underground to a degree. Gambling can be carried out on-line where the server is located outside the country. I ask the Minister for clarification of his thoughts.</p>

            <p eId="para_1106">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me this opportunity to discuss the issue. As he is aware, when announcing the publication of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 a fortnight or so ago, I adverted to my intention to avail myself of the opportunity this Bill presents to address the subject of this debate. The opportunity arises because that Bill already contains some provisions for the amendment of the Gaming and Lotteries Act. Those provisions deal with the limits on stake and prize money in gaming and amusement machines and I do not propose to anticipate debate on the Bill by going into further detail on that issue at this stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1107">It is a matter for the Oireachtas and not for me to decide whether it wants to regulate or prohibit casino gambling in Ireland. I say this to make the position clear because the Deputy seems to think that it is I who will decide this issue, but this House will decide that issue. The Oireachtas has already made its decision on the question in the shape of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts. Oireachtas policy, as clearly expressed in those Acts, goes for the prohibition of casino-type operations in this State and against the notion that casinos should be permitted and regulated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1108">I agree with that policy. Casinos, generally speaking, are not desirable. It is the general view of the great majority of people in this society that they are not desirable. It can be said that Irish society as a whole is not averse to having a flutter. We have many ways, ranging from the national lottery, through betting on horseracing, greyhound racing and on many other events such as sports outcomes, to the humble parish raffle, of putting our money at hazard. Likewise, licensed slot machines at seaside resorts, where the reward is a cuddly toy or a small sum of money, are a feature of many family holiday experiences. Card games, whether they be genteel bridge evenings, fundraising whist, 45 drives or a night of poker among friends, are popular pastimes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1109">The Gaming and Lotteries Acts define what unlawful gaming is and allow certain permitted exclusions from that definition which cater for the activities I mentioned. As the Deputy is aware, gaming is the playing of a game of skill or chance or partly of skill or partly of chance for stakes hazarded by the players. Unlawful gaming is gaming where the chances of the players are not equal. However, the running of a business enterprise offering games of chance where the promoter has an edge over the other participants in the game, as is the case with roulette, is defined by the Act as unlawful gaming. That applies to taking a share of the pot simply for running the game without putting any stake at hazard — which is how casinos operate poker tables — and it is against the policy and terms of the Act for that to be permitted. I am not a puritan or a killjoy. I do not mind people playing poker if they want to, but if people are engaging in unlawful gaming, they should not be allowed operate a business under the terms of the 1956 Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1110">There are those who would argue that we should recognise that casinos are here to stay and instead of continuing to outlaw them we should permit them to operate and set up systems for regulating their operation or perhaps extracting revenue from them. That is a course taken in many jurisdictions but I do not share that view. We do not need this additional facility here. Irish people who crave this facility can go abroad and find one if they want to. Innocent people are sucked into such activity and it is not desirable that they should be.</p>
            <p eId="para_1111">The Deputy mentioned the possibility that the State could run such an operation but the lobby group that approached him will not be interested in the State doing so. The question at issue is, do we want private enterprise casinos in Ireland, a State-run casino or to leave matters roughly as they are. My view — I hope the Inspector of Prisons does not come down on me for being too conservative — is that we should leave matters roughly as they are. We should ensure bogus clubs, which pretend to be clubs but clearly are not, do not become a loophole in the law and effectively allow for casinos to be established across this country posing as something else.</p>
            <p eId="para_1112">I strongly believe we must have either a workable law or no law on this matter. In the course of consideration of the gaming and lotteries legislation, which will be part of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, I intend to make the law workable and to allow the Garda Síochána to close unlawful gaming establishments that are not licensed in accordance with the policy laid down by this House.</p>

            <p eId="para_1130">The Report of the Lourdes Hospital Inquiry was published on 28th February last. Since the publication of the report, I have met with many of the key stakeholders including Patient Focus, the Health Service Executive (HSE), the Medical Council, and the management and medical board of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. I have listened carefully to the views of these bodies on the recommendations in the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1131">The Report of the Inquiry highlighted the urgent need for change and reform in our hospitals and particularly in the area of clinical governance. The recommendations in the report underline the importance of the approach being taken by my Department in a number of areas: the preparation of the new Medical Practitioners Bill which I intend, subject to Government approval, to bring to the House later this year; the new contract for hospital consultants, which is urgently needed for the recruitment of many more consultants. The report will help to inform the continued approach of my Department to these very important issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1132">The Inquiry also made a series of recommendations of an operational and service nature, the implementation of which is a matter for the HSE.

            <p eId="para_1133">One of the key recommendations in the Report relates to the recording of data on sentinel events. In this regard, a new National Perinatal Epidemiology Centre in Cork University Hospital will be up and running in the Autumn of this year, with annual funding of €630,000. Every time a mother gives birth in this country, the important interventions, the good outcomes and the complications will be recorded and analysed at the centre.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_1143">The Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 are administered by the Health Service Executive. There are currently three rates of subvention payable, i.e. €114.30, €152.40 and €190.50 for the three levels of dependency which are medium, high and maximum. There are no plans to increase the subvention rates at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144">The HSE has discretion to pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted. The application of these provisions in an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention, subject to the provisions of the Health Act, 2004. The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">I wish to advise the Deputy that additional funding of €20 million was provided for the administration of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme in 2006, bringing the total available budget to €161 million. The supports paid by the HSE vary from person to person and region to region, depending on prices for example. Accordingly, the Department is not in a position to estimate the costs of increasing the maximum basic rate to €300 and the enhanced rate to €800.

Under Section 45 of the Health Act 1970 medical cards are provided for persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants. Section 58 of the Health Act, 1970, as amended, provides for GP visit cards for adult persons with limited eligibility for whom, in the opinion of the HSE, and notwithstanding that they do not qualify for a medical card, it would be unduly burdensome to arrange GP medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</p>

            <p eId="para_1184">Firstly I wish to assure the Deputy that there is no question of voted monies being unaccounted for by the Health Service Executive (HSE). The 2005 Appropriation Account and the HSE's Annual Financial Statements have been submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General who is in the process of completing his audit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185">In compliance with the Department of Finance reporting requirements, the HSE provided their best estimate of the end year forecast of Exchequer issues for 2005 on 22nd December 2005. As stated by the HSE at the time, the estimated outturn figures provided in January 2006 were preliminary and were subject to revision following a full reconciliation of the Financial Statements on an income and expenditure basis with the Appropriation Account on a vote basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1186">The HSE's Appropriation Account for 2005 is now complete. It shows an excess of €300,000 on the revenue Vote account and a saving of €51m on the capital Vote account. In the context of a budget of more than €11 billion this is a very satisfactory outcome. It has been agreed that subject to the necessary Dáil approval, the saving on capital will be made available to the HSE this year by way of a Supplementary Estimate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1187">I recognise that it will take some time for the HSE to introduce a single accounting system throughout the organisation which is capable of providing full dual accounting — the standard Vote accounts, and the income and expenditure accounts operated by the former health boards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1188">However, I am assured by the HSE that their systems are fully capable of accounting for all transactions within the organisation and I expect to see a significant improvement this year in the quality of their in-year expenditure management returns.</p>

            <p eId="para_1201">I recognise the important role of small or medium sized enterprises in the local and national economy and my aim is to encourage maximum participation of SMEs in the public procurement market. While the requirements and specifications for individual contracts must be determined by the contracting authority, general guidelines issued by my Department recommend that contracting authorities ensure that recently established firms, or firms with no previous experience of public contracts, are not excluded from the tendering process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1202">The public procurement market must operate on an open and non-discriminatory basis and it can be an important source of business for SMEs. In the past, access to public contracts was perceived as a problem by many in this sector. Significant measures have been introduced to combat this. For example, a national public procurement website (www.etenders.gov.ie) was developed by my Department in recent years where all significant public sector contracts are advertised. This central facility increases transparency and greatly increases access to public sector contracts for all suppliers. The SME sector is also actively targeted through a marketing campaign and suppliers receive free email alerts to tender notices of interest to them. Figures show a steady increase in the number of registered suppliers competing for business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203">A practical example of encouraging appropriate inclusion of SMEs can be found in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector. It is intended to hold a series of competitions to set up framework contracts for ICT hardware, software and services. These tenders will reference the desirability of SME inclusion. The first such contract has recently been put in place for personal computers. This framework includes an SME as a lead supplier and a number of SMEs as nominated resellers. I would like to build on this and to see more SMEs competing for public contracts in the future. I will, therefore, be keeping the matter under review, particularly in the implementation of the national public procurement strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1204">As regards the broader question of encouraging and facilitating SMEs in Ireland, this is a matter primarily for my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment, who I know is also supportive of SMEs.</p>

My Department, with the assistance of the Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC), specialist legal drafters and external technical expertise, has developed a suite of Standard Forms of Construction Contract and Conditions of Engagement for Construction Related Services, e.g. architects, engineers and quantity surveyors, to give effect to the Government decision.</p>

These include the reduction in the yearly average number of contributions required for pension purposes from 20 to 10 and the introduction of special half rate pensions based on pre-53 insurance contributions. Pro-rata pensions are also available to allow people with mixed rate insurance records to receive a payment. This set of measures is of particular benefit to women who may have less than complete social insurance records due to working in the home.</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">The social welfare pension entitlements of those who take time out of the paid workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker's scheme which was introduced from 1994. The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, have a minimum of 260 paid contributions increasing to 520 from 2012 and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age must also be satisfied.</p>
            <p eId="para_1230">There are, of course, those who will not benefit from the homemaker's scheme and who cannot qualify for a pension in their own right. In this regard, the Government is committed to increasing the payment for qualified adults (age 66 or over) to the same level as the personal rate of the old age (non-contributory) pension and to facilitate the direct payment of the allowance to spouses and partners. Separate payments have been available on request since 2002 and my Department is at present examining the legal and administrative issues involved in enhancing these arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">I will continue to look for ways, within the current social welfare structure, in which the needs of older people who are at present outside the social welfare pensions system may be addressed further.</p>

A pensioner can also travel for free on cross border journeys between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1238">In order to avail of the scheme, a passholder must present their pass to the transport operator in advance of making their journey. A passholder is also required to produce their free travel pass for inspection to an inspector with the transport operator or to an official of my Department if required. In addition, passholders resident in the major cities (Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway) must obtain an ancillary photopass from CIE in order to use the CIE Group services in those cities. This photopass is obtained free of charge by eligible passholders with the cost being met by my Department. The primary reason for photo identification is to prevent fraud of the system through free travel passes being transferred.</p>
            <p eId="para_1239">My Department is working towards the introduction of a more secure type of free travel card. The new travel card will introduce a number of improvements, including an improved registration process and new card technology which will bring improved customer service and better security features considerably reducing the potential for forging cards and fraudulent use. It is planned that the new cards will be introduced during 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1240">Currently, my Department is in consultation with the Northern Ireland authorities (the Department of Regional Development) with a view to implementing a scheme of All-Ireland Free Travel.

            <p eId="para_1244">All carers who are in receipt of carer's allowance, carer's benefit, prescribed relative allowance or constant attendance allowance on the first Thursday in June will automatically receive the respite care grant without having to apply for it. Similarly, carers who are in receipt of domiciliary care allowance from the Health Service Executive will automatically receive the respite care grant from the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245">The respite care grant was extended in 2005. Carers who do not qualify for the grant under one of the above schemes may now receive the grant if the following conditions are met: the carer must be providing full time care to a person who is in need of such care for at least 6 months. This period of care must include the first Thursday in June, and as is the case with recipients of carers allowance, a full time carer must not be engaged in employment for more than 10 hours per week (this will increase to 15 hours for the purposes of the 2006 grant).</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">Those who are in receipt of an unemployment payment are not eligible to receive the grant as they are required to be available for and actively seeking full time work. Provision was made in Budget 2006 to increase the amount of the grant from €1,000 to €1,200 in respect of each care recipient and, as already mentioned, to increase the number of hours that a recipient of the grant may work from 10 to 15 hours per week. All support schemes for carers, including the respite care grant will be kept under review and further possible improvements will be considered in a budgetary context.</p>

            <p eId="para_1248">The Commission on the Family was established by the Minister for Social Welfare in October 1995. Its remit was "to examine the effects of legislation and policies on families and make recommendations to the Government on proposals which would strengthen the capacity of families to carry out their functions in a changing economic and social environment".</p>
            <p eId="para_1249">The membership of the Commission included experts from a number of key areas including social policy, family law, education and community work. The Commission set out by inviting families, individuals and national and local voluntary organisations who work with families to assist with its work by making submissions setting out their views about the issues that affect family life and how policies, programmes and services can be improved to better support families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1250">Over 500 submissions were received from a mixture of organisations and individuals accurately reflecting the concerns of families at that time. The Commission concentrated on the welfare of children and vulnerable families and how public policy could best strengthen and support families in carrying out their important functions. The overall thrust of the Commission's recommendations centred on the need for public policy to focus on preventive and supportive measures to strengthen families in carrying out their functions and prevent difficulty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1251">In its final report, "Strengthening Families for Life", the Commission made a total of 43 recommendations for family policy. A review of the progress to date on the implementation of the recommendations was undertaken by my Department in 2005 and I am making arrangements for this review to be sent to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1253">I understand that the Deputy's question relates to a recent newspaper article in relation to the operation of the habitual residence condition. I should clarify that there was no decision by the European Commission at that time concerning the habitual residence condition. However, in November 2005 a clarification was issued to Community Welfare Officers explaining that supplementary welfare allowance is considered under EU legislation to be a social advantage and must therefore be subject to the principles of equal treatment to all EU workers regardless of nationality. Any EU worker who suffers loss of income because he or she has lost employment through no fault of their own, or become unable to work through illness, is entitled to claim supplementary welfare allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1254">The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1st May 2004. It was introduced in the context of the Government's decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the new EU Member States without the transitional limitations which were being imposed at that time by many of the other Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1255">In December 2004 the EU Commission wrote to the Government raising a number of issues concerning the compliance of the habitual residence condition with EU law in relation to workers and their families. The formal process of the Commission's examination of the matter has recently been completed and the Commission is satisfied that Ireland is fully compliant with the ECJ case law in applying the habitual residence condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">While the management of migrant labour is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Deputy may wish to note that there has been no significant change in the numbers of EU nationals claiming supplementary welfare allowance or rent allowance since November last.</p>

I will shortly be publishing a consultation document in relation to a driving instructors register that will be operated by the Road Safety Authority to set and maintain standards of tuition for all.</p>

            <p eId="para_1343">I would like to give the deputy some background to the refugee situation in this Jordanian camp. Ireland is one of 18 countries which voluntarily participates in resettlement programmes co-ordinated by the UNHCR. Resettlement programmes are designed to find a durable solution for persons, generally in a country of first asylum, where local integration or repatriation is not an option. Following a Government Decision in July, 2005, Ireland increased its resettlement quota from 10 cases (approximately 40 persons) per year to 200 persons per year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1344">Ireland, along with a number of other resettlement countries, has responded on a humanitarian basis to a request from the UNHCR to facilitate the resettlement of a group of approximately 300 Iranian Kurds currently located in a UNHCR camp in Jordan. This group will be resettled in a number of resettlement countries, including Ireland. In accordance with good resettlement practice, once it has been established that a resettlement country can cater for the needs of an applicant family, families are accepted and resettled as a unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1345">Preparations are already in hand for the group of refugees coming to Ireland following a recent mission to Jordan by officials of my Department. Our refugee resettlement programme involves co-ordination of all services both from a central and local perspective and is in line with best international resettlement practice. I would like to reassure the Deputy that our refugees are accepted and supported as complete family units and the concerns expressed by the Deputy simply do not arise.</p>

However, prior to this more formal arrangement, the Irish Prison Service has, over the past few years, had an ongoing liaison with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) and provided reports of non-EU national prisoners in custody. These reports varied from lists of non-EU nationals serving sentences to targeted reporting of specific nationalities in custody in conjunction with planned deportation operations to the country in question. In March 2006, an internal review of the arrangements was carried out, resulting in improved systems of liaison between the various organisations involved in this process.</p>

The review process will operate under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.

This assessment has recently been completed and the long term projected staffing figure, on which future accommodation needs will be based, has been agreed with the school authority. My Department is now in the process of drawing up of a detailed accommodation brief, which may require a site visit, in respect of this school.</p>

            <p eId="para_1397">Government commitment to the PLC sector, by reference to the resources applied in teachers' pay, non-pay running costs, student support and certification costs, is very significant. We have increased the number of PLC places by 60% since 1996/97. Indeed, the number of PLC places approved for 2005/2006 is up by more than 1,600 on the 2004/05 level. The number of approved places in the sector now stands at 30,188. We also extended the provision of maintenance grants to PLC students with effect from September 1998. The PLC maintenance grant scheme operates on the same basis as in higher education. There were nearly 8,000 PLC grant holders in 2005 and they received some €23 million in direct support. Tuition fees for PLC courses are also waived.</p>
            <p eId="para_1398">PLC students are included in the calculation of non-pay budgets issued to schools in respect of running costs. A supplementary non-pay grant towards running costs specifically for PLC schools is also payable. This amounted to €5.5 million in 2005. In addition, capital funding for works at 11 post-Leaving Certificate Colleges in 2006 has been agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1399">Other developments funded by my Department of direct benefit to the PLC sector include the provision of national certification under the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the development of progression links with higher education in the Institutes of Technology. The McIver Report contains 21 over-arching recommendations, incorporating 91 sub- recommendations. It has been estimated, in consultation with management and staff interests, that the recommendations for staffing would involve at a minimum the creation of at least 800 new posts at a cost of over €48 million. This level of additional provision cannot be considered in isolation from other areas of education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1400">I want to invest in educational opportunity for learners in Further Education by providing the necessary system supports that will allow the sector as a whole to fulfil its important potential. The non-teaching educational tasks particular to PLC teachers, the demands on the management side and the challenges presented by the variation in size of the 200 plus PLC providers are under very active consideration by officials at present. It is intended to table concrete proposals for discussion on the way forward. The positive engagement of the main partners will be sought to advance this agenda.</p>

A supplementary non-pay grant towards running costs specifically for PLC schools is also payable. This amounted to €5.5 million in 2005. In addition, capital funding for works at eleven PLC colleges in 2006 has been agreed. The position with regard to private secondary schools is that my Department pays the salaries of teachers in these schools but capitation grants for running costs are not payable.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Miss de Valera)</from>
            <p eId="para_1409">I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 to 100, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1410">PLC programmes are a critically important feature of the lifelong education continuum. For young people looking to enhance their qualifications and employment prospects, for those seeking an alternative route of entry into higher education and for older adults wishing to return to learning, the PLC route offers an invaluable opportunity. PLC colleges form an important source of supply of people with skills to serve the Irish economy. Courses are aimed at preparing students both for employment and for progression into other areas of education and training. PLC providers form a major employee source for a wide range of industries and services, with a strong focus, for example, on childcare and tourism services, leisure (including sport-related) services, beauty therapy, business and administration, information technology and a diverse range of activity in the sciences and technologies with a particular focus on pre-nursing and social care studies. Over 40 providers have more than 150 students, including 20 providers which have over 450 students and the remaining 150 providers are, as the Deputy notes, of a smaller scale but have the benefits that arise from local initiative and local relationships.</p>
            <p eId="para_1411">Government commitment to the PLC sector, by reference to the resources applied in teachers' pay, non-pay running costs, student support and certification costs, is very significant. We have increased the number of PLC places by 60% since 1996/97. Indeed, the number of PLC places approved for 2005/2006 is up by more than 1,600 on the 2004/05 level. The number of approved places in the sector now stands at 30,188. We also extended the provision of maintenance grants to PLC students with effect from September 1998. The PLC maintenance grant scheme operates on the same basis as in higher education. There were nearly 8,000 PLC grant holders in 2005 and they received some €23 million in direct support. Tuition fees for PLC courses are also waived.</p>
            <p eId="para_1412">PLC students are included in the calculation of non-pay budgets issued to schools in respect of running costs. A supplementary non-pay grant towards running costs specifically for PLC schools is also payable. This amounted to €5.5 million in 2005. In addition, capital funding for works at eleven post-Leaving Certificate Colleges in 2006 has been agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1413">Other developments funded by my Department of direct benefit to the PLC sector include the provision of national certification under the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the development of progression links with higher education in the Institutes of Technology. Going forward, the McIver Report presented an ambitious and far-reaching analysis of how we can develop the potential of the sector. The Report contains 21 over-arching recommendations, incorporating 91 sub-recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1414">It has been estimated, in consultation with management and staff interests, that the recommendations for staffing would involve at a minimum the creation of at least 800 new posts at a cost of over €48 million. This level of additional provision cannot be considered in isolation from other areas of education. I want to invest in educational opportunity for learners in Further Education by providing the necessary system supports that will allow the sector as a whole to fulfil its important potential. The non-teaching educational tasks particular to PLC teachers, the demands on the management side and the challenges presented by the variation in size of the 200 plus PLC providers are under very active consideration by officials at present. It is intended to table concrete proposals for discussion on the way forward. The positive engagement of all the main partners will be sought to advance the agenda.</p>

            <p eId="para_1418">The position generally is that eligibility for school transport is determined by distance from home to the nearest primary school or post-primary centre. The phasing out of the 3 for 2 seating arrangement on school buses arising from the use of seat belts will not affect the overall seating provision for those who are eligible for transport. Furthermore, this initiative does not necessarily mean that pupils who are availing of concessionary transport will no longer be provided with such transport. The availability of concessionary transport depends on the number of spare seats available after all other eligible pupils have been accommodated. The Deputy will be aware that significant investment has been made by the Government to address capacity shortfalls arising from the phasing out of the three for two seating arrangement on school buses. A programme for Bus Éireann to acquire a number of new and modern second-hand buses is well advanced. In addition, Bus Éireann has hired-in over 220 additional vehicles from the private sector and the situation is being kept under review.</p>

Returning Officers undertook the task of procuring suitable dry accommodation for the electronic voting machines and ancillary equipment, and the detailed contractual and other arrangements put in place by Returning Officers reflect the varying circumstances applying at local level. Information provided by Returning Officers to my Department indicates that the total annual storage cost for the electronic voting machines and ancillary equipment (which includes rent, insurance, service charges, rates, heating) is some €696,000.</p>

          <speech by="#DickRoche" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_636">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_1426">Under the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, producers — i.e. manufacturers and importers — of farm plastics (silage bale wrap and sheeting) are required to take steps to recover farm plastics waste which they have placed on the market or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes to recover the waste in question. The Irish Farm Film Producers Group (IFFPG) is currently the sole approved body in Ireland for the purposes of implementing a compliance scheme for the recovery of farm plastics waste.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">Under the IFFPG scheme, producers apply a levy on the sale of farm plastics that in turn is transferred to the IFFPG for use in funding the collection and recovery of farm plastics waste. It is estimated that around 8,500 tonnes (some55%) of farm plastics placed on the market in 2004 were collected for recycling. An estimated 55,000 farmers availed of the collection service in 2004. IFFPG estimate that over 12,500 tonnes of farm plastics were collected in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">In spite of the successful operation of the scheme in recent years, more recently it has become apparent that the Scheme lacked sufficient resources to satisfy the demand that existed for collections of farm plastics. I have therefore, following discussions with the IFFPG, farming organisations and local authorities, recently announced amendments to the scheme to support improved services to farmers. Under the new arrangements, the scheme will be funded by a combination of the existing levies paid by the producer members of IFFPG who run the scheme and funding from weight based collection charges to be paid by farmers availing of the service. This will improve the operational efficiency of the scheme by incentivising the presentation of clean, dry plastic by farmers. IFFPG estimate that a typical farmer will incur a cost of €50 every second year arising from the introduction of this charge. The effect of the introduction of a charge will be to ensure that supply of collections of farm plastics to farmers can match the demand on an ongoing basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">In order to ensure that producer responsibility remains the principal source of funds for the IFFPG, minimum recovery/recycling targets, to be funded by producers placing this material on the market, are being set. The target will be 50% for 2006 and 2007 and this will rise to 55% by end 2008 and 60% thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1430">In addition, to address the issue of accumulated backlogs of farm plastic, designated facilities will be provided this year on a temporary basis by local authorities where farmers may deposit stockpiled farm plastic. This will operate on a pilot basis in the first instance in counties Galway, Clare, Mayo, Offaly and Waterford. It is planned to role out this service to other areas after the initial trial, which will assist in determining the quantities of plastic likely to be recovered for recycling under this initiative. This service will be free to the farmer and funding to assist the local authorities will be made available from my Department through the Environment Fund. My Department is asking the local authorities involved to proceed with collections at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1431">Further steps are also to be taken by IFFPG to improve traceability whereby the compliance scheme will now examine the question of introducing a register of suppliers. The purpose of this measure will be to support compliance with the requirements of the scheme and to reduce scope for unfair competition from 'free riders' in the market. Overall, this package of measures is designed to improve the efficiency of the IFFPG, reduce the scope for non-compliance and ensure that farmers can avail of a more reliable service.</p>

            <p eId="para_1445">My Department does not have a breakdown of new house completions by type of buyer. However, mortgage data provided by the financial institutions indicates that during 2005 first time buyers remained a strong presence in the housing market, representing approximately 45% of the new housing loans paid out in 2005. First time buyers have also a strong presence in the second hand housing market, making up 30% of the second hand housing loans paid out in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">The key objective of Government housing policy is to enable every household to have available an affordable dwelling of good quality, suited to its needs, in a good environment and as far as possible, at the tenure of its choice. To further this objective, the Government has implemented a balanced range of measures to increase overall housing supply and afford greater access to the housing market to first-time buyers; to develop the private rented sector and to advance social and affordable housing programmes specifically targeted at low income groups and those with social housing needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447">It is proposed that 15,000 units of affordable housing will be delivered in the three-year period 2006 — 2008. This represents a doubling of the rate of output of affordable housing over the past three years and will significantly increase the supply of affordable homes for first time buyers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1449">In March 2006 648.3 hectares (1,602 acres) at Luggala were acquired for Wicklow Mountains National Park by my Department for €1.725m. This was the first acquisition for the Park during the past five years. Over the years, the Government has pursued a policy of increasing the number and size of our National Parks where possible. This has resulted in a growth in the number of National Parks from one (Killarney) in 1972, to six at the present time. I believe that we should continue to enlarge the area of these Parks and particularly through the acquisition of adjacent habitat-rich lands as they become available.</p>
