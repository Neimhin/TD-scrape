        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">I am sure the House will agree that we expressed a sense of grave disappointment at the failure to conclude the talks in Hillsborough yesterday in respect of the completion of the Good Friday Agreement. I received a telephone call earlier this morning from the Department of the Taoiseach to request the Taoiseach be allowed to stay away from the House for a while, as the talks concluded late last night or early this morning. Arising from that can the Tánaiste outline a timetable to resurrect the talks to the point where they might be completed?</p>
          <p eId="para_2">Given that both the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach were very much against the postponement of the elections beyond 1 May and the real possibility that an invasion of Iraq might take place which will obviously divert the attentions of the British Prime Minister, is there not now a serious possibility that these talks and all the work, discussions and deliberations that have taken place over the past five years will begin to unravel? This is very serious for the entire island of Ireland following the consent given in a referendum by the people, both North and South, to the Good Friday Agreement. Does the Taoiseach intend coming in here today to give a statement to the House and allow us to discuss this? Can the Tánaiste indicate the timetable set out by both Governments to attempt to resurrect the talks to a point where they can be concluded successfully?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Tánaiste" eId="spk_2">
          <from>The Tánaiste</from>
          <p eId="para_3">I am sure the House would wish to join me in commending the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister as well as all the parties for their hard work over the past two days. There were 30 hours of intensive and substantive talks and this was an exercise in optimism and trust. While there have been difficulties nobody should underestimate the progress that was made.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">The intention is for the two Governments to meet the parties again in early April to put proposals to them. I believe the parties are aware privately what those proposals are and there is now a period of reflection for the parties to sell those proposals to their members. During the  talks process everybody recognised it was preferable to delay the elections from 1 May to 29 May so that the appropriate time would be given to parties to sell the new proposals to their electorate before they go to the polls. That is understandable and appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I am not certain of the Taoiseach's intentions for today; I have not spoken to him yet this morning. However, I am certain the Government would be available to brief the Opposition parties and maybe later in the day we could discuss what form that might take.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_6">This side of the House offers its full support to the efforts of Government to achieve success in this. I share the Tánaiste's view that this was an exercise in trust. Can the Tánaiste confirm whether the issue of sanctions was the single dividing point and that all sides seemed to be in favour of this with the exception of Sinn Féin? At a recent meeting I attended in Belfast, it was made clear to us that Sinn Féin does not represent the IRA, but had influence over it. If that was the single point of real division, what attempts will be made to have Sinn Féin use its expressed influence over the IRA to bring about conclusion?</p>
          <p eId="para_7">Given the likely diversion of attention by the British Prime Minister, this is now really urgent and is critical to the future reputation of the entire island of Ireland. In so far as this side of the House can give any assistance towards concluding these matters, that will be readily forthcoming.</p>

          <p eId="para_8">I very much appreciate what Deputy Kenny has said and the constructive role Fine Gael has played in the talks process, not just in recent days but also in the past. I have been briefed on the talks and it would not be helpful to start speculating as to where the area of disagreement might be or what areas of difficulty remain. In all processes of this kind there are requirements on various parties and enormous courage and determination is required. The parties now have a period in which to reflect. That is a very good thing and the Governments will come forward with their proposals in early April, but the parties are in no doubt as to the shape of those proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">The elections in May will give an opportunity to the electorate in Northern Ireland to place their trust and support in those who have taken huge risks for peace. It is therefore important that we consolidate and resolve in the first incidence all the remaining outstanding issues to allow us to consolidate the enormous progress that has been made since the Good Friday Agreement so that all the institutions can be put into effect again as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_10">Like Deputy Kenny, I agreed to the Taoiseach's request. However, it would be important for him to come to the House either  later today or certainly by tomorrow to have a discussion on these important developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">Did the Tánaiste see the quote attributed to Deputy Woods, in which he described the Freedom of Information Act as a half measure, merely window dressing and called for the repeal of the Official Secrets Act when Eithne Fitzgerald was putting through the Freedom of Information Act? Does the Tánaiste not agree it was that kind of humbug, which brought the Progressive Democrats into existence? Did the Tánaiste not make her name on the basis of her espousal of openness, transparency and accountability? Is the record of the House not littered with references by her to the necessity for greater openness and transparency? How does she reconcile this with the repeal of the Freedom of Information Act?</p>
          <p eId="para_12">Does the Tánaiste agree that it is not merely the historical role of the Progressive Democrats Party to act as the people's watchdog in Government and ride shotgun on the Fianna Fáil Party? As recently as the last election, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, canvassed on the basis that the Fianna Fáil Party could not be let out alone and required an escort. His slogan was "Single Party Government, No thanks".</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I draw the Tánaiste's attention to the words of Deputy O'Donnell when the then Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, was putting the Freedom of Information Act through the Houses. The Deputy stated: "There is little point in legislating for the principle of openness and access to information if everything sensitive to the authorities is to be excluded by exemption."  If she was not right then, she is certainly right now.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">How does the Tánaiste reconcile her collusion with the Fianna Fáil Party in covering up arrangements made during the lifetime of the previous Government in order to keep them from the prying eyes of the public, journalists and the Opposition? It is a disgrace to which I did not believe the Progressive Democrats Party would assent.</p>

He stated nothing of the kind was being contemplated.

What exactly is the Government's view of this resolution? The Taoiseach said it was a political imperative. Does the Tánaiste believe it is a legal imperative? Leaving aside the real reasons for the war and the question of morality, what is the Government's view of the opinion of many international legal experts that even a second resolution which endorsed the principle of a pre-emptive strike would be completely wrong and inadmissible in international law?</p>
          <p eId="para_52">Will the Government please stop colluding in the fraud that the imminent invasion of Iraq is about alleged weapons of mass destruction or to bring democracy to the Iraqi people? The real reason is to secure Iraqi oil fields for the United States and western capitalism, in other words it is an old-fashioned, imperialist grab for resources and control of the region.

          <p eId="para_115">I thought we might get a little more detail from the Minister of State on the question of cutbacks in the CSO budget. I tried to raise this question yesterday so perhaps I will have more success today. There have been reports about this and the Taoiseach referred to initiatives and projects affected by these cutbacks. Will the Minister of State indicate if the national employment survey, which is probably more important now than it has been for many years, will be affected by what I understand will be a 40% cut in the CSO budget?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_96" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach">
          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_116">As I said at the outset, and I realise it was difficult to hear the reply, the CSO funding is cyclical in nature. The reason for the cut is that much more money was required last year to deal with the census returns than is needed this year. With the funding available to it, however, the CSO will be able to continue with its priority work and much extra work also for the coming year. For example, it will complete the census of population, which is essential, and the reports will come out during this year. It will also be launching the new EU SILC survey on income and living conditions. Funding not available in the original Estimate has been made available for that survey because the nine Departments have agreed to contribute €100,000 each towards its cost. That is important because it will ensure we  can participate in this survey which will provide good quality national estimates on poverty rates, income distribution, etc., which I know is of interest to the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">Other activities which the CSO will be able to continue this year include the implementation of the two major studies – structural and quarterly – on the earnings statistics the Deputy is interested in, and advance preparation will be made for the household budget survey of 2004-05, which will also be going ahead. The core work of the CSO, plus additional work, will go ahead as usual.</p>

I realise it replaces the structure of earnings survey which might be what the Minister of State was referring to when she talked about earnings statistics. I specifically asked if this survey, which I understand is to go ahead in 2003, will be affected in any way by the cutbacks and I was looking for a "Yes" or "No" answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_120">I apologise to the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister of State for being late in availing of my opportunity to put a question. Will the Minister of State outline the co-operation between the Central Statistics Office here and the equivalent body in the Six Counties? Is work ongoing so that the results of the census on both sides of the Border can be compared and collated? Does this come under the remit of any of the all-Ireland implementation bodies? Will the Government seek to advance this issue on its agenda? Finally, does the Minister recognise that increasingly we need to treat this island as a unit in policy terms and, therefore, co-operation even between our statisticians is a requirement?</p>

          <p eId="para_121">The Central Statistics Office is an independent body which works separately but of course there is co-operation on the island and within the EU for the collation of data. We have found that as questions can be asked in different ways it can be difficult to compare statistics but we are becoming increasingly aware of the value and importance of data being collected in a way that can be used on an all-island basis. Regarding the Deputy's second point, the National Statistics Board has been devising schemes and outlines for the kind of statistics we need. Deputies will be aware of a particular dearth of statistics on social issues and those are urgently needed for health and social policies. The National Statistics Board is working closely to build links with the CSO to  devise strategies to determine exactly what kind of statistics will be needed in the future. Those can then be collated in a similar way across Departments for policy input.</p>

Will she inform us of the Government's intentions regarding the CSO? Does she agree that it is not a case of cutting funds but that there should be an expansion of the work of the CSO into different areas of the economy and society?

          <p eId="para_136">I agree on the importance of statistics and of using those statistics for various policies. The obvious examples are the national spatial strategy, education policies, social and  health access and so on. Those would all depend on knowing population statistics but also on details of income and lifestyle and that kind of information is gathered on a regular basis. It is not true to say, however, that there has been a real cut in funding. It is because of the cyclical nature of the work of the CSO that funding is lower this year than last year. As I said at the outset, though I know it was difficult to hear, the census of population is only done every five years but obviously in those years much more funding is needed. The household budget survey is done every five years and the census of agriculture is done every ten years; in those years funding is likely to be higher than in the other years, when the CSO continues with its usual work. I welcome the fact that we are looking more and more for social statistics, which can contribute in a very positive way to policies across Departments.</p>

The CSO is itself physically responsible for collecting the census population figures with the couple of million forms it delivers through its enumerators before coding the responses. The CSO is not responsible for the collation of crime statistics because that is information the Garda has and as that is the body which has the information, it will have to remain the body responsible for gathering it.</p>

      <b>Mr. Sargent</b>
      asked the

      his views on the Central Statistic Office's Statistical Yearbook of Ireland 2002 published on 20 November 2002.

          <p eId="para_147">The first edition of the new look Statistical Yearbook of Ireland was launched by the CSO in October 2001. The 2002 yearbook was published on 20 November last year. This yearbook gives a comprehensive picture of Ireland in figures up to 2001. It contains 18 chapters of statistical tables and commentary, spanning a wide range of topics. The figures are taken from the CSO's surveys but also include a wide range of information compiled by other bodies. The report also includes, in an appendix, a range of statistics on Northern Ireland. The Statistical Yearbook of Ireland is also available free on the CSO website. This is a comprehensive and very informative publication and I congratulate the CSO on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_148">I too congratulate the CSO. Forgive me for jumping ahead but we are so used to having a compilation of questions that often one wonders why they are grouped together. The process is more logical in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">Does the Minister of State agree that there are some alarming statistics in the yearbook? What is her role in bringing the important information gathered by the hard work of the CSO to the attention of other Departments? I draw the House's attention to the total number of registered vehicles being up 60% from 1990 to 2000, with the related CO2 emissions up 106% over the same period. That is alarming from both a national and international perspective. Does the Minister of State agree that those figures should be noted and acted on?</p>
          <p eId="para_150">Does the Minister of State agree that the CSO is reflecting a serious problem regarding the failure of Government policy, for example, on total energy requirements being up 74% since 1980? Of the one tonne of waste per household, one quarter is made up of packaging, which is another serious failure of our ability to get to grips with the limitations the natural world puts on our activities. What is the Minister of State's role in bringing these facts to the attention of other Departments so that they are acted on?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_127">
          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_151">The Deputy will not expect me to be aware of every statistic in the book, which is 423 pages long. To each their own, and obviously everyone has a different interest. Deputy Sargent took a particular interest in the figures on energy, while I took a particular interest in the figures showing that females live at least five and a half years longer than their male counterparts. Those are the kinds of figures that jump out at one.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">As I said earlier, the important thing is that the statistics are used by various Departments. What is valuable about this book is the range of information in it. It covers everything – population, education, agriculture, industry, building and construction, tourism, earnings, the environment, services and distribution. It was circulated to all Departments, which were asked to establish a national information gathering unit to ensure the statistics are collated and used properly. From my experience in the Department of Health and Children, I would be the first to admit that the collation of information has not been good and has not contributed properly to Government policy. We can use this accurate information in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_153">I take the Minister of State's point and I am glad to hear her acknowledge that there were problems in the past. What will she do to ensure there is a response and that the bad practice of the past will not continue? Is there any way to monitor the success of those Departments that have taken note of the CSO figures? Will she ask for any assessment, as she would have done in her teaching days?</p>

          <p eId="para_155">Each Department now identifies a responsible person. In the Department of the Taoiseach a senior officer is responsible for the entire statistics area. By establishing a Cabinet sub-committee to draw together all Departments, we will now see the impact of the information. It was used when devising the national children's strategy and the national spatial strategy. By using figures from the National Statistics Board, as well as from the CSO, such information has more influence on policy.</p>

          <p eId="para_157">As part of its statement of strategy 2001-03, the Central Statistics Office is committed to disseminating the full range of results from the 2002 census by the end of April 2004, two years after census day.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">The preliminary report of the census, which was based on summaries prepared by the enumerators, was published on 24 July 2002. It is planned to release the principal demographic results in June 2003 and to follow this up with the principal socio-economic results in September.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">Individual subject matter volumes will be published between June 2003 and April 2004. The first of these volumes, on population classified by area, will be made available in July 2003. In  addition to hard copy publications, all output from the 2002 census will be made available on the CSO website.</p>

          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_160">When the Minister of State was recording that Irish women live longer than Irishmen, did she notice that the health status of men and women in this State is not all it could be? Irish women have a life span that is seven years shorter than that of French women. Considering the state of the health service, this should be a matter of anxiety to her.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">Is the Minister aware that the figures for population as categorised by area are available? Why is publication of these figures of national significance being delayed until July and not happening now? What is the situation regarding the redrawing of boundaries for the European election in 2004 and the next general election? These figures form the basis for the redrawing of constituencies.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_133">
          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_162">Why not compare the life expectancy of Irishmen and women now to that they previously enjoyed? In 1926, when the first live tables were compiled, life expectancy was 57 years. For children born in 1996, male expectancy is 73 years and 78.5 years for females. According to statistics, the CSO's projections indicate that life expectancy will improve to 77.8 years for men and 84 years for women by 2030. Go raibh fada buan sinn go léir.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">The census was 25% ahead of the timetable of the previous census in publishing documentation. The original census returns were made available to every Deputy in a preliminary report. In July the population of males and females in each constituency, as defined in the Electoral (Amendment)(No. 2) Act 1998 for elections to Dáil Éireann, and the figures for county and city local electoral areas in 2002 will be available.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">Such information is not readily available at the moment. It would be premature to make any decisions on boundary commissions prior to the publication of the figures but it is evident from the preliminary results that there have been major population shifts, particularly in areas such as the west side of Dublin city, and those must be carefully considered before any decisions are made.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_169">Has the Minister of State been in contact with the director general of the CSO about bringing forward the date of publication of the area based population figures in view of the urgency of the matter and the improvements in technology which should make tabulation and checking of the figures much simpler and speedier than was previously the case? The CSO is a professional body.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">It is not only politicians who are interested in these figures, many local authorities are contemplating the review of their development plans and these data are essential and will help identify trends that will underpin them. If the Minister of State has not already been in contact with the director general of the CSO, will she undertake to contact him to see if they can bring forward publication from July? If that is not possible, will she tell us why not?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_139">
          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_171">To give credit to the CSO, 1.3 million census forms will be fully processed by the end of April. Technology has substantially facilitated the work with scanning and recognition software that was not used previously. That is why the office was ahead of itself in being able to publish preliminary results. The processing and publication times adopted are in line with best international practice and are far ahead of what was seen in Britain, where the census was carried out on 29 April 2001 but was not processed until October 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">I am confident that the CSO is working as fast and as efficiently as possible. It must carry on with work involving labour force statistics and household surveys that are published on a regular basis. I meet the CSO often to discuss its work and if it felt it would have the information earlier, it would make it available but I do not believe it can.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" eId="spk_140">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_173">I am somewhat amazed at how quickly one's personality can slip into the orthodoxy of office and the officialdom response. I merely asked the Minister of State if she would consider asking the CSO, rather than simply taking at face value what they tell her. Of course, information technology has improved but surely a teacher of the Minister of State's renown and respect across the whole area of Dun Laoghaire would be the first to pick up the absolute contradiction of comparing apples and oranges. A state with less than four million people, as against a state with just under 60 million people, is a different mathematical or arithmetical exercise. To suggest that one can compare the two and say we are ahead of British practice is facile in the extreme.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">May I repeat my request to the Minister of State? At the request of the elected Members of this House, if it is not an imposition on the  Government, will she convey our desire to ascertain if it is possible for the CSO to bring forward the publication date we would like to see, rather than the date offered by it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_141">
          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_175">It is not a matter of apples and oranges but rather of showing that the CSO fulfils the best international practice. Of course I appreciate the value of it and I will be happy to ask the CSO if it is possible in the context of its time plan. In response to one of the Deputy's original questions, I have not asked that of the CSO to date but I believe the time plan it has set out, which is a very ambitious target, is the only one it considers feasible. Bearing in mind that the CSO is an independent body, I will, of course, convey the Deputy's request.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_176">Arising from the Minister of State's reply – and without wishing to be difficult or truculent – the figures which have already been published require certain actions on the part of Government Departments at this stage. Essentially, what we are asking is whether, on the basis of the information now available to the various Government Departments, certain actions should be taken to avoid a crisis six or seven months from now, with a Bill being rushed through the House when that is totally unnecessary.</p>

          <p eId="para_185">Following on from Deputy Quinn's point, which I support, when the Minister of State meets the CSO about the issues and questions raised in this regard, will she ask that, if it is possible, the area breakdown be published area by area? As well as local authorities, other bodies such as school and church authorities and many other groups are waiting with bated breath for the information which will enable them to formulate plans, sometimes involving considerable capital investment and voluntary fund raising. Will the Minister of State ask that the area statistics be published as they become available, rather than waiting for everything to be compiled and then published in one fell swoop?</p>

          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_186">I suggest that much of the information which some people would require could be gleaned from the publication already issued. That is a most useful document and, accordingly, I have circulated it to all Members. The CSO is an independent body, working in a very professional way. I am not sure the CSO would regard it as in the best interest of the overall picture to begin issuing information on a piecemeal basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_187">It is clear the Minister of State has not asked the CSO the reason it has taken so long to publish this information. I welcome the fact that she will now go back to seek further information from the CSO and, presumably, to put the case which has been made in this House. Will she revert to the leaders of the Opposition parties to advise them as to the new course of action as a result of raising those issues with the CSO? In relation to the work of the Boundary Commission, how does the Minister of State envisage that work being carried out in relation to the European election and general election boundaries? Is it intended to have local election boundaries revised before the local elections in 2004? The time frame in that regard is not great, in terms of starting from July. I believe the Government has not clearly indicated the programme of work in relation to drawing up new boundaries to match population shifts.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">Reverting to the House with information during Question Time is difficult for me as my questions are usually numbered from 100 upwards and are rarely reached. However, I will, of course, pass on to the Deputies any information I receive from the CSO. My remit, broad though it may be, does not extend to dealing with Boundary Commission matters and I regret I cannot advise the Deputy on that.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_189">If I may return to an earlier reply from the Minister of State, I also had dealings with the CSO in the past. I have the utmost regard for its professionalism, the manner in which it conducts its business and, of course, its independence. However, does the Minister of State agree that times have changed and access  to information is now required at a much faster level than was previously the case?</p>
          <p eId="para_190">Does she also agree that, statistically, there is a practice in relation to publication of economic data whereby, at the end of a current year, provisional data for the outturn, in terms of performance, is published, with an asterisk drawing attention to the fact that these are provisional data which may be subject to correction? Accordingly, does she agree it is possible, on the basis of the provisional data, to look at the trends in emerging fields of information, including population movement? This may not have been the practice of the CSO in the past but the Minister of State could request it to bring forward the data currently available to enable local authorities and other bodies, including political parties and Government agencies, to have a snapshot look at trends in demographic movement and begin to evaluate possible alternatives, in the clear knowledge that the figures may be adjusted subsequently by 2% or 3%. The clear parameters would have been set in the publication of provisional figures. I formally request the Minister of State to consider putting the proposition to the CSO, without in any way compromising its professionalism or integrity, to release the information currently available to it and, perhaps, to publish it in electronic form if hard copy printing is a delaying factor.</p>

If we are only looking for a snapshot of general trends and indications, even on the local areas – I do not know if all Deputies have looked closely at the census report for their own constituencies and beyond – it is broken down by area. I just happened to open the page for the Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown area, which has an area breakdown. From this, we can obtain trends, a snapshot picture, and indications of the population shifts. We have not got the exact, accurate information the Deputy is seeking. That is what the CSO is telling us will not be available until June. As I already said, I will revert to the CSO to ascertain its thinking in this regard.</p>

Ar an ábhar céanna tá deacracht ag baint le comparáid idir dhaonáireamh na bliana 1996 agus na daonáirimh roimhe sin mar gheall ar an athrú a cuireadh ar fhoclaíocht na ceiste faoin nGaeilge i 1996.</p>

I gcomhthéacs Chonradh Aoine an Chéasta, ar a laghad, nach tábhachtach an rud é go mbeadh na ceisteanna céanna á gcur chun go dtuigfí na staitisticí a bhaineann leis an oileán ar fad, de bharr go bhfuilimid ag obair ar an mbonn sin in a lán bealaí faoi láthair?</p>

Má fhéactar ar na figiúirí féin feictear go raibh breis agus milliún duine adúirt gur Gaeilgeoirí iad sa bhliain 1991(35% den daonra). Sa bhliain 1996 dúirt 1,430,000 (41% den daonra) an rud céanna. An deacracht atá ann nárbh ionann na ceisteanna a cuireadh sa dá bhliain agus mar sin go bhfuil sé deacair comparáid chuí a dhéanamh. Tá sé deacair freisin comparáid cheart a dhéanamh idir na figiúirí a cuireadh mar níor cuireadh an cheist chéanna ó thuaidh agus a cuireadh anseo.

Aithnímid, freisin, go bhuil líon na ndaoine lasmuigh den nGaeltacht a labhraíonn Gaeilge ag méadú.

Tá dhá ghrúpa i gceist a rialaíonn cursaí ins an dá áit agus tá polasaithe difriúla ins an dá áit. Tá eolas ann gur feidir linn a úsaid.

The Ombudsman went so far as to give a special report to Dáil Éireann that the authority of his office was being seriously undermined by the attitude of the Revenue Commissioners.

          <p eId="para_223">In No. 18, to delete "1.30 p.m." and substitute "7 p.m.".</p>
          <p eId="para_224">On 20 February the Tánaiste took the Order of Business and I raised the question of the emergence of completely new amendments on Report Stage of the Finance Bill. She told me she would raise it with the Minister for Finance and that she hoped the Minister would revert to me. He did not, which will not come as a surprise to anybody on the Front Bench of the Government side.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">Amendment No. 26 is a completely new amendment, the purpose of which is to give extensive capital allowances to an unnamed private health facility. This is in keeping with a number of projects in the private health area over the past five years that have been conferred with the benefit of significant capital allowances. The beneficiaries in all cases were very specific. I do not know, nor has the House been told, who is the beneficiary in this case. It seems to be a day care clinic. It is entirely wrong, based on what the Tánaiste told me on 20 February, that for the first time such an amendment can be introduced on Report Stage. We do not even know when it will be reached – there is no guarantee it will be reached at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">Since 1998 extensive changes have been made to the Finance Acts, extending the provision in  question to private nursing homes in that year and to convalescent homes the year after that. The year after that charitable trusts were permitted this facility and in 2002 they were excised. Now private facilities are being assisted in this way, yet the Minister will not say who is the beneficiary, only that it was a ministerial initiative. It may be perfectly creditable, I do not know. However, this is no way to enact finance legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">I ask the Tánaiste to agree to an amendment to the Standing Orders that would delete "1.30 p.m." and substitute "7 p.m." and provide that, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, amendment No. 26 be recommitted to the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which shall complete its deliberations not later than whatever time the Tánaiste wishes. The intention is that the select committee meet in this Chamber, recommit the amendment to Committee Stage and allow it to be discussed. It is completely unacceptable that we do business in this fashion on such an important matter, the major financial instrument of the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_228">It must be clear to the Tánaiste that there is considerable interest in the Finance Bill, with 93 amendments, only 11 of which have been dealt with so far. Deputy Rabbitte referred to a more profound issue, the question of why the Minister for Finance was so keen to take into account the views of bodies outside this House although he has not accepted any amendments from the Opposition. It is strange that in this Parliament the Opposition seems to have so little influence on the Minister, yet those outside the House seem to have so much.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">I ask the Tánaiste to take into account the strong case that has been made for many of the amendments. The Minister for Finance would have more time to reflect on them if we could have more time to discuss the Bill. He should reflect on areas such as biofuel, on which we have a much higher excise duty compared to other countries. We are essentially becoming uncompetitive due to the short-sightedness of our Minister for Finance. He is also denying farmers opportunities for alternative enterprise as well as the chance of cutting down on CO2 emissions. It is strange, when there is such an advantage in responding to some of the Opposition's amendments, that the Minister turns his face against all of them and instead takes the word of outside bodies that are not elected to this House.</p>

What time will there be at the conclusion of the Order of Business to address the body of amendments still before us? We had a longer period of time for discussion yesterday, yet amendments Nos. 12 and 13 have not yet been dealt with. What point will we have reached by the time the debate is finished today? On Report Stage, dealing with this Bill it is absolutely unacceptable that key and  critical areas will not be addressed, including the removal of the roll-over relief on capital gains tax for farmers facing CPOs and those within the small business sector seeking to upgrade and relocate as well as the levies on the banks and financial institutions. There are many important issues which will not be addressed and the Minister and the Cabinet are showing their disregard for the views of other Deputies. On Committee Stage, the Minister refused to take a solitary Opposition amendment, despite the sustainability of each argument presented and obstinately rejected them out of hand. The same attitude is demonstrated here and it is not acceptable. We need more time if we are to do justice to this important Bill.</p>

This would be entirely consistent with Deputy Kenny's request for a committee of the House to hear submissions on the Bill from a number of interested parties. Is it not eminently reasonable to extend the life of the existing Act for 12 months during which the NUJ, the Information Commissioner, Mr. Kevin Murphy, and the civil servants who think these changes are necessary can come before the committee to give evidence? While we are not opposed to the Act being revised we are opposed to it being completely undermined, which is what is happening at the moment.

          <p eId="para_489">This amendment and the one that follows it deals with a similar issue, namely, the situation where the Revenue have made a clear misinterpretation of the tax law and whether in those circumstances the aggrieved taxpayer should not only get back the money he or she lost but also interest supplements to make good the real value of the money.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">This arises acutely in respect of the recent Ombudsman's report which is the subject of my amendment No. 21. The Ombudsman took the exceptional step of reporting directly to these Houses on his experience with the Revenue Commissioners regarding his complaint that a number of widows and a number of other aggrieved taxpayers, including people suffering from serious illnesses, were not being compensated. At the time he drew the attention of the House to the fact that the response of the Revenue Commissioners represented such a misrepresentation of the position, that he considered it a direct and unprecedented challenge to the authority vested in the Office of the Ombudsman by the Oireachtas. The Ombudsman has made this an issue of principle in that he is putting his own reputation and that of his office on the line. We did not make any progress with the Minister on Committee Stage either in terms of legislative change or making arrangements for an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to the individuals involved who were highlighted in the Ombudsman's report.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">This is a matter of major importance to the future operation of the Ombudsman's office and we should get a response from the Minister on it. If he is not willing to accept either amendments Nos. 20 or 21, he should at least indicate that an <i>ex gratia</i> payment will be made to a number of these individuals who are not in a strong financial position. One of them, a constituent of mine, is extremely ill and could do with these moneys. These payments have been recommended by the Ombudsman, the highest office that can adjudicate on such issues. I ask the Minister again to at least make a gesture of goodwill, and allow for an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to be made to these people.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_495">Amendment No. 20 in the name of Deputy Bruton relates to section 17 which we debated fairly extensively in the select committee last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">Section 17 and other sections provide for a general right to repayment of taxes and duties, subject to a four year claim period. In his amendment, Deputy Bruton is seeking to have a ten year time limit for repayment claims arising out of Revenue misinterpreting or misapplying the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">I have a number of points on this amendment. As discussed in the select committee last week, allowing unlimited claims where Revenue have been mistaken in interpreting or applying the law could have significant Exchequer risks. There are cases where tax provisions, having been passed by the Oireachtas and assumed to be constitutional, have subsequently been struck down by the courts as being unconstitutional. There were also cases where Revenue operated in good faith but some years after the event the courts decided that Revenue had been applying a mistaken assumption of the law. In providing for a four year time limit on all claims within the general scheme proposed, I felt it was necessary and reasonable to protect the Exchequer in these types of cases. The proposed four year time limit applies not just to income tax but to all taxes and duties other than custom duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">In recent years it was considered necessary to protect the Exchequer by reducing the time limit for VAT claims from ten to six years. This was because of the perceived magnitude of potential  claims for refunds arising from cases taken not just in the Irish courts but in the European Court of Justice which could give rise to a re-interpretation of existing VAT law. In those circumstances, the Deputy's proposal could have serious implications for the Exchequer. It is also important to note that if there are restrictions under the proposed scheme on the rights of the taxpayer to claim repayment, there are similar restrictions on the Revenue Commissioners to look back generally more than four years.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">I am satisfied the scheme in section 17 achieves the necessary balance between establishing a fair and uniform system for taxpayers while at the same time providing necessary protection for the Exchequer. It also addresses the issue raised by the Ombudsman about the need for a general scheme. In this regard, I am fortified by the words of the Ombudsman in addressing the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. He stated: "I am pleased to acknowledge the initiative of the Minister for Finance in the context of the Finance Bill which fully meets the third of the three outstanding recommendations". For these reasons I am not prepared to accept Deputy Bruton's amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Amendment No. 93 in my name is related to the report made by the Ombudsman to the Oireachtas last November 2002 entitled Redress for Taxpayers. We had a detailed discussion on Committee Stage about the difficulties in implementing two of the recommendations in this report. The general provisions in the Bill are prospective and represent a balanced approach to providing general rights to repayments and interest while protecting the Exchequer from unquantifiable and unlimited costs. For obvious reasons, it would not be tenable to establish a general retrospective scheme. However, I am mindful of the concerns of Deputies on all sides of the House that even if we take a different approach on what should be the elements of a prospective scheme, the cases raised in the Ombudsman's report should be dealt with. I have given further consideration to these two outstanding recommendations and I have consulted the Attorney General's office on various options.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">I propose a solution which is partly legislative and partly administrative and which is strictly confined to the specific cases on which the Ombudsman made recommendations. First, I propose to proceed by way of a legislative solution in respect of the O'Carroll case widows. This amendment will provide the Revenue Commissioners with statutory authority to make payments for loss of purchasing power to those widows. It will permit the Revenue Commissioners to make these payments by reference to the consumer price index, as recommended by the Ombudsman, to all the widows concerned. These payments will be made from the central fund and thus will not be dependent on the size of a Vote or the collection of tax revenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">Second, the Revenue Commissioners will use the voted funds mechanism to make loss of pur chasing power payments to the much smaller remaining group of ten taxpayers on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis so as to complete the response to the Ombudsman's recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">In coming up with this solution, I have been conscious of the need to protect the Exchequer from the creation of any precedent for further claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">The payments provided for under the legislative amendment will be made at the discretion of the accounting officer – the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners. I am advised by the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners that he would propose to approve payments in respect of loss of purchasing power to all those widows to whom repayments are being made by reference to the O'Carroll judgment. This will fully meet the Ombudsman's recommendations in relation to these widows.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">The payments to be made to the other ten taxpayers by the Revenue Commissioners will be made wholly on an exceptional <i>ex gratia</i> basis to the ten taxpayers concerned and to no others.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">In his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on 12 February last, the Ombudsman stressed that "As regards the . . .  ten complainants my recommendations apply only to them and do not extend any further". This unequivocal clarification by the Ombudsman is central to the approach being adopted in responding to his recommendations. I hope in responding fully to the recommendations of the Ombudsman and in providing, together with the Revenue Commissioners, for the payments for loss of purchasing power sought by him, I will have the full support of the House in ensuring that this is an exceptional arrangement in these circumstances and will not be used as a precedent.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">The recommendations of the Ombudsman will be implemented in full and this will be done by a statutory provision creating a discretionary power in relation to the main group, the widows, and by <i>ex gratia</i> payments by Revenue to the ten other taxpayers specified by the Ombudsman. This is being done on the clear basis of an exceptional arrangement for these cases. I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_518">In page 53, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_519">24.–(1) Section 268 of the Principal Act is amended, in subsection (2A), by substituting the following for paragraph (<i>d</i>) of the definition of ‘qualifying hospital':</p>
          <p eId="para_520">‘(<i>d</i>) has the capacity to provide–</p>
          <p eId="para_521">(i) out-patient services and accommodation on an overnight basis of not less than 70in-patient beds, or</p>
          <p eId="para_522">(ii)day-case and out-patient medical and surgical services and accommodation for such services of not less than 40 beds,'.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">(2) This section applies as respects capital expenditure incurred on or after the date of the passing of this Act on the construction (within  the meaning of section 270 of the Principal Act) of a building or structure.".</p>
          <p eId="para_524">This amendment inserts a new section 24 to include hospitals providing acute hospital services on a day case basis within the scheme of capital allowances which applies in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of buildings used as private health care facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">This extension of the tax relief scheme to day hospitals has been devised as a result of a meeting I held last November with certain constituents who then wrote to me about their project. I asked before Christmas that my officials meet the promoters to discuss the detailed provisions of their proposed project. However, this meeting with officials was delayed and did not take place until 24 February, which explains why the provisions have only been included in the Bill now on Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">To qualify, a day case hospital must provide a minimum of 40 day case beds, outpatient services, operating theatres and on-site diagnostic and therapeutic services. It must also have facilities to provide at least five specialist services, ranging from accident and emergency to oncology and cardiology, etc. While the hospital will provide services to those patients with private health insurance, not less than 20% of the bed capacity must be available for public patients. Moreover, the hospital must provide a discount of at least 10% to the State in respect of the fees to be charged in respect of the treatment of public patients. Fulfilment of the qualifying criteria will be certified by the local area health board.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">The capital allowances regime which will apply provides for a seven year write-off period. In other words, allowances of 15% a year will be available for the first six years with the balance of 10% being written off in year seven. The allowances will be subject to a clawback if the building ceases to be a qualifying hospital within ten years. The allowances will be subject to the usual €31,750 limit per annum on the amount of capital allowances which an individual passive investor can set against non-rental income. To conform with EU State aid rules, a day-case hospital will not qualify for the allowances where the relevant interest in the capital expenditure incurred on its construction is held by a company, the trustees of a trust, an individual involved in the operation or management of the hospital as an employee or director, or a property developer. The section will apply in the case of capital expenditure incurred on or after the date of the passing of the Finance Act 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">This section is consistent with the tax incentives I have provided for in recent years for the construction and refurbishment of buildings in the health sector. Similar incentives are available in respect of capital expenditure incurred on nursing homes and associated housing units for the aged and infirm, convalescence homes, private hospitals and sports injury clinics. These incentives play a valuable role in taking pressure off  the public health system. They encourage the creation of additional capacity in the private sector. In addition, they create an alternative option to treatment in a public hospital, not just for those who can afford to provide for their own health care needs, by offering State agencies an opportunity to secure services for public patients from the private sector at discounted rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">The amendment proposes to insert a new section 24 into the Bill. The new section 24 amends section 268 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provides the meaning of the term "industrial building or structure" for capital allowances purposes. Subsection (1)(<i>j</i>) of that section treats as an industrial building or structure a building or structure in use for the purposes of a trade which consists of the operation or management of a qualifying hospital, as defined in subsection 2A of that section. The definition of qualifying hospital sets out a number of conditions and criteria that must be satisfied if a hospital is to be regarded as a qualifying hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">Paragraph (<i>d</i>) of the definition of qualifying hospital is rewritten so as to provide that, in order to be treated as a qualifying hospital for such purposes, a hospital must, <i>inter alia,</i> have the capacity to provide, as it must under the current law, out-patient services and accommodation on an overnight basis of not less than 70 in-patient beds, or, and this is the new measure, day case and out-patient medical and surgical services and accommodation for such services of not less than 40 beds. That is the main change – the condition of 70 beds is reduced to 40 beds in these cases with all the other conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">The new measure will allow private day case hospitals with such capacity to be treated as a qualifying hospital for capital allowances purposes, subject to their satisfying all the existing conditions and criteria set out in the definition of qualifying hospital. The new measure will apply in the case of capital expenditure incurred on construction or refurbishment on or after the date of the passing of the Finance Act 2003. The scheme of capital allowances which applies to qualifying hospitals involves: writing-down allowances of 15% per annum – 10% in year seven – in respect of qualifying construction or refurbishment expenditure – section 272(3)(<i>h</i>) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997; a seven year writing-down period for the allowances – section 272(4)(i) of that Act refers; and a ten year holding period for the purposes of the avoidance of a balancing charge on disposal – section 274(1)(<i>b</i>)(vi) of that Act refers.</p>

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_557">Ireland's approach is based on the need to respect the role of the United Nations. From the outset the Government has made clear its belief that this crisis should be resolved through peaceful means. We have supported, and during our term on the Security Council worked hard to further, the efforts of the international community to arrive at a solution to this issue which will compel the Iraqi authorities to meet their obligations without the need for resort to the actual use of military force.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Ireland, as a member of the Security Council, played an active and constructive role in building the unanimous support for UN Security Council Resolution 1441. Ireland believes that Resolution 1441 offers a genuine prospect of securing peaceful disarmament and of avoiding war. It offers the most likely means of obtaining Iraq's compliance with its disarmament obligations, avoiding a military conflict and preserving primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. We continue to believe that this solution is attainable. We recognise that time is now very limited and we call upon the Iraqi regime to respond promptly and effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">The Iraqi Government must fulfil without delay and in every respect its disarmament obligations, and fully co-operate with the UN inspectors. The Government believes that inspections should continue for as long as the inspectors and the Security Council believe that they are productive, but that they cannot continue indefinitely in the face of Iraqi non-compliance. Should Iraq continue with its lack of full co-operation, I would see a political need for a second resolution. While there is no international legal consensus on the need for a second resolution, it would signal the unity and resolve of the international community and reinforce the legitimacy of any subsequent military action.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">A unified and coherent approach within the Security Council is most likely to succeed in convincing Saddam Hussein to comply with Iraq's obligations. Only full compliance with these obligations can secure the peaceful resolution of this crisis.</p>

Will the Minister confirm in unambiguous terms that the Government will only support multilateral action on Iraq duly authorised by the UN Security Council, that he rules out support for action other than multilateral action duly authorised by the UN Security Council?

          <p eId="para_562">As I stated in my reply, we regard it as politically important that there is a second resolution on this matter in the interests of ensuring that Saddam Hussein gets the message that the international community seeks his full compliance for the peaceful resolution of this crisis on that basis. We note that a resolution has been tabled. The Security Council has yet to discuss the substance of that resolution. There is also a  Franco-German proposal. What we have been saying throughout this, and at the European Council meeting, is there is a need for the Security Council to debate these issues and come forward with a common position. The international community is not best served if the Security Council cannot come forward with a common position.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">Basically we are now seeing the tabling of resolutions and the distribution of papers which will enable the debate to take place in that context. We watch carefully and exhort and encourage all members of the Security Council to address that debate constructively and try to find a solution to this problem. We will of course support the Security Council in whatever it decides in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">I cannot go further than that except to say that we hope the Security Council can come forward with a common position based on the fact that differing views are being expressed at present. We need to see that synthesised into a coherent position by the Security Council and that would have the support of everyone in the international community.</p>

      <b>Mr. M. Higgins</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
      the Government's position on a pre-emptive strike against Iraq; the reasons for the Government's support for a second resolution of the Security Council of the UN before Resolution 1441 had been concluded; if the Government supports the French and German proposal for greater resources and additional time to enable the UN inspectors to complete their task; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [6395/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_439" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_570">The Government has, from the outset, favoured resolution of the current crisis by the UN through peaceful means. It remains our strong hope that this will be possible and we are  encouraging the efforts being made by the international community to ensure this outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">As the Deputy will be aware, the UN Security Council has been trying for the past 12 years, with limited success, to relieve Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein has stubbornly defied all efforts to achieve Iraq's disarmament by peaceful means. He has been willing to see his people suffer the hardship of UN imposed economic sanctions rather than comply with the Security Council's demands. Resolution 1441 gave Iraq a final opportunity to meet its disarmament obligations or face serious consequences. It did not contain a deadline for completion. Immediate and unconditional compliance was required.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">The weapons inspectors will be reporting to the Security Council on Friday on whether and to what extent Saddam has seized that opportunity. I will not pre-empt or speculate on what they might say. The Government has made its position clear, that the arms inspectors should be given as much time as the inspectors and the members of the Security Council believe is necessary to carry forward their task. We would fully support a resolution to that effect. Nevertheless, as is widely accepted, and Hans Blix has made clear, inspections and suggestions for their improvement can only be effective if the Iraqi authorities comply fully with their obligations under Security Council resolutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">If the Security Council should decide to adopt a resolution concluding that Iraq has failed to meet its obligations and that it must now face the serious consequences, we would also support that position, as we are bound to under the UN Charter. I cannot see how subsequent military action on foot of such a resolution could be described as "pre-emptive". Under Article 42, the Security Council is authorised to sanction military action to maintain or restore international peace and security, where lesser measures such as economic sanctions have proved to be inadequate. Twelve years is surely long enough to establish that fact. In sanctioning military action against Iraq, the Security Council would be acting in full accordance with the role and responsibilities conferred on it under the charter.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">I would see a political need for a further resolution, should the use of force become necessary as a matter of last resort. I would do so for two reasons, first, because I believe that military action would be best conducted by a united international community and, second, because a further resolution would reinforce the legal basis for military action and help overcome the legal uncertainty which surrounds the question of whether there is an existing mandate for the use of force.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_440">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_575">Not all resolutions in the past 12 years have dealt with the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. Resolution 688, for example, is not a Chapter VII resolution. It deals with no-fly zones. Six people were killed because  of it. Does the Minister agree that there is no legal basis for the no-fly zone? The original participating countries in this resolution were the USA, the UK and France, the latter of which withdrew. No customary international law was invoked in any of the discussions. What is the position of the Government in relation to this resolution?</p>
          <p eId="para_576">The Minister gave his usual reply about Saddam Hussein's compliance, with which I agree. However, who is to judge that compliance? In the resolutions in which we participated, including the ones over the past 12 years to which the Minister referred, the Security Council states that it will stay seized of the matters. It is the Security Council that is empowered to judge. What is the Minister's opinion of the US and the UK taking it upon themselves to judge whether there is compliance and shifting the goalposts from access for inspectors to destruction of weapons to regime change? Where does the Minister stand in relation to participating in or being bound by a resolution dealing with regime change which is in flagrant violation of the UN Charter?</p>
          <p eId="para_577">I asked in my original question how the Minister had moved the Government's position from unequivocal support for Resolution 1441 to support of a second resolution, as announced by the Taoiseach. Is it supporting the second resolution to avoid war or is it willing to support it to defeat the purposes of Resolution 1441 and provide a facade for war? Resolution 1441 does not contain an automatic trigger, nor do any of the resolutions to which the Minister referred. Yet he says the only issue is Saddam Hussein's compliance. I put it to the Minister that he is silent on pre-emption and on the fact that the USA and the UK have taken it upon themselves to interpret resolutions. He is silent on the issue of whether the mandate of the Security Council is being frustrated. If the Government is faced with a choice between political unity within the Security Council and supporting the UN Charter, on whose side will it fall?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_578">The Deputy has asked a number of questions, with which I will deal as best I can. Resolution 1441 is silent on whether a legal basis exists for military action from previous resolutions simply because we were incapable of obtaining unanimity on that point.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_580">What that means is that it does not explicitly require military action because there were different views within the Security Council when the resolution was being formulated on whether the legal basis for military action already existed. That difference has not gone away. In the event of parties taking military action in the future, it will be characterised not as unilateral action but on the basis of the legal mandate for action they claim still exists in the earlier resol utions. That is a legal point in international law on which there is not unanimity.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_582">I am trying to answer the questions asked by the Deputy and I will answer the next round of questions when the Deputy asks them.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The Deputy mentioned Resolution 688. The no-fly zones in Iraq were originally established to protect the vulnerable Kurdish populations in the north of the country and the Marsh Arab population in the south from attack by the forces of Saddam Hussein. Those populations remain vulnerable to threats of force from the Iraqi regime. In debating the legality in international law of the no-fly zones and the recent military action in Iraq by the US and the UK in support of these zones, this reality needs to be taken into account. Unfortunately, there is no agreed view in the Security Council on this issue. The USA and the UK argue that the establishment of the no-fly zone arrangements is legally justified on the basis of the provisions of a series of Security Council resolutions: Resolutions 678, 686, 687 and 688. Other members of the Security Council contest that interpretation.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">On the basis of the legal advice available to my Department, none of the Security Council resolutions concerned unambiguously addresses the question of the legal legitimacy of the no-fly zone arrangements. Similarly, the basis in international law for the recent attacks by the USA and Britain on Iraqi military installations carried out during patrol of the no-fly zones is also unclear. The matter should be addressed as quickly as possible by the Security Council in its deliberations regarding the present evolving situation. That is the responsibility of the council. As for its responsibility regarding the need for a second resolution, it is open to it to adopt a second resolution if it so wishes – if that is the decision of the Security Council under international law, we will abide by it.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">We see our role in all of this as encouraging the Security Council to muster the collective political will to adopt a position that will increase the pressure on Saddam's regime to disarm voluntarily so that we can try to avoid what is available under the Chapter VII resolution, which is enforcement by military force. That is what we are trying to do. The Deputy has asked me what my position will be in advance of any deliberation or continuing discussion and in advance of Dr. Blix's report next Friday and its impact on present proposals and future discussions. We will deal with those questions and I will be answerable and accountable to the House once the decisions are taken, if they are taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">In the meantime, I am not here on the basis that we have decided upon the date, time and approach for military action. Rather, we are trying to avoid it. In every forum, including the UN and the EU, we are putting forward our view that  the Security Council should come together, although there are differing views, and try to solve this matter in a coherent way on behalf of us all so that Saddam Hussein gets the message that the international community will robustly defend its charter and resolutions in terms of giving him a final opportunity to disarm. We are also trying to make sure that this is resolved peacefully, if at all possible, through the multilateral process.</p>

          <p eId="para_594">The Government has consistently favoured a peaceful solution to this crisis through the United Nations and we have urged the use of diplomatic means in every forum available to us. As a member of the Security Council we worked for the adoption of Resolution 1441, which provides an opportunity to avert military action by achieving Iraqi disarmament through arms inspections. We believe that the arms inspections should continue for as long as the inspectors themselves and the members of the Security Council consider necessary and worthwhile.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">A draft resolution has been tabled in the Security Council by Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. The clear thrust of this text is  that Iraq has been warned that it would face serious consequences if it continues in violation of its disarmament obligations, that Iraq is in further material breach of these obligations and has consequently failed to seize the last opportunity offered by Resolution 1441 to comply with its disarmament obligations. The draft resolution does not speak of continuing arms inspections, nor does it specify what should happen next. Both that and the intention of the Security Council will become clear when the draft is introduced by the sponsors, is placed in context and is followed by a debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">At the same time, the Council has a memorandum before it, prepared by France, Germany and Russia, which foresees the continuation of inspections for a certain period. The arms inspectors are due to deliver their next report on 7 March, which will have an important input into the debate in the Security Council on the draft resolution likely to take place next week. It is not known when or if a vote on the draft resolution, on an amended text or on some other text will take place. The Government will decide its own view in the light of the inspectors' report and the considerations of the Security Council. Should the Security Council adopt a resolution, Ireland would be bound under the Charter of the UN to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council.</p>

I noticed the Chilean Ambassador in the Distinguished Visitor's Gallery this morning. What would the Minister say to him, given that his country has to make a decision on this matter? What would he say Ireland's position is? Would he urge him to accept the French, German and Russian proposal – they have no difficulty outlining their position – or would he urge them to go with the resolution as outlined by the American and the British Governments? Will the Minister give the House a direct answer?</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Does the Minister further agree that this conflict has already begun? Washington has already said that it has extended the range of targets to include weapons which could hinder a ground invasion. On that basis, is it not time that we had another debate in the House and that the Minister ceased permission for the use of Shannon Airport to the Americans?</p>

We used this approach successfully when we were on the Security Council – when we had the unanimous adoption of Resolution 1441. We used it on the European Council when we sought a common position and we will continue to seek to influence the situation on this basis. How does one get to have a common position adopted? If the Deputy's view is that one does not get involved in those discussions and decide to take one side or the other, on the basis of how things currently stand, I am afraid we will not get a resolution to this matter in a way that will forge a united international community position. The purpose of the Security Council is precisely to engage in that debate now on the basis of what will emerge from the Blix report, what recommendations he makes and his analysis on 7 March in his discussions with the Security Council. That is what the Government intends to do. I do not intend to be committed to "what-if".</p>

We regard it as politically important that happens so that we can ensure this regime understands that the resolve of the international community is such that he will have no option but to comply with these resolutions. It would also ensure that the message is sent loudly and clearly and that there is no miscalculation by the regime in relation to our resolve as an international community. As a Minister, I make no apology for discharging my responsibilities by taking our position as to what we feel should be happening, as we try to resolve this matter peacefully in the context of the closing window of opportunity. We will do all we can to get it done that way and get the people who have the responsibility on the Security Council, however burdensome and difficult it is, to try and come forward with a common position on that basis. There is a need for both sides to try and take into account both perspectives to achieve a united position.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">I do not know what the terms of any resolution will be, what amendments will be put or what the final outcome will be and I would like to see what the explanations of the vote are if there is one. When I have all of that information, taking into account our interests and the principles that inform our policy, I will then be in a position to give a recommendation or advice to the Government. The matter will come before the House for debate and the Government will then make a decision. That is the process of accountability involved and I am not in the business of pre-empting that process, given the gravity of the situation for the international community and the seriousness of the situation for our own interests.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_616">Since October, both Governments and the parties have been intensively engaged in talks aimed at achieving the acts of completion necessary to fully and rapidly implement all outstanding aspects of the agreement, including the restoration of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland on a stable and inclusive basis. Our template for this work was the joint statement of 14 October by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair which recognised that the institutions could only be sustained on the basis of mutual trust and confidence between the parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">The talks over recent months have taken place in various formats, including bilateral, trilateral  and collective formations. These discussions also made it clear that the current difficulties in the process could not be reduced to a single item agenda and could best be addressed in a comprehensive framework that advanced and resolved all outstanding issues of the Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">As Deputies will be aware, the past few weeks have been particularly intensive and have culminated in the talks earlier this week and this morning in Hillsborough. A substantial amount of progress was made over the course of two long days and I pay tribute to all of the parties who constructively engaged in those discussions. We managed to bridge or substantially close the gaps in a number of key areas including policing, criminal justice and the human rights and equality areas. While all of the parties did not sign up to every aspect, there is nevertheless a shared understanding among them of the broad parameters of the steps necessary to achieve the required acts of completion on all sides. In Hillsborough, the consistent approach by the two Governments was to provide clarity and certainty and to set down the obligations and commitments necessary to restore full confidence and trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">The Taoiseach and Prime Minister will return to Northern Ireland in early April to publish their final proposals. In the meantime, the parties will avail of the time and space to consult their members before coming to a conclusion. It is very important that over the next few weeks people do not prejudge the outcome of these discussions on the basis of any selective leaks.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">On account of the need to accord some more time and space to the parties to facilitate their consultations, the Assembly elections will be delayed by a few weeks and will now take place on 29 May. I believe that this modest postponement is both appropriate and reasonable. Our aim is that when the people go to the polls on that date, they will see before them an agreement that is in full working order, a demonstrable end to the instability of the past few years and a clear prospect of sustainable political institutions that will deliver a better and more prosperous future for all.</p>

          <p eId="para_621">I was reminded of the saying "Handsome is as handsome does" when I saw a television programme recently featuring a charming and smiling Pol Pot. I am reminded of the saying when I see some of the charming, smiling, PR-trained, Armani-clad politicos on our television screens leading us up the garden path again. It is a terrible pity that, through petulance, democratically elected politicians let these people off the hook and allow them to portray themselves in the way they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">Does the Minister agree that while much progress has been made in the five years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, the public expects we should be well on the way towards its full implementation by this time? Does he  agree that it is reasonable to put in place so-called yellow card and red card sanctions for those who do not meet the requirements of the Agreement? Is such a sanctions procedure the real stumbling block to the election and the resumption of the Executive? If so, what steps does the Minister intend to take to ensure the will of both Governments and all the democratically elected parties that do not have army wings prevails in the resumed talks?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_623">While a degree of frustration is, perhaps, understandable, it is important to state that discussions over the past two days have been substantive on all sides. We have broken new ground in a range of new areas. Because of the nature of the negotiations and the logistical requirements of further discussion and space and time for people to reflect on an intensive period of discussion, it is important we do not allow this to take away from the magnitude of the achievements of the work of the past five months. We are trying to chart out the full and faithful implementation of the Good Friday Agreement on the basis of acts of completion where we see an end to all paramilitarism and the workings of stable institutions meeting not only the word but also the spirit of the Agreement. We have come through a period of transition in this process. We should try to keep this in mind and not allow understandable frustration to take from the genuine achievements in mapping out, to everyone's satisfaction, a shared understanding of what full implementation of the Agreement will mean in an acts of completion phase. We should not underestimate this or be pessimistic.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">I am optimistic that the level and quality of the work, and the consensus that has been achieved, has the prospect of enabling us to move positively towards a new era in Irish politics, north and south. This is what everybody has been striving to achieve in the discussions that concluded in the early hours of this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">The question of the monitoring of and compliance with commitments made has proven to be a very difficult one. Sinn Féin has stated it will not accept any mechanisms that are perceived to be outside the terms of the Agreement while the UUP, in light of past experience, requires such a mechanism if it is to proceed in inclusive government. Mindful of these positions, the Governments will continue to discuss this matter and consult each other with a view to finding a way forward that meets the requirements of proving the necessary trust and confidence for sustainable political institutions. This position will be made public in a month's time.</p>

      <b>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
      his views on the attitude of the Israeli administration to the Quartet road map, if he has raised concerns with the Israeli Prime Minister over the fact that the policy guidelines of the new Israeli coalition Government do not refer to the Quartet road map in any way; his further views on the widely expressed fears that the Israeli Government will escalate its attacks on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and pursue a policy of ethnic cleansing under the cover of war on Iraq; and his further views on the contrast between the current insistence on full Iraqi compliance with UN resolutions and the leniency which has historically and continuously been shown the State of Israel, which has consistently defied UN resolutions since 1967.
      [6768/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_471">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_629">The Quartet road map enjoys the support of the international community and represents the best hope of peace in the Middle East. Its aim of a viable, democratic Palestinian state living in peace beside Israel is one to which the European Union, Russia, the United States and the UN Secretary General are fully committed. The need for all parties to the Middle East conflict to engage along the lines of the road map has been stressed on many occasions by the European Union. It is regrettable that the new Government of Israel has not yet given a positive response to the road map as it clearly offers the best hope of peace and security for the people of Israel and the region in general. I hope that, when the road map is formally adopted and published by the Quartet, the Government of Israel will realise the potential it offers and embrace its possibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">I am aware of fears that, in the event of hostilities in Iraq, circumstances in the occupied Palestinian territories might deteriorate. However, the fear raised by the Deputy that any Israeli Government would use that opportunity to engage in ethnic cleansing is one that disturbs me greatly and I find it difficult to share. It is hardly credible that people of Israel, conscious as they are of the appalling crimes of genocide visited over generations upon their own nation, would countenance a policy of ethnic cleansing being conducted in their name. However, the Government continues to be deeply concerned about the Israeli Government's ongoing policy of establishing and expanding settlements in the occupied territories. This activity is illegal and must stop. Israel's settlement policy is perhaps the biggest obstacle to peace in the Middle East. To suggest, as some do, that settlement activity should cease only as there is progress towards a peaceful settlement is, in my view, putting the cart before the horse.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">As regards the alleged discrepancy between the treatment of Israel and Iraq, the Government is  of the view that all resolutions of the United Nations Security Council should be respected and obeyed. This includes both those resolutions applying to Iraq and those relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Government regrets the failure of Israel to comply with the wishes of the Security Council expressed in numerous resolutions. However, a significant difference between the two groups of resolutions is that those relating to Iraq have been adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter, which provides for enforcement action by the United Nations, while those relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were adopted under Chapter VI of the Charter, which does not. The fact that resolutions were adopted many years ago does not weaken their force and it is clear to all involved in the search for peace in the Middle East that the provisions of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and other relevant resolutions will form the basis for the eventual settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">In the case of Iraq, the Security Council has been applying economic sanctions against Iraq for 12 years in an, as yet, unsuccessful effort to force Iraq to surrender its weapons of mass destruction. Where such sanctions have proved to be inadequate, Article 43 of the UN Charter clearly allows the Security Council to sanction military action as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_633">While the Minister accepts the need to implement UN resolutions, it is a pity he does not agree with me that there is a double standard in their application, even though they have been passed under different chapters. What is happening in Israel and, in particular, in the occupied Palestinian territories equates to breaches of international law, torture and denial of human rights. What steps will the Minister take to muster the political will in Europe and the UN to bring pressure on Israel to conform to the UN resolution? Israel, in ignoring the quartet road map, has taken a decision to consign it to the dustbin. That will be frustrating for everybody who has put so much effort into it. The best hope is that the UN resolutions will be complied with and political pressure will be brought to bear on Israel to comply with them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_473">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_634">There is no double standard in the UN regarding the implementation of its resolutions. There are different chapters which afford different levels of intervention and there are different instruments available to the UN in not just the adoption of resolutions but also their implementation. Chapter seven has an enforcement mechanism that is not available under chapter six resolutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">It is important that this intractable problem is dealt with through a measure of collective political will that will bring about effective change consistent with the road map set out by the quartet. Ireland will continue to work through the Euro pean Union on this matter to bring about adoption of the resolution and to ensure it will form the context within which future developments will take place in relation to the political and security measures that are necessary in the Middle East.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">Ireland has been consistently forthright, under successive Governments, regarding the need to recognise the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people and, of course, the right of peaceful co-existence for the state of Israel.</p>

        </question>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_475">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_641">I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 165 and 178 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">On 17 December 2002, I set out the Government's position with respect to the situation in West Papua, stating that the question of a possible UN review of the Act of Free Choice would be a matter for the UN Secretariat and the UN Secretary General. I also emphasised that the situation in West Papua and, in particular, the human rights situation there were matters of ongoing concern to the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Following our exchanges in the House on 17 December, I asked that further inquiries regard ing the Act of Free Choice be made by our permanent representation to the UN. The position, however, remains the same. It is a matter, in the first instance, for the UN Secretariat. The support of UN member states would be required for it to be taken forward. The reality is that, irrespective of one's view of the process involved, the UN General Assembly confirmed the Act of Free Choice in 1969. Any change in that position, therefore, would require the support of the wider membership, expressed in the General Assembly.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">The inquiries I initiated have confirmed that at present there is no significant support for this approach. There is, likewise, widespread concern that any such review might prejudice ongoing efforts to initiate a meaningful dialogue with the Government in Jakarta and would not contribute to the amelioration of the current situation of the West Papuan people. At the same time, my Department has remained in contact with the representatives of the West Papua Action group. In January last, the group sent a paper to Deputy Tom Kitt, the Minister of State with special responsibility for overseas assistance and human rights, concerning proposals for action at the Commission on Human Rights. These proposals, which include a request for a specific resolution on Indonesia at the Commission on Human Rights and the establishment of a "zone of peace" in West Papua, which would facilitate peaceful dialogue and reconciliation there, are being considered by my Department in advance of the forthcoming 59th session.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">In January 2003, I took the opportunity of my attendance at the EU-ASEAN Foreign Ministers meeting to meet my Indonesian counterpart, Mr. Wirajuda. I referred to Ireland's interest in the development of a strengthened dialogue and partnership between the EU and Indonesia. I raised issues of particular concern, such as respect for human rights and the tensions in West Papua, and I made the point that these matters impact on our national perception of Indonesia. In reply, Minister Wirajuda referred to the difficult transition process which Indonesia has been undergoing in terms of political, security and economic matters. With regard to West Papua, Mr. Wirajuda commented on what he saw as an improving situation and the implementation of the special autonomy law for West Papua.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">Separate from the autonomy law, President Megawati Sukarnoputri issued a presidential decree to implement a 1999 law to divide the province of West Papua into three provinces. On 13 February 2003, the Indonesian House of Representatives endorsed the decree. There is widespread concern, which I share, about the implications of this decree for the identity and interests of the people of West Papua. EU member states are due to discuss the situation in Indonesia again in April 2003. The situation in West Papua will be among the issues we will examine.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">The Government will continue to monitor closely the situation in West Papua and will continue to encourage the Indonesian authorities to  act with due regard to the rights and interests of the people of West Papua.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_476">
          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_648">I welcome the fact that the Minister raised this issue with his Indonesian counterpart. On the last occasion we discussed this matter the Minister said he would try to find out why there was no support in the UN for this. I am none the wiser from the Minister's reply. Why is there no support within the UN? Will the Minister agree to meet the groups that are interested in West Papua, such as West Papua Action, Trócaire and Amnesty International? They have sought such a meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">Will the Minister talk to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about the case of Mr. Sem Karoba? He is an activist in Ireland who spoke at the Green Party conference at the weekend. He needs his visa extended. He speaks throughout the country on this issue and many Members are aware of him. His life will be under threat if he returns to West Papua. I hope the Minister will give a commitment that he will discuss this with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">The Indonesian Government does not grant journalists free access to West Papua. That means the situation is under-reported in the west. Will the Minister raise this in any forum, particularly when he next meets his Indonesian counterpart, to ensure there is freer access for journalists so the wider public is informed about what is happening there and the type of repression West Papuans must endure?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_477">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_651">There is little support for this approach. It is not that one must try to deal with the Indonesians on these issues. The reason this approach would not be regarded as a productive course of action is that it is felt that a continuing dialogue with the Indonesian authorities by the UN and bilaterally by members of the UN with Indonesia is the best means of trying to influence events for the betterment of the people of West Papua rather than getting involved in a procedural issue which does not command sufficient support. It is felt, our inquiries indicate, that bilateral contact and continuing dialogue with the authorities on a political level is the best prospect of achieving an impact that will benefit the people in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">There is also the background issue of concerns about the stability of Indonesia and the region. There are always concerns about what political problems will emerge should anything happen with regard to Indonesia breaking up. It is a nation of islands in the Pacific and is the most populous Muslim country in the world. There is a necessity to deal with the entity that exists and work pragmatically with it rather than use the other approach. That appears to be the reason for how things stand on that question.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">With regard to the Green Party activist, now that the Deputy has brought that to my attention, I will inquire into the matter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_478">
          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_479">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_655">I will raise with the Minister the case of the person mentioned by the Deputy to see what, if anything, can be done to deal with that situation. Similarly, I will bring to the Indonesian authorities' attention the need for freer access by the media. When I met the Indonesian Foreign Minister I was impressed by his general attitude. Efforts are being made to improve the situation. As the Deputy knows, we did not have a dialogue with Indonesia for a long time over the question of East Timor. Having resolved that specific matter, we feel that intensifying a dialogue with the Indonesians would be the best way to approach the situation in West Papua, rather than taking a different position. Based on my bilateral contacts with the Indonesian Foreign Minister, I will proceed according to that advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">The prospect of my personally meeting these groups is a matter that will continue to be considered. I cannot add anything other than what I have stated publicly. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has responsibility for that area and he is dealing with it. While I understand the Deputy's point, he will understand that given the current workload in the Department, people will receive the Government's position just as clearly from the Minister of State as they would from me.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_480">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_657">It is helpful that the Minister is taking such a deep interest in this subject. The issue can be approached under Article 73 of the United Nations Charter, which concerns decolonisation. The United Nations were in West Papua for six months but their departure facilitated a military takeover there. West Papua is not so much an issue concerning the Indonesian Government as the Indonesian army, as was the case in East Timor. The people who briefed us on this matter have pointed out that the military takeover left 50,000 dead, while 100,000 – that is 10% of the population – have been killed since what was, in effect, the annexation of West Papua.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">Going back to first principles, the Netherlands said West Papua could exercise its right to independence under Article 73 of the UN Charter, but that possibility was frustrated. In December 2001, one of the chief UN officials responsible described what took place as "a whitewash". Now that their right to freedom has been vindicated, why should the West Papuans, who have lost so much, be satisfied with an integrationist dialogue that leaves them continually at the mercy of the Indonesian army which has slaughtered their people?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_481">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_659">This matter will be discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council in April, after which I can report back to the House. I will also discuss the matter with my Dutch counterpart, in light of  the issues raised by the Deputy. The position of ordinary West Papuans poses a difficult problem. I do not necessarily disagree with the sentiments that have been expressed by Opposition Deputies. Since these decisions have not been taken, however, and given the prospect that these issues may not be re-opened in the immediate future, what can one do to address them pragmatically? We think the way forward is not to resolve the ultimate question of self-determination, but to genuinely try to build up an international dialogue that would bring some benefit to the people there. In the aftermath of the Foreign Affairs Council discussions we may be able to re-visit this matter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GayMitchell" eId="spk_482">
          <from>Mr. G. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_660">The Minister will be aware that representatives of West Papua Action have briefed Members that the UN failed to fulfil its obligations to advise, assist and participate in an act of self-determination in accordance with international practice. They also said that the then UN Under-Secretary General, Narasimhan, who handled the takeover, stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_661">It was a whitewash. The mood at the United Nations was to get rid of this problem as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">In view of that, will the Minister confirm that the Government is vigorously supporting international calls for the UN Secretary General to conduct a review of the UN's conduct and actions in relation to the so-called act of free choice in 1968 and 1969, leaving aside what occurred as a result?</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kitt)</from>
          <p eId="para_667">I propose to take Questions Nos. 114, 246 and 252 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">The Government is deeply conscious of the enormity of the challenges facing African nations as they seek to build the foundations of economic and social development, often in a climate of famine and strife. Ireland continues to address these challenges bilaterally and with our partners in the European Union and the United Nations. While the focus of Ireland Aid, the official development assistance programme of the Government, remains on Africa, it also continues to assist where needs are greatest in other parts of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">Ireland Aid responds in two ways to the development needs of Africa and beyond. In the short-term, we focus on saving lives in the most effective way possible through direct assistance via the UN system and international agencies, as well as non-governmental organisations. In the long-term, Ireland Aid's development programmes tackle the structural reasons underlying endemic poverty and insecurity, especially on the African continent.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">Last year, the Government intervened to provide emergency and recovery assistance on over 70 occasions in more than a dozen countries throughout Africa. This humanitarian assistance amounted to more than €20 million. These interventions were designed to reduce the effects of famine and conflict on some of the most vulnerable populations in Africa, with particular emphasis on women and children.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">Our direct humanitarian assistance is complemented by ongoing political action. On food insecurity, we have been working closely with our partners in the EU and the UN to develop strategies on how immediate needs can best be met at national and regional level.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">I have personally visited a number of famine-affected countries in Africa in recent months. On foot of these visits I communicated directly with my EU counterparts to urge a greater humanitarian response. I have met also key figures in the EU and UN, including the EU Commissioner with responsibility for development, the deputy executive director of the UN world food programme and the secretary general of the International Federation of the Red Cross, to highlight my concerns and to discuss ways of improving the co-ordination of assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">If we are to break the cyclical nature of food insecurity and conflict in Africa, the underlying structural problems affecting poverty and stability must be addressed. Ireland Aid has strong development partnerships with six countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Through these partnerships Ireland Aid fully engages with the Governments, donors and EU and UN agencies on the basis of poverty reduction strategy plans. These plans outline how each country prioritises resources and policies with the objective of reducing poverty. The programmes contain a strong governance element throughout to assist in the building of  democratic structures, the rule of law and a culture of respect for human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">This comprehensive and African-owned approach by donors, Governments and civil societies stands the best chance of reversing the downward spiral of economic and social indicators in sub-Saharan Africa, reducing conflict and strife, and facilitating real and positive change in the lives of millions of Africans.</p>

          <p eId="para_675">I do not need to rehearse the figures for the Minister of State who is more experienced than most people and is well aware of the situation. The charity Concern estimates that in Ethiopia alone, up to 35 million people will be in need of food this year. Will the Minister tell the House how much of the EU budget for developing countries remained unspent in the last calendar year, and why was it not spent?</p>

        <speech by="#TomKitt" eId="spk_487" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_677">I share Deputy Mitchell's concern about Ethiopia in particular. Having been there myself, I am very conscious of the reality on the ground. Since my visit, a pre-famine situation has developed, placing 11 million people in great danger. Given the drought conditions, even greater numbers may be threatened by famine.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">The European Union is a major current contributor to humanitarian relief in Ethiopia and elsewhere. The figures for humanitarian assistance for the southern African region amounts to €340 million, of which one third was allocated by the Commission. The EU has committed assistance of €160 million for the Horn of Africa. One of my responsibilities is to ensure that we maintain pressure on the European Commission in this regard. I have had a number of meetings with the Commissioner and with my EU colleagues to ensure that the EU plays a prominent role not only in respect of famine relief requirements but in the long-term approach towards Africa. I am sure the Deputy will agree that the role Ireland plays in this area is respected, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, and we will continue to play that role.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">Those are the types of figures I can share with the Deputy as regards the Commission. We keep in regular touch with it. We need to co-ordinate and redouble our efforts, especially in regard to Ethiopia. Food aid is required there immediately. There is a deficit there. Since I visited that country, I have urged the Commission and the European Union as a whole to do much more and I will continue to do that.</p>

          <p eId="para_683">I would have to get the precise figure for the Deputy. I am sure I could get it for the Deputy today or tomorrow. That type of figure he mentioned would not be the amount in question. It is our responsibility to ensure that the money is well spent, especially having regard to the current needs in the region. According to the World Food Programme, an estimated 30 million people in Africa are directly affected by serious food shortages.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_685">I genuinely do not believe that is the real problem. I mentioned figures for Ethiopia. There is deficit there and there is a responsibility on the United States and others to fill it. Since my visit to that country, I am aware that the USA made further commitments in respect of meeting immediate requirements there, and the EU is still a substantial player in providing resources to meet particular needs. I will get that specific figure for the Deputy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_494">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_686">We met the Commissioner at the Foreign Affairs committee last year and a few years ago. The issue is the proportion of money that has been voted but scandalously lies unspent. Does the Minister of State agree that damage is being done because the countries that are asked to vote more money know that the money they have voted already has not been disbursed by the Commission, which is a disgrace?</p>
          <p eId="para_687">When the Minister of State gets the figure which Deputy Gay Mitchell requested, he might also give the House the figure in respect of the proportion of the commitments made in Johannesburg that have been met. My information is that not even 30% of the commitments made have been delivered. In other words, in a flare of publicity countries made commitments to help alleviate world hunger, but they have not delivered on them and that position, in turn, is damaged by the European Commission's failure to disburse money that has already been voted. That is the position, despite the Commissioner coming here and talking to the Foreign Affairs committee and telling us how he was reorganising everything. He has managed to reorganise in a such a way that hardly any of the NGOs are speaking to him in Brussels, as the Minister of State will be aware. The Minister of State might like to reflect on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_688">Is the Minister of State aware that all the forecasts predict further famines and ecological refugees because of global warming? Is that not a reason we must act and be totally committed to the Kyoto Protocol? Is he aware, in his capacity as Minister of State, that this is a serious problem?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomKitt" eId="spk_496" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_689">I am very much aware of the impact of global warming on the developing world and  have experienced and witnessed the effects of it. I agree with the Deputy's view on the Kyoto Protocol. We have an emphasis on agriculture and development in that area. I have set up a policy and task force on agriculture and I witnessed the impact of many of the creative and innovative schemes we have in place throughout Sub-Saharan Africa during my visits there. We will continue to maintain that emphasis on the need for sustainable development.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">With regard to the EU Commission and the EU in general, I agree with Deputy Michael Higgins that there are commitments that need to be fulfilled. We were the first country to honour our commitment to the global fund on HIV-AIDS and to put money up-front. It is scandalous that many countries who send representatives to these well heralded meetings, such as the Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg to which the Deputy referred, make announcements and pronouncements, but do not pursue them. All we can do is lead by example and we have done that right across the board not only in regard to development issues in general but specifically in relation HIV-AIDS. I am sure the Deputy will agree we have shown the way forward in that regard and our position has been acknowledged internationally. I will get those figures for the Deputies and I will ensure that the Government maintains pressure on the Commission to ensure that these moneys are spent properly.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_497">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_692">The European Council meeting on 17 February was very productive, in that, its outcome demonstrated the broad range of agreement among the members of the European Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Ireland made a significant contribution to the shaping of the agreement. The conclusions restated the European Union objective of full and effective Iraqi disarmament and the desire to achieve this peacefully. I am pleased at the level of consensus which this reflected. In our discussions we also took full account of the deep public concerns about the possibility of conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">Every European Union government is anxious to avoid war. That is why we want to see the disarmament of Iraq achieved through exclusively peaceful means, in accordance with Resolution 1441.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">The Government's policy on the issue of Iraq has been reflected in this as in other EU policy statements, which generally correspond to our view that war is not inevitable, that force must be  used only as a last resort, that we support the work of the arms inspectors, that the unity and firmness of the international community and the military build-up have been essential in obtaining the return of the inspectors, and that those factors will remain essential in achieving the full co-operation needed to attain the goal of disarming Iraq peacefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">A united approach in the Security Council and in the European Union is most likely to succeed in convincing Saddam Hussein to comply with his obligations. Only full compliance with his obligations can secure the peaceful resolution of this crisis.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_498">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_697">I will not go back over old ground. We know the view of the Minister and the Government on full compliance by Iraq; we have heard it often enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">With regard to the meeting of 17 February at which unity was the aim – I understand that would also be the Minister's view – would the British view on compliance be much different from the Irish view on it? Is the allocation of, say, 250,000 troops by Britain and the United States around the borders of Iraq a confidence building measure? Is it the Irish Government's view that they will turn around and head home again if we get further compliance? What compliance would be full compliance?</p>
          <p eId="para_699">Is the Minister aware that one of the 16 resolutions – not all of those resolutions come under Chapter VII which we discussed earlier – he mentioned earlier, Resolution 678, which deals with weapons of mass destruction, provides for the ending of sanctions should there be full compliance? Is the Government still advancing this view in the knowledge that Warren Christopher unilaterally dropped this section of the resolution as far back as 1998?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_499">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_700">If we get full compliance and this matter is peacefully resolved to the satisfaction of the international community and Saddam Hussein no longer has the capability he has, which he should not have under the arrangements made when the ceasefire to the Gulf War was negotiated by his generals, I assure the Deputy we will advocate the dropping of sanctions pretty quickly because they were only brought in because Saddam Hussein would not comply with his own agreements.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">In relation to the European Council meeting, the common position was set out. Given the expectations for that meeting, the idea that it would end in total disarray and that it would not be possible to have a common position, that was avoided. It is important for the political credibility of the European Council that it was avoided. In fairness to the leaders of the governments who have different views on these matters, there was a preparedness on all their parts to work to that common position which emerged. It is to the credit of them all that they did that,  although it was not to the effect that differences had been eliminated.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">As regards the military build-up and the purpose of it, rather than being considered a confidence building measure I hope it is a confidence shattering measure for the Iraqi regime and, if it gets it to disarm peacefully, I welcome it. I hope the Security Council under the terms of its resolution and through the inspectors' reporting mechanism is able to confirm that full compliance is forthcoming, although unfortunately I read what Mr. Blix had to say that the level of co-operation appears to increase with the imminence of the publication of his reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">The problem is one of attitude. The inspectors' reports state that the issue of attitude would get us out of this logjam of uncertainty and crisis. It is unfortunate that the Iraqi regime appears incapable of providing the level of co-operation that would enable the inspectors to confirm to the Security Council that they are obtaining full compliance. Our position is that, as long as the inspectors and the Security Council believe the inspection work is useful, we will support it. If the Security Council reaches a different conclusion based on the fact that full compliance has not been forthcoming, we will also have to support that.</p>

          <p eId="para_704">How many members of the European Council were in favour of regime change and subjecting the activity to a timescale? When did the factor of time become a common European theme? I take it from the Minister's position that, if faced with a choice, he supports giving more resources and time to the inspectors to avoid war and that there are no circumstances in which he would support the British-American position of forcing pre-emptive action.</p>

Iraq has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully and the Iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and does not take this last chance. That is the common position of all in the European Union.</p>

If, as was envisaged, the inspectors are unable to obtain the compliance the Security Council would regard as adequate, serious consequences will follow and we know what that means.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">If there is failure to disarm voluntarily, clearly there is, under the enforcement mechanism in Chapter 7, the contemplation of involuntary disarmament by reason of incomplete co-operation by the Iraqi regime. Obviously this would involve it losing its grip on the country. Presumably no one in the House contends or advocates the absurd proposal that, in the event of military action and the involuntary disarmament of the Iraqi regime, the regime will remain in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_724">I disagree with that characterisation of my position. The German position, which I respect, is that it will not support military action, even in the event of UN authorisation. It is unique in the European Union and the wider international community where there are genuine differences of opinion, which I respect. We have a different position which adheres to the belief that the UN should try to resolve the matter peacefully but that, if military action ensues on foot of a second UN resolution, we will uphold it. That has been the consistent position of successive Governments regarding UN positions. It is just as credible, sincere and properly motivated as anything of the German Government which we respect but with which we have a difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">While I understand Deputy Gormley's loyalty to his Green Party colleague, he should not contend that the Irish Government does not give equal consideration to the principles that inform its foreign policy and by which we would seek to defend our interests and take into account all circumstances. It is important to point out to Deputy Gormley that we can have a democratic debate in the House not on the basis of anyone shilly-shallying but of sincerely held differences motivated by the same principle of defending our interests, promoting the principles that inform our foreign policy, taking into account all the circumstances should the unfortunate event of military action occur, and doing everything in the meantime to avert it.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Regarding what Deputy Gay Mitchell said, all these concerns come into play in how we deal with this. It is a situation that evolves day to day. We should not lock into the inevitability of military action and that nothing can happen in the meantime. We have granted a limited opportunity towards trying to influence this matter for the better by resolving it peacefully. The fact we have not had sufficient success to date does not mean we accept the inevitability of military action, although we recognise the situation we are in and that we must work within that framework and difficult environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">As regards Deputy O'Keeffe's question, I refer him to Question No. 117 which sets out the steps we are taking.</p>

          <p eId="para_730">I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each  case: (1) Deputies Hayes and Healy – the need for south Tipperary to be included in the decentralisation programme to be announced shortly; (2) Deputy Broughan – the urgent need for the Office of Public Works to facilitate a better rental arrangement for tenants at the new civil offices in Coolock, Dublin 5; (3) Deputy Hogan – to ask the Minister to reverse his decision to impose major increases in charges for small businesses in respect of licence fees for directional signage arising from the Planning and Development Act 2002; (4) Deputy O'Sullivan – the dilapidated state of St Kieran's Boys National School, Galvone, Limerick and the need to provide adequate funding to carry out repairs; (5) Deputy Seán Ryan – the difficulty in operating Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 arising from Department of the Environment and Local Government's circulars in respect of income limit for eligibility for local authority loans, loan limits of €130,000 and the reluctance of the commercial lending institutions to accept the required clawback provisions of the scheme, which have all resulted in eligible applicants under the scheme being unable to secure a loan; (6) Deputy Kirk – the proposed redundancy payment increases having regard to the threat of closure of Lissadell Towels, Aclint, Ardee; (7) Deputy Richard Bruton – the design failure which appears to have given rise to the collapse of support beams and subsidence of Dublin Port Tunnel; (8) Deputy Crawford – the urgent need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to provide the necessary support for the livestock, pig and poultry industry to avoid total chaos due to his withdrawal of the €45 million subsidy towards the disposal of meat and bonemeal before alternative structures were put in place; (9) Deputy Crowe – the reports that the cutbacks in FÁS supported schemes announced by the Government will cost up to 300 jobs in the Tallaght area of Dublin and how the Government intends to meet the needs of local communities having forced the closure of so many essential local services; (10) Deputy Neville – the need for an independent investigation into the death by suicide of a 21 year old student at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital on 20 September 2002; (11) Deputy Morgan – to ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to comment on the decision by An Bord Pleanála to grant planning permission to Indaver Ireland to build an incinerator at Carranstown, Duleek, County Meath; (12) Deputy O'Dowd – to ask the Minister for Education and Science to make a statement on the urgent need for a new primary school to replace Scoil Mhuire Fatima, Dublin Road, Drogheda, County Louth; (13) Deputy Connolly – the position regarding the application for an extension at Scoil Naomh Padraig, Corracrin, Emyvale, County Monaghan.</p>

        <speech by="#PatTheCope" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_521">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_733">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_734">The primary purpose of the Bill is to give legislative form to the increases in motor tax rates and trade plate licences, which were contained in the Financial Resolution on motor tax, passed by the Dáil on 12 December 2002. The Financial Resolution and this Bill provide for a standard 12% across the board increase on motor tax on all classes of vehicle. As the House will be aware, the increases in motor tax are already in place and apply to all motor tax taken out for periods after 1 January this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">As well as increasing motor tax, the Bill also contains a small number of minor technical amendments to motor tax law designed to improve the administration of motor tax. The technical changes relate to extending the national vehicle records, which are held in my Department's vehicle registration unit in Shannon, to include vehicles prior to first taxing or vehicles never taxed.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">It is also proposed to provide that, as well as local authorities, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government may be classed as a licensing authority for motor tax purposes. This will facilitate the introduction of a new system to allow the motoring public to pay their motor tax on-line later in the year. The final minor technical adjustment will simply remove an Irish punt amount from the law as it is now redundant and its euro equivalent is already in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">The decision to increase motor tax rates was taken against a background of 33% inflation in the past ten years compared to a 12% rise in motor tax rates. In making the decision to increase motor tax rates, the primary consideration was the need to provide adequate funding for the non-national road programme. Unlike other taxes, motor tax is not paid into the Exchequer. It is paid directly into the local government fund. This fund, which was established under the Local Government Act 1998, is ring-fenced in law for the specific purpose of local government and cannot be used by the  Exchequer for other purposes. The fund is financed from the proceeds of motor taxation and this is supplemented by an Exchequer contribution. The fund is used to finance non-national roads and the general purpose needs of local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">As the Minister indicated during the debate on the Financial Resolution in December last, as a consequence of channelling motor tax receipts into the local government fund a link has been created between the amount of tax paid by motorists and the visible and concrete service they get for that tax in terms of better roads and better local government services.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">The National Development Plan provides for investment of €2.43 billion in the non-national road network in the period from 2000 to 2006. Looking at the operation of the plan for its first two years, I am happy to inform the House that expenditure in both the regions is almost 13% ahead of that profiled for the period. The non-national roads measure is one of the best performing measures under both the south and east, and BMW regional operational programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">Last year, Fitzpatrick Associates, Economic Consultants, carried out an in-depth independent evaluation of investment in our road network. This covered both national and non-national roads. The evaluator's overall conclusion on the non-national road programme was positive and the evaluation confirmed this programme was being operated on a reasonable and efficient basis. The cost management of the programme was satisfactory and no major adjustments were recommended by the evaluator. The verdict for the first two years of the programme is good and the credit for this is mainly attributable to the local authorities, which carried out such excellent work throughout the period. I take this opportunity to commend all those involved in the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">Continuation of this good work by local authorities is dependent on having adequate resources at their disposal and therefore we are increasing the rates of motor tax and trade plate licences. For this year €434 million will be available for non-national roads. This compares to €435 in 2002, which was the highest ever State grant provision for non-national roads. Along with funding roads, adequate finance must be provided for local authorities to perform all their functions and to continue to provide good quality services to the public. If local government is to continue its good work, it needs extra resources and this is the reason for increasing motor tax rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">As I mentioned at the outset, the new rates of motor tax set out in the Bill apply to tax discs and trade licences taken out for any period beginning on or after 1 January 2003. The new tax rates for all vehicles are set out in the Schedule to the Bill. While the increases were 12% on all vehicles, I would like to highlight for the House what this increase means in actual cash terms in relation to private cars and goods vehicles which make up over 90% of the national fleet. For private cars  with the lowest engine size of under 1,000 cc, the annual rate increase is €15. For private cars in the 1,001 cc to 1,300 cc category, the annual increase is between €23 and €28. For private cars in the 1,301 cc to 1,400 cc range, the additional annual increase is €30.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">Some 60% of the national car fleet is made up of cars that are less than 1,400 cc. Therefore the annual extra costs for most motorists will be between €15 and €30 – that is between 29 cent and 58 cent a week. Put another way, that is between 4.1 cent and 8.2 cent per day. For the remaining cars, the increases will range from €32 for cars above 1,400 cc up to €137 for cars over 3,001 cc. Less than 0.5% of cars in the country are in the 3,001 cc plus category.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">For goods vehicles, the effect of the 12% increase will vary depending on the size of the vehicle. Some 80% of vehicles in this category are at the lowest level of charge, meaning that they will pay an annual increase of €26 or 50 cent per week. A 12% increase is also proposed for trade licences, or trade plates, as they are known. These are the green registration plates used by motor traders on vehicles, which are temporarily in their possession, in lieu of taxing such vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">While there are strict restrictions on the use of the plates, they are transferable between vehicles. The increase for a pair of trade plates will be €27.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">This is a short Bill and its purpose is simple. It is to copper-fasten the increases in motor tax introduced by the financial resolution passed by Dáil Éireann last December. Clearly, increasing any tax is not a popular decision and is not one which is taken lightly. These increases are being introduced with good reason and for a particular purpose. The revenue generated by the motor tax increases will be used for funding local authorities. In particular, it will be used to fund the non-national road programme to ensure local authorities can consolidate and build on the great progress made in rehabilitating our non-national road network over recent years. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardAllen" eId="spk_522">
          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_747">This Bill implements the savage increases in motor tax rates and trade licences proposed in the budget in December. The introduction of a standard, across the board increase of 12% at a time when inflation is running at 5% and possibly 6% and car sales are plummeting is unacceptable. We need only look at an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 4 March which stated that new car sales fell significantly last month amid signs that the economic downtown was finally taking hold in the industry. Car registration figures for February were down by 18.8% on the same month last year and 5.5% for the year so far. The number of cars sold in the first two months of this year was 52,454 of which 19,624 were sold last month, a fall of 4,490 on February 2002. It is against this backdrop that these increases are being introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">Ireland is entering a recession, which will add another nail in the coffin of what is becoming an increasingly uncompetitive economy. In addition to the cuts implemented in 2002, this year to date has been a bleak one for those seeking improved public services and infrastructure. The cuts implemented last year, which will continue to affect the country, include 800 health jobs, €36 million in funding for schemes designed to tackle educational disadvantage, €12.5 million from the budgets of FÁS and the IDA and €40 million from the overseas development aid budget, which will affect the world's poorest people. It is important we highlight these figures as they amount to another stealth tax. Regardless of what the Government says, they are another way of screwing the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">The House and the public will have to be reminded over and over again of the promises made by the Taoiseach and the Government prior to the general election and what has happened since. Within weeks of the election, during which the Taoiseach insisted the public finances were in good shape, he stated corrective measures would be necessary to dig the Government out of its economic hole.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">I will remind the House of some of these measures. In education, a 10% cut in real terms was imposed on primary school budgets and other cuts in real terms were made to budgets at every level. Health spending increased by 5% at a time when health inflation rates were 10%. The drug refund and long-term illness schemes were reduced by 10% in real terms. To maintain current service levels, hospital managers were told budgets would have to rise by some €380 million, yet the actual increase was €26 million. The roads budget, to which the Minister of State referred, was cut by 4.5% in real terms. At a time when we should be developing our rail services, the development budget for rail was cut by 8.5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">I do not need to remind the Minister of State that the first-time buyer's grant has been axed. In agriculture, the budget for Bord Bia was reduced by 13% while 44% was cut from agricultural development under the national development plan. Rural Ireland will also be affected by the 26% cut in the budget of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, including a 68% cut in the western investment fund. In addition to a cut of 40% last year, the defence budget for this year was cut by 10%. None of these reductions takes into account the public pay element of increases in departmental budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">The increase of €200 million in the capital budget for 2003 will be wiped out by increased VAT costs for the construction industry. The Minister cut the budget for improved infrastructure in absolute and real terms. Alongside the cuts new charges were introduced. The failure to index tax bands in the budget effectively amounted to an increase of around €300 million in the tax burden of workers and will cost the average family an additional €400 per year. The cost of a visit to a casualty department has risen  by 26% to €40. VHI charges increased by 18% in September 2002 following a rise of 9% in 2001. ESB bills have risen by more than 13% for domestic users, more than 8% for small businesses and more than 4% for industrial users. College registration fees have increased by 69% and free third level education has been effectively scrapped. It is also clear from the comments of teachers in recent days that the Government is preparing the way to abolish free fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">The drugs payment scheme threshold was increased by €19 to €70. Local authorities have been forced to increase water and bin charges in an effort to avoid abolition. The Environmental Protection Bill currently passing through the Seanad will create chaos because it effectively removes powers from local councillors and gives them to managers who will now make up the shortfall in central funding by raising refuse charges to about €600 per year.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">The television licence fee was increased by 40% to €150, bus fares in Dublin have risen by 9% and the increase in the lower rate of VAT will cost the average family about €182 per year. Motor tax is up 12% on 2002 while bank card charges have increased by 108%.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">In two budget speeches the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, signalled the introduction of a carbon tax in the foreseeable future. The principle of passing on the environment in a better state than one receives it should be a key policy objective and should lie at the heart of sustainable development. By signing up to the Kyoto agreement, we will have to cap greenhouse gas emissions at 13% above 1990 levels. Current energy emissions exceed this target by 20%. Despite being in power for almost seven years, this Government has done little or nothing to advance that objective as the greenhouse gas intensity as a result of economic growth here has worsened since 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">The Government's transport policy has been a failure. Its waste strategy is in a shambles having achieved less than one-third of the target it set itself for growth in recycling. Illegal dumping is rampant and landfill sites are running out of capacity. While it was to be expected that the massive expansion of employment, house building and car ownership over the past decade would push up emissions, it is disappointing that emission levels per vehicle grew by 26% in the past six years.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">Despite the long run-in period, the Government admits it has implemented less than one-fifth of the measures intended to achieve the Kyoto objectives. New Zealand was one of the most recent countries to introduce a carbon tax. Last October when it announced its plans for a carbon tax, the Government stated that although the measure would push up fuel costs it would help the country meet the target set for it under the Kyoto climate change agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">The tax being introduced there, at approximately €12 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, will be levied some time after 2007 but only  if the controversial Kyoto protocol comes into force internationally. It is estimated that petrol prices in New Zealand will increase by about 6%, diesel by about 12% and gas and electricity prices by 8% or 9%. The losers will be coal users who will see costs jump by about 19%. The New Zealand Government has said the unquantified amount of finance raised by the new tax would be offset by the reduction of other taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">The Minister of Finance stated that we are now facing the introduction of a carbon tax here because of our obligations under the Kyoto protocol. However, the world's biggest air polluter, the United States, has refused to ratify the protocol which it sees as flawed because it does not bind developing countries. The New Zealand Government has promised that the revenue raised from its proposals will not be used to improve the Government's fiscal position but will be recycled through the tax system into climate change projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">It is significant that New Zealand is pressing ahead with its carbon tax proposals despite the fact that the United States and New Zealand's near neighbours, Australia, have rejected the climate agreement expressing fears that it would damage their economies. Incidentally, I was amused to discover that New Zealand intends to impose a tax on a wide range of activities, including on sheep and cattle because one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gas in New Zealand is the belching of cattle and sheep. Even they are not spared in terms of these greenhouse taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">The public here will greet the announcement of a carbon tax with a high degree of scepticism. They will be very suspicious that the Government is enthusiastically espousing the calls for a carbon tax at a time when it is increasing charges and imposing further taxes to compensate for its own mismanagement of the economy and the public finances. It is vital that carbon taxes are introduced for environmental reasons and not for crude financial reasons. If carbon taxes are to be introduced, they must be part of a well thought-out strategy to deliver real changes in tune with the behaviour of individuals and businesses rather than simply imposing a burden on the public to prop up the poor management of public expenditure we have seen in recent times.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">Carbon tax is not the answer to everything. I am aware the Department of the Environment and Local Government estimates that it would raise approximately €510 million annually but would reduce greenhouse gases by about 1.4%.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">Deputy Richard Bruton, the Fine Gael spokesman on finance, pointed out that because of existing structures of excise on fuels, a uniform carbon tax increases fuel prices in line with their environmental damage. In that respect for natural gas, for example, there will be twice the rate of price increase of motor fuels even though it is a much cleaner energy source. Small businesses would face a significant competitive disadvantage compared to large users of energy who will receive free of charge tradable emission rations instead  of paying the tax. Irish businesses competing in the United States, however, will experience problems because of the Bush Administration's reckless attitude to the Kyoto agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">If carbon tax is being proposed, key guidelines must be set out by the Government in a Green Paper, as Deputy Bruton suggested, and time should be given for responses from key players in the Irish economy as well as the consumer. If the Government proposes to introduce carbon tax, the revenue gathered must be ring-fenced for promoting other energy saving or emission improving actions. It must be used for compensating low income households and ring-fenced for cutting other taxes. It cannot be used to prop up Government mismanagement and incompetence.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">The rate of carbon tax should be set out at a level that does not put us at a significant disadvantage to that of other European countries, none of which has so far proposed a rate comparable to that advocated by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The Government has failed to reform motor tax which should be graduated according to the emission performance of vehicles as in the United Kingdom. Has the Minister any ideas on the system in the UK? I would like to hear in his response whether it is examining the whole question of emission performance of vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">The key to success in environmental policy is that the public must understand the rationale but have confidence also that the money taken from the system will be used to deliver a better environment for us all. The revenues gathered must be used to promote innovative behaviour-changing policies in the various sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">This Bill, in the absence of motor tax reform, is a crude measure to raise revenue to pay for the Government's mismanagement and incompetence, as well as for its election promises, most of which have not been implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">In the time remaining to me I want to make a number of suggestions. The greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and transport here are of particular concern because a rise of 176% in emissions is predicted between 1990 and 2010 if there is no policy change in this area. The Government should encourage the use of biofuel as an alternative to diesel and petrol powered engines in an effort to reduce emissions and promote the biofuel industry. It should also remove excise on biofuels when used in transportation, a policy supported by more environmentally conscious European Union countries. If significant progress is to be made, a new tax regime must be created that positively discriminates in favour of renewable fuels.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">Real potential exists for viable alternative use of farmland and existing crops. Agricultural set-aside land, for the most part in fallow, could be used to grow industrial products while seed-rape and sugar beet, two crops with biofuel potential, have been grown successfully here over recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">Has the Government examined European models in relation to taxation and biofuels? What are its ideas on those because all we are getting today is another stealth tax? There is no forward planning on the part of the Government. What incentives are available to local authorities to encourage them to use biofuels as an alternative to petrol and diesel? The local authority in my area is an EU grant aided participant in a programme with a written commitment to operate its fleet on biofuels. Incentives should be given to local authorities and public bodies to use alternatives to petrol and diesel.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">This Bill is just one of a long litany of new charges being imposed on the public. The public have been screwed with new taxes, increased charges and cuts in services since the general election. Having been fed with promises prior to the election, they have been screwed since then and they will not forget the Government's deception and double-talk during the election campaign. I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy English.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_523">
          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_772">Deputy Allen summed up what this Bill is all about – it is another tax, simple as that. The Minister of State said we are here because this was voted on by the Dáil on 12 December last but the Opposition was against this measure. The Government parties voted for the tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">This Bill is in keeping with the theme of Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats policies. We seem to spend a great deal of time debating tax hikes, broken promises and cutbacks for which the Government received no mandate in the general election. This undermines the system of accountability in the House and erodes public confidence in our political institutions. Many new Deputies are concerned with the image of politics and the actions of the Government do not help. The image of politics is going down and the imposition of more taxes does not help. It would be different if people were warned a year or two ago that these taxes would be imposed. In Finland the Minister for Finance is very honest and warns people that times will be hard for a couple of years. People accept that and do not mind paying taxes. In Ireland we screw the people, keeping quiet until we hit them with taxes; no wonder they do not want to pay them.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">As recent legislation proves, our Government colleagues have become arrogant. They care nothing for public confidence in our political structures and they dislike accountability. They would prefer if the first people knew about proposed legislative changes was when those were enacted or, in the case of taxes, when deductions are made from people's wages. That is why the debate this morning on the Finance Bill was cut short and why even this debate finishes at 7 p.m. The Government wants to keep things quiet and to keep discussions brief. That brings us to freedom of information, which is a principle we hold  dear as the centre of democracy. We do not intend to give that up without a fight.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">When will we stop asking motorists, the motor trade and taxpayers to write blank cheques for an unspecified amount of work on our national roads infrastructure? People are driving on the same roads that they were using five years ago but in some cases those roads are now worse. Road maintenance costs money and building new roads costs even more money but recent startling figures from the National Roads Authority shows that spending has grown beyond belief. Motorists wonder if they are paying for roads or making millionaires out of shareholders in civil engineering and construction companies. Are we being asked as motorists to pay our fair share of the maintenance costs or, through the Government's policies, are we fuelling the hyper-inflation in the construction field which is taking the blame for so many broken promises?</p>
          <p eId="para_776">For example, a bypass was proposed for Ashbourne in Meath in 1996-97, when the best price was €80 million. The price is approximately €170 million today, five or six years later. What has gone wrong in the last five or six years? Is that why we are paying extra taxes?</p>
          <p eId="para_777">Are the policies of the Government fuelling this hyper-inflation? If so, what does the Government propose to do? Taking inflation into account, are motorists being asked to fork out money for nothing new? Are we throwing our money down the drain? Perhaps the Government is doing that for us. There is not much pleasure in this situation and it has to change. It is time for accountability and for motorists to be given a fair deal. No reasonable person minds paying for what they use or get but what are we getting for this money? There is talk of people being able to see, in the Minister of State's words, visible and concrete service. However, people will be queuing for eye tests to see that service. The roads are in a desperate state all over the country but we are being told about a visible and concrete service: I do not believe in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">The Minister of State told us the money for roads is ring-fenced by the local authority. That is like a person who loses money in a field; he knows the money is in the field but he does not know where and cannot find it. Motorists feel much the same and most sane people would not go back into a field to lose money again. However, present Government policies seem insane. There is certainly little logic to them: first spend money to buy an election and then say with a cheeky smile that sound management means people will have to be fleeced for a while to make up for the con pulled on them – trust us with your money as we know what we are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">Does the Government think we are all fools? Does it pay any heed to taxpayers' money or is it something the Government takes for granted? Is the Government so arrogant as to think that a slender majority gives it permission to demand taxpayers' money at will for whatever it wants, with no real accountability? Are the economics  of the national stadium, "the Bertie bowl" at work here too? Are overtaxed motorists now being asked to fill the Taoiseach's holes, the holes left in the economy by years of mismanagement of our infrastructure? I am a motorist and I say "no". There will be no more money until we know exactly where it is going. What roads will the money be spent on? What distances will be covered and how many holes will be filled in?</p>
          <p eId="para_780">What proportion of the funds is being spent on administration and legal fees, false claims settlements or consultant fees? I have a major problem with consultants lapping up money. We had a stretch of road in Meath for which €200,000 was allotted over several years to deal with footpaths and so on, but in the first year consultants accounted for approximately 25% of the cost. They get paid up front and swallow a large amount of the money, so people do not see the visible and concrete service to which the Minister of State referred. The money has gone into someone's pocket.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">What percentage of our money is being spent on fancy signs which state that projects are funded by the national development plan or on television advertisements for NDP-funded projects? The national development plan is mostly funded by taxpayers' money: that is our money, money from motorists and others. We did not ask for TV advertisements to tell us where our money is going; we know we are paying the money but we did not ask for advertisements to tell us about it. More money should be spent on the roads to bring them up to European standards. The Government may not care much about this but it is a serious point.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">It is not too much to ask what exactly our money is to be spent on. Next year we should be shown what it has been spent on – a real road in a real town. Motorists should be given a reason to believe in politicians and the power of the House. Accountability means results are measured – we should be able to come in here next year and say this much was spent on materials for roads and so on. We should be shown the percentage of funding spent on roads where it is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">I am sure my county's situation is mirrored all over the country. Our roads budget has been slashed and the people of Meath are saying: "We are being asked for a 12-13% increase in taxes yet we are getting less money to spend on our roads."  That does not add up. It makes no sense to them that there has been a reduction of €16.3 million in overall road spending in Meath, although I understand the motorway in Drogheda accounts for some of that. There is a €290,000 drop in spending on national roads maintenance, though I know the Minister of State will say that much of what we are discussing relates to non-national roads. There was a drop of almost €2 million in funding for regional and county roads in a county where the roads are in a mess. The ordinary maintenance of regional roads is down by 13.6% and maintenance of county roads is  down 21.3%. We had a debate on this last Monday at the council. How are we to tell people that though they are paying more taxes less money is being spent on roads? That does not add up and people are looking at us as if we have two heads. I could cite other figures. If the Minister of State could respond to this when he replies it would be great, as I could then go to people in Meath and explain to them why this situation looks like a "con". Maybe I am missing something.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">It is a hobbyhorse of mine that the Government has a love affair with roads. We must start thinking of railways, as then we would not need these motor tax increases. We should try to get people off our roads, which are a mess not only due to the lack of funding but because there are so many cars using them. We should take freight off our roads. This Government spent millions repairing the railway between Kingscourt and Navan but as soon as the money was spent it closed the line because there was no freight for it. We should encourage business to use the railway for freight. Deputy Allen spoke about new initiatives to clean up the environment. We should also look at ways to get business to invest in the rail network. We see the fancy advertisement on television telling us about money being spent on the railways but that money will only keep what we have and fix up a few lines and a few carriages. There will be nothing new, no extra track and we will see increases in motor tax every year for the next five years.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_524">
          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_785">I cannot recall complaining before about having too much time to speak on an issue but it is ludicrous that each spokesperson this afternoon has 30 minutes to make a contribution on a single tax measure when this morning the Government refused my party leader when he asked for adequate time to debate the Finance Bill, the most important finance measure of the year, and particularly the sneaky attempt by the Government to introduce on Report Stage an amendment that will give a tax break to private hospitals when the Government is not providing sufficient money to fund the health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">It is appropriate, however, that this measure is being debated on the day the Finance Bill was rushed through the House and guillotined by this dishonest Government. This is a mini-Finance Bill, it is a tax raising measure just as the motion which preceded it in December was a mini-budget following the budget that was introduced then.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">This is simple. The Minister for Finance comes into this House and tells us that he has reduced taxes and intends to keep down income tax while every other Minister is sent in to raise taxes and charges by any means possible. There has been a litany of such increases since the general election. College registration fees have been increased by 70%. Charges for medical care have risen as a result of the changes in the drugs refund scheme. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs is  clawing back €12 million from the poorest tenants in the State through the increased personal contribution under the rent allowance scheme. The increase in VAT has affected first time home buyers among others.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">Local authority charges and rents have been increased. The Minister for Finance is imposing an additional charge on credit and ATM cards. Not only are we being taxed on the card we put into the machine, now the Government intends to charge a tax when we remove the receipt from the machine after seeing the bad news on the screen. There have been increases in the television licence, ESB prices and bus fares. The largest single contributor to increased inflation in this State is the Government through the charges it is levying and this Bill makes permanent the increases in motor taxation introduced in the wake of the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">When the Minister for the Environment and Local Government came into the House in December to introduce the measure by way of a Dáil motion he told us this was a 12% increase in motor taxation that would go to the local government fund and would be ring-fenced for roads. We assumed if there was a 12% increase in motor taxation there would be a corresponding increase in the local government fund or in the allocations for the non-national roads fund. I asked the Minister about this at the time because I was aware that the Department of the Environment and Local Government had already circulated to local authorities their allocations under the local government fund and that, far from reflecting any increase, the allocation reflected the position in the book of Estimates – that there was no additional Exchequer money going into the fund. It was effectively frozen at last year's levels and the real increase for day to day local authority activities was of the order of 2%, considerably less than the rate of inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">I asked the Minister what additional increase local authorities could expect in their allocations or in allocations for non-national roads as a result of the increase in motor taxation. After many exchanges where the Minister told me I was wrong, where he corrected and contradicted the figures I put to him, he eventually made the admission of the day. He said, "I never said that this is extra money". When I pressed him on the issue, he said, "I want to maintain and develop the non-national roads structure. This is my job and I face choices. I was not prepared to see a decrease in the non-national roads fund. That would have been disastrous because we have achieved a high level of road maintenance". Motorists would be hit with a 12% increase in motor taxation but the Minister admitted that there would be no extra money for local authorities or roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">Let us see how well the Minister did in maintaining the funding position. He announced a total allocation for non-national roads to local authorities on 27 January of €433.986 million. I compared that with the announcement made by  his predecessor in January 2002 and found that Deputy Noel Dempsey had announced €438.46 million in State grants for non-national roads. A child can see that €433 million is less than €438 million, particularly after inflation is taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">When we look at the detail of allocations for the restoration of non-national roads, an issue the Minister of State emphasised this afternoon, we find the decrease is considerably more. In 2002, €221 million was allocated for restoration but in 2003, after a 12% increase in motor taxation, the figure falls to €216 million. The Minister should tell motorists stuck in traffic this evening why, after increasing motor taxation by 12%, the money to fund the roads programmes and maintain and restore the roads is being reduced at a time when the number of vehicles is increasing. Motorists are being tricked by this measure. The Government has told them that motor taxation is being increased and there will be a corresponding improvement in the state of the roads but that is not the case. It is reducing the money for roads funding and using the increase in motor taxation as a means of raising general taxation to fill the pothole in Government finances arising from its spending splurge before the general election. Now it finds it has to cut public services and expenditure and raise taxes by all kinds of devious means. The Minister's statement in the House that motorists will not feel the pinch as the cost only amounts to between 4.1 cent and 8.2 cent per day will cut no ice with them, particularly in view of the state of the roads on which they have to drive.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">I draw the Minister's attention again to an issue I raised when this topic was before the House last December. Whatever may be the state of national primary and secondary roads, the tertiary roads of this country, particularly in urban areas, are a disgrace. For many motorists driving home this evening, the worst roads they will encounter are those within their own housing estates which, in many cases, were built 20 or 30 years ago. Since then, the roads built by the original developers have not been resurfaced or maintained by the local authorities and are, literally, falling apart. Local authorities do not have the resources with which to repair and maintain those roads. In my local authority area, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, I was recently informed by the director of services, who is responsible for the roads programme, that the county council's estimate for the restoration of tertiary roads in its area is €10 million, while the amount of money it can provide from its own resources in any year is approximately €500,000. We are faced with a situation where, unless resources are provided to deal with those roads, what is now an issue of resurfacing, restoration and repair will very soon become a much bigger problem of total reconstruction at considerably greater cost to the public purse.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">My proposal to the Minister, in the context of the debate on this Bill, is that a special fund be made available by his Department to enable local  authorities to repair and improve tertiary roads. There used to be a practice in the Department whereby, in mid year, there was a review of moneys coming out of the local government fund and around August each year a small grant was made available when the Government found that car registrations had increased or some local authorities had underspent and some reshuffle of funding was possible. That mid-year grant was always very useful to local authorities to meet urgent road repair projects. Last August, due to the Government's post-election cutbacks, no such grants were made available to local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">The final issue to which I wish to refer in this debate directly affects my constituency. The Minister and his Department will be well aware of a Supreme Court decision last week in respect of the M50 motorway scheme which, effectively, halts work on the scheme at Carrickmines. Having addressed the issue in an Adjournment debate last week, I do not wish to repeat everything I said on that occasion. One of the issues at the centre of the Supreme Court case, on which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has remained remarkably silent, is in respect of the status of Carrickmines Castle and its environs. The case was put to the Supreme Court which, evidently, accepted that Carrickmines Castle is a national monument. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, whose responsibility it is to state explicitly whether it is a national monument has remained remarkably silent on this question. The local authority and the National Roads Authority have been operating on the basis that it was not a national monument and had applied for what is known as a section 26 permission to allow the motorway construction to proceed. If it is a national monument, they will have to make a separate application under section 14 of the relevant Act. The one thing we do not know is whether the Minister with responsibility for deciding if it is a national monument will actually make that decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">As a consequence of the Supreme Court decision, the cost of constructing this motorway is set to increase by a figure – depending on whose estimate one believes – between €50,000 and €100,000 per day and at best estimate, in a best case scenario, construction and completion will now be delayed by two years. It is time the Minister for the Environment and Local Government or the Minister of State came off the fence on this issue to tell the House whether Carrickmines Castle and its environs constitute a national monument. If it is not a national monument, the local authority can take a particular route and if it is a national monument, there are obvious consequences which flow from that in terms of what the courts may subsequently decide. It is an issue on which the Minister can no longer remain silent. The sequence of bad decisions – I will put it no stronger than that today – which were made in the lead-up to the approval of this motorway scheme, have resulted in a situation  whereby a national monument, Carrickmines Castle, is at risk, the construction of the motorway will be considerably delayed and the cost to the taxpayer will increase enormously.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_799">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The primary purpose of the Bill is to give legislative form to the increases in motor tax costs and trade plate licences. It involves a standard across-the-board increase of 12%, which is more than twice the rate of inflation. The Bill aims to put this revenue into the local government fund. I welcome and support the concept of a local government fund, particularly when this money is earmarked exclusively for local authority purposes. However, there is still a long way to go in relation to radical reform of local government, especially with regard to its finances, including motor tax investment schemes. Sections 1, 2, 3 and 5 deal with technical changes, replacing the former £90 with €114 and providing for revised tax rates for vintage vehicles. Section 6 provides for increased fees for trade plate licences and the replacement of trade plate licences in respect of motorcycles and all other vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">That may sound very good in this Bill but motorists are not happy. They have genuine concerns about value for money. The question is regularly asked as to whether we are getting value for money and most motorists seem to answer "No". They do not mind paying their motor tax and making their contribution to the wider community but they resent – I support them in this regard – the absence of real value for money in relation to roads, services for dangerous roads and safety measures. These are the type of questions people ask Deputies. The sad reality is that not enough money is being spent to ensure maximum road safety. I agree that we have improved the roads over the years by improving the motorways, but there are many roads which are a serious danger to the public. In many parts of Ireland one can see secondary roads in very bad condition. There are major roads in my constituency in Marino such as Griffith Avenue where the regular comment from the local authority is that there is no budget for serious repairs. This money should be invested on these inferior roads and traffic calming measures. This motor tax belongs to the people. The elected members of local authorities do not need to have their hands tied by the Government in raising funds with new creative and radical ideas. We must stop hammering the motorist and when people pays taxes, we must spend them wisely on their behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">Section 7 provides for a technical amendment to extend the national vehicle file records to  include vehicles prior to taxing. We need this kind of regulation which plays an important role in measures to combat crime or tax avoidance. Nobody is above the law and that message should be sent out loudly and clearly, particularly to those who refuse to pay their taxes and, in particular, motor tax. Society is now moving in that direction but we need to keep the momentum going. We should not be afraid to state that by paying taxes, one is paying for services and that occasionally we must raise taxes to pay for services. However, there should be no tolerance for anyone, particularly the well-off in society, who want to avoid tax or come up with scams to dodge tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">My other major worry about this Bill is whether we have enough gardaí to implement it in an effective way. If not, we are codding ourselves and, worse still, we are codding the people. This legislation is not worth the paper on which it is written, if that provision is not encompassed in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">Section 8 provides for the legal framework to enable the Minister to process on-line motor tax applications. This can be extremely helpful to the consumer and to the staff. It will assist staff in a positive and efficient way. It is the way of the future and it should be developed as quickly as possible. This type of technology should always be used for the benefit of the people and to promote efficiency and quality services for the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">Returning to the local government fund, it is essential that this fund is expanded. We cannot have local authorities running around each year looking for money or Ministers threatening to dissolve them, as in the case of Dublin City Council. It is not good for local democracy and it is certainly not good for the taxpayers. This motor tax and other revenue must be pumped into the city councils to prevent the introduction of double taxation like bin charges or water charges. Once they get the bin charges through, incidentally, let there be no mistake about it, these extra charges are on the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">There is plenty of space in the local government fund to raise money and develop services. This Bill has the potential to allow that but I am not optimistic as I feel the Government has decided that the way forward is to treat local authorities and elected members of city councils with contempt. I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill and I hope some day we will get legislation which will radically reform motor tax and bring in more democratic and more balanced local government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarianHarkinIND" eId="spk_528">
          <from>Ms Harkin</from>
          <p eId="para_806">I am happy to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill, the objective of which is to extend the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952 and the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992. While the primary purpose is to give legislative form to the increases in motor tax rates and plate licences, I ask the Minister to use the opportunity afforded by the debate on, and subsequent Com mittee Stage of, this Bill to make changes to the tax relief for vehicles purchased for use by people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">A person who has received a primary medical certificate can apply for relief, either as a driver or passenger, or there is a provision for family members to apply. This scheme provides that for a driver with a disability, VRT and VAT borne in respect of the purchase and adaptation of the vehicle may be repaid up to a maximum of €9,525 provided that the vehicle's engine capacity does not exceed 2,000cc. This means that a person who purchases a car with an engine capacity of 1,100cc or 1,200cc will get a lower refund that a person who can afford a more expensive model with, for example, an engine capacity of 1,800cc or 2,000cc.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">However, the real inequality exists where up to a maximum of €15,875 can be repaid in respect of VAT and VRT under the heading of passengers with disabilities or family members. This tax relief is available in respect of a vehicle with an engine capacity which does not exceed 4,000cc. In other words, if a person can afford to buy a top of the range Mercedes with an engine capacity of 3,800cc or 4,000cc, for example, he or she will benefit to the full extent, whereas if a person can only afford to purchase a more modest vehicle with an engine capacity of 1,500cc or 1,800cc, the person will not get the maximum benefit. Therefore if one has a great deal of money to spend, one can save a great deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">There is a strong case for making a standard payment to all disabled persons of, say, €12,700. This would have the effect of introducing equity into the system rather than the current position, whereby those with the most money to spend benefit most and those with the least money to spend benefit least.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">However, to avail of this tax relief a person must, in the first place, be in possession of a primary medical certificate. The medical criteria for this certificate includes a stipulation that the person be without one or both legs, or be without both arms. There are other criteria but I am particularly interested in these two. Any person must be recognised as disabled, certainly as far as driving is concerned, if he or she is without one arm, yet such a person does not qualify for a primary medical certificate and therefore cannot qualify for the VAT or VRT refunds. There is such a case in my constituency and I am sure the Minister will recognise that a serious inequity exists here. Surely the purpose of the tax refunds is to allow disabled persons' mobility and independence? If persons without one arm wish to get on with their lives and preserve their independence and their mobility, and adapt their vehicles so that they can drive, surely they too should be allowed to avail of these tax refunds?</p>
          <p eId="para_811">While I understand that the issuing of a primary medical certificate is not within the specific remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, the consequences of having or not having such a certificate fall within his remit. I also understand that Departments are subject to certain fiscal con straints but if my earlier suggestion of a flat-rate payment to all disabled drivers were introduced, it is more than likely that money would be saved. If the medical criteria for getting a primary medical certificate in the first place were extended to persons without one arm, the extra number concerned would be quite small and money saved by introducing a more equitable system for all disabled drivers would more than cover the cost of extending the criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">This is an opportunity to introduce a more equitable system and at the same time extend that system to include those who are disabled but who are currently outside the system, and it probably would not use up any extra resources. I ask the Minister to consider that proposal in the context of this legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_529">
          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_813">The measure in the legislation is a realistic way of tackling the issue of raising revenue from the motor vehicle industry. However, the debate should centre on whether it is the most equitable way of dealing with this issue or whether we could make further reforms which would provide an element of greater equity for the motor car user.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">I drive a Mercedes-Benz Smart car. Its engine capacity is 600 cc and I pay an annual tax of €144, which is the same as I would pay if I had a 1,000 cc car. It would also be the same if it were 900, 800, or 700 cc. The Minister should consider the lower end of the scale and introduce reductions. The car I drive is the most efficient and environmentally friendly petrol-engine car on the road, but I get no breaks from the Minister for this. The taxation for cars with engine capacities of less than 1,000 cc should be reduced commensurate with the reduction in engine size. I do not believe the current arrangements are fair on people who try to do their bit for the environment but do not receive a break in terms of annual tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">It would be more equitable to put the taxation on fuel. This tax hits equally those who travel 1,000 km per year and 100,000 km per year. Let us take the example of a widow who drives her car once a week to and from Mass in the local village. She should not have the same tax burden as somebody who travels 100,000 km per year. It is one of the failings of the current tax regime that we do not provide any bonus for those who try to minimise their annual mileage. We should try to address this issue through a slight increase in tax on fuel and a slight decrease in annual tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">This tax is ring-fenced for the purpose of financing local government. This sets a dangerous precedent as local government becomes dependent on tax revenue from the motor vehicle industry. It would be preferable if the Minister were to reform the financial basis of local government and give it real autonomy, as opposed to using various methods of taxation to provide its income. I do not think local government should have to look very carefully to find funding from the car industry. It should be given funding on an  annual or triennial basis in its own right. It is high time the Minister gave autonomy to local government rather than making it wait, cap in hand, for the following year's revenues to accrue to it. That is how it works elsewhere in Europe. Local government should not have to wait for its motor tax receipts to know whether it can provide school meals or funding for new buildings. It is dangerous to make local government dependent on motor taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">We should also consider the allocation of funding to public transport. This funding is dedicated to local government, but if, for example, a strong effort is made to improve public transportation, getting more people out of their cars and onto buses, that is not reflected in the tax take. In fact, the tax take will go down. There is a contradiction in ring-fencing motor tax for local government. Local government should have its own financial footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">We should also have some way of taking into account the actual environmental damage caused by the vehicle. As we try to reach our Kyoto targets, we should be looking not at annual tax measures on vehicles, as the Minister proposes, but at the amount of fuel used, pollution created and climate-changing gases emitted by the vehicle. That would be a modern way of dealing with the environmental pollution caused by the motor vehicle, rather than the single-minded and specific annual tax being proposed in this measure. We could have a much more equitable system. I ask the Minister to revise the rates of tax to be paid on cars of less than 1,000 cc to take into account the smaller amount of environmental damage created by small engine cars and consider the case of the widow driving her Mini to Mass. She does not benefit from what the Minister is proposing today. I believe that a more equitable system is possible and I hope the Minister can deliver it.</p>

          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_819">On one hand, I congratulate the Minister on putting the boot into those stubborn people who refuse to leave their cars at home. On the other hand, however, when we look at the options people have, we begin to see how unfair this tax increase really is. Can motorists leave their cars at home and travel by public transport? Of course they cannot, except in a small number of areas. What if they need their cars to travel 20 or 30 miles to a train or bus station, as I and many others do? How much will it cost to leave the car at the station when these new charges are introduced?</p>
          <p eId="para_820">What are motorists being offered in exchange for this massive increase in tax? Gridlock – a good old-fashioned bumper-to-bumper, five-mile-per-hour crawl while one's job or business waits for one's arrival. They also get tolls. Just to make sure the motorist feels totally ripped off by the 12% hike, he is pushed into a toll plaza. If the motorist manages to arrive in one of our wonderful cities or towns, the Minister offers him or her  totally inadequate parking facilities, and where there are parking spaces the motorist is further ripped off by the local authority who in turn is seriously underfunded by, unsurprisingly, the Minister's Department. We have VRT, VAT, tolls, parking charges, gridlock and potholes. I am sorry, we no longer use the word "pothole". According to motoring correspondent Brian Byrne, the term does not exist on the NRA's website. In an article a few weeks ago, he highlighted the new term for potholes: "surface distress". This is the new spin from the NRA on potholes – the Minister can check it – as if it mattered to motorists who are unfortunate enough to drive into one of these holes. The effect is the same whatever it is called.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">We do not have reliable public transport, adequate parking facilities or park and ride facilities. All in all, it is unfair. The recent hike in diesel charges introduced on the night of the budget in December represented an increase of €2,000 per truck per year, according to the Irish Hauliers' Association. That is a significant increase in a key area of our commerce infrastructure – moving goods from point A to point B quickly and cheaply. Hauliers are now suffering, and this is before the Bill has even gone through the Dáil, a €2,000 increase per truck per year. Of the Exchequer's €30 billion annual income, motorists already pay more than €4 billion, so they are already carrying a significant burden. Motorists are the soft underbelly of Irish society, victims of not only the Government and local authorities but also insurance companies, oil companies and clamping and towing companies. It is endless.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">I accept that raising further tax revenue is necessary. The Revenue Commissioners recently conducted a study. It is unfortunate that a report by them, examining the top 400 earners in the State and the tax they pay, was not available at the time of the budget. It was published on 13 December and concluded that some 24% of the highest earners pay no tax while a further 18.8% of top earners pay less than 5% tax on their income. On the other hand, the burden is borne by the soft underbelly of society – people who are victimised by everyone. This is not constructive taxation and it is not alleviating the burden on those who need more help. For example, a widow living in rural Ireland and going to chapel or buying her few groceries is caught in this drastic net, even though her small car may be her only means of transport. Meanwhile, on the other side of the scale, the Revenue Commissioners admit that the richest people are paying minuscule contributions towards the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">The cart is very much before the horse in this instance. I appeal to the Government to restructure the tax system to give fair play and a break to those who need it. The report of the Revenue Commissioners details clearly where the money is coming from. It is grossly unfair that motorists should be burdened in this way. If the tax revenue generated were to contribute towards some  alleviation of our environmental problems, we could acknowledge it as a step in the right direction. However, it is not and makes no attempt in that direction, like the pay-as-you-go system Deputy Cuffe suggested. This is a grossly unfair tax. I wait with interest to see if this money will come back to local government as it should do. However, I can sense the Minister for Finance, his fingers twitching, counting the euros as they come in to see where the money can be diverted to and I cannot see it going to people who would benefit from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">If this revenue was funding projects such as park and ride facilities which would free up the gridlock that affects our towns and cities by getting people onto public transport, it would be welcome. If it were spent on public transport it would benefit those of us who cannot use public transport as often as we would like because it is inadequate and undependable. If even some of this additional tax was spent in these areas there could be an argument for the increase, but this is the wrong way round. This taxes those who can least afford it while people who can afford to be taxed are left alone. It is a sad indictment of Government policy that this is allowed to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">I ask the Minister of State to tackle his colleagues at Cabinet and ask them to catch themselves on, have a look at the matter and see how it is for people in the real Ireland as opposed to the horsey world in Kildare. If Ministers were to do that, we would have an effective change of policy.</p>

          <from>Mr. Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_826">This Bill comes before the House on foot of the budget changes announced last December. It is one of the more difficult aspects of Government, which is not easy to deliver and which is not easily entered into by Ministers. We are part of a global economy and, as it slows, we must put the brake on more so than any other economy in the OECD. We are doing our best to ensure that fundamental budgetary and fiscal policies remain steady, that we stay within the terms of the stability and growth pact of the EU and that we deliver on what people elected us to do, which is to keep the economy on the straight and narrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">All of our commitments prior to the general election were predicated on growth in the economy. Although that is not forthcoming, the economy is still growing faster than other EU and OECD countries, albeit not at the rate which we have become used to over the past seven years. As a consequence, unsavoury increases have been forced upon us and we must have the courage to push them through and stand over them.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">The key issue in regard to motor vehicle tax is how we are going to comply with our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. As Deputies know, we are obliged under the terms of that protocol to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to 13% of our 1990 figure. We are currently way in excess of that at around 25% and the projection for 2010  is over 30%. We have a gun to our head in that if we fail to comply with our obligations we will face fines. While concern is expressed by Members opposite about the direct impact of these measures, the impact of the fines would be even greater. We must face this issue head on.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">A tax strategy group has been established under the various Departments to analyse the best way to introduce carbon energy taxes. How we do so is important because it will be one of the most challenging aspects of fiscal policy over the next 12 months. All Deputies should contribute to this ongoing debate. No decisions have been made other than we must comply with Kyoto and introduce carbon energy taxes. Whether we do so alongside the current motor vehicle regime is a matter for discussion, as is what we do with such taxes. Some people feel that carbon energy taxes will reduce competitiveness but that depends on what we do with the revenue and how many other countries comply with their obligations. Given that our output of greenhouse gases is so far in advance by comparison with other countries, we are fooling ourselves if we believe we will protect our economy by continuing to disregard our obligations. We are already producing over 17 tonnes of greenhouse gases per person per annum which is far in advance of the 10 tonnes per person per annum in the rest of the EU and 2 tonnes in the developing world where climate change is most adversely felt. Unless we deal with these issues immediately, we will pay the penalty down the road. We have a real duty to do so in the next 12 months and deliver upon our obligations by 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">As regards the implementation of these taxes, the key issue is that lower income groups should not be unduly burdened. People on lower incomes spend a proportionately higher amount on fuel than people with higher incomes and we must bear that in mind during the forthcoming debate. I agree with what Deputy Cuffe said about the relationship between the amount of fuel burnt and tax paid under the simple principle of "polluter pays"– a 4,000 cc car does not burn energy at the same rate as a smaller one. This regime is going to be revolutionary in the changes it will bring. It will be welcomed and reasonably easy to sell politically. It has been tough to sell the local bin charges that also come under the polluter pays framework. It was a mistake to get rid of water charges as it is a scarce resource. Our environment is becoming a scarce and valuable resource and we must consider charging to protect it. Many people driving on our roads do not seem to care about the implications of their burning of greenhouse gases. We must also consider incentives for best practice so that industry in particular is encouraged to use the best forms of manufacturing and carbon energy fuels in those processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">I am a member of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and I am sure most members of local authorities are familiar with the difficulties we are having with the local government fund. I  am delighted to note that funds raised through the increases will go directly to local government funding for non-national roads and other discretionary spending. I support the Bill and commend it to the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_839">If Members from other parties cannot admire Ministers of State, I certainly can.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">The purpose of this Bill is to give legislative form to the increases contained in the financial resolution passed by this House in December last. The technical issues apart, I would like express my views on the areas where these revenues are spent. As Members are aware, revenue collected under this Bill has been ring-fenced and put into the local government fund since 1999. It is exclusively used for local authority purposes and is distributed to the authorities as discretionary grants in respect of day-to-day spending and expenditure on non-national roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">When I speak about the state of non-national roads I am sure many colleagues will agree that while our national routes may be improving, there seems to be a marked deterioration of local roads both urban and rural. As I drive around my  constituency to attend clinics in Tallaght, Greenhills, Templeogue and Firhouse, I not only have my constituents complaining about this but I am personally aware of the impact on my car of this disrepair. I call on the Minister to investigate the potential for the value for money section in his Department's internal audit section to do a report on how the grants from the local government fund are being spent on local roads. While I expect that this would be a lengthy task, I suggest that an urban and rural authority be selected firstly and, subject to the findings of this report, a decision be made to extend the exercise to other authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">Every day we are made aware of the demands for State support in areas such as education, health and social welfare. This will be a scheme where the revenues accruing from Ireland's large vehicle fleet should ensure a decent standard of road maintenance that, on the face of it, we do not have. I do not say this to get at the Department or local authorities. In addition to the value for money report, departmental officials should also consider a five to ten year development plan for all non-national roads that would, like the school maintenance programme of the Department of Education and Science, list the upgrading of the local roads on a priority basis. Over a maximum ten-year period most, if not all, non-national roads should be upgraded. Taxpayers would then see the difference in our roads and the value of work done.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">Much of the business transacted in this House has the potential to impact on all citizens and communities. Sometimes the title of Bills and the manner in which business is dealt with does not catch the public's imagination. It is important in a debate like this that we stress the positives. I missed some of the other contributions but cars, and the use of them, is a subject at which we are all entitled to look. We must all understand we are causing problems for each other. I do not mean to be patronising, but those of us who travel only a short distance to Leinster House are in awe of our colleagues who have to travel 200 or 300 miles to get here. I do not know how people in that position cope – I find it difficult enough to cope with the eight miles I have to travel. If one goes onto the streets around Leinster House one will see the effect too many cars is having on the environment. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_846">This measure is not about the issues the previous speakers mentioned. It is a direct tax increase of 12% on the cost of motoring. It hits the easy target again and has nothing to do with carbon energy taxes. It is simply a tax on the motorist.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">The Minister of State said the motor taxation was passed by the Dáil on 12 December 2002 in the financial resolutions. Technically, he is correct. It was passed by the Dáil but only by the Government parties in the Dáil. The Opposition parties opposed it, as they will again when it is brought to a vote. It is an unjust tax on the motorist.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">Deputy Harkin referred to disabled drivers and disabled passengers. I put down a parliamentary question on this issue and was told that a review group had been set up about two and a half years ago on the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme. It reported recently to the Minister, according to the Minister's reply of 18 February last. The Minister should deal with that report urgently. The review has been going on for two and a half years so why can the report not be dealt with so that disabled passengers and disabled drivers get the concessions to which they are entitled?</p>
          <p eId="para_849">Will the costs involved in going on-line be taken out of the finance raised? The Minister, Deputy Andrews and Deputy O'Connor stressed that the fund which was established under the Local Government Act 1988 is ring-fenced in law for the specific purpose of local government and cannot be used by the Exchequer for any other purpose. The fund is financed from the proceeds of motor taxation and this is supplemented by an Exchequer contribution. If that were true, I might be inclined to support the Bill because the county roads need all the money they can get. However, nothing could be further from the truth. That is not the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">There is a 12% increase in motor taxation. There should be a subsequent or corresponding 12% increase in grants for county and tertiary roads. Until I see that 12% increase in the fund, I cannot accept that it has been ring-fenced. The money is being put into the fund but the fund was reduced because the extra taxation of 12% was due to go into it. The figures confirm it. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government announced on 27 January last that a total of €433 million was allocated for non-national roads. In the same month last year, €438.46 million was allocated for non-national roads. Instead of a 12% increase, there is a decrease. This is a fake and the Government backbenchers have been taken in by it. With an increase of 12% in tax and many more cars and other vehicles on the roads, far more revenue is being generated by road tax. However, there is still a decrease in the funds for non-national roads. That is the factual position and if the Minister can convince me otherwise, I will accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">The county roads and roads in city housing estates are falling apart. It is false economy not to repair them. Once the surface of the road is gone, the foundation will be washed away because without the surface there is nothing to hold the road in place. A small amount of money spent now on the restoration of the surfaces of these roads will save millions in the long run for  the Department and the local authorities. The Minister and the Government backbenchers gloated that this money will be ring-fenced. That is false. The money is being put into the fund but there is no increase in the fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">According to the explanatory memorandum, there will be a revised road tax for vintage vehicles. That is not clear in the Bill. What does that statement mean? The Bill also contains two technical amendments to motor tax law and an enabling power to facilitate the processing of on-line motor tax applications. How will that affect local authorities? Facilities will have to be set up in local authorities and extra staff will have to be employed. Will the local authorities be compensated for the extra cost incurred in establishing those facilities? I hope the Minister will address these questions.</p>

        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_541">
          <from>Mr. O'Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_853">Motor taxation is a serious issue, particularly for those who have to pay it annually, if they can afford it. Many people pay their motor tax quarterly. The increases in motor tax and the general tax increases on motorists are savage. The private motorist is seen as an easy target for governments of all hues all over the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">The issue is where this money is spent when it is put into local authority funding. I live in Drogheda and drive more than 30,000 miles per year. Most of my time is wasted sitting in traffic in Dublin city. Despite the transport policies and the funding Dublin Corporation puts into transport and roads, I cannot see any money being invested in park and ride facilities on the outskirts of the city. There is no park and ride facility on either the main road from the north into Dublin or on the Ashbourne road, although there are thousands of motorists.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">If people do not have access to public transport, they must use their cars. They have no choice. However, people who come into the city using these two routes could exercise a choice if there were locations where they could park their cars for a reasonable fee and travel into the city on public transport. That is not happening. It is shameful. It is a waste of time for the drivers who are stuck for hours in traffic. If one leaves this building at any time between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m., one will be delayed in Pearse Street for up to three quarters of an hour. I do not know if the staff in the Department have examined this problem. If they have, they should put pressure on Dublin Corporation to address these issues so people can use the alternative of park and ride facilities to get into the city in time for work.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">The other issue is the cost of petrol and diesel. If one travels on the road from Drogheda to Dublin <i>via</i> Swords, in every petrol station one will pay a higher premium for fuel than on the Ashbourne road. It is cheaper to drive on the Ashbourne road than on the main road to the North. The reason is that there are cartels. On some routes and in some towns there is a uniformity of price, whether it is 79 cent, 82 cent or 85 cent per litre.  There can be a difference of seven or eight cent per litre in the prices charged on different routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">It is time for the Minister of State to write to the Director of Consumer Affairs or the Competition Authority directing them to investigate the exorbitant charges on various routes. Diesel and petrol can be purchased at a location near Moate more cheaply than anywhere else in the country, but how can it be sold for such a low price there when the rest of us have to pay so much elsewhere? It is a serious issue because motorists are being ripped off.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">We should take a holistic approach to this matter. We all need to drive sometimes but we should also try to use public transport when we can. Motorists are being taxed out of all proportion, particularly with regard to fuel costs in certain areas. Drivers can pay through the nose for fuel in isolated towns like Dingle. An investigation of such charges should be undertaken on a national level.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_859">I oppose the Bill which is just another form of taxation. On budget day, the Minister for Finance announced certain fiscal measures but he did not mention the 12% rise in motor tax which was introduced the following day. I have known the Minister of State for a long time and I realise that he means well. In his speech, however, he said that along with funding roads, adequate finance must be provided for local authorities to perform all their functions. As a member of a local authority I know there was no increase in funding for roads. In addition, there is tremendous pressure on local authorities due to the better local government policy being introduced – a step that was supported by all parties – yet no extra funding was provided to pay for it. As a result, more local authority staff have to be paid, but funding is insufficient to allow them to deliver a better service. It is a very serious issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">The Minister plans to introduce a Bill to allow county managers to find money wherever they like. Earlier this year a county manager wanted to impose a charge of €140 per tonne for waste disposal, although the price was reduced to €101 through negotiation. If the Minister gets his way, however, councillors will not have the authority to get such charges reduced, so that is a means of imposing more indirect taxes by stealth.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">I have to deal with Monaghan County Council on a daily basis. In 2000, we had €10.5 million for local and regional road development. In 2001 the figure was €12 million, and in 2002 it was €13 million. This year, however, road funding has fallen to €12.92 million, even though motor tax increased by 12%. A senior engineer has said that it will take 15 years to upgrade the remaining roads in Monaghan.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">Before he became a Member of this House, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, negotiated a roll-over tax which is another indirect charge on  those whose land is acquired by compulsory purchase order.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">A number of speakers have mentioned VRT and VAT refunds for handicapped drivers. Recently, I came across a case of a mother whose five-year-old child has Peirthes, a rare disease. It is affecting the child's leg yet he cannot be operated on until he is in his forties. Nonetheless, his parents have been refused a VRT/VAT refund on their car which is essential for transporting their child in a comfortable manner. The Minister of State should re-examine how that refund scheme is operated. Establishing committees to undertake a two and a half year review is a great way of avoiding an issue, but the committee has now reported and appropriate action should be taken as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">The taxation system should be re-examined seriously. In recent years, the Minister for Finance has granted a sizeable decrease in income tax to middle income earners. However, poor people in rural areas need private transport because there is no alternative. Despite that, VRT is being increased on the average family car, which will hit people who can least afford it. In addition, the price of petrol and diesel fuel is increasing. The Minister should not charge elderly people in rural areas, many of whom are poorly off, any more than he has to. They do not have the option of using public transport. There are no railways in Cavan, Monaghan or Donegal so people have no choice but to use cars.</p>

        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_543">
          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_865">The Bill represents a tax on business and regional development because it will introduce a rise in the cost of fuel. Every one cent increase in fuel prices impacts at a rate of 0.7% on sales in the haulage sector which has suffered from insurance cost increases of between 36% and 63% in the past 12 months. A 12% rise in motor tax is more than double the rate of inflation. It is unacceptable because it is fuelling inflation. When the budget was introduced, the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste spoke <i>ad nauseam</i> about trying to ease inflationary pressures. When they met the social partners they gave a commitment to reduce inflation during the remaining 18 months of the current agreement. The 12% rise in motor tax will put huge pressure on the haulage industry which is already trying to cope with increased diesel fuel charges introduced earlier. All this will impact on inflation, thus affecting import and export costs, as well as the cost of distributing goods to rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">The Minister for Transport has proposed the introduction road tolls which will represent a fresh tax on investment and regional employment. The tolls will only operate in the regions, not in and around Dublin, so they will be badly hit.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">Earlier in the debate, Deputy Andrews spoke about the agreements we signed up to under the Kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 13%, based on 1990 levels. At the moment, however, we are exceeding those levels  by 20% and it is disappointing to see that vehicle exhaust emissions have risen by 26% in the last six years. The Government has done nothing about this issue but, having introduced the Finance Bill, the Minister for Finance is now talking about introducing carbon taxes. We have heard nothing, however, about encouraging the use of renewable fuels such as rape seed oil. Such fuels are currently viewed in the same way as hydrocarbons and so they are taxed at the same rate of duty. Why was a reduction in duty on rape seed oil diesel not considered? Why should the excise duty on renewable energy sources be the same as that for hydrocarbons? This does not encourage the use or development of such fuels. Why are we not encouraging their development and use by reducing excise duty on renewable resources?</p>
          <p eId="para_868">This legislation is short-sighted. Every year when these proposals are made I raise the same issue but the Department fails to address it. We need to take a different attitude, such as that adopted abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">Germany, France, Italy, Austria and other countries take a different attitude to renewable energy sources such as rape seed oil. For example, in Austria a great deal of technology has been developed in relation to bio-diesel and encouraging its use. The use of bio-diesel would reduce costs on industry, the cost of exports and it is a renewal energy source, which would reduce the cost and the demand we put on hydrocarbons. The difficulty in recent years has been that the differential between the cost of oil and hydrocarbon products has not been sufficient to support the development of new technology in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">For example, in Oak Park where a tremendous amount of research has been done in this area, the conversation of some land from food to biofuel produce would ease some of the major problems facing agriculture and other sectors of the economy. Ireland has a high degree of dependence on imported energy. Farmers could make a significant contribution to the national energy supply. As a rough guide, each 1% of farmed land devoted to biofuels could supply 1% of the national energy requirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are growing rapidly. The livestock industry contributes to the cause of greenhouse gases. Some displacement of ruminant animals by biofuel production would help in the reduction of methane emissions and fossil fuel consumption and help to support farm incomes. We know the Government's attitude to farmers' incomes. Such a measure would benefit the economy, employment and the agricultural community. That is hard for the Government to swallow, but it is a measure that should be considered. A 5% reduction in the national herd, which the Government is targeting through stealth taxes on the farming community, and 50% of that vacated land used for biofuel production would have a major impact on national greenhouse gas trends.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">The disposal of organic by-products from the agriculture and food industry is becoming an  increasing problem. For example, recovered vegetable oil and tallow, which is a massive problem in the agricultural sector, could be used as a biofuel and have a major impact in reducing oil imports. The Government has not done anything to support farm incomes or to encourage the use of biofuels, which could have a major impact on reducing the costs of exports and imports and help us meet the emission targets set under the Kyoto Protocol. To date, we have not seen any action from the Government in this area.</p>

          <from>Dr. Devins</from>
          <p eId="para_873">I am pleased to speak on this Bill. I, like I am sure everybody else, do not like paying tax. It can be argued that motor tax is no different, but I stress that there is a big difference. In this case the revenue collected by way of motor tax goes directly into maintaining our roads. It is used in road restoration and maintenance programmes. In other words, road users are being asked to pay for road maintenance.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">There is a difference between national roads and non-national roads. I come from Sligo where there are only two or three national roads while 95% or more of the roads are non-national. The money collected by motor taxation goes directly towards helping to maintain the upkeep of these roads. I agree with the previous speakers who said that roads are vital in the west. They are the lifeblood and arteries of social and business life in my county and elsewhere throughout the west. However, those roads must be maintained and kept in a good state. The revenue collected by way of motor tax in each county will be spent on maintaining the roads in those counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">In a small county like Sligo or Leitrim, the number of road users has increased enormously, but the revenue collected by way of motor taxation is not sufficient to maintain the roads to the required standard. I commend the Government on topping up the local government fund, which has ensured that the roads in my county have been maintained in a good state.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">We have a five year rolling programme under which county council engineers update and publish each year the roads that will be restored and maintained. This has been made possible by the local government fund developed by Fianna Fáil, which is committed to ensuring that local government continues to meet the needs of local people.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">Another aspect of the Bill I welcome is the provision whereby one can pay one's motor tax on-line. I remember queuing for almost two hours in a motor tax office some years ago to pay my motor tax. With an increase in staff and the development of facilities, the frequency with which people can be dealt with has improved enormously. The use of the on-line facility will speed up the service even more.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">I wish to refer to insurance certificates. When a person buys a new car, they apply for an insurance certificate in order that it can be put on the road. However, many constituents have called to me in recent months complaining about the inordinate delay in the issue of insurance certifi cation. They have paid their premium to the insurance company, but it has taken two, three, or, in one case, four weeks for the insurance company to issue the insurance certificate. A member of the Garda Síochána pointed out to me recently that such motorists could be penalised for driving their cars without displaying an insurance certificate. However, the fact that there is a delay in obtaining the certificate is not their fault; it is the fault of the insurance company. With the onset of the penalty points system, I ask the Minister of State to consider this complaint. With all the resources that are at the beck and call of insurance companies, it is unreasonable that it can take up to four weeks before motorists are issued with a simple certificate to enable them to legally drive their cars on the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">I agree with Deputy Naughten that toll roads are down the road, but I would take a different line from that of the Deputy. I commend the Minister, Deputy Brennan, on bringing a degree of original thinking to the problems that beset us in terms of our roads. I am sure the Minister will not put in place a toll road in an area unless there is an untolled road there. That is what happens on the Continent and such facilities must be put in place here. If a toll road is to be put in place, those who want to use it will have to pay the toll and presumably they will get to their destination quicker than if they did not take that road, but if motorists do not want to pay a toll, they should be able to travel on good quality non-national or national roads to their destinations.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">The ability of county councils to raise revenue through motor taxation to restore and maintain county roads, which are the lifeblood of rural areas, will be greatly enhanced by this Bill.</p>

          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_883">I am pleased to speak on this Bill. Anybody from my county would be very aware of the condition of the roads in the county because motorists are continuing to pay increased taxes, but the roads in that area have not improved. Little seems to have changed. This Bill is to give legislative effect to more increases in motor tax rates, which does not make sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">People in Mayo are not unreasonable; they are very tolerant and have accepted a lot. The road from Casltebar to Newport is a disgrace. It has been on the cards to upgrade that road for the past 18 years. Ministers have driven on that road and they have visited my area, yet the condition of that road has not improved. That is why I am in the Dáil because the Government has not delivered on a commitment in this regard, as a result of which we still have awful roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">The conditions of the road from Ballina to Bohola scheduled for completion in 2003 is as bad  as ever. The road from Castlebar to Westport, the regional roads, the road to Achill – I can talk about all the roads, including the main road into Mayo – are a disgrace. Mayo is famous for having the worst primary entry route into a county. We are told about balanced regional development, but where is the commitment to the N5 that would allow the people in my area to get balanced regional development and be equal to others? However, we are not to be so favoured. The Government has failed to prioritise any major road project in the west. The situation will continue where the development of the south, east and Dublin will be copperfastened. That was brought out in the Fitzpatrick report on the Border, midlands and western area which stated that there were no clear time-bound targets for anywhere except Dublin and major inter-urban routes. We need precise targets for the development of roads to the west if we are to have balanced regional development.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">It angers people to see that the major expenditure has been in Dublin and on major inter-urban routes, with the southern and eastern regions a whopping 45% ahead of target. How can this be termed "equality"? It is like <i>Animal Farm</i>; some are more equal than others. Those who live in the Pale, south and east are certainly more equal than the rest of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">It does not make sense because the Pale is already chock-a-block with people and does not need any more. Half our graduates must go to Dublin to find their first job. It is ridiculous when the answer lies in balanced regional development. All roads lead to Dublin and that is so obvious, it is immoral. Other speakers referred to countries such as Portugal and Cyprus which have a coastal road around the country which allows any area to be accessed. The system in Ireland is a recipe for congestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">I was pleased to see the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, open the Knock – Claremorris bypass, but that is an oasis. It links Galway and Sligo and allows people to get through Mayo as quickly as possible. It is the only reason it was built as far as I can see. We hear about the terrible overrun in roads expenditure, but unfortunately it is not happening with our roads in Mayo. Despite this, we pay the same taxes. We deserve equality. How can we be expected to pay more taxes, as the Bill suggests we should, if there is no improvement in our roads? It is nonsensical. I do not blame the National Roads Authority, rather the Government which has failed to deliver to the west over the years which is why we have bad roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">The open-ended contracts for the construction of roads mean the risk will be taken by the State with the consultants and designers paid on the basis of a percentage of the finished cost. That is economic madness and is at the cost of national and non-national roads in Mayo. The national development plan is a fraud where balanced regional development is concerned and is a fraud  perpetrated on the people. The taxpayer must pay for the tune the piper plays. Unfortunately, we are the suckers.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">Expenditure on the national roads programme is €16 billion and rising. Why not rationalise the programme and build roads that are not motorways but which allow plenty of room for passing? They would give some semblance of equality and would do wonders for tourism, balanced regional development and combating the urban sprawl in Dublin. There are many examples of such roads throughout the world. The national development plan motorway programme will compound the terrible over-population of the Pale. Why not develop an infrastructure that will serve the country?</p>
          <p eId="para_891">I am aware of the situation regarding insurance costs where people pay above and beyond what others pay. I read about the terrible cost of insurance fraud. However, the real fraud is perpetrated on the people of the west by a Government that is not prepared to afford us equality in terms of balanced regional development to give us a chance to attract industry to allow people and graduates stay in their areas. We do not want our graduates to go to Dublin. We want to keep them in our area, but they are obliged to go because of the economic situation. We need a commitment to and deadlines from the Government for balanced regional development.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_548">
          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_892">I am delighted to share my time with my colleague with whom I share a constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">This is the greatest country in the world for collecting taxes. The 12% increase in the Bill is massive and is not right in the current climate. I will give examples of how good we are at collecting taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">The clampers in Dublin sicken me. They are present around the clock to clamp people who do not have a ticket displayed on their cars or whose tickets have run out not more than five minutes before. A friend of mine, who came to Dublin at 8.15 a.m. one day to be at work at 8.30 a.m., was clamped because he did not have a ticket displayed and could not purchase one from the nearby machine because it was out of order. This person won the case. The question must be asked: where were the people to ensure the ticket machine was in working order? This country is becoming a dictatorship. The Government is arrogant and acts like a dictator.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">We are great for taking money from people through taxes. Despite this, local authorities cannot afford to erect proper signage. If one wishes to find a hospital or road in Dublin city, one cannot find a sign pointing in the direction of it. Why are we against signs in this city and country? We are great for clamping, taxing and taking money from people.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">On the issue of roads, if one comes into Dublin on the N5, one can travel legally at 70 miles per hour because it is a motorway. All of a sudden, it is reduced to 50 miles per hour. That is not right. What are the Minister and local authority doing  to regularise this? How can a person be expected to go immediately from 70 to 50 miles per hour?</p>
          <p eId="para_897">It is good that the Government has introduced penalty points, but I will give another example in this regard. The other day there was chaos on the M50 because the traffic lights were out of order. I turned off the motorway to find gardaí with a speed camera 200 yards down the road. I thought it was RTE at first but it was the Garda Síochána. No garda was on duty on the M50 to deal with the problems caused by the lack of traffic signals, yet 200 yards down a slip road, they were on duty with a speed camera. I do not imagine they caught many people speeding that evening because there was chaos on the road. People were not moving at more than five miles per hour. Why were these gardaí not on duty on the M50? They are great in Garda headquarters at identifying a car in any part of the city. Why did a message not go out from there to the two gardaí to sort out the traffic problems on the M50? It is all about collecting the euro from the poor, over-taxed consumer. It is not right.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">I raise the issue of roads in the west, especially national primary and non-national roads. The road from Longford to Mayo is the greatest national scandal. People are expected to live and industry is expected to survive with it. Industrialists from the area, who met the Tánaiste before last Christmas, run many companies in County Mayo which employ thousands of people. Their exports go from Mayo to Dublin before being sent throughout the world. The greatest complaint they receive is that their goods are damaged. This is a problem for industry in the county and is simply because the road from Strokestown to Charlestown is a national disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">It sickens me in that context to see the Government announcing additional funding for the National Roads Authority or, as a colleague of mine, Councillor Gerry Coyle, rightly calls it, the no roads at all authority. It is certainly a case of no roads for the west. We have had enough. It is not good enough. We cannot survive with it any longer. Goods cannot be transported into and out of the west. No funding could be found for the national primary route from Westport to Castlebar nor for the N26 from Foxford to Ballina. What is wrong with us? What does Fianna Fáil have against the west and Mayo? How are we to survive? The Government does not want people to live in rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">The provisional licence regulations introduced by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, are another scam and way of collecting money. The Government is putting the cart before the horse on this issue. Let us take the example of people in rural areas who have never driven in a city, on a dual carriageway or negotiated a roundabout. They use their cars to enable them to pick up the pension on a Friday, to go to the doctor and to go to Mass on a Sunday. If they were going to Ballina or Castlebar, they would pay for public transport or take a taxi, but would not drive their cars. It is time the Government looked at a way  of dealing with this and there is a very simple way. It will have to introduce a rural Ireland number plate, whereby these people could only drive in rural areas or towns and would not be able to drive in cities. Many of these people will never drive on a motorway or a dual carriageway. We are putting them out of business and it is not right.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">If the Minister were serious about this he would have put this on the school curriculum. By third year in secondary school students should take the theory test. Before completing their leaving certificate, they should have completed their practical driving test. That would cost the State a few pounds. However, the attitude of the Government is that if it costs money it is no good. If it is taxation, it is great and it will pull the money out of people's pockets. The new driving test requirements have caused chaos in the west of Ireland and all over the country particularly for elderly people who have provisional licences but do not cause accidents. I am totally opposed to anybody who drives dangerously and am all in favour of lives being saved. However, there is a difference between that and attacking innocent people.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">It is a bit like the way people can be caught on cameras. However, when my car was damaged and my phone was stolen in this city, there were not many gardaí or clampers around and nobody seemed to see anything. If I parked my car for ten minutes and failed to put my money in the box, it would be clamped and I would have to pay €80. There are more clamping cars in this city than there are taxis. It must be a great industry and I would love to know how it operates. They must get a percentage for every car they clamp. They remind me of the young lads who used to get the penny for an empty bottle. Every time the clampers clamp a car they must be getting more than a penny.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">However, these clampers cannot see people breaking into, robbing and damaging cars. I left my car on Lower Mount Street to go into a pub. I was only out of the car for two minutes and when I returned, my windscreen was smashed and my mobile phone was taken. I asked a man selling papers if he saw anything and he told me that nobody sees anything in this city. If I left my car for five minutes more than it should be, there would be a clamper there and somebody would have seen it. How is it that with all the equipment in the Dublin Transportation Office, they could not see what was being done to my car? Why could they not have made a phone call to alert the Garda Síochána? However they can ring the clampers to tell them to be there in two seconds, before the car is gone. People do not mind paying their dues, but there are times when people get delayed in shops, visiting a doctor or at work and they are five minutes late. For somebody on low income €80 is a considerable amount of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">What will the Government do about signage? What will the Government do about the daft  speed limit signs? The speed limit on the national primary road approaching Mullingar is 60 miles per hour and all of a sudden there is a 30 miles per hour speed limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">The national car test is another racket. Cars that are only two years old are now being tested. Modern cars are not like those 20 years ago. They all adhere to a very good European standard, but it is all about revenue for the Government. If we were half as good at repairing the roads it would be great. To get a pothole fixed takes about six weeks. Once the local authority has been informed, it has to find a worker to do it. I recently tabled a parliamentary question to find out how many engineers and workers were employed in my local authority. There are more engineers employed than ordinary workers. The first people to be let go are ordinary workers and not engineers.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">The Minister has responsibility for cars. He used to be a very good MEP and was part of the European scene. When we first joined the EU we were told that a person buying a car in France, Germany or any European country could bring it into the country without having to pay tax, but yet we still have the VRT. Are we part of Europe or not? Why are we so good at introducing EU regulations when they cost the taxpayers? Why does the Minister not introduce a Bill to eliminate the VRT? I am told there is a test case already. Although we have a derogation from Europe, we should not have. A recent case involving another European country was lost and the Irish Government will also lose. I know the State is collecting significant revenue from VRT. Why are we so good at bringing in EU regulations when France, Germany and other countries ignore them?</p>
          <p eId="para_907">I recently received a phone call from a constituent in the food business concerning EU regulations. Two years ago I was in France having my dinner when a dog came in, cocked his leg and nobody took any notice of him. Some 200 people from the food industry were recently at a meeting in Knock. The health inspector told them they were a danger and threat to the food chain here. We are gone EU regulations mad and have gone a step too far. People in business and other workers paying tax have had enough. They are up to their necks with government, regulations and diktat. I predict that 20,000 or 30,000 people will be on the streets of this city before too long because they cannot put up with any more regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">We are great for employing civil servants. Once they start their jobs they want to find ways to take a pound off the next man to pay for the jobs they have just got. It would be far cheaper to let people who are working continue to do so and have fewer civil servants. I am not talking about the civil servants here, but those in every local authority and health board. We have so many paper pushers that we will not have enough paper for them if we do not stop.</p>

It is good to see him back in the national arena. I agree with Deputy Ring that the Minister was an excellent MEP and was very good at communications. I am sure this will serve him well in his portfolio here. Introducing a Bill that will result in people paying more money for a facility is never a nice message to sell. However, if we can see the value of what is being done and that message is communicated, the increase is justified.</p>

          <p eId="para_913">I put my money where my mouth is and invested it directly in better provision for my own services in County Donegal. The primary purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to the increases in motor tax rates and trade plate licences provided for in the financial resolution on motor tax in the budget in December. The standard 12% across the board increase in motor tax for all classes of vehicles has already hit me personally. However, as the measure is for good reason, I agree with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">The amendments to motor tax legislation designed to improve the administration of the system are welcome. During my day-to-day business, I receive an increasing number of e-mails, which I usually read within a reasonable period. If I could make the day longer, I would be able to read them even sooner. E-business is important for business and business transactions. The facility to pay motor tax on-line is also welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">The motor taxation offices established by the previous Government, which consisted of the same coalition partners as the current Government, have been important in increasing the ease with which people in my region pay motor tax. I welcome the fact that many of the offices moved to Donegal as part of the decentralisation process are now opening or have opened already. The motor tax office in Carndonagh, for example, has been a phenomenal success. At one stage it was handling 20% of all motor taxation in the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">People appreciate being able to use a facility locally and anything that eases the process of paying motor taxation is welcome. I commend the Government for decentralising motor taxation offices as it has returned local government to the people to whom services must be brought. I also commend all those working in the local offices for whom the transfer from the centralised office to the new facility was traumatic. There appears to have been few teething problems and the change has been very successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">As the chairperson of the Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I have a suggestion to make regarding the technical changes being extended to the national vehicle records held in Shannon. We have a serious problem both in my region and nationally with the phenomenon of cars being abandoned and burnt out by joyriders. Although it is handy for people in my constituency to say all such cars originate in Derry, I do not believe this to be the case. Cars which have perhaps failed the national car test or bought cheaply in another jurisdiction are being driven around by boy racers, who then set them on fire on roadsides and push them into hedges or fields. Often they are not even pushed off the road and present a hazard for unsuspecting drivers who may come around a corner.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">It seems all car records are held in Shannon. When a person is finished with a car, he or she is supposed to fill in and return a form to the vehicle registration unit detailing what has happened to the car, for instance, whether it has been scrapped or sold on. Is this not a roundabout approach to the issue? Is it not possible to provide for a mechanism in the legislation which would ensure such information is quickly shared with local authorities? For example, the unit could provide the local authorities with information on cars which have not been taxed in a particular year or about which no information has been received, which could then appear on the computer system of the authority in question. The Garda and the owner of the car could then be notified and genuine owners could clarify what happened to the car. People who have sold the car on for less positive uses could and should be pursued and an example made of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">The problem of abandoned cars could result in serious accidents involving not only joyriders, but also unsuspecting families who may drive around a bend and crash into a burning car on the side of the road. We should consider the possibility of improving the information available to the vehicle registration unit in Shannon and giving the Garda and local authorities access to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">Will the Minister indicate whether it is envisaged to reinstate the scrappage scheme? I understand this was a successful scheme. If this is the case, why was it withdrawn? Under the national car test, cars can be deemed to be of no use. Under the old scheme, one received £1,000 or £2,000 to scrap one's car which meant people had some extra money to buy a better quality car. It also offered a way of ensuring cars at the end of their shelf life were kept in a controlled environment. We need a mechanism for providing information on the whereabouts of such cars which would allow them to be dealt with properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">Recently, at local authority level, the question was raised as to the number of facilities for scrapping cars available nationally and the value to a dealer of providing such facilities for a local authority. The question was also asked as to whether local authorities should receive capital grants  from the Department of the Environment and Local Government for establishing scrappage facilities. We have some excellent facilities for waste disposal in Carndonagh, where the central office is located, and we hope to establish a similar facility in Buncrana. We need to address this serious issue and the vehicle registration unit in Shannon should play a role in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">I return to spending increases. There has been a huge increase in funding for the national primary roads on which significant sums are now being spent. I have gripes about the fact that the national development plan does not make provision for the N2-A5 to be brought up to motorway standard. However, I am aware of sums of money being spent in this area. I welcome the decision to proceed with the bypasses at Carrickmacross and Castleblayney. It is important we continue to improve access.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">There is insufficient co-operation between Departments. The Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Transport should maximise co-operation in areas in which they can provide mutual assistance. In the context of the N2-A5, a joint effort between the Departments here and either the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the relevant British Minister or a local Minister once the Executive is up and running again which will, I hope, be in the near future, will yield improvements. Much of the road has significantly improved since I started to use it several years ago. The problems with it are now almost exclusively confined to the North. I have worked on a cross-Border group with my northern colleagues from most parties and we also met Peter Robinson on the issue. Although the problem has been recognised, it must also be recognised that a solution needs to be sought and found.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">On the national primary roads, which are not specifically addressed in the Bill, it was indicated to us that because it was a tight year, counties such as Donegal might have major difficulties in terms of receiving allocations. Prior to the recent announcement by the National Roads Authority the indications emanating from it were that roads in County Donegal would not receive a significant allocation. When we met the NRA we were desperate to receive €9 million to enable us to keep the show on the road, as it were. As it was a tight year, we wondered if we would receive it. In the end, we received in the region of €13.5 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">Other speakers claim money is not being spent and list areas to which it is not being allocated. Money has been made available and is being spent. While I will have rows with the NRA as to where it is spent and how much my county receives, nevertheless we received more than we had anticipated. I welcome the increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">National primary roads do not impact on my part of the constituency because we do not have national primary routes and have just one small section of national secondary road. I hope major  safety improvements can be made at Newtowncunningham to allow pedestrians to cross this very busy road. More forward planning is required. We need to allocate funds to long stretches of road rather than making allocations in a piecemeal fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">Despite concerns that County Donegal would not receive funds, it received a welcome allocation to cover the main roads. A total of €300,000 was allocated for the Moville Road, €300,000 for the Carndonagh bypass, €300,000 to start the inner relief road in Buncrana and €300,000 for the main Bridgend to Buncrana Road.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">Some years ago Donegal lost its LAS moneys on the basis that they were being spent in a piecemeal fashion. That funding was subsequently regained after considerable discussion with the then Minister of State, the former Deputy Molloy. Councillors are always being told not to spend on a piecemeal basis and it is satisfying to spend some money in, say, four areas in one year but we would be better off putting a few million euro towards finishing those roads instead of spending money on repairing them year after year. By the time the people get on site, the €300,000 is almost gone. With a good cash injection in a particular year many of these roads could be removed from the work programme. In the past certain roads lasted 20 or 25 years and perhaps that could be examined on a bigger scale.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">An announcement was made today about the LAS, and I welcome the €11 million allocation for Donegal. Eight years ago, when I was a councillor, the LAS money we received was so insignificant that works were carried out on only a small number of roads and most roads were left untouched. In the recent past, LAS money has been of major benefit to the county and the additional CLÁR funding that we have acquired will be of even more benefit. The devil might be in the detail of that but the CLÁR funding for non-national roads and LAS type moneys will be of major benefit to our own region. In that regard I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, who is the Minister responsible for rural development.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">I spoke on the need for co-operation between the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Transport but there should also be co-operation with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources because the problem of coastal erosion is often associated with coastal roads. Dealing with the problem of coastal erosion could be more imaginative in terms of how the moneys are spent and the way the people involved do this work. A long time ago I spoke to people who talked about using a CE type scheme to make the coastal erosion moneys go further. However, much more could be done to address this problem in terms of co-operation between the Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">I agree with earlier speakers who referred to discretionary maintenance. There has been a  decline in the amount of discretionary maintenance given to councils as a result of the funding being channelled in a different way. Discretionary maintenance is important for local engineers in that issues that arise through the year are not always pre-planned and there must be a level of discretion applied to moneys that come in.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">There is an ongoing row about freedom of information and there is a drive towards openness, accountability and transparency. It has reached a stage where everyone is trying so hard to account for the moneys they have been allocated that the discretion applied in the case of what may be a very good project can be lost. In some instances we are cutting off our nose to spite our face.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">In my own area there have been town and village renewals as a result of money allocated from the PEACE initiative. Incredibly, small villages have come alive to the idea of doing something for themselves but when they ask the council engineer for additional funding to carry out more work, he or she is tied by the five year programme. The idea of local and voluntary groups coming together to work with the county council is being stymied by the lack of discretionary moneys. I am not saying engineers should be given vast amounts of money to do with it what they wish but many good projects are being put on the long finger. At the start of a five year programme one cannot be sure about the type of projects that will evolve. There should be some leeway and more discussion with the council engineers in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">Very little is being done about "sioc" cleaning, as it is called in our area. Roads are constantly being torn up having only been resurfaced because the sides of the roads were not ledged and the "siocs" were not cleared. If the initial water problem is not addressed, it does not matter how much tar is put on a road the job will not be successful. It should be compulsory for roadworks to involve the cleaning of the verges on the sides of roads, which is a basic requirement. That work used to be done by council workmen but they are fewer in number now. This is a basic complaint in my own region but it is a serious one which is worthy of examination.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">I commend the people involved in the low cost accident measures. This is an area to which we should try to allocate as much funding as possible. Sometimes a little money goes a long way in these situations. Rumble strips have been placed on the roads in an area just outside Malin, on the way to Glengad, to try to warn people of the dangers and speed limit signs of 25 miles per hour have been put up. They are trying everything to deal with the problem of speed on that road but if the height of the incline was reduced and the resultant material used to fill in the hollow, the problem would be solved. Unfortunately, commonsense solutions have to go through many hoops but if, God forbid, there was a fatality in any of these areas the money would be found and the work would be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">An issue that causes me extreme annoyance is the disparity between the prices of petrol and diesel. A Deputy spoke about this earlier and he mentioned a disparity of between six and seven cent. I do a lot of driving and pass many petrol stations. I can tell the House there are disparities of 12 and 13 cent, and even more. It is time that someone examined this issue. I do not know if we need consumer legislation but I would like someone to explain the reason for a difference of five, six, seven or even eight cent in these prices in a small peninsula such as mine. The figure nationally is between 12 and 15 cent.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">Rural transport initiatives should continue. Another area we have difficulty getting funding for is footpaths and car parks. It is easy to say the money should be taken out of the local fund but perhaps following this increase Donegal County Council will get considerably more money to deal with these.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">The council has been imaginative in trying to solve its problems, whether in regard to employment or environment initiatives. It has been progressive in many respects and I commend the workers involved. There is much to be done, however, and I would like to ensure that we get the best possible advantages for our own area. I wish the Minister well. I presume he will work well with the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid. They may have a national portfolio but Donegal will gain from having two Ministers of State in Government.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_939">I thank all Deputies who participated in this debate. It goes without saying that any proposals to increase taxes will generate lively and good debate, and we had a lot of that here this evening. I would point out, however, that we are dealing specifically with non-national roads. Many questions were raised that are more appropriate for the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister for Transport. I will try to deal with the questions to the Department of the Environment and Local Government in the limited time available to me. If Deputies want me to convey their views to other Ministers I will be happy to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">I said earlier that 60% of the national fleet of cars are under 1,400 cc so the extra annual cost to most motorists will be from €15 to €30, between 29c to 58c per week, or 2.8c to 4.1c per day.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">I cannot listen to this debate without referring to the past and there are Deputies present who have been in Cabinet. Decisions such as these are not taken lightly and I assure the House that the proposals in the Bill were not drawn up lightly. They were drawn up because it was the right thing to do to support our local government system and to maintain and improve our non-national road network. I underline that the local government fund is not used for national roads,  which seems to be the perception among some Deputies. The fund is specifically for non-national roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">Deputy Morgan and others can rest assured that the motor tax will not be diverted to the Minister for Finance. It is ring-fenced by the legislation, which states clearly that it goes to the local government fund. The Department of the Environment and Local Government keeps the local government fund account in a bank in Dublin, where it accrues approximately €2 million in interest each year. It is critical to underline that motor tax, unlike other taxes, is not paid into the Exchequer. That should be abundantly clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">This is not a budgetary issue. It was the rainbow coalition which laid the groundwork for this measure when it decided to divert motor tax from the Exchequer into the equalisation fund, assigning it to local government.</p>

          <p eId="para_945">We will deal with that. When that administration introduced the measure in 1997 it also took the opportunity to make provision to allow local authorities to increase motor tax rates above and beyond levels set centrally. That was the decision taken by the Government of the time. This Bill is all about ensuring local government is well resourced to perform its functions and to provide good local services across a range of areas, contributing to national, local and community development.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">In 1997 the total allocation for non-national roads was €214 million. Contrast that with this year's allocation, €434 million. I was amused by Deputy Crawford, whose memory goes back to 1999 and 2000. I will take him back to 1997, when the allocation to Monaghan County Council was €7.5 million. Contrast that with this year's allocation, €12.97 million, an increase of 72%. That is a realistic increase.</p>

          <p eId="para_965">—and in some cases it is 85% higher than the corresponding allocation in 1997. I am confident this level of general purpose funding from the local government fund, together with funding from local sources, is appropriate to meet the reasonable costs of local authority services this year. Since the 1998 Act came into force the local government fund has been the primary source of funding for non-national roads. This Bill is all about continuing the development of a good national roads system and is a key part of the national development plan. There is a commitment to promoting balanced regional development, social inclusion and rural development.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">Regarding the non-national roads, the NDP is committed to expenditure of €2.43 billion to that network from 2000 to 2006. That comprises €1.08 in the BMW region and €1.35 billion in the southeast. There had to be positive discrimination as those regions have to catch up and expenditure in both areas is well ahead of the profile for the period January 2000 to December 2002. Actual expenditure in the BMW region of nearly €494 million took place against a profile figure of €458 million, while in the southeast actual expenditure was €677 million, in comparison with a profile figure of €580 million. Total expenditure in the 2000 to 2002 period was €1.17 billion, as against a profile figure of €1.038 billion. This is almost 13% ahead of the profile. The non-national road allocation announced in January this year provides for expenditure of €171.6 million in the BMW  region and €247.3 million in the southeast.

          <p eId="para_998">Deputy Allen referred to the possibility of introducing a motor tax regime based on carbon dioxide emissions. He looked at the British example. The Department is examining ways to relate car tax to emissions. It will look at equity, real emissions and reduction in revenue safeguards. We cannot compare this State with Britain because from March 2001 the vehicle excise duties for new cars have been determined by their CO2 emission figures and the fuel used. There are five bands with three rates in each, the lowest rate being for alternative fuel cars. Britain has only one rate for private cars and light goods vehicles while we have 22. The change to a carbon dioxide basis was, therefore, easy for the British but the Department is examining the relation of car tax to emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">Deputies Finian McGrath and Crowe spoke about local government funding. The arrangements introduced through the fund have served local authorities well. The Government is committed to ensuring local authorities have sufficient funding to provide quality services.  Deputy O'Connor suggested the Department should carry out a value for money study. I indicated in my opening address that an independent evaluation was carried out by Fitzpatrick Associates Economic Consultants and that company stated we are getting value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">Deputy McCormack asked about progress with the on-line motor tax project and its funding. The Department received funding to set up the on-line system from the Information Society that is administered by the Department of the Taoiseach. The system should be introduced on a pilot basis in some areas by the middle of the year and rolled out by the end of the year. There will be no extra staff required by local authorities. The opposite will be the case, local authorities will not have to process business at the counter, saving time and money. The cost of an on-line transaction will be 15 cent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">Deputy Devins referred to the delays with insurance certificates. That is a matter for the Ministers for Transport and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. When payment is made, there should be no reason for any delay in issuing the certificates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">Deputy Ring mentioned VRT. That is a matter for the Minister for Finance and it formed part of the Finance Bill which was discussed in the House in recent weeks. Deputies Cowley and Ring referred to the situation in the west. I draw their attention to the fact that in 1997, €10.5 million was allocated there and that has now been increased to €19 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">Deputy Keaveney referred to the announcement I made today of an allocation of €11 million for the local improvements scheme. This is an important scheme and I am pleased that improvements will be made on the basis of need, with the areas with most applications and the greatest need receiving the highest allocation on a national basis. The same system will then work with local electoral areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">There is a commitment in the national development plan to provide €25 million over a five year period for regional signage in each county. This year we have taken the first step by providing €5.1 million to provide signage in Counties Donegal, Sligo, Galway, Kerry and Wexford.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">The end of life vehicle recovery scheme was mentioned. The Government has agreed proposals put forward by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on this issue. The motor vehicle and metal recyclers' associations have taken the lead in developing the scheme. The Government has agreed that it should proceed and the necessary legal provisions will be added to the Protection of the Environment Bill that is currently before the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">Deputy Gilmore referred to class three roads and asked why there was no funding last year. He has raised this on a number of occasions and it is an important issue for those involved but it is also marginal when one considers that class three grants amounted to €6 million when last allocated  in 2001 and his own local authority, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, received €127,000 at that time. The tertiary road grants were paid for the first time in 1997 and additional funding was also provided for this purpose. No such funding was provided in 1998 or 2002 while funding for class three roads was made available in 1999, 2000 and 2001. In each of those years €6.1 million was allocated in the middle of the year – the allocations came about after mid-year expenditure reviews.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">Savings were identified in a number of schemes in which progress was slower than anticipated as a result of delay in land acquisition and the class three allocations were reallocations. I acknowledge the importance of those roads and the necessity to have work carried out on them. The money involved was as a result of reallocations in other years but, unfortunately, that does not apply at present. It is a matter which I intend to look at with Department officials at some stage.</p>

          <from>Mr. T. O'Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_1012">I welcome the opportunity to speak on issues related to the provision of services for people with disabilities and to outline what the Government is doing to meet the needs which have been identified for this population group. There have been a number of key devel opments over recent years on the enhancement of services and the development of new services to meet identified needs in the area of disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, last night outlined the increases in the number of people with intellectual disabilities or autism accessing services generally. I believe the significant progress which has been made in terms of the growth in funding available for these sectors in recent years is indicative of the Government's commitment to the ongoing development of health-funded services for people with disabilities. Between 1997 and 2002, an extra €188 million revenue and €139 million capital funding has been provided, making a total additional investment of €327 million for the maintenance and development of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Included in this funding is €27.2 million which was allocated to meet identified needs in existing services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">In the current year, further additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding brings the total extra investment in these services to €340 million over seven years. Of this total amount, over €200 million has been built into the ongoing budget base. This funding has brought about very significant and unprecedented developments in the services. Between 1997 and 2002, about 1,700 extra residential places have been provided, with most of these based in the community. This figure includes new residential respite places which were developed in 1997 and 1998. Between 1999 and 2002, approximately 465 dedicated respite places were also provided. In addition, the period from 1997 to 2002 saw the provision of about 2,950 new day places.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population. Approximately €180 million in additional funding has been provided since 1997 with regard to the maintenance and development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. A significant proportion of this funding, over €20 million, has been provided specifically for home support services.</p>

          <p eId="para_1020">A further €71 million has been provided in once-off grants for capital projects and services such as the provision of technical aids and appliances. Under the national development plan, capital funding amounting to almost €108 million has been allocated to services for persons with intellectual disability and those with autism to provide for the infrastructural supports required by these services. This funding has been used to purchase new facilities for the residential, respite and day services and the refurbishment or expansion of existing facilities. It has also been used to provide alternative or refurbished accommodation for persons with an intellectual disability or autism who are accommodated in psychiatric hospitals or other inappropriate settings. The €27.4 million in capital funding allocated to this programme has facilitated the reduction of the numbers of such persons from 970 in 1996 to 452 in late 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">On the capital funding provided by my Department for residential facilities for people with disabilities, voluntary service providers have in many instances also accessed the voluntary housing grant scheme of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.

          <p eId="para_1023">It is acknowledged that further work is required in the coming years to advance services. Only through the active participation of all involved can this issue be progressed to achieve what is ultimately most important, the delivery of quality and cost effective services to people with disabilities. As I have stated, the Government has given visible evidence of its commitment in this area through an overall investment of €555 million in services for people with disabilities in recent years. It is also committed to moving forward to further enhance the level of support available to people with disabilities and others who require specific supports. However, this can only be achieved in a sustainable and enduring manner if it is delivered within a financial environment which protects the delivery of services into the future.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donovan</from>
          <p eId="para_1025">I welcome the increased funding which the Minister of State has outlined in his speech this evening. Despite increased funding over the past five years, it appears that in some instances it is not enough. There has been significant progress in many areas concerning people with disabilities, including the increase in the disabled person's grant administered by local authorities and the essential repairs grant for the benefit of elderly people. If I may be somewhat parochial, there is a very active voluntary group in my area, Co-action West Cork, which was set up in 1974 and has done tremendous work. It has a number of bases in peripheral areas of west Cork. Although the funding received by this organisation through the health board has almost quadrupled since 1997, there is still a deficit and, regrettably, there has been recent speculation on the possibility of four or five redundancies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">I acknowledge that in the past number of years significant progress has been made in helping people with disadvantages and giving them a window of opportunity in so far as that can be given. In 1997, the total funding for this organisation was approximately €500,000 and this year it was in the region of €2.4 million. They have a problem and I would appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, in this regard. I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Martin, on the issue of core funding. There seems to be a deficit which in my view should be addressed because my constituency is a peripheral region, which includes the peninsulas of Beara and the Mizen Head and places remote from Cork. Due to their peripheral location these organisations encounter extra costs such as transporting people long distances of as much as 60 or 70 miles by bus and they deserve extra credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">From my knowledge of organisations such as Co-Action West Cork and – not wishing to be parochial – Cope, which is doing the same sort of work in Cork, and other valuable organisations throughout the county like the one set-up in Charleville, they are doing extremely good work. We must ensure that their tremendous work continues. Much of this work was done with voluntary help over the years. They started off in the 1970s with practically no Government funding. The core funding they require should be put in place to ensure that they can continue their services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">The wheel has turned full circle. I am not quite sure if that is a good development in the case of these voluntary organisations because they rose out of a decade or 15 years of almost total dependence on voluntary contributions with an initial contribution from central Government or the health boards in the early 1990s, and they have reached a position where they have become very professional and have expanded their services. The Minister must also ensure that the funding they get is used in a cost effective manner and is  managed correctly. These services for people with either physical or intellectual disadvantages must be maintained and increased for the future. I implore the Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, to look closely at these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, of which I am Chairman, has embarked on looking at the whole area of disability as one of the fundamental rights under the Constitution. I hope that in our work over the next year or two we may give a window of opportunity for some of these organisations to put their case to us and address their real concerns. I am glad that I was able to make a contribution, although it was much briefer than I would have liked.</p>

          <p eId="para_1030">Like my colleagues, it is a big challenge to say my piece in the three or four minutes available rather than in a longer debate, but it is important that we take the opportunity to speak on this matter. I commend Deputy Allen and his colleagues for tabling this motion which gives us all an opportunity to make our point.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">Although I sometimes feel the need to do so, I will not spend any time speaking about the merits of being a Government backbencher and the manner in which one must deal with business. Like my colleagues, I bring to this House my experience of public life in my constituency, as a member of the local authority – particularly in recent times on South Dublin County Council – and indeed as a member of the South-Western Area Health Board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, and I am happy to acknowledge the work of the Deputy Olivia Mitchell at that level. Since we have experience of the local authorities and the health boards, all of us understand the matter before us and the challenge involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">I will not patronise elderly people. I take the view that, just like everybody else, I am ageing slowly, but I have had personal experience of the problems of ageing in the family. My Dad was quite elderly and somewhat disabled by a health problem. We encountered the challenge which those issues bring to every family and members of the family responded to that challenge. There was a range of issues and some of the issues raised in the motion affected us like everyone else. Politicians are no different in that regard. We are entitled to respond to those matters and I have no hesitation in making my point to the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, who will understand many of these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">Certainly the elderly people in our communities are entitled to our support. At a time when the national economy is being challenged, if that is the appropriate term, we should be looking at those who need our support. There are other sections of our community who are entitled to have our support in that regard, but certainly the elderly have an absolute entitlement and we should not be afraid to speak out for the elderly and give them a voice if they are not able to make  the points themselves. In the case of some of these issues, they certainly need our support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">In the short time available to me, I want to focus on the question of nursing home subvention and the availability of nursing homes. I live in a community which would be perceived as a very young community. For those Members who do not know, I am from Tallaght in Dublin South-West.</p>

          <p eId="para_1036">Tallaght has a young population and a small elderly population, yet there are still people in Tallaght who are in that category. Indeed I am a member of the board of Tallaght Welfare Society which does a huge amount of work through its day care centre for people with a disability and for the elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">I often have to help families accessing nursing home places. This was a particularly common occurrence when I was on the health board. There is no nursing home, as yet, in the Tallaght area, although there are ambitious plans in that regard and Crooksling, which is quite close by, caters for women. In trying to help families access nursing home subvention in respect of good accommodation which the family can visit easily, I often find that Tallaght families must place their elderly relatives in nursing homes in places like Howth and Bray. This presents a challenge to those families who want to visit their elderly relatives. This is an issue which I am pursuing at local level but in a debate like this it is right and legitimate that I would mention such challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">The Government is taking seriously the problems highlighted in the motion. I hope the Minister understands that people have strong feelings about assisting people and I am happy to have been able to make these points in the short time available.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1040">I want to say a few words in my contribution to this debate about healthy ageing and in particular the healthy ageing programme which is being organised by the National Council on Ageing and Older Persons in association with the Department's health promotion unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">A healthy ageing programme is any innovative service or activity designed to improve the quality of life and the well-being of older persons that is in addition to the normal services provided to older persons in the region. Projects can have their origins in the health boards, local authorities, community development groups, voluntary groups, retirement groups or inter-generational groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">The design of the healthy ageing framework has involved the following key tasks: reviewing the evidence base for health promotion with older persons nationally and internationally; building on the findings and recommendations of the healthy ageing review in 2000; studying healthy ageing programmes in the UK, Northern Ireland, the United States and Canada and conducting an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the healthy ageing programme as it stands; identifying groups of older persons who are disadvantaged in health terms and most in need of targeted effort in health promotion; and familiarisation with existing health promotion infrastructures; and developing the approach to fit with current health policy in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">I compliment the National Council on Ageing and Older People and my Department's health promotion unit for their initiative in undertaking this important work. The Department will be providing the required resources and I am confident that a programme will be produced to help us all survive into a healthier old age.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_1044">I am glad to have the opportunity of making a short contribution on this important matter. One of the best indicators of how we treat the elderly in our society is the standard of housing throughout the country. I am glad that over the last few years the standard of local authority housing has improved. Housing is not provided on the cheap nowadays. Due to the continuing substantial programme of local authority housing of recent years there has been a huge increase in the number of housing units available for the elderly and for people on the housing list in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">One of the successful schemes has been the disabled person's grant scheme. As outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, last night, there has been a substantial increase in the maximum level of grant assistance available.</p>

With the very low level of grant assistance available in 1996 and 1997, people were not able to carry out repairs to their homes. With the maximum level, percentage-wise, being increased substantially, the number of people able to participate in the schemes has increased dramatically.</p>

          <p eId="para_1061">Surely we could accept the word of the person's GP if he or she were to sign the certificate stating that the person meets the medical eligibility criteria. Let the local authority or the health board carry out spot checks if they have concerns. It is farcical that in each case an application is referred from the local authority to the health board and lies there for some time before going back to the local authority, where there are more delays. Unfortunately, all public representatives have dealt with cases over the years in which the recipient of the grant had little or no time to enjoy their improved home. I would like officials from the Department of the Environment and Local Government to sit down with local authority officials and review this scheme with a view to cutting out the bureaucracy and red tape while keeping guidelines that can be implemented and checked.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">Great credit is due to the many communities who have availed of the capital assistance scheme. The Department of the Environment and Local Government, to its credit, has encouraged many communities to avail of the scheme, whereby schemes of 12 or 20 houses are built so that people in isolated conditions can go to live in a village. They can still live within their own parish  or area but without the isolation of living on their own. Schemes such as this should be promoted much more.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">I am glad that substantial funding is being provided in the national development plan towards the provision of additional community nursing homes. In my own county, two nursing units have been built in recent years, one in Ballyconnell and one in Virginia. The 30-bed unit in Ballyconnell is a model for any nursing unit. Great credit is due to the Department and the officials in the health board on designing a nursing home of such a high standard. I appeal to the Minister to ensure the new unit in Virginia is commissioned and equipped at the earliest possible date so we can avail of the 50 places there.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">I do not like to see a lot of unnecessary expenditure on professional fees. The Department or the health board will choose an architectural or design team to plan each individual unit. If we need 30 beds or 50 beds, surely we can have a standard, prototype nursing unit that will cater properly for the needs of the patients and ensure that the best value is obtained from the staff. The same thing happens in the design and planning of schools, with 11% always going on professional fees. I do not know what the level of professional fees is, but I am sure it is quite high. I would like to see those professional fees being put into bricks and mortar and into beds and facilities.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMoynihan" eId="spk_640">
          <from>Mr. M. Moynihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1065">I welcome the opportunity of contributing to tonight's debate. In various communities, especially in County Cork, voluntary associations have come together to build sheltered housing communities consisting of five, ten or 12 houses. This is welcome and should be encouraged to a greater extent. One of the difficulties is that there is a lot of red tape and people are afraid to set up limited companies for these projects. As local GPs will agree, in many community hospitals a certain percentage of people – long-stay patients due to family circumstances and so on – would be better off out in the community if sheltered housing could be built for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">I compliment the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Health and Children on the amount of money they have made available for these schemes. Facilities attached to these include day care centres for the elderly, weekly and daily help services and meals on wheels – run in my own area by the local LEADER group – which provide a hot meal every day for elderly people living on their own. Unfortunately, demographic changes have resulted in the traditional family situation, in which the elderly live with their families, no longer being viable. People are living in very isolated areas, particularly in the countryside, but also in urban communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">When the home help service started out it was underpaid and underfunded and the job was seen as demeaning. Now, however, it is very well paid and I encourage the Minister and the Department  to ensure the service continues. It is a fantastic service, providing care for people in their own homes and communities. The elderly find it useful to have people coming in and out. Those who work in the area have come together to form a professional organisation of carers for the elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">I have listened to the views of Deputies on the other side of the House in relation to disabled person's grants. Over the last three or four years there has been a ferocious amount of red tape in this scheme. One grant I dealt with has gone back and forth five or six times. It was in relation to a new house and new drawings had to be provided for fittings, lighting and so on. When somebody looks at an application form he or she makes a judgment call: this person deserves a grant because the medical evidence is sufficient. I am delighted that there is a review under way. It is to be hoped the system will be streamlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">The people I dealt with when I was involved with the disabled person's essential repairs grants were living in atrocious conditions without heating or proper shelter. I am glad that increases in the grants since 1997 have gone a long way towards making people's basic accommodation better.</p>

          <p eId="para_1072">Raising a child with a disability or chronic illness and caring for his or her needs into adulthood presents many challenges. In recent years, the growth of respite care services has begun to provide families with much-needed temporary relief. I have heard respite care described as "temporary relief from the responsibility of constant care-giving". The birth of a child with a disability or chronic illness, or the discovery that a child has a disability, has a profound effect on a family. When parents learn that their child has a disability or special health care need, they begin a process of continuous lifelong adjustment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">Social and community support can reduce the stress experienced by families. The support of relatives, friends, service providers and the community can help ease the adjustment period, an adjustment which influences all family members. Growing awareness of the effects of this adjustment on families has led to the development of support services for families to assist them through the lifelong adjustment process. Among these family support services, respite care has consistently been identified as a priority need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">While "respite" may be a new word for some people, it is not a new phenomenon. It emerged in the late 1960s with the de-institutionalisation movement. We should ensure that this becomes a reality for the aged and people with learning disabilities. Families with a dependent relative or  a child with a disability or chronic illness know the commitment and intensity of care necessary. That level of dedication and care becomes part of daily life and family routine, but this same commitment can make stress routine too. Parents can become accustomed to having no time for themselves. Respite services are intended to provide assistance to the family and prevent burn-out and family disintegration. Many families find these changes difficult, if not virtually impossible, to handle. Even performing the basic necessities of daily life such as shopping or social interaction can become difficult or virtually impossible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">Caring families are providing such services representing an enormous saving in health expenditure to the State and would be more than willing to continue caring for their disabled relatives if respite care could be made available to them on a regular, guaranteed basis. However, if parents are unable to secure such guaranteed respite care on a regular basis, they may be compelled to seek an alternative, namely, to resort to institutionalising their disabled family member at considerably greater cost to the State. Accordingly, the establishment of a comprehensive system of respite care on a national basis would represent one of the greatest value-for-money programmes, preserving the family unit and supporting family stability.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_644">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1076">I strongly support this motion because it is about people and services, and its tone expresses a caring philosophy. In section 1, I welcome the highlighting of the inadequate provision for our elderly and people with disabilities. This is a disgrace and after seven years of an economic boom, I find it unacceptable. Families urgently need day care and respite places.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">During the general election, I canvassed in areas where elderly people had their doors locked and bolted at 7 p.m. on beautiful summer evenings. They were locked in for the night because of fear. It seemed nobody cared and people were looking the other way. I do not want to live in a society like that and it is time we posed some hard questions. Is this the way we want our society to go and is this the kind of society we want in 2003? If we do not support the motion tonight, that is exactly the way we are going. This is an opportunity to change and to put our money where our mouths are. We must come up with new and creative ideas and proposals to care for our elderly in the community where possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">I strongly support section 3 of the motion which deplores the lengthy waiting lists for disabled person's grants and their current low level, particularly with current construction costs. I wish the Government would come and live in the real world. Let us look at the core issues in this motion – disabled people, carers and their families and those on waiting lists. We can do much about this in the coming years. We can implement a three year plan to deal with the elderly, the dis abled, carers and those on waiting lists, particularly in times of crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">The Government has failed to address these serious issues and is now walking away from its responsibilities. Improving the quality of life for people with disabilities, the elderly, their families and carers is the way forward. I accept that it must be paid for through taxation, but this is where we must make the really tough decisions and begin to create a fairer Ireland. Supporting this motion is a step in that direction and an important one. To vote against this motion is a step backwards and an insult to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">Let us now see the Government use the Office of Public Works's sale of State land to fund services for children and adults with disabilities, real on-the-ground services like day care and respite. I am not talking about creating more jobs for professionals, I am talking about looking after the 344 families in St. Michael's House on waiting lists. Let us remember that some of these people are over 80 years old and some are terminally ill. Let us see some action by the Government. Let us quit the spoof and the spin. I urge everyone to support the motion.</p>

        <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_645">
          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_1081">I am happy to speak on this important motion. It has often been said that we are all getting older, but there has been an explosion of older people and our health services have not been planning towards it properly. In my area, we lack consultants in such areas as orthopaedics and rheumatology, and men have to wait for five years, getting up five times a night, because of the lack of a single urologist.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">The entire health system is geared towards putting people in nursing homes, which is a totally inappropriate treatment of people in old age. Why should people need doctors, nurses and nursing homes? They do not and too often nursing homes are used as a catch-all answer. People are there who should not be there. Even if it cost twice as much, it would be worth keeping people in their own areas, rather than putting them into nursing homes where they do not want to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">In St. Brendan's Village we have continuum support, support at home at the day centre and in low and high support sheltered housing. The guarantee is that no matter how old you are or how disabled, you can stay in your own community. Not alone that, but we are the biggest economic regenerator in our area. We employ 65 people, 24 of whom are working under a CE scheme, and the remainder we employ ourselves, so we give real employment. The problem is that it is difficult to do this, although communities are crying out to do so. I acknowledge that the capital supports are good but the lack of a defined revenue funding scheme means that people are paying ten times more in nursing homes than they would be paying if they were at home in their own community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">We require more developments like St. Brendan's Village because it is about supporting people in their own area which is where they want to be.  A major problem is persuading the local authorities to get on board with these schemes. Local authorities are the agencies to be approached in the first instance, but they must agree that there is a local housing need. The housing plans should be looked at because they are due for a two year review. Let us insert a clause requiring a certain amount of sheltered housing in each area. The future is in supporting people at home in sheltered housing. Too often communities do not get the start they need and land is not available. In this context, there should be an inventory of State land so that it can be provided for communities for this purpose. It is better for the older person to live in and contribute to his or her own community rather than be put in some far-off corner where they are forgotten about and where they do not do as well as they should. We would have a much better society if we could do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">The Government missed a good opportunity in the budget by not introducing a defined revenue funding scheme to support older people at home. Home is where the heart is. All the reports state that people should be supported in their homes for as long as possible but if they cannot be supported at home they should be supported in their communities. Instead of sending people to a catch all nursing home with many people in it that should not be there, this can, if done properly, revitalise the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">Many homeowners who do not need their big houses would love to be part of a sheltered housing project. I know Dublin Corporation is putting in place a project that allows people to go from a bigger house to sheltered housing. This scheme should be extended as it would take the edge off the high cost of land and urban local authorities should keep people in their local area where they will have communal support. This should be more about support than care. Just because someone turns 65 does not mean he or she should lose their independence or the right to close one's door on the world when one has had enough of it. It is possible to do this in sheltered housing projects.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_1087">In the many debates we have had in this Dáil on the subject of carers and those living with disabilities, I have been struck by those who look on from the Gallery. I have seen faces that are long, drawn and tired. I have seen faces that expressed fear mixed with hope and frustrated expectations. My fear is we are subjecting people to a sea of platitudes if at the end of debates such as this there is not an adequate Government response evidenced by real changes in policy and the provision of necessary resources. I fear this will not be met tonight but I am hopeful the Opposition parties can prick the Government's conscience.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">We must make a decision between those whose care needs are total, such as those who need full-time home support and care or additional medical resources, and those who aspire to independent living. Health boards often take a patronising attitude towards those who live with a disability yet  want to fend for themselves by using available resources. For example, the British Parliament passed a Community Care (Direct Payments) Act in 1996. This Act made the disabled person the purchaser of his or her care needs. Why do we not have a similarly imaginative response? Instead, we have a patchwork system. The community employment system is supposed to deal with labour market problems. An army of people was created and met some needs in the area of care provision but it was withdrawn at a stroke and there was no alternative plan as to how these needs were to be met in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">The Government has a responsibility to put in place a proper social service network for people who want to meet their own needs. This can be done either by providing direct resources or using an adaptation of the home help or community employment systems. The ERHA is running an innovative project in this area and it should be applied nationwide. The Government has been too slow in adapting to the needs of people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">Current Government policy, and social services in general, depend far too much on the voluntary principle, whether it is charitable, voluntary or community organisations or the goodwill of a person in the family unit. In every other country that considers itself developed these services are provided by the State. Until we properly reward those who give their services voluntarily and put in place a State infrastructure to provide these services, debates such as these will happen on an all too regular basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_1091">The section dealing with older people in An Agreed Programme for Government states: "One of our core objectives will be to help all older people to live in the dignity which their immense contribution to the development of the country deserves". In the section dealing with disability and caring the programme states: "We are committed to building service provision and legislative frameworks which enable people with disabilities to fulfil their potential and make full contribution to the economic and social life of our country."  Since taking office last June, the Government has done little to further these admirable objectives and has shown little commitment to resourcing these marginalised groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">The advances made by people with disabilities and the elderly in the past decade are now in danger of being ruined by the fiscal policies the Government is pursuing. This must prompt conscientious voices into action. It must be recognised that in sectors such as this and others the tremendous opportunities arising from the past five years of unprecedented affluence were not used to maximise social benefit. As a result, people with disabilities and the elderly are still among the foremost of those experiencing social exclusion. Over half of those households headed by a person with a disability or a long-term illness  is living in what is regarded as relative income poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">I call on the Government to support people with disabilities and the elderly, both through proper funding and, more importantly, the introduction of rights based legislation. In the words of the Disability Federation of Ireland, "The foundation stone of equal citizenship for people with disabilities is rights-based legislation."  This can equally apply to the elderly. The State must recognise, in principle and practice, the right of people with disabilities to live independently. The system of payment, supports and services for people with disabilities must be suitably adapted for this purpose and an independent living fund must be established.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">The State needs to invest in the construction of suitable sheltered accommodation, incorporating support services, for older people and people with disabilities. This would accommodate the desire of many of these people whose ambition is to live independently. Many older people would prefer to continue living in their own homes. As elected representatives, we all know of many people who fit into these categories. They are unable to do this because the necessary supports that would allow people to live independently are not available. Day care centres can play an important role in supporting elderly people by allowing them to live in their own homes for longer. Such centres need to be adequately resourced to facilitate them in playing an increased role in the provision of social and health care services for older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">We must recognise that even people with a reasonable income have great difficulty in meeting the cost of long-term residential care. It is a huge burden on the individual and the family and demands significant commitment from the offspring of the older person or persons. In some instances, people are supporting two parents in long-term residential care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">Subvention in respect of nursing home care must be significantly increased and, most importantly, linked to inflation. It should not be the case that every time a Government argues for a tightening of the screw, the weakest links in society in terms of dependence should suffer most. If we do not prepare for the needs of people with disability and the elderly, and we will all be elderly some day, we are sowing the seeds for our own old age.</p>

          <p eId="para_1099">The Government's response last night to this motion on inadequate services for the disabled was one of arrogance and denial. I have never before heard anything like it in this House. I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy  Callely, is present because he was one of the chief culprits where arrogance is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">The Minister for Health and Children tried to face down and ignore the genuine cases of hardship endured by the elderly as a result of drastic cutbacks, particularly in the disabled person's grant, the essential repairs grant and housing for the elderly. What is most disturbing, and it is something I have not seen in this Parliament in recent years, is the harsh and uncaring attitude on the part of Ministers and Ministers of State. Every night they glibly say that, as far as they are concerned, they have put more money into this service than any previous Government. That response is an insult to every disabled person, the elderly, every person with a mental or physical handicap and, above all, every carer in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">No Government in the State's history had the amount of money at its disposal that this Government had. Anything the disabled received was richly deserved and the Minister cannot take credit for it. What makes the disabled and the handicapped white with anger is the fact that the Government, and particularly Fianna Fáil, promised that if it was returned to power in the election last May, there would be a continuation of that type of investment. The Minister of State and his party knew that this amount of money was not available but they clinically and cunningly contrived to con the most vulnerable people in society. That will come back to haunt the Government. There is a huge depth of feeling among the public about what this Government has done to the handicapped.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">The litmus test is whether people are waiting longer today for a disabled person's grant than they were two years ago. A 75 year old person, living alone in north Galway, recently developed Parkinson's disease. He lodged an application with Galway County Council for approval for a disabled person's grant. If that application had been lodged a year ago, he would have the grant today. Now, however, he is likely to wait three years for it. When one is 75 years old and suffers from Parkinson's disease, which is getting progressively worse, it is a long time to wait. All he is seeking is to change the bath in his bathroom to a walk in shower.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_1105">I am sorry the Minister for Health and Children is not present. He seems to be treating this debate with contempt. However, I welcome the Minister of State. I wish to refer to what is happening in the Western Health Board, the area with which I am most familiar.  This matter is so serious that I intend to communicate directly with the Minister about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">In July 2002, a deficit of €16.6 million in the Western Health Board was reported. However, at the end of the year, a surplus of over €8 million was not spent. How did the Western Health Board arrive at that position? It did so by cutting back. It cut back the mental health and older people's budget by over €4 million, it underspent the community care budget by over €2 million in that time and it had €17 million accumulated in the corporate contingency fund. The €17 million saved was money that was taken from all the programmes in the health board, including the community care, mental health and older people's programmes and the housing grants for the elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">What type of accountancy system is there in the Western Health Board that it could not even get the cutbacks right? At the end of six months it underspent by €8 million. It was not for the want of staff. There was a phenomenal increase in the number of staff in the Western Health Board over the past two and a half years. In January 2000, for example, the personnel and human resources section of the health board had a staff of 30, in June 2002 it had a staff of 70. The number of staff in the finance department in 2000 was 56 and in June 2002 it was 64. The chief executive officer's office had a staff of six in January 2000 and in June 2002 it had 14. With all the extra staff in finance, management and the chief executive officer's office, it could not even get the budget right.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">The health board robbed the services of €24 million in six months. In the meantime a disabled person seeking a walking aid or a wheelchair was told they would have to continue to suffer because the health board had no money. One could not get respite care for an elderly relative or a few hours of home help. Parents looking after a mentally or physically handicapped or disadvantaged child or young adult were told there was no money for respite or residential care. The parents are exhausted and at their wits' end trying to give full-time care and attention to their loved ones. Old people seeking a grant to repair a leaking roof or to replace rotten windows under the housing aid for the elderly scheme were told there was no money, the repairs were not considered essential and that they must continue to suffer. The Western Health Board housing staff were forced to work under extreme pressure with management telling them that applications must be stalled, refused or not heard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">The same thing is happening this year. The allocation to the Western Health Board for housing repair grants is €2.53 million. Of that, €0.5 million is for grants for last year. Of the remaining €2 million, only €1 million is being allocated to housing repairs for the elderly. The other €1 million is being put into the contingency fund to balance the books at the end of the year, at a cost to the people waiting for repairs to their houses. The Minister for the Environment and Local  Government and the Minister for Health and Children must wake up to the reality that the support schemes for the elderly and the disadvantaged are in a shambles in the Western Health Board area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">The Minister of State should investigate what is happening. Is the Minister aware of what is happening in the health boards? It is a book balancing exercise. All the energies of the health boards' staff are being directed the wrong way. They are being directed to saving money rather than allocating it and spending it in the areas for which it is provided. I will communicate directly with the Minister. I will not let this matter rest. What is happening in the Western Health Board, the one with which I am most familiar, is a scandal.</p>

          <p eId="para_1111">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. The Minister, in the amendment, asks the Dáil to acknowledge the significant improvement to the terms, conditions and financing of the disabled person's grant and the essential repairs grant in recent years. The grants are in a shambles. I will first deal with the special housing aid for the elderly scheme. There is a waiting list in my health board area of three to four years. We are told the most urgent and needy cases are being met but we are unsure of what that means.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">I will give some examples of what is happening. In May 2001, an application was made for windows and doors for an elderly person's house because the existing ones were falling out. That matter is still with the environmental health officer. In October 2001, there was a case of an elderly woman living alone who had to cross a yard to reach an outside toilet. When she suffered a stroke she requested the installation of an inside toilet under the special housing aid for the elderly scheme, but that matter is still with the environmental health officer almost 18 months later.</p>

        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_656">
          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_1114">The health board says it is only dealing with emergency categories, so the scheme is a shambles. Last year 1,704 people were on the waiting list for special housing aid for the elderly, 1,385 of whom were in the Mid-Western Health Board area. Those figures are disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">A total of 22 local authorities are having trouble operating the disabled person's grant which has either been disbanded or is being re-examined. Those numbers are growing daily and, consequently, the disabled person's grant is in a shambles. The sooner both schemes – special housing aid for the elderly and the disabled person's grant – are dealt with the better. They should be rationalised into one system with the necessary funding. The Minister can undertake all the rejigging he likes but if sufficient funding is not made available to undertake the work, any  reorganisation is useless and only amounts to a whitewash.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">In 2001, 28,705 patients were readmitted to hospital within one week of being discharged. Hospital consultants are coming under unbearable pressure to discharge patients early to make room for others coming through the accident and emergency units. Most of those discharged early were elderly people who then had to be readmitted. The disgraceful early discharge system represents a false saving and puts pressure and stress on elderly people who have to be readmitted to hospital later.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">Yesterday and today, we have received a history lesson from Ministers concerning 1987, but we have been told nothing about what will happen in the future. Since the Minister of State has raised this issue, let me deal with some aspects of previous Administrations. In 1996, a report entitled Towards an Independent Future was published dealing with the needs of people with physical and sensory disabilities. The report stated that there was a lack of comprehensive data on the number of services needed, yet the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government failed to deal with that aspect of the report and others, including inadequate access to information on service provision; disparities in eligibility criteria between and within health board areas; uncertain funding of voluntary organisations; shortfalls in therapy, day-care and home support services; uneven geographic distribution of services; inadequate transport services; inadequate co-ordination of services, which should be dealt with as a matter of urgency; and poor consumer choice for those with physical and sensory disabilities. The Government has failed in all these areas. That is our history lesson to the Minister of State who should not trot out statements about what happened during the previous Government's five years in office.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">The lack of housing and personal assistants for people with physical and sensory disabilities takes a huge toll on their quality of life. The centre for independent living's latest assessment of needs reveals a waiting list of 370 clients in need of personal assistants. This is a total of 17,648 hours of services which are not being provided. The Government's amendment is a sham and a miserable failure in that it does not deal with the issue at hand.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanRyan" eId="spk_657">
          <from>Mr. S. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_1119">I thank the Fine Gael Party for affording me the opportunity to make this brief contribution to the debate. Last week, I spoke in the House about carers and I outlined the lack of recognition, services and supports for their caring role which reflects to a significant degree on the elderly's quality of life. In this debate I wish to highlight shortcomings in the provision of suitable housing and appropriate housing grants for the elderly. Old people throughout the country are living in sub-standard accommodation, including vested cottages. For example, I am  aware of a couple living on a basic income from old age pensions who currently have three containers to collect water that is seeping through their roof. The roof urgently needs replacement before it falls in. Other elderly people huddle together before open fires in draughty houses which require new doors and windows. They are at risk of contracting hypothermia. Other people have no indoor toilets or bathrooms. The Minister of State must agree that is no quality of life for people who have made a significant contribution to the country over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">I wish to refer in particular to the special housing needs scheme operated by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The Department admits that Ireland has thousands of relatively poor older people, often living alone, whose houses and flats are so cold they many die prematurely. Thousands of others struggle on in discomfort and distress. This report was brought before the Minister back in 2000, yet the situation has not improved in the interim.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">Various schemes for housing maintenance and repair, such as the disabled person's grant, essential repair grants, special housing aids for the elderly and the eastern community works programme in the Dublin area have major shortcomings apart from lack of funding. A house improvement grant scheme geared towards the elderly, with a clawback mechanism, is urgently required. The Minister's advisers may ask how such a scheme can be afforded, but why not? It is a matter of choice that has to be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">Was it not the Government, particularly the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, who showed total recklessness when introducing the SSIA scheme? The Minister totally ignored his departmental advisers who warned that the cost of the scheme would be hugely expensive. The Minister deliberately understated the suggested cost, saying it would only be €127 million per year. In recent replies to parliamentary questions I have been informed that the cost of the SSIA scheme has now risen to €535 million a year, which comes to €2.6 billion over a five-year period. It does not end there either because some people will have an opportunity of making further contributions to the scheme, which could bring the total cost to the State to over €4 billion. Ministers could do much to improve the quality of life for elderly people with such resources, but the choices made by the Government do not reflect people's priority needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">Over the past two days, contributors to this debate have spelled out the reality which is that elderly people are living in deplorable conditions. The House must state clearly that the Government has failed. It is time to stand up and be counted on this issue. The Government has failed to look after the elderly and provide for their needs.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_1124">I am pleased to have the opportunity to debate the needs of older  people and people with disabilities, which was discussed last night and tonight. Because of my long association with the eastern regional health services, I have intimate knowledge of the needs of these groups and have visited most of the facilities available. I salute and pay tribute to all those involved in the provision and delivery of services to such groups. When I was Chairman and member of the health board, I played an active role in the planning and opening of a number of new modern community nursing units.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">We have heard the two sides of this debate, areas that warrant more improvements and details of the considerable progress made over the past five years in the provision of services. It will be my job, in these more difficult times, to address the areas that warrant more improvements and to keep as much as possible of that great progress going over the next number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">I am known to hold strong views on issues of principle. I strongly believe supporting older people must be a core priority of the Government. Ireland is a small country that has achieved success beyond measure and certainly beyond the expected capacity of a nation of our size. Through the efforts of previous generations, the economy and our quality of life is at the healthy level we enjoy today. Our success has been truly built on the shoulders of giants. They cared for us, now it is our time to care for them. As stated in the programme for Government, we intend to care and help all older people to live in dignity, which their full measured contribution to the development of our country deserves. I am determined to see a society where older people can live in dignity and care is provided whenever needed. I also want to acknowledge the extraordinary contribution that some older people continue to make to society, the development of an active and fulfilled third age has long been reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">The health strategy sets out the following actions and targets for older people: development of a co-ordinated action plan to meet the needs of ageing and older people; funding of community groups to facilitate volunteers in providing support services; implementation of an action plan for dementia; clarification of eligibility versus entitlement to services; review of the nursing home subvention scheme; consideration of the financing of long-term care; introduction of an integrated approach to care planning for individuals; and establishment of regional advisory panels in all health board areas for older consumers and their carers to provide them with a voice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">I want to see an increased number of day care centres, additional assessment and rehabilitation beds, additional day hospital beds, additional nursing-care beds, including for long-term, convalescent and respite patients. I am pleased to say that work has commenced to achieve progress on implementing most of these targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">I have long felt that there has been a need for greater co-ordination between various Depart ments in the provision of services for older people. Therefore, immediately after my appointment to office, I set up, and now chair, an inter-departmental group on the needs of older people. This group provides the opportunity for a positive influence to be brought on all services provided. The group is taking a cross-cutting approach to its work, with members speaking with authority and having influence on their Department's policy on services for older people. The group's initial focus has been on what is being done at present, with a view to having better co-ordination and integration between Departments and the various agencies in those areas.</p>

          <p eId="para_1143">I compliment Deputies Olivia Mitchell and Allen on tabling this motion and all those who contributed to it. It is hard to believe when one lives in a modern democracy that the major Opposition party would have to table two parliamentary motions in a year to address the dire circumstances in which large sections of Irish people are living, but thanks to the Government, these men and women are not living at all. As my colleagues have clearly outlined, these people are merely existing, many of them, their carer and families, hanging on by the slimmest of threads.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">The reality of disability does not confine itself to only one person, it extends to people's husbands, wives, children, parents and siblings. Ask anyone facing the gross incapacitation caused by chronic, progressive MS, ask any man or woman dealing with the creeping, but certain, paralysis caused by motor neurone disease and they will tell one about it if they can. Ask Minister, if you dare.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">It is clear that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, what one might call another willing coalition, are presiding over a sort of survival of the fittest society. The message of the action and the attitude of this Government could not be clearer: properly functioning bodies, good; poorly functioning bodies, bad. That may be graphic, but that is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">What is altogether more galling is that this official attitude prevails in the European Year of People with disabilities, the year when Ireland claims to be so proud to host the Special Olympics, which we are. "Be happy for me" is their motto. As a citizen and a politician, I cannot poss ibly be happy for people who, whether by virtue of physical, intellectual or other disability, are daily deliberately and systematically denied not only their basic civil rights but in too many instances their very human rights, especially the right to live with dignity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">Try cooking a meal for children and putting them to bed at night in one's dream home complete with a 25 year mortgage when that dream becomes a nightmare when a young mother of 35 years of age develops progressive MS, or try to negotiate the steps to one's modified house or to go upstairs to take a shower in one's modified bathroom when both one's legs have been amputated because of the complications of diabetes. That is what some in the Government call "dignity" and what the Government calls "looking after all the children equally". In the Government's book that may be so because despite the fact that the Minister of State referred to a pilot scheme for the DPG, how else can one explain its descent into chaos, an 8% cut in the budget and no new services planned for this year? We might have details of the pilot scheme and there may be the possibility of it being extended nationwide, if it a success.</p>

          <p eId="para_1149">It is deplorable that in any modern democracy people should have to exist like this. It is entirely unacceptable that in 2003 people with disabilities who need to make their homes, the places where they live, accessible to them, are entitled to recoup only 60% of the cost of so doing. Surely they deserve to be treated better than this. People with disabilities are among our poorest and most disadvantaged. The unemployment rate in this most fragile sector of society is 70%. In that case how could they possibly afford to shell out large sums to modify their homes? The ability to use the bathroom on one's own in one's own home is surely a human right in this day and age. In a broader context, where personal assistance is required, as was referred to by many speakers, its provision should not be debated; it should be provided without issue. I have already espoused a non-means tested cost of care and disability allowance. Perhaps the Government will address that and publish its proposals as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">On the BBC the other night there was a shocking account of the AIDS epidemic sweeping parts of Africa. The people of Swaziland in particular are being annihilated. To camera, the Government man blamed the health official for the treatment crisis. The king of the region was interviewed and outlined the urgent and shocking nature of the position. However, he has just bought a €30 million jet, twice the health budget for his people. If one wanted to be clever about this, one could say there is a certain resonance in that this week in Ireland. For better or worse, the Minister for Health and Children has been blamed as being the Government man and he  compounded that by saying on "Morning Ireland" that he is not a hospital manager. Full marks to him for that. He is not, he is the Minister for Health and Children, the man with whom the buck stops in this case. While the health service disintegrates with spectacular certainty, another one of his colleagues has been mandated to buy another Government jet, perhaps at the same price as the jet of the king of Swaziland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">Everything of which my party colleagues have spoken is symptomatic of the deep malaise at the heart of Ireland's health "disservice". Those in Government appear to have neither the wit nor the will to do anything radical about it. They no longer have the famous X ingredient, the cure for all the nation's ills over the past five years – money. The country and economy of which the Government took control in 1997 was in sound shape. The nation's legacy became a potential panacea for the Government's gross mismanagement and disconnection from the concept of real reform. The Government has wasted millions of the people's money by throwing it at a system that the Government's consultants said was unable to absorb it. The Government knew that in hiring 30,000 people to work in health, only 6,150 would be employed as front-line medical personnel. I have nothing against those employed in administration, but perhaps we should be told why the ratio is 4:1 or 5:1. Perhaps the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, will explain how the intellectually penetrating analysis came up with that one.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">The Taoiseach says there is no crisis in the health service while the national health strategy is in tatters. Hospital waiting lists have increased – in St. Vincent's nearby they have increased by 108% – BreastCheck is available in only three health regions, and the medical card system is in dire need of reform. Need I go on?</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">Last night the Minister for Health and Children told the House: "No Government, across all Departments, had a record like that of the present Government."  He went on to say: "No Government since the foundation of the State has a record equal to that of the present Government."  When it comes to health and disability, one can only say "Amen" to that.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidStanton" eId="spk_674">
          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_1154">We should not be debating this issue, especially this year, the European Year of People with Disabilities. I am concerned when I hear Ministers and Ministers of State saying they will do their best to maintain services in the current dire economic circumstances. Many speakers on all sides except the Government pointed out the problems and human issues involving ordinary people, citizens of the State who are suffering. I hope the debate will alert those in authority, the Minister and his officials, to re-examine the lack of services, which is extremely serious.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155">The people involved should have these services as of right and not by grace or favour. The services should be ring-fenced and made available. There is too much red tape and too many appli cation forms to be filled out. I will hold the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, to account and hope that what he said will happen in a few months will come to pass and that the red tape will disappear.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156">The Minister for Health and Children is under pressure because the health service is crumbling. The man is ageing as we look at him. There was a vibrant economy when the Government took over in 1997 and it rode that wave for a few years. Six years later, we have cuts in spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">I tried a year ago to find out how many chronically sick young people there were in the State. The Minister said I would receive a reply as a matter of urgency. I received it one year later after tabling the question another three times. As a medical practitioner, the Ceann Comhairle will understand what is meant by "chronically sick young people". There are 914 such people awaiting beds. Many health boards have no provision in this regard. I checked this with some public health workers and they told me that these figures are an underestimation of the reality. It is worse than the reply suggests.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">It took a year for these figures to be produced. That shows the Minister does not know what is happening and is not aware of the need. If he does not know that, how can he plan for it? We know that the database for physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities that is being worked on has run into difficulties. Perhaps the Minister will check that out. We know that funding for 2002 for physical and sensory disability has not come through. What are we playing at? Who are we codding? Real people are involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159">The mainstreaming of community employment services was also supposed to take place. No money has been allocated to health boards in 2003 for mainstreaming CE schemes and no health services provided by CE workers services have been mainstreamed to date. This is a serious issue for people and perhaps the Minister will, as a result of this debate, kick some butt somewhere and have this remedied. People will lose their personal assistants and care workers in a few weeks' time and cannot have them replaced. This is serious for such people who depend on their assistants to help them get up, get dressed and have their breakfast, and without whom they would not otherwise be able to do these tasks. People were promised that more than 2,000 such assistants would be mainstreamed. Deputy Ring was told this 12 months ago, but nothing has happened and there is no plan for this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1160">Political decisions are being made. A new Government jet is being bought and hundreds of millions were spent on the Bertie Bowl which will never be built. It was little more than an ego trip. The people in real need are being marginalised, sidelined and forgotten because Fianna Fáil has decided there are no votes in that constituency. I am convinced that is the reason. If there were votes, Fianna Fáil would be singing a different tune. We have descended to this cynical level where the party's spin doctors public relations merchants and advisory and focus groups have  decided that there are no votes in disability, as a result of which these people are marginalised, hidden, silent and forgotten and the Government makes spending cuts in this area. They are not forgotten on this side of the House. We will hold the Government to account on behalf of the people who have no voice, despite the fact that the systems of the House try to silence us at every turn.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161">I thank everyone who contributed to this important debate. Among the matters brought to our attention was that the home help agreement element of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has not been paid since April 2001 to the Irish Wheelchair Association in five health board areas. This amounts to €2.5 million. We could keep going on about things that are not happening but should be. Why are they not happening? The Minister should take note of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162">The Minister of State with responsibility for the disabled person's grant was here last night. He ran out of the House afterwards in shock and has not appeared tonight. He said everything was fine, but if he read the newspapers today he  would see that many of the health boards have stopped paying and suspended the schemes. Maybe some of the PR merchants in the Department should be asked to look at this. Perhaps they are too busy admiring pictures of the Ministers and getting those pictures in the newspapers. Instead of really looking at the issues, the Minister is spending money on PR and spin. He should phone the health boards to find out what is really happening on the ground. He does not need a review for that. He should go to the health board offices and ask for the files to find out why people are waiting and why grants are being suspended.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163">The Minister is smiling at me and thinking I am just making a speech. However, these are serious issues that have to be addressed. We call on people from all sides of the House to support the motion. I know many Government backbenchers who spoke in this debate are muzzled because of the party Whip. They are afraid to criticise their Minister in public, but perhaps some of them will talk to the Minister in private and tell him what is the real issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164">I commend the motion to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusKirk" eId="spk_675">
          <from>Mr. Kirk</from>
          <p eId="para_1175">I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this subject. As you may know, Lissadell Towels, the textile industry, is located on the county boundary between Monaghan and Louth. Unfortunately, as we know from other experiences, the textile sector has encountered very difficult trading conditions over recent years and there has been a gradual decline of the industry generally with its movement to other locations where costs are less expensive and there are more numerous personnel to work in the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176">Lissadell Towels has been in operation for quite a number of years. In the Ardee area there has been a tradition of working in the textile sector. There are many people employed in Lissadell Towels who have not worked anywhere other than this company. They went into it directly from school and they now find themselves facing the prospect of being made redundant with no alternative employment available locally. It will be extremely difficult for many of them to find alternative employment. Some may be able to avail of the retraining opportunities which I hope FÁS will consider putting in place for the staff but the prospects are grim for the approximately 70 people who are employed in the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is contemplating the possibility of increasing the level of redundancy payments to people who will be made redundant as and from a particular date. Apparently that has to be done by way of legislation rather than change in regulations but we do not know when that legislation will be introduced. As one can imagine, that is of paramount importance as far as the staff of Lissadell Towels are concerned. They are more than anxious to know when the legislation will be brought before the House because the date they will be made redundant will be relevant to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178">I ask the Minister of State to take the opportunity to elaborate on this issue and perhaps brighten the prospects for those who are facing redundancy in Lissadell Towels.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_676">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1179">I thank Deputy Kirk for raising this matter on the Adjournment. Lissadell Towels Ltd is part of Enterprise Ireland's portfolio of companies. Due to a significant decline in its business activity, which is mainly as a supplier to the international hotel bedroom and bathroom market, the company has been in discussion with its staff and union representatives regarding redundancies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180">On 30 January 2003, the company appointed an interim examiner to assess the future prospects of the company. Also on that day, a petition pursuant to the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990 was presented to the Central Office of the High Court by the directors of the company. This was directed to be heard at the High Court on 17 February 2003. At the hearing on 17 February, the court appointed an examiner. The examiner has  21 days to complete his report and, accordingly, his report is due in the week ending 8 March 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181">The likely outcome of the process is that the company will cease to be a manufacturing company but will continue as a supplier. The company is continuing to trade pending the report of the examiner. The reasons for the difficulties all relate to competitiveness issues. Currently, 60 people are employed but this figure will reduce if manufacturing ceases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182">The severance package for employees who are made redundant is composed of two elements – statutory redundancy, in respect of which the social insurance fund pays a 60% rebate to the employer, and <i>ex gratia</i> redundancy. The latter is a matter for negotiation between the employer and the employees or a trade union acting on their behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183">With regard to statutory redundancy, the position is that in April 2002 the Government established a review group, in the context of the social partnership, to examine the operation of the redundancy payments scheme so as to ensure that the scheme best meets the requirements of employers and employees. The review group consisted of representatives of the social partners, IBEC, CIF, ICTU and the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Social and Family Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The chair and secretariat were provided by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184">The review group, which reported back to the Tánaiste and Government in October, agreed a range of changes to the redundancy scheme, including a simpler method for calculating service, changes in the treatment of absences from work, treatment of service abroad, simplification of application forms and a new IT system, including an e-Government aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">The group did not reach consensus on issues such as an increase in the level of statutory redundancy payments and size of rebate to employers. The draft partnership agreement endorses the changes agreed by the redundancy review group and provides, in addition, that the distinction between service under and over 41 years will be removed; there will be two weeks pay for every year of service; the bonus week will be retained; and the rebate of 60% to the employer retained.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">On 18 February 2003 the Government approved the drafting of a Bill on a priority basis to give effect to the new enhanced redundancy payments scheme. The Bill has since been sent to the parliamentary counsel for drafting. Following ratification of the new partnership agreement it is the Tánaiste's intention to bring the increased statutory payments into effect at the earliest possible date.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187">A new IT system will be required to implement the full range of changes and it is estimated that this process could take approximately 18 months from start to finish. However, a relatively minor  modification can be made to the present computer system which enables the enhanced statutory entitlements of employees and other improvements to be brought into effect soon after the proposed Bill is enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">The heads of the Bill provide for the remaining changes to be introduced by ministerial order, when the new IT system is available, projected for the second half of 2004. Pending the enactment of the new legislation, the existing statutory redundancy terms remain operative. Backdating is not possible because the redundancy scheme places obligations on employers and confers rights on employees. The legal advice from the Attorney General's office is that obligations, such as increased statutory redundancy, cannot be assigned to employers retrospectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">When the improved statutory redundancy payments come into operation it is estimated that a full year's cost of payments to the social insurance fund based on the 2002 level of redundancy will be in the region of €149 million. This is an increase of €96 million in the annual cost to bring the new enhanced rates into effect.</p>

          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_1190">Over the past two decades we in Coolock, in the heart of Dublin's northside, have developed a large community campus of buildings to bring services from the centre to the people of the northside. The project began almost two decades ago in one of the old schools in the area. Since then we have built a number of enterprise centres, facilities for St. Michael's House, crèches and child care centres, including the famous An Doras Buí, and helped a wide range of other community groups, including our local radio station, North East Access Radio.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">The culmination of this work was the plan which began with close negotiations with the Civil Service through the strategic management initiative to establish civic offices at Coolock for the outer northside. The offices would specifically serve the Dublin North-East and Dublin North-Central constituencies. Over four years ago negotiations began and we now have a magnificent new building, with 2,717 square metres of space, which is about to be opened – I invite the Minister of State to visit in the coming weeks. I congratulate all the players who got the project this far, including the Office of Public Works, Dublin City Council, Northside Partnership, Coolock Development Council, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, the Citizens Information Service and the Coolock Community Law Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192">The Minister of State will be aware that a problem has arisen due to the very high rents being charged to the community groups and I declare an interest in that I am a long time director of the Northside Partnership. Approximately 40% of the centre will be taken up by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which is moving the main employment exchange for the area to Coolock, but some other groups are facing major  rents. Most accept there will be service charges and other ongoing costs but the Northside Partnership and the local employment service, for example, face a total bill of €54,000 per annum. North East Access Radio faces a bill of approximately €38,000 per annum and the Coolock Law Centre faces a bill of €44,000 per annum. These rents include service charges and perhaps some of the capital fitting out costs. Voluntary bodies will face major fundraising efforts. The money advice and budgeting service faces a similarly high rent bill, as does the Citizens Information Centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193">These bodies are often directed by volunteers – although they may have professional staff, much of the fundraising and organisation is purely voluntary. Everyone recognises the need for service charges as the building on Bunratty Road must be well maintained and remain an asset to the area. However, we do not understand why hard-pressed voluntary groups should have to stump up huge amounts in rent year after year. The Department of Social and Family Affairs is the key as it is the mother Department for MABS, Comhairle and the CIC, yet it is not paying rent. The burden seems to be falling on the voluntary bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194">The Taoiseach asked us to respond vigorously to the White Paper on Voluntary Activity. At one stage he echoed contributions from all sides of the House in saying we should try to encourage volunteers at every turn and voluntary committees like this try to supervise our professional organisations on a voluntary basis. However, if we must spend endless amounts of time fundraising it will distract us from what we do best, attracting jobs to the north side. I urge the Minister of State to look at this again and to deal sympathetically with these hard-pressed community bodies.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_1195">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. In 1999 the Department of Social and Family Affairs secured the sanction of the Department of Finance to relocate its Gardiner Street office to the Coolock area. A site suitable for the Department of Social and Family Affairs was identified at Bunratty Road, Coolock, which was owned by Dublin City Council. The council agreed to sell the site to Office of Public Works provided any development would include accommodation for various voluntary groups in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196">It was always understood that the voluntary groups would pay rent for the accommodation provided. Construction works commenced in August 2002 with a view to supplying sufficient accommodation to house the following groups from the State sector: the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the probation and welfare service, FÁS, family mediation services, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and Dublin City Council services. Community groups to be  accommodated included the Northside Citizens Information Centre, the Northside Partnership, the money advice and budgeting services, the Coolock Community Law Centre, local employment services and Near FM.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197">In effect, the building was planned as a civic centre for the north side which would facilitate the delivery of integrated services to the local community. The building, construction of which is being overseen by the project management services of Office of Public Works, is due to be ready for occupation in the first quarter of 2003. When completed the building will be State-owned and will incorporate a crèche and café. The project is estimated to cost in the region of €15.62 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198">At the outset, the community-voluntary sector confirmed that it was willing to pay reasonable rent for its accommodation in the proposed civic centre. The rent has been set at €15 per sq. ft. Bearing in mind both the cost and high quality of the accommodation, the rent is not unreasonable and is well below present day market rents for similar type accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199">A facilities management company will be put in place to look after the day-to-day upkeep and maintenance of the centre. This will be funded by means of a service charge billed to each of the occupants on a <i>pro rata</i> basis. The Office of Public Works is aware that some of the voluntary sector groups are having difficulty funding the rental costs in the new centre. However, it is important to note that the primary remit of the Office of Public Works is to provide accommodation for Departments and offices. It is not the Office of Public Works's role to fund voluntary organisation, whether directly or indirectly. If additional funding is required by any of the voluntary groups to meet their rental costs, they should direct their requests for assistance to the appropriate authorities, that is, the bodies or organisations that sponsor them or provide them with funding.</p>

        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_679">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_1201">I welcome the opportunity to address this important issue. Recently I was approached by the board of management of Scoil Naomh Pádraig in Corracrin about an application it had made four years ago for a grant to extend the school. The application was made in conjunction with the planning officials in Monaghan County Council. They discussed the issue with teachers in the school to decide how to cater for the increase in numbers in the school in years to come. The decision to apply for the grant reflected the policy of the county council because it had granted planning permission for the Emyvale area council housing schemes. In Emyvale, 18 new houses will be ready at the end of May and in two years, another 26 houses will be built in the area. Private dwellings will also be built in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202">In the last census we saw an increase of 17% in the population of Emyvale. A village that is  thriving is a rare phenomenon in a rural area. The community is moving up and we should help them. Good schools and infrastructure are necessary if the local community is to thrive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203">The board of management felt that it had been promised by the Department in March that the extension would soon be under way. Plans were at the pre-tender stage and the board was informed that building would be under way by now. Board members feel badly let down. They understand it will be a further three years before the situation is re-examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">The board of management believes there are many things acting in favour of the school. It has a site that it will be able to develop and there is no need to purchase land. There is a good transport network to bring children to school and the community is growing. The extension is at pre-tender stage so the board feels it will only take some gentle persuasion to get building under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">The school has over 200 pupils, nine of whom are non-national and three of whom have special needs. It has a much needed pre-school facility. If the extension is not built, the principal believes he will have no alternative but to put as many as 44 children into one classroom. That is not conducive to a good learning environment. I ask the Minister for Education to bring forward the programme and go ahead with the building. It is much needed and would be appreciated by the students in Scoil Naomh Pádraig and their parents.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" eId="spk_680">
          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_1206">I am glad that the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline to the House, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, the Department's current position regarding the allocation of funding for school building projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207">The 2003 capital programme has now been published and full details in relation to individual projects are available on the Department's website at www.education.ie. The programme is designed to give the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students. The criteria used for selecting projects have also been published for the first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1208">This year's building programme amounts to €342.9 million, four times the amount allocated in 1997. The 2003 programme will deliver over 140 large scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition, more than 400 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme and all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209">The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on projects at schools currently in architectural planning, including Scoil Naomh Pádraig, Corracrin. The management authorities at individual schools should continue to use funds from their devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety matters.</p>

        <heading>Dublin Port Tunnel.</heading>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_681">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_1210">This is the third occasion that there has been a problem with work on the Dublin Port Tunnel. On the last occasion, subsidence led to the closing down of the railway line. I raised my concerns then and was told that sensitive electronic monitors and resistivity surveys were being used. Reassurance was offered that this was an unusual and exceptional occurrence that would not happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211">Once again, however, work has had to be stopped. This time support beams have collapsed. It would seem to indicate a fundamental design flaw if beams that are supposed to be strong enough to support excavation have failed. There must have been a miscalculation by engineers regarding the support needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">Subsidence is once again occurring under the rail line. A full explanation was not given for what happened the first time this occurred. The public are looking for reassurance that the design is robust and that these all too frequent failures are not caused by poor design or workmanship. We want independent reassurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213">The Minister will say that there is an independent team of consultant engineers employed by Iarnród Éireann but it is part of the consulting group and locally there is a desire for an independent inspection to ensure conditions and design features are maintained to the highest possible standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214">There is continuing concern about tunnelling under houses that will take place. Hearing that beams are buckling and failing does not offer people great reassurance when the tunnel will pass under their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215">Will the Minister explain these occurrences and give an indication that an independent review will give public assurance that the design systems are robust and the work is being conducted in accordance with the specified design?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesMcDaid" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport" eId="spk_682">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Dr. McDaid)</from>
          <p eId="para_1216">The Dublin Port Tunnel is the largest road tunnel project ever undertaken in the history of the State. On completion, it will transform access to Dublin Port, providing a motorway connection to the port from the M1 at Santry and the road network at East Wall.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">The National Roads Authority and Dublin City Council are responsible for the construction and design of the tunnel. The tunnel has been designed to the highest international standards to ensure its safety, both during and after construction. In addition, extensive ground surveys were carried out in advance of the commencement of construction to ensure the suitability of the route for tunnelling purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218">On Monday, 3 March, Iarnród Éireann instructed the port tunnel contractors to cease all tunnelling works under the railway at Fairview following two incidents that occurred during the construction of temporary supports at the site. These temporary supports are being constructed beneath the railway line to enable permanent  works to follow with the construction of the tunnel itself. It is important to note that Iarnród Éireann has confirmed that the two incidents on 23 February and 1 March did not pose a danger to railway operations. The incidents related to problems with a supporting beam in an excavation tunnel – or pilot tunnel – and also to the slippage of about five cubic metres of material in a tunnel for a foundation shaft. These incidents are being investigated by the contractors, Dublin City Council, Iarnród Éireann and their advisers. A subsidence previously occurred in Fairview on 17 December 2002. An interim report on that incident has been completed and discussions are ongoing between all relevant parties to identify the reason for its occurrence. I know this is not a full explanation at this stage but it is important to await a proper, scientific explanation for this occurrence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219">While these incidents are obviously a cause of some concern for all involved, including the contractors, the authorities and the general public, it is important to note that a wide range of measures are in place to ensure the safety of the works. The Deputy referred to independent observers and research.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">Extensive resources and personnel are dedicated to ensure the safety of the project. Full time safety officers are employed by the contractor to monitor all aspects from a health and safety perspective. Dublin City Council has engaged a firm of consultants to supervise work on the project and it also employs a safety specialist. Safety updates are given to employees at regular inter vals. Dublin City Council has also engaged the services of an international tunnel safety specialist with extensive experience in the UK Health and Safety Executive. His role is to review and audit the on-site safety regime and improvements that have been carried out on foot of his advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">Significant measures have also been taken to monitor and ensure the safety of buildings over the tunnel, in line with the best international practice. With regard to the railway, Iarnród Éireann also has in place a number of precautionary measures to protect railway operations, including 24-hour visual monitoring of the track and electronic equipment to detect any track movement. A stand-by crew is continually available to deal with any subsidence arising. No works will recommence under the railway until Iarnród Éireann has obtained sufficient details to satisfy itself as to the safety of the works. Work is currently proceeding on the main line of the Dublin Port Tunnel.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222">It is important to bear in mind that, despite a small number of incidents having arisen, the safety record of the Dublin Port Tunnel site is extremely good. The fact that such close attention is being paid to these incidents shows the level of dedication to safety at the tunnel site. Everyone involved with the project is concerned that the tunnel should be constructed as robustly and safely as possible, while at the same time minimising any delays in delivering this important national infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223">The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 March 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_1226">The Government has formed an assessment, in consultation with appropriate UN and other humanitarian organisations, of the likely impact of the use of military force against Iraq. We share the widely held view that the immediate consequences of such action for the civilian population of Iraq, including children, will be serious. Since there can be no certainty about exactly what will occur in the event of military action, all assessments are necessarily estimates based, for the most part, on extrapolation from earlier conflicts. However, we are satisfied that these assessments represent the most reliable information available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227">It is estimated that there are more than 3.5 million children under the age of five in Iraq. UNICEF has reported that the current under-five mortality rate has increased significantly since 1990 in some areas of Iraq. The main causes of high mortality rates in children under five are malnutrition and the high prevalence of diarrhoeal disease as well as acute respiratory infections. The maternal mortality ratio has also more than doubled since 1990 and in some areas accounts for one third of all deaths among women between 15 and 49 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228">Following the onset of an emergency, the most immediate concern would be for the 240,000 children currently undergoing nutritional rehabilitation in the country as well as the 140,000 malnourished pregnant women in need of supplemental feeding. Any breakdown in primary health services and interruption in the supply of nutritional supplements could result in the further deterioration of the health of malnourished children.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_83">Ireland Aid has contributed more than €700,000 in humanitarian funding for the people of Iraq since 2000. Funding has been targeted at relief programmes in nutrition, water and sanitation and rehabilitation of health services. These programmes have been implemented by  UNICEF, the International committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent and Trócaire's local partner CARITAS.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_84">The Government continues to believe that the potential still exists to resolve this crisis without recourse to the use of military force and we hope that Iraq will act immediately to bring itself into compliance with its obligations. This would be in the best interests of Iraqi children who have been subjected to great hardship by the stubborn refusal of Saddam Hussein to comply with the legitimate demands of the UN Security Council.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1230">As far as my Department is aware, there is only one Irish citizen resident in Iraq, and she is expected to leave the country shortly. I understand that there are two other Irish citizens visiting Iraq at present, and that a small number of Irish citizens may be intending to travel there in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231">My Department issued travel advice on 21 February strongly advising against travel to Iraq and urging any Irish citizens in the country to leave immediately. The Irish Embassy in Baghdad has been closed since 1991 and the Department has made it clear that, in the event of a conflict, we will not be in a position to provide consular assistance to Irish citizens in Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232">There is a standing arrangement whereby Irish citizens may seek consular assistance from embassies of other EU member states in countries where Ireland does not have a resident mission. However, in the event of a conflict in Iraq, there can be no assurance that such EU embassies as might remain in Baghdad would be able to provide effective assistance to any Irish citizens there.</p>

          <p eId="para_1234">One of the key outcomes of the WTO ministerial meeting at Doha in November 2001 was an agreement to provide access by developing countries to medicines necessary to combat HIV-AIDS, malaria and other infectious diseases. Ireland, in  common with other member states of the EU, has been very supportive of this initiative. It was possible to reach agreement at Doha that developing countries with a pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity could invoke a compulsory license to produce relevant medicines.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235">On the other hand, negotiations have been ongoing since then to address the situation of developing countries, which lack such a capacity. The solution envisaged is to allow generic copies of patented drugs to be exported to these countries. However, pharmaceutical companies are concerned about the bona fide implementation of this solution, including the potential for large-scale re-exportation of cheap drugs to developed countries. They also have concerns about the effects on investment in research for the production of new drugs to combat future diseases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236">The EU has been to the fore in pressing for a satisfactory outcome to this. Ireland feels, as do our European partners, that the compromise text put forward in this regard by the Chairman of the WTO council on 16 December last, offers the best basis on which to broker a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237">As I said, Ireland has worked consistently towards an acceptable solution and we will continue with our efforts in Geneva to secure an agreement before the next WTO ministerial meeting in Cancun in September next.</p>

          <p eId="para_1250">The special representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations for children and armed conflict acts as an advocate for the adoption of measures to protect children and their mothers in areas of armed conflict, to prevent the recruitment of children as armed combatants and to promote the demobilisation and re-integration of children who have been engaged in armed conflict with particular reference to their mental and physical health and education. Ireland actively supports the office of the special representative. It is a member of an informal group known as the Friends of the Special Representative, the aim of which is to support his work and to promote measures for the protection of children in armed conflict. In 2002, Ireland provided funding of €60,000 to the office.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">I met special representative Olara Otunnu in New York on 12 November 2001. We had a fruitful discussion, including on such issues as the humanitarian needs of the children of Afghanistan. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, met the special representative in New York on 5 November 2002. Mr. Otunnu <i>inter alia</i> expressed appreciation for the strong support Ireland had extended to his office from the commencement of his mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1252">During Ireland's membership of the Security Council, we worked hard for a strengthening of measures for the protection of children in armed conflict. We contributed actively to the drafting of Resolution 1379, adopted on 20 November 2001, in which the council supported the ongoing work of the special representative and expressed itself ready to include specific provisions for the protection of children in the mandates of peacekeeping operations. The council requested the Secretary General to take the protection of children into account in peacekeeping plans submitted to the Security Council, including through the appointment of child protection staff to peacekeeping operations. The Secretary General was also requested to report after one year on the implementation of the resolution and to attach to his report a list of parties to armed conflict that recruit or use children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253">The Council reaffirmed its commitment to the protection of children in armed conflict in a presidential statement on 7 May 2002. The Secretary General issued a comprehensive report on 26 November 2002 on this topic and I refer the Deputy to it for a detailed assessment of the situation and of progress in the various areas.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_89">The Security Council discussed this report in an open debate on 14 January last. Although  Ireland was no longer a member of the council, we were associated with the statement made in the debate by Greece on behalf of the European Union and by Austria on behalf of the human security network. The council subsequently, on 30 January, adopted Resolution 1460 supporting the Secretary General's call for an era of application. It again called on all parties to armed conflict to halt immediately the recruitment of children and expressed its intention to enter into dialogue or to support the Secretary General in entering into dialogue with such groups in order to develop clear and time bound plans to end this practice. It stressed the need for monitoring to ensure that children involved in disarmament and demobilisation programmes are not re-recruited. The Secretary General will again report on progress in this difficult and important area towards the end of this year.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1255">Following on from the European Council in Copenhagen last December and on the basis of a joint action adopted by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 27 January, the European Union is prepared to take over the current NATO-led allied harmony military monitoring-stabilisation mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM. A further joint action is expected to be submitted for approval at the next Council meeting on 18 and 19 March in order to facilitate deployment of the operation before the end of the month.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">The planned EU mission in FYROM is small scale, with an overall personnel strength of around 300. It has been anticipated since the Barcelona and Seville European Councils and will constitute the first military operation under the EU's European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP. It takes place with the full agreement of the FYROM authorities and should also be seen within the overall EU political framework for FYROM and the Balkans region as a whole. The original NATO-led operation was endorsed by the UN Security Council under the terms of Resolution 1371 of 26 September 2001.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_90">The joint action approved by the Council on 27 January confirmed the EU's decision in principle to act and was agreed unanimously by EU foreign ministers. NATO did not participate in that decision but the joint action contained provision that the EU operation should have recourse to certain NATO assets and capabilities. Arrangements in this regard are fully consistent with principles established by the Feira and Nice Euro pean Councils which hold that there should be autonomy of EU decision making, recognition of the different nature of the EU and NATO and non-discrimination against any of the member states.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_91">It is envisaged the EU mission will be of six months duration. EU and OSCE monitors will remain in FYROM throughout the period of the operation, as will a separate NATO advisory mission. Against that background, provision has been made for participation by non-EU member states and for necessary ongoing liaison and co-ordination with NATO and the OSCE. A so-called committee of contributors, that is participating states, for the EU operation has since been established and will be composed of representatives of all EU member states, as well as representatives of the third countries contributing to the operation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_92">Powers of decision-making on the nature and scope of the EU operation are vested in the EU Council of Ministers, with the political control and strategic direction to be undertaken by the political and security committee – PSC – under the authority of the Council.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_93">Ireland has expressed support in principle for the EU mission. It is entirely consistent with the EU's ongoing support for full implementation of the Ohrid framework agreement in FYROM and our general approach to tasks of conflict prevention and crisis management. However, Ireland will not participate on this occasion. This is due to legal advice indicating that the UN endorsement for the original NATO-led operation does not fully meet the requirements, as provided for in the Defence Acts, for the participation of Defence Forces personnel in the EU-led successor force.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_94">I do not accept that war in Iraq is inevitable. I  continue to believe that all means short of force must be tried and exhausted and that force must be used only as a last resort. The possible humanitarian consequences of a conflict in Iraq are of deep concern to the Government. It is not possible at this stage to accurately gauge the needs of those who may be directly and adversely affected by a possible conflict. A number of scenarios are being examined by UN agencies and by non-governmental organisations with the benefit of the most up-to-date information available.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_95">We know that 60% of the population is fully dependent on the food rations distributed each month under the oil for food programme. We are also aware that the health, water and sanitation infrastructure of the country is in a very poor state of repair. In the event of a conflict there is a real possibility that the food pipeline and the distribution of basic services could be interrupted with severe humanitarian consequences. In addition, conflict may lead to the displacement of many thousands of Iraqi families both internally and externally.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_96">In circumstances where conflict is possible, humanitarian agencies must prudently plan for all possible eventualities. As I mentioned in the Dáil on 11 February, we have sought and obtained a confidential briefing from the UN Secretariat on the extensive plans it is making to deal with a possible humanitarian crisis. We are in regular contact with the key UN relief agencies and we participated in the humanitarian conference on Iraq which was held in Geneva on 15 and 16 February on the initiative of the Swiss Government. In addition we have been in communication with NGOs which are also engaged in preparedness planning. In this way we are forming an overall picture of the kind of circumstances which may present themselves and of the response which would be required of us.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_97">Ireland Aid has committed €6.8 million to UNHCR and €8 million to UNICEF for their global operations in 2003. These funds are not earmarked in order that they can be utilised quickly and effectively for emergency and humanitarian planning and rapid responses in situations prioritised by these agencies. A further €750,000 was released to the United Nations office for the co-ordination of humanitarian activities – UNOCHA – to facilitate that agency in its planning for prioritised humanitarian emergencies.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_98">The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, has recently approved an initiative to assist key Irish NGOs in their rapid deployment to address prioritised humanitarian emergencies. This will be of relevance to the NGOs' involvement in any humanitarian relief operations relating to Iraq.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_99">While I fervently hope that the issue of Iraqi disarmament can be solved in a peaceful manner, Ireland Aid remains ready to respond to the humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable Iraqis in the event of an outbreak of hostilities.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1266">With regard to those countries in the Middle East with safeguards and therefore subject to inspection, the IAEA confirms that the amount of plutonium in their facilities can be described as negligible because there are no power reactors in the region and research reactors do not produce significant quantities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">Israel is one of the three countries which remain outside the NPT and thus no IAEA inspection of their facilities is possible.

        <summary eId="sum_104">Concern persists in relation to the lack of respect for human rights in China, including the freedom of expression, of religion and of association. Likewise, there is concern about the ongoing violations of the human rights of pro-democracy activists, the proponents of free trade unions and the followers of the Falun Gong, which is regarded by the Chinese Government as "an evil cult". The EU has also noted with concern the widespread use of torture and the "strike hard" campaign, which has resulted in an extremely high number of death sentences and executions, as well as the deprivation of religious and cultural rights in Tibet and Xinjiang.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_105">At the forthcoming session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, Ireland, along with our EU partners, will make known our concerns in regard to these serious human rights violations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_106">The EU discusses key human rights concerns with China in the framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which provides a forum for an in-depth discussion of these issues. The last session of the dialogue took place on 13-14 November 2002 in Beijing. At that session, the EU raised a wide variety of issues, including the question of freedom of expression, association, assembly and also the freedom of religion and belief. The EU also raised the cases of a number of individuals whose detention by the Chinese authorities was of concern. A further session of the dialogue begins today in Beijing, and will conclude tomorrow. The EU will continue to evaluate the results of the dialogue at regular intervals to determine how far its expectations have been met.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_107">This formal human rights dialogue is complemented by biannual human rights seminars in which representatives from academia, the judiciary and other experts from the EU and China participate. The most recent seminar took place in Copenhagen on 17-18 October 2002 and focused on the theme of the prevention of torture, and on the role of national human rights institutions.</summary>

However, the Minister of State for Overseas Development and Human Rights, Deputy Kitt, along with officials from my Department, met on 4 February 2003 with representatives of Amnesty International, and the Irish Falun Dafa Association and received a petition on behalf of the individuals concerned.

          <p eId="para_1275">As the Deputy may be aware, the treatment of persons in detention is regulated by two well established branches of international law: human rights law and international humanitarian law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1276">In the case of those detained on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence, the relevant rules are provided by international human rights instruments, chief among which is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or ICCPR. Among the rights recognised by the ICCPR are that of an arrested person to be informed of the charges against him or her at the time of the arrest, and the right to a fair trial before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1277">In the case of persons detained as prisoners of war, the provisions of international humanitarian law, in particular the third Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of 12 August 1949, must additionally be applied. The convention gives a detailed list of the rights enjoyed by prisoners of war, including the right to give only basic information to his or her captors, and the right to pursue religious, intellectual and physical activities while in captivity. Importantly, should a detaining power wish to try a prisoner of war for any criminal activity, such a trial must be held by an independent and impartial court and the prisoner must have the opportunity to present his or her defence with the assistance of a qualified advocate or counsel.</p>
          <p eId="para_1278">It has been claimed that persons detained in the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba can be regarded as falling into a third category of detainee – that of "unlawful combatants", who, while not being entitled to prisoner of war status, are being provided with selected prisoner of war privileges. I have previously expressed to the House the Government's concern that the detainees in Guantanamo Bay be treated in accordance with the provisions of international human rights and humanitarian law. I understand that a number of EU partners whose nationals are being held in Guantanamo Bay are seeking to resolve this issue with the US authorities. The Government hopes that a speedy solution, ensuring that all detainees are treated in accordance with international law, can be reached.</p>

      his views on the current situation in North Korea.

          <p eId="para_1281">The current crisis began in October 2002, when the  US presented North Korea with evidence that it was enriching uranium with a view to developing nuclear weapons. This placed North Korea in violation of international agreements including the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the North-South Declaration on the Denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula and the 1994 agreed framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">On 10 January this year, I issued a statement noting with great regret North Korea's announcement that it was withdrawing from the non-proliferation treaty. Since then the Government's concern has been heightened by the increasingly serious actions that have been taken by the DPRK.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">As a recent example, we view as extremely serious last week's reports that North Korea has restarted a nuclear reactor which had been closed since the resolution of the last crisis in 1994. Developments such as these are damaging to the vitally important multilateral system of non-proliferation and could also have serious consequences for regional stability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">On 12 February 2003 the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, decided to refer the question of North Korea's non-compliance with its international non-proliferation obligations to the United Nations Security Council. The Government fully supports this decision and we agree that discussion of the matter at the Security Council is warranted owing to the gravity of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">On 20 February 2003 the Security Council held an initial discussion about this matter and decided that SECCO experts on North Korea should meet to consider further how the issue can be taken forward in order to ensure that the non-proliferation regime is respected and that peace and security in the region is protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">The Government is consulting with our EU partners and countries in the region that are seriously concerned by the developments in North Korea. At the General Affairs and External Relations Council in January 2003, Ireland, together with our EU partners, agreed on the principle of sending a high-level EU delegation to Pyongyang.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_110">However, difficulties relating to the level at which the delegation would be received, and conditions laid down by the North Koreans, have so far prevented this delegation from going to Pyongyang. In the Government's view, an EU visit, if it takes place, should focus on the need for the DPRK to fulfil its international non-proliferation obligations. The Government does not consider that this matter is solely a bilateral issue with the United States, as characterised by the Pyongyang Government. On the contrary, we regard it as a matter which affects the international community and thus one which demands a multilateral solution. We remain sensitive however to the need to avoid exacerbating an already tense situation and will continue to consult with our European Union partners, as well as the US and the  Republic of Korea, on how this matter might be peacefully resolved.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1290">The human rights reforms adopted in Turkey in August 2002 included the abolition of capital punishment in peacetime. As a result, the death penalty on the individual in question was commuted in October to a sentence of life imprisonment. As the Deputies are aware, the Government had made representations to the Turkish authorities not to execute this person. I strongly welcome the abolition of capital punishment in Turkey.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">On 17 February 2003, a delegation from the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, CPT, visited the prison on the island of Imrali in which the individual is the sole inmate. The delegation interviewed him and had discussions with the relevant Turkish authorities on concerns regarding his right to receive visits from his relatives and lawyers. The CPT had earlier visited Imrali closed prison in March 1999 and in September 2001.</p>

          <p eId="para_1294">The matter at issue concerns draft legislation currently being considered within the Council of Ministers on EU aid for policies and actions on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">The European Commission in March 2002 submitted a proposal to the Council and the European Parliament for a new regulation on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries. The previous regulation expired on 31 December last, having been in force since July 1997. The purpose of both the previous regulation and its proposed replacement is to allow the Commission to continue to support programmes in developing countries in the area of reproductive and sexual health and rights. The Commission's role in relation to development co-operation is laid down in Articles 177 to 181 of the treaty establishing the European Community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">The previous regulation and its proposed replacement form an important part of the EC's development policy. The legislation addresses the specific UN millennium development goal relating to maternal health, which calls for the reduction of maternal mortality by three-quarters over the period 1990 to 2015. Throughout the developing world, and particularly in the poorest countries, hundreds of thousands of women continue to die in childbirth because health systems cannot afford proper medical care and appropriate services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">The draft regulation, like the previous 1997 to 2002 instrument, is based on the programme of action agreed at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development in 1994 and the "Cairo +5" follow-up conference of 1999. Ireland's position in the Council negotiations on both the draft regulation and its predecessor has been that they must be in strict conformity with the Cairo programme of action, which provides that abortion is not to be promoted as a family planning method and that regulations regarding abortion are solely for individual countries to decide. We are satisfied that the draft regulation in its current form meets this requirement and that it represents a substantial contribution by the Union towards implementation of the millennium development goals, to which the international community is committed.</p>

          <p eId="para_1300">On 17 December 2002, I made a statement to the House concerning the situation in Afghanistan. Since then, the progress towards a stable and democratic society in Afghanistan has continued. This process commenced with the signing of the Bonn Agreement in December 2001. Working together, the Afghanistan Transitional Authority and the international community are working steadily towards the reconstruction of the social, economic and governmental infrastructure of Afghanistan. Since 17 December, the important process of drafting a new constitution for Afghanistan has advanced. President Karzai is currently preparing a decree detailing the main elements of the new constitutional process, and a constitutional commission is to be established by March 2003. Thereafter, public consultations on the new constitution are scheduled to take place between April and June this year. There has also been important progress on the preparation for the elections due to take place in June 2004. The UN mission in Afghanistan, UNAMA, has already started organising the electoral process and co-ordinating the international assistance which has been offered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">A very welcome development on the ground in Afghanistan was the heavy fall of rain and snow last week. There is widespread hope there that this may mark the end of the severe drought, which the people have endured for the past six years. The impact of the end of the drought cannot be underestimated, as it would have a huge effect on the agricultural and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, which has been particularly devastating for the rural population. Other key developments currently under way include the reform of the national army and the creation of a national police force. On a positive note, on 10 February 2003, the leadership of the international security assistance force, ISAF, with which Irish troops continue to serve in Kabul, was transferred smoothly from Turkey to Germany and the Netherlands. In view of this progress, it is unfortunate that the human rights and security situations in Afghanistan continue to raise concern. The Afghanistan poppy eradication programme has also met with opposition in the east of the country and there have been reports of attacks on the offices of some international organisations.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_111">The Government remains strongly committed to the process of reconstruction in Afghanistan. Our ambassador in Tehran, who will also serve as ambassador to Afghanistan, is presenting his credentials in Kabul this week. He will conduct a series of meetings on the ground with the Afghan authorities, Irish NGOs in the field and international organisations, which will be important for our assessment of the ongoing needs of the Afghan people and in further informing decisions as to where Ireland's contribution can best be made. Ireland has provided over €14.2 million in funding to Afghanistan since 2000 which, I am pleased to report, makes us one of the leading international donors to Afghanistan on aper capita basis. Together with our EU partners, Ireland will maintain its commitment to support the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Afghanistan to ensure that, with the help of the international community, it may emerge as a stable and peaceful democracy.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1305">It would not be appropriate for me, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, to comment on the policy approach of another EU member state such as Austria, in this area. This is a matter for the Austrian authorities, having regard to their particular circumstances. Unlike Austria, Ireland's geographical position places it on the main flight path between North America and Europe. For many decades, military aircraft of various nationalities have been flying over and landing in Ireland. The practice of facilitating the overflights and landings of US military aircraft continued throughout the Cold War and all the conflicts, wars and upheavals of the last fifty years. It has been maintained under successive Governments comprising various political parties.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_112">The procedures for implementing the regulations applying to overflights and landings have been tightened in recent months. This Government has done more than all of its predecessors put together to ensure that the practices and  arrangements built up over the years are operated in compliance with the strict legal requirements. With reference to the Government's policy on overflights and landings by foreign military aircraft, it is worth recalling that UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, and the head of UNMOVIC, Dr. Hans Blix, have confirmed that the pressure placed so far upon Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime has had an impact and, without that pressure, the weapons inspectors would not be back in Iraq today.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1308">The Timor Sea Treaty provides that revenue from the area of the Timor Sea that is jointly administered by Timor-Leste and Australia, known as the Joint Petroleum Development Area – JPDA, will be shared, with 90% of the revenues going to Timor-Leste.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309">This is a positive development, which will provide an important source of revenue for the people of Timor-Leste, and a working foundation for economic progress in the newly independent state.

        <summary eId="sum_114">Ireland fully supports the talks sponsored by the United Nations aimed at a comprehensive and lasting settlement in Cyprus, and the continuing efforts of the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan. As the House will be aware, the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities agreed to negotiate on the basis of the Secretary General's amended proposals with the objective of reaching agreement by 28 February  2003, and with a view to the accession of a united Cyprus to the European Union on 1 May 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_115">Last week, Secretary General Annan visited Ankara, Athens and Nicosia for detailed discussions on his newly-revised proposals. Regrettably, it did not prove possible to reach agreement on a comprehensive settlement by Friday 28 February. However, the Secretary General has secured the agreement of the leaders of the two communities, newly-elected President Tassos Papadopoulos and Mr. Rauf Denktash, to continue negotiating. He has invited them to meet with him in The Hague on 10 March and to commit themselves to the holding of simultaneous referendums on 30 March on a foundation agreement on a comprehensive settlement based on his proposals and the outcome of their negotiations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_116">This is an historic opportunity for the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot communities. I strongly urge the two leaders to co-operate fully with the UN Secretary General and to make every effort to conclude their negotiations in the coming weeks. Both leaders, and both communities, will have to decide on difficult compromises if a comprehensive settlement is to be reached on the basis of the Secretary General's revised proposals. The time available is now short, but a resolution which is to the overall benefit of all parties remains in sight.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_117">If an agreement is supported by referendum on 30 March, it will be possible to take account of its provisions in the EU Treaty of Accession for Cyprus, and for a united Cyprus to join the European Union on 1 May 2004. This is the outcome I wish to see. The Copenhagen European Council in December 2003 expressed a strong preference for the accession of a united Cyprus. In the absence of a settlement, the application of the Union's laws and regulations to the northern part of the island will be suspended.</summary>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_119">I remain concerned at the crisis in the international coffee trade and the problems this is causing for producers, including in such areas as central Ethiopia. The international coffee crisis  was discussed at the General Affairs Council in November last. There, the Commission undertook to come forward with ideas to address the situation of commodities in general. The general consensus among Ministers is that there is no short-term solution to the problem. It was agreed that initiatives needed to be taken and the issue had to be looked at in the broader context including with a view to sustainable development. I expect the council to return to this matter soon on the basis of the Commission's ideas for dealing with the commodities situation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_120">The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, participated in discussions to learn of the effects of the crisis in Ethiopia during his recent visit to that country. His talks with Prime Minister Meles and some of his ministers underlined the extent to which the downturn in coffee prices was affecting Ethiopia's economy. The OXFAM report, Mugged: Poverty in your Coffee Cup, draws attention to the fact that the livelihoods of 25 million coffee producers are affected by the fall in the price of coffee. I have noted the recommendations in the report that the UN Conference on Trade and Development should develop a long-term integrated strategy to tackle the problem of commodities and organise a major international conference on coffee with the International Coffee Organisation by February or March 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_121">In the wake of the publication of the OXFAM report the International Coffee Organisation, of which Ireland, along with the other EU member states, is a member, put in place the coffee quality improvement programme on 1 October 2002. Ireland has given positive endorsement to the quality improvement programme of the International Coffee Organisation. This programme aims to improve the supply of high-quality coffee on the world market by adopting minimum standards for exported coffee. This measure will improve market equilibrium and help to eliminate the presence of low-quality coffee from the market.</summary>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_122">While the situation remains serious, there have also been positive developments. On 2 November 2002, the new Government of Jammu and Kashmir was sworn in, following elections in September and October. The government is a coali tion of the two largest parties in the assembly, the Congress Party and the People's Democratic Party. The new administration is committed to dialogue as a means of resolving the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. Following the recent democratic elections in Pakistan, a civilian Government has been formed, comprising the Muslim League-Quaid, PML-Q, and the Muttahida Quami Movement, MQM. The new PML-Q civilian Prime Minister, Mr. Zafarullah Khan Jamali, was sworn in on 22 November.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_123">Throughout January 2003, both India and Pakistan issued a series of inflammatory statements, including military threats, which have once again raised tensions. On 22 and 23 January, each country expelled a number of diplomats of the other. On 28 January, the Pakistani military shot down an unmanned Indian spy plane which it claimed had violated Pakistani airspace. On 5 February, Kashmir Solidarity Day, Pakistan Prime Minister Jamali called on India to resume a process of dialogue aimed at resolving the Kashmir issue. At every opportunity, the EU has offered to assist both countries in finding a way out of the present stalemate. A Ministerial troika met with the Indian foreign minister in Athens on 17 January 2003. Last year, the Presidency welcomed the assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir and the elections in Pakistan and called on India and Pakistan to resume a diplomatic dialogue as soon as possible. The question of Jammu and Kashmir is also regularly discussed by officials of EU member states. Heads of missions in New Delhi and Islamabad regularly engage with Indian and Pakistani officials.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_124">Ireland has also made its concerns known at every opportunity to representatives of India and Pakistan in Dublin, New York, New Delhi and Islamabad. In June 2002, our ambassador to Pakistan presented his credentials in Islamabad to President Musharraf and former Foreign Minister Sattar and took that opportunity to outline our views. I met with the then Pakistan Foreign Minister Ul Haq in September 2002 at the UN General Assembly and urged increased co-operation on terrorism issues and support for bilateral dialogue. Ireland, along with our EU partners, remains fully committed to supporting every advance in this critical dialogue.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_127">Since Christmas, the European Convention has entered a new, more detailed phase of its work. Now that all of the 11 working groups, established to examine particular issues in detail, have reported, the praesidium has begun to circulate draft articles for inclusion in a new constitutional treaty. These flesh out the skel eton treaty brought forward by the praesidium last October.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_128">Drafts of articles 1 to 16, which establish the Union, describe its values and objectives and address questions of rights and competences, were published by the praesidium on 6 February and debated at the plenary meeting of 27 and 28 February. Through our representative at the Convention, Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Roche, a number of amendments were tabled, generally aimed at bringing greater precision and clarity to the texts. We made it clear that our views were necessarily initial ones and that it would not be possible to reach more definitive positions on the issues involved until drafts of all elements of the treaty – especially of part two which will set out the detail of the various policy areas – have been circulated and considered.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_129">Drafts of articles 24-33, which set out the Union's legal instruments and procedures, along with draft protocols on the role of national parliaments and on subsidiarity were published by the praesidium on 27 February. Proposed amendments are to be forwarded to the Convention's secretariat by 8 March. Work is continuing involving the relevant Departments to prepare our input.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_130">Throughout the work of the Convention, the Government has stressed its view that national parliaments have a critical role to play in the democratic life of the Union. This is most importantly done through holding national Governments to account. I pay tribute to those Members of the House who, through the Joint Committee on European Affairs and other relevant committees, have helped get the new arrangements for Oireachtas scrutiny of EU business off to such a positive and constructive start. The role of national parliaments does not stop there. I strongly support the proposal that they act as a watchdog over application of the principle of subsidiarity, which is reflected in the draft protocols brought forward by the praesidium. Ireland has also suggested that they could play a role in the appointment of the President of the Commission through participation in an electoral college.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_131">The Government strongly supported promulgation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights as a political declaration at Nice in December 2000. It is entirely appropriate that the values and principles that underpin the work of the Union be set out in a clear, comprehensive and comprehensible way. The question being asked of the Convention is whether the charter should be incorporated into the new treaty, the fundamental law of the Union. The Government is giving very careful consideration to the issues involved. We recognise that important work has been done at the Convention to bring greater clarity and certainty to the clauses of the charter which delimit its scope and application. The charter is not intended as a vehicle to extend Union competence into areas where it does not have auth ority to act. It would also be helpful for the important commentary produced by the praesidium on the charter convention to be given due recognition. If the charter is to be incorporated, therefore, I believe it would best be placed in a protocol attached to the new treaty.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_132">In reaching a final view on the charter's status, the Government will be pragmatic, reasonable and conscious of the need to achieve consensus. We will also bear carefully in mind the expectation citizens now rightly have that institutions, whether it be their own Governments or the European Union, should be held to account for how they promote and vindicate fundamental rights. The Government has set out its broad approach to the Convention on a number of occasions, including in my address to the Institute of European Affairs in January. We hope that the process which is begun at the Convention and which will be concluded at the inter governmental conference will result in a simplified treaty which is more legible and accessible for our citizens. The process should also ensure that the Union's institutions are as efficient and effective as possible, taking account of the changing environment in which they operate. The Government is prepared to approach institutional questions in a forward-thinking manner, so long as the important balances between the various institutions of the Union and between the member states are properly respected. We would also support a simplification of the instruments and procedures available to the Union, although, as I have said before, it is also important that, where necessary, particular arrangements continue to apply in exceptionally sensitive areas. For example, while we could support the extension of QMV to new areas on a case by case basis, it is our strong view that unanimity must continue to apply in areas including taxation and some aspects of JHA issues.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_133">The European Council has asked that the Convention bring forward its recommendations to its meeting in Thessaloniki in June. The work will then be taken forward by the Governments in an Intergovernmental Conference. While it is not yet clear when the Intergovernmental Conference will complete its work – clearly, this will very much depend on the nature of the Convention's recommendations – it has been agreed by the European Council that a new treaty will not be signed until after the ten countries which will sign an accession treaty with the EU in April of this year, become full members on 1 May 2004 during Ireland's Presidency. It is important that the public is informed of and involved in the debate on the future of Europe. The National Forum on Europe is continuing to play a very valuable role and has recently launched a further round of meetings dedicated to exploring the issues being considered at the Convention. I understand that it intends to hold 13 meetings between now and June, visiting various venues outside Dublin. I also commend the work of the Joint Committee on European Affairs which is following the work of the Convention in a close and active way.  Through the Communicating Europe initiative, my Department has recently co-funded a video of the work of the Convention, primarily aimed at transition year students. Arrangements for keeping the public informed and involved will be kept under review as the process evolves.</summary>

Secretary General-High Representative Solana and the Presidency were invited to begin consultations to this end with the Bosnian authorities, as well as with EU Special Representative and Dayton High Representative Ashdown, NATO and other international players. On this basis, it was also agreed that a preliminary report on the matter should be submitted to the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting to be held in February. In early February, France and Britain announced their intention to submit further proposals to the Council in this regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_134">In the event, both texts were submitted to Council as scheduled and were given a broad initial welcome by member states. There was much convergence between the two submissions and EU partners were in agreement on the importance of an integrated approach to guaranteeing a secure environment in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In particular, it will be necessary to ensure coherence between any EU-led military force and  the EU police mission which has been under way in Bosnia since 1 January of this year, in succession to the outgoing UN international police task force.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_135">An appropriate legal basis for the operation will also be important. SFOR and its predecessor IFOR are based on UN Security Council resolutions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and it is envisaged that this authority will need to be extended to the EU-led force.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_136">From a national perspective, I consider that an EU take over of SFOR raises no difficulties of principle for Ireland. As the Deputy will be aware, SFOR has as its mandate the implementation of the military aspects of the general framework agreement for peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina – the "Dayton Agreement". Its role is to contribute to a secure environment necessary for consolidation and stabilisation of peace in the region and it works closely with the other international agencies principally involved in the implementation of its role. Any EU mission would be in continuance of these activities and should be considered in the context of overall EU political and economic activity in the Balkans region.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_137">I would also point to the fact that Ireland has participated successfully in SFOR since 1997. We would particularly support the transfer of the Security Council authorisation for SFOR to the EU-led force and we will be underlining the importance of effective coordination between military and civilian instruments in the EU's approach to the operation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_138">SG-HR Solana and the Presidency will now continue their consultations with the Bosnian authorities and with NATO, Lord Ashdown and other international organisations over the coming months. The matter is due to be revisited by the Council in May.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1348">I propose to take Questions Nos. 147, 173 and 190 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349">The four Geneva Conventions and the two additional protocols form part of a wider body of international humanitarian law which seeks to limit the effects of armed conflict. Its purpose is to restrict the means and methods of warfare and to protect persons who are not, or who are no longer, participating in hostilities. The conventions have acquired the status of customary international law, given that the overwhelming majority of states have accepted them as binding by becoming parties to them. To date 189 states, including Ireland, have ratified the conventions.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_140">International humanitarian law does not in itself prohibit or prevent states from engaging in conflict. The question of whether a state may use armed force is a separate question, governed by the Charter of the United Nations. The substan tive provisions of the Geneva Convention apply once an armed conflict has begun, and apply equally to all sides. Their application ceases at the general close of military operations and, in occupied territories, at the end of the occupation – except for certain categories of persons whose final release, repatriation or settlement takes place at a later date. Iraq and the United States are both high contracting parties to the four Geneva Conventions, and are obliged to apply their provisions to any conflict between themselves and other high contracting parties. Equally, both are entitled to the protection afforded by the conventions in any conflict.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_141">The Fourth Geneva Convention, relating to the protection of civilians in time of war, sets down a number of rules on how belligerents must deal with civilians. For instance, it provides for the establishment of neutralised zones and for the protection of hospitals and medical personnel, it lays down rules of behaviour for occupying powers, and it deals with the treatment of internees and displaced persons. The main provisions dealing specifically with children during a time of conflict are articles 23 and 24. Article 23 provides for the free passage of essential foodstuffs etc., intended for children under 15, provided that the party concerned is satisfied that the consignments will not be diverted, that they will remain under effective control, and that no definite military advantage will accrue to the military efforts or economy of the enemy. Article 24 deals with the welfare of children under 15 who are orphaned or are separated from their families as a result of war.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_142">The first additional protocol to the Geneva Conventions, relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts, provides for significantly greater protection of civilians, including children. While fewer states are parties to this protocol, it is nevertheless recognised that many of it provisions reflect customary international law. Neither Iraq nor the United States is party to the protocol. In these circumstances, the conventions and the additional protocol provide that civilians, and combatants, remain under the protection and authority of the principles of international law derived from established custom, from the principles of humanity and from dictates of public conscience. These would prohibit,inter alia, deliberate or indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population. Article 1.3 of the protocol provides that it shall apply in the situations referred to in article 2 common to the Geneva Conventions. Common article 2 of the conventions in turn provides that parties to the conventions shall be bound by them in relation to a non-party if the latter accepts and applies their provisions. It would be open for Iraq to accept and apply the provisions of the additional protocol, and in that case all parties to the protocol would be bound to apply its provisions in their relations with Iraq.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_143">The Government believes strongly that all belligerent parties in any armed conflict should take  every possible step to protect civilian populations from the effects of war. In particular, they must comply with their obligations under the Geneva Conventions and the other principles of international humanitarian law. The onus of respecting the laws of war falls in the first place on the parties to the conflict, who are obliged to punish anyone who commits war crimes or other breaches of humanitarian law. Under the Geneva Conventions, the parties to a conflict may appoint protecting powers, who have the duty of safeguarding the interests of those parties. Under common article 9, the conventions are to be applied with the co-operation and under the scrutiny of the protecting powers. The conventions also recognise the humanitarian role of the International Committee of the Red Cross. At the same time, all parties to the Geneva Conventions undertake to ensure respect for their provisions. The international community as a whole has an interest in minimising the effect of conflict on combatants and civilians alike.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1354">Political links with Cuba have strengthened considerably in recent years, in particular since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1999, which led to the accreditation to Cuba of the Irish ambassador based in Mexico City. Cuba estab lished a resident embassy in Dublin in 2001. In 2001 also, a delegation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs visited Cuba.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355">The establishment of diplomatic relations has led to a number of initiatives for bilateral agreements. Proposals are under consideration for the conclusion of agreements between the two Governments in the areas of criminal mutual legal assistance, co-operation against drugs and the transfer of sentenced prisoners. These proposals are currently being examined by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in consultation with other relevant Departments, offices and agencies. Later this year, when Ireland joins the EU Troika in preparation for its 2004 Presidency, we look forward to participating in the annual political dialogue meeting at ministerial level between the EU and Cuba.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356">In recent years trade between Ireland and Cuba has fluctuated considerably. In 2001, total trade amounted to almost €2.1 million: imports from Cuba totalling approximately €1.2 million and exports to Cuba totalling approximately €880,000. The Cuban Government has introduced a number of economic reforms and, in this context, the Government, along with our EU partners, is keen to see the development of business relations. It is noteworthy, in this regard, that the European Commission is to establish a resident delegation office in Havana next month. We will continue to monitor the situation with a view to identifying opportunities for future trade co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1357">Anecdotal evidence suggests that social contacts between our two countries and our peoples are stronger than ever, due mainly to the increasing number of Irish tourists travelling to Cuba. Since the Irish Government does not have a role in the promotion of outbound tourism, I am not in possession of exact figures. In January 2003, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, on the recommendation of the cultural relations committee, provided funding to an Irish artist, Mr. Barry Dinan, towards the cost of an exhibition in Cuba from March to May 2003. I am also aware that the Cuban authorities have recently approached the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism with a view to negotiating a cultural agreement between that country and Ireland. The proposal is currently being examined.</p>

          <p eId="para_1361">Ireland considers the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as the cornerstone of the international non-proliferation regime. Ireland would consider the development of new forms of nuclear weapon inconsistent with Article VI of the treaty which commits all states parties to pursue, <i>inter alia,</i> nuclear disarmament.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362">Ireland expects all states parties to the NPT to respect its terms and make every effort to achieve its full implementation. Ireland, as part of the New Agenda Coalition, has indicated that it would be deeply concerned about any future role for nuclear weapons as part of any new security strategy. We have further made it clear that a continual irreversible progress in nuclear arms reductions is a fundamental prerequisite for promoting nuclear non-proliferation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363">In the year 2000, the review conference of the NPT agreed by consensus a Final Document which contained concrete steps toward the achievement of the elimination of nuclear weapons. In particular the final document includes an unequivocal undertaking by the Nuclear Weapon States to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals in fulfilment of their commitment under Article VI of the Treaty. Ireland as a member of the New Agenda Coalition was to the forefront in the negotiations leading to this agreement and continues to press for its full implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1364">Another issue connected to any development of new forms of nuclear weapons is that of testing. One of the steps agreed in the 2000 final document is a commitment to the entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. This treaty which contains an outright prohibition on nuclear tests will enter into force when 44 named states which are deemed to be nuclear capable, whether civilian or military, have signed and ratified. Thirteen of these forty-four have yet to ratify and Ireland and the New Agenda Coalition have regularly urged these countries to do so.</p>

      the position in relation to Rockall; the timescale for the conclusion of all matters relating to exploitation, oil and mineral rights; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [6413/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_717">
          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1366">The issue of Rockall has in the past been a source of some public legal and political controversy in both Ireland and the United Kingdom. Much of that controversy was due to unresolved fears that jurisdiction over Rockall and similar rocks and skerries was thought to be central to the mineral rights in the adjacent sea-bed and to fishing rights in the surrounding seas. However, during the course of the Third United Nations Conference  on the Law of the Sea the Irish delegation worked hard to establish a satisfactory legal regime applicable to islands. The United Nations convention on the Law of the Sea, which was adopted at Montego Bay at the conclusion of the Conference on 10 December 1982, provides at Article 121 paragraph 3 that: "Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf."</p>
          <p eId="para_1367">Article 121 (3) applies to Rockall. Ireland ratified the convention on 21 June 1996. The United Kingdom acceded to the convention on 25 July 1997. It is accordingly accepted by both states that Rockall cannot be used as a basis for delimiting their respective continental shelves or fisheries zones. While the United Kingdom continues to claim jurisdiction over Rockall, this claim is not accepted by Ireland. Each country remains aware of the position of the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_1368">As regards rights to oil and other minerals on the continental shelf, Article 77 of the 1982 convention provides that the coastal state exercises over its continental shelf sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting its natural resources. It exercises these rights out to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured, or further if the shelf naturally extends beyond that limit. Where the submerged prolongation of its land territory extends beyond 200 nautical miles a state is required to make a submission to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which has been established by the convention especially for this purpose. Such a submission should be accompanied by technical and scientific data which support the claimed limits. The limits established on the basis of the recommendations that the commission makes following its consideration of the submission shall be final and binding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1369">Under the terms of the convention Ireland is due to make its submission to the Commission within ten years of entry into force of the convention with respect to the State, i.e. by 21 July 2006. However a recent meeting of the states parties to the convention decided to extend this period to May 2009 for all states which had ratified or acceded to the convention before 13 May 1999, the date on which the commission adopted its scientific and technical guidelines. The scientific and technical data necessary to support Ireland's submission has been collected and work on the preparation of the submission is in hand.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_145">It should be noted however that the commission's rules of procedure prevent consideration by it of any submission with respect to a part of the continental shelf that is the subject of a dispute except with the prior consent of all the parties to that dispute. While Ireland and the United Kingdom reached agreement between themselves in 1988 on the delimitation of most of their respective continental shelves, this agreement is not accepted by Iceland or Denmark, on behalf of the Færoe Islands. Both of these coun tries maintain claims to parts of the outer continental shelf of the North East Atlantic which have also been claimed by Ireland and which lie more than 200 nautical miles from Irish baselines. Contacts between officials of all four states on this question are maintained but it is not possible to state at this stage when the limits of these disputed parts of the outer continental shelf may finally be established.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_146">The EU itself is already implementing a substantial programme of socio-economic and insti tutional support in Colombia, aimed at promoting and protecting respect for human rights, humanitarian law and fundamental freedoms, improving the living conditions of the local populations, encouraging the cultivation of alternative crops and the protection of bio-diversity, and supporting the introduction of structural reforms in all fields that fuel armed conflict.</summary>

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the work of the ICRC generally and Ireland Aid's current programme engagement with the ICRC.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383">The meeting covered common priorities which the ICRC and Ireland share in terms of responding to humanitarian emergencies and the needs of those populations, especially women and children, who are most affected by conflict and disasters. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, recalling Ireland's funding of the ICRC over the years, reaffirmed his commitment to work closely with the ICRC and its affiliates in the Red Cross family in responding to humanitarian emergencies worldwide. This reflects the high regard in which the ICRC is held by Ireland and the international humanitarian community and the important role it fulfils in providing early assistance to vulnerable and suffering people particularly in conflicts. Discussions also focused on the new partnership programme with the ICRC which was initiated in December 2002 and which supports the ICRC's protection programmes in Africa, a key priority for Ireland and the ICRC.</p>
          <p eId="para_1384">Dr. Keilenberger greatly appreciates Ireland's support in responding to the ICRC's emergency appeals and also the political support given in the area of international humanitarian law. Dr. Keilenberger informed the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, on ICRC country programmes in key regions, including programmes in Iraq. In Iraq the ICRC is involved in the rehabilitation of hospitals, water and sanitation and general humanitarian relief activities.

          <p eId="para_1389">I propose to take Questions Nos. 158 and 231 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1390">There have been allegations that the UN Population Fund, the UNFPA, has supported coercive family planning methods among the Montagnard hill tribes in Vietnam. My Department has raised this matter with the UNFPA. In addition, an official from the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the UN in New York participated in a field visit of donors to Vietnam in April 2002 organised by the UN Development Programme and the UNFPA. Donors had the opportunity to inspect the UNFPA's activities in Vietnam, to discuss these with UNFPA workers and to consult the Government of Vietnam on the role the UNFPA plays in support of voluntary family planning in Vietnam. A report on this field visit was discussed at the executive board of the UNFPA in January 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1391">The UNFPA has categorically denied the allegations concerning its programme in Vietnam. The UNFPAs programmes in Vietnam are strictly based on the principles of voluntarism which guide its work elsewhere in the world. Coercion is specifically forbidden by the UNFPA's founding mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1392">The UNFPA has been operating in Vietnam since 1977. Initially it worked with the Government but is now focused on more qualitative work involving the welfare of the mother and the child since 2001. Mother and child care has been a particularly big challenge in more remote rural areas and, in some of these areas, the UNFPA has been instrumental in assisting the opening of a series of reproductive health care and primary health care clinics. The UNFPA is also working to combat the spread of HIV-AIDS which, although still limited, is likely to spread significantly in the near future. These clinics and all the work the UNFPA carries out in Vietnam are guided by the principles of free choice, human rights, education and information.</p>

          <p eId="para_1394">At the Barcelona European Council in March 2002, those EU member states which had not yet reached the UN ODA expenditure target of 0.7% of GNP committed themselves individually to increasing their ODA volume within their respective budget allocation processes. Those member states at or above the target – Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Sweden – agreed to renew their efforts to maintain this position so that collectively a European Union average of 0.39% is reached by 2006. Member states that have not reached the current EU average of  0.33% agreed to strive to reach this figure at least by 2006. This EU commitment was confirmed at the international conference on financing for development at Monterrey, Mexico, later in March 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1395">In November 2002, the General Affairs and External Relations Council entrusted the Commission with the task of monitoring the implementation of this commitment and presenting it with a report in May next on progress achieved to date. Accordingly, the Commission in December last circulated member states with a questionnaire to consolidate information on national ODA expenditures throughout the Union. The data gathered from this exercise, when presented to the Council in May, will provide a first indication of the extent to which member states are on track in regard to the commitment made by the Union at Monterrey.</p>
          <p eId="para_1396">Ireland strongly supports the close monitoring of the Union's Monterrey commitment to increase its ODA expenditure. It has been estimated that the increase should translate into additional ODA from EU member states of $20 billion between 2002 and 2006.</p>

          <p eId="para_1415">The development of permanent arrangements between the EU and NATO has been envisaged since the early evolution of European Security and Defence Policy, and has been outlined in the conclusions of successive European Councils. A role for NATO in relation to ESDP arises from the need for the EU, which is not a military organisation, to have access to certain capabilities and resources such as transportation, headquarters and planning facilities which will be required for substantial crisis management missions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1416">Discussion on necessary arrangements in this regard had effectively stalled on the issue of participation of non-EU European members of NATO in ESDP. At the European Council held in Brussels on 24-25 October 2002, and on the basis of conclusions drawn at the previous Nice European Council, EU Heads of State and Government agreed on modalities in this area. At Copenhagen last December further negotiations took place in the context of general discussions on enlargement, particularly with regard to Turkey. EU Heads of State and Government concluded that agreement could be finalised and that necessary follow-up, including on arrangements for secure exchange of relevant information between the two organisations, could proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1417">Work between the two organisations has progressed well since then and has acquired additional significance by the imminent EU military operation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>

          <p eId="para_1420">Last year was the first in more than a decade not marked by violent conflict in the Western Balkans, the term used in referring to the countries of the former Yugoslavia and neighbouring Albania. Remarkable, if fragile, progress has been made in the past three years in the prevention of conflict and the establishment of functioning democratic structures throughout the region. Although it has been uneven, there has also been progress in many aspects of the economic and institutional reform processes and in working towards stability based on respect for human rights and the rule of law. Problems of ongoing concern include the prevalence of organised crime and unsatisfactory levels of cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.</p>
          <p eId="para_1421">The EU is taking the leading role in building peace and stability in the region. The overall framework for EU engagement is provided by the Stabilisation and Association Process, which holds out the prospect of eventual integration into European structures on the basis of the implementation of a very detailed series of political and economic reforms. A summit meeting, bringing together the heads of state and government of the five states in the region and of the EU member states, plus Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, will be held in Thessaloniki on 21 June 2003, the day after the European Council. The aim will be to strengthen the EU-Western Balkans relationship and to institute a process of enhanced political dialogue. I hope that the summit will reconfirm the commitment of the EU to addressing the individual circumstances of the countries of the region, in the context of improved regional cooperation. It should also clarify for the people of the region that the goal of eventual integration requires a recognition that the primary responsibility for driving reform rests with their democratically-elected governments. Ireland will play a full part in developing the EU-Western Balkans relationship during 2003 and especially during our EU Presidency in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1422">In relation to the individual countries of the region, if the referendum on EU membership is passed next month, Slovenia will sign its treaty of accession on 16 April 2003. Croatias economic and political progress enabled the conclusion of a stabilisation and association agreement with the EU in October 2001. Prime Minister Racan formally submitted Croatias application for membership of the EU to the Presidency on 21 February. The next step in the process will be the formulation of a commission opinion for consideration by the Council. This is expected to take at least a year to complete.</p>

In order to underpin the stability of Serbia and Montenegro, the democratic institutions of the state will have to be put in place within a relatively short time frame.

          <p eId="para_1427">The food security crisis in the Horn of Africa is of deep concern to the Government. The surveys undertaken by Concern, as well as information made available by the Embassy of Ireland in Addis Ababa and others, have informed the actions of the Government. Ireland Aid has moved rapidly to respond to the needs of the region since the crisis began last year. Emergency and humanitarian assistance provided by the Government for the region amounts to €9 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1428">Last month the Minister of State with responsibility for Development Cooperation and Human Rights, Deputy Tom Kitt, visited Ethiopia to view and assess the impact that the prolonged drought is having on the country. During the visit he held discussions with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles as well as other Ministers. He also met people from key development sectors such as the UN World Food Programme, the EU Commission and representatives of the NGO community. Discussions were held on ways of effectively mobilising resources for the more than 11 million people who will require food assistance in the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1429">On foot of the visit Deputy Kitt wrote to his EU counterparts to call for a redoubling of efforts to tackle this crisis. The key message is that there is still time to save millions of lives if action is taken quickly. This message applies particularly to those countries that have not yet responded to the emergency appeals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1430">On 18 January the Minister of State announced that, in the light of his visit to Ethiopia, he would make a new package of €1.25 million immediately available for food and other essential needs for the people of Ethiopia. The package comes on top of some €2.4 million already provided by the Government for emergency relief in Ethiopia since the food crisis began last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1431">Ireland's emergency assistance will be integrated closely with our long-term development activities in Ethiopia and thus address the underlying causes of drought and hunger.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_160">Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, took the opportunity during his visit to witness first hand the positive effects that Ireland's long-term assistance programme is having on many rural communities  in Ethiopia. The partnership for development established with the Ethiopian authorities represents the best way forward in tackling once and for all the structural problems associated with food insecurity in that country.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_161">In Eritrea latest UN reports indicate that more than 60% of its 3.3 million people are facing food shortages. On 17 February Deputy Kitt allocated emergency funding of €550,000 for food and other essential assistance for the people of Eritrea. This brings to €1.6 million Ireland's assistance to Eritrea in the past year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_162">Deputy Kitt raised the crisis in the Horn of Africa on a number of occasions with EU Commissioner Poul Nielson, most recently on 18 February in Dublin.

          <p eId="para_1449">The situation in Zimbabwe was discussed at the meeting of the External Relations Council on 27 January. It was clear to the Council that there has been no improvement in the human rights situation in Zimbabwe over the past year. The situation has deteriorated further with continued arbitrary arrests of opposition politicians and leaders of civil society, harassment of the media and politically motivated violence primarily instigated by State forces or groups supporting President Mugabe's ZANU-PF party.</p>
          <p eId="para_1450">Following on from the discussion at the External Relations Council, on 18 February the EU extended for a further 12 months the sanctions it had imposed on Zimbabwe. The sanctions include an embargo on the sale or supply to Zimbabwe of arms or equipment which could be used for internal repression; a freezing of funds or assets belonging to listed individuals; and a ban on travel to, or transit through, the EU by these individuals. Member states may exempt from the travel ban an individual attending an intergovernmental meeting which will promote democracy and respect for human rights in Zimbabwe. If one or more member state objects the exemption may still be granted by the Council acting by qualified majority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1451">The targeted sanctions are aimed solely at those whom the EU judges to be responsible for the violations of human rights in Zimbabwe and are designed not to adversely affect the ordinary people of Zimbabwe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1452">The food crisis in Zimbabwe has been greatly exacerbated by the political instability and by the Zimbabwean Government's land reform policies. Ireland remains committed, both bilaterally and through our membership of the EU, to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Zimbabwe.

          <p eId="para_1455">During its period of membership the Government's approach was to develop independently a national position on each of the issues before the Security Council, to articulate it firmly and consistently, and to work constructively and flexibility to help achieve, wherever possible, a fair and practical outcome in the broadest possible interest of the parties involved and of the international community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1456">We were sympathetic to the concerns and interests of the wider UN membership whose trust in Ireland was evident in the support it received as a candidate for election in October 2001. Those who supported us will have been fully aware that our membership of the Security Council would be conducted in line with the distinctive approach that Ireland has brought to the UN since it became a member in 1955, including in such areas as peacekeeping, disarmament, human rights and development cooperation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1457">As a member of the Council, Ireland sought to ensure that human rights and humanitarian needs remained central to the discussions in the Council.

          <p eId="para_1460">There were the 11 September attacks, and the ensuing military action in Afghanistan which commenced during Ireland's Presidency of the Council in October 2001. As Presidency, we were in a position to ensure that the actions taken were fully in accord with the letter and spirit of the UN Charter, that the Council was and remained fully involved, that the grave humanitarian situation of the Afghan people remained at the centre of its concerns, and that the UN was at the centre of reconstruction efforts.</p>

On disarmament, Ireland was actively involved in the discussions leading to the adoption of Resolution 1441 in November 2002. In these discussions Ireland, with others, insisted on the central role of the Security Council and the importance of offering Iraq the option of peaceful disarmament. We insisted that it was for the Council to determine the course of action in the event that Iraq refused this option, but that in such an event, the Council, in the words of Secretary General Annan, must assume its responsibilities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_177">On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Ireland argued at every stage for a strengthened Security Council and international role to break the impasse and for a balanced international approach. In the face of a deteriorating situation, Ireland played a central role in ensuring that the Security Council resumed its rightful position at the centre of efforts to resolve the conflict and that it formally enshrined in a resolution the concept of a two State solution. Ireland at all times called for parallel progress on the political, security and economic-humanitarian fronts. It supported the role of the Quartet in their work of developing a road map leading to the achievement of the two State solution.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_178">Ireland pressed for increased Council engagement with African issues, in particular for support for the peace processes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and Sierra Leone. Ireland was particularly active in calling for re-engagement by the UN with Somalia in opposition to the failed State argument often made about that country. Ireland's permanent representative was a particularly active chairman of the Angola Sanctions Committee, and proved to be its last chairman, with the Council lifting the sanctions in December 2002 as Angola's long civil war was brought to an end.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1462">Following the UN General Assembly Special Session on AIDS, the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria was established in January 2002. The fund is an independent public private partnership the purpose of which is to increase the volume of financial resources which can be allocated to controlling the spread of AIDS, TB and malaria in poorer countries. To date it has approved grants amounting to $1.5 billion in support of over 160 new programmes in 85 countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1463">The UN estimates that $10 billion is required each year to halt the progression of HIV in poorer countries. Though it was never intended that the fund would generate all of these resources, it was anticipated that its establishment would greatly increase the volume of financial resources available to respond to the threat of this disease. To date total pledges to the fund amount to just over $2 billion. Its secretariat has calculated that it will need to generate an additional $6.3 billion over the next two years to meet projected financing requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1464">Ireland has been a strong advocate of the fund since it was first proposed by the UN Secretary General in 2001. To date we have contributed €12.9 million to it. Ireland is one of only a small number of countries to have fully honoured its pledges of financial support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1465">It is the Government's view that the establishment of the global fund is a key element in the response of the international community to the threat posed by AIDS, TB and malaria.</p>
          <p eId="para_1466">We are concerned at the current shortfall in its funding requirements and at the fact that many developed countries have yet to honour pledges which had earlier been made. In our view, responsibility for accelerating financial contributions to the fund falls primarily on the G8 and other OECD states. The recent announcement by President Bush of an additional $1 billion to be contributed to the fund over the next five years is to be welcomed in this context. It is important also that efforts are made to increase the volume of donations from the corporate and private sectors.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_184">Having itself made a major financial commitment to the fund, the Government is also concerned that additional resources made available through this mechanism translate into effective programmes at country level. With this in mind we have commissioned a tracking study of the effect of the fund in four of Ireland Aid's programme countries, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique. Any future contributions to the fund will take into account the results of this study.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1472">On 5 February responsibility for the DÍON fund was transferred to my Department from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This was to comply with a recommendation of the task force on policy regarding emigrants which proposed that all Government funding for emigrant services should be brought together under the Vote for Foreign Affairs. It was not possible for me to seek additional funding for this year.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_185">The DÍON fund for this year is €2.573 million. While this is 5% less in euro terms than the figure for 2002, the appreciation in the value of the euro since then means that the sterling value of the fund will be maintained in 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_186">The funding that can be provided for services to emigrants this year has had to take account of the overall budgetary situation facing the Government. My hope is that the report of the task force on policy regarding emigrants will provide a template for developing these services in the future.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_187">Last October the Government established an interdepartmental working group to examine the recommendations of the task force with a view to submitting proposals to Government for future action. The report of the working group will be finalised shortly.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1474">My Department nominates election monitors to participate in election monitoring missions organised by international organisations of which Ireland is a member. For example, the Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the EU. Election monitors are selected from a register of qualified and skilled individuals maintained by the Agency for Personal Services Overseas. On occasion my Department may act on its own discretion to appoint a member of its staff as an election monitor.</p>

          <p eId="para_2982">I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 and 196 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2983">The current situation in Venezuela must be seen against the background of the socio-economic realities of the country. Venezuela is an oil rich nation where 66% of the people live below the poverty line and a further 21% exist in abject destitution without the basic necessities of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_2984">By 1998, notwithstanding the country's immense oil and other mineral wealth, 67% of Venezuelans were living on less than $2 a day.</p>
          <p eId="para_2985">In the Presidential elections of December 1998 a former army officer, Hugo Chávez, who had served a prison term for his part in an attempted coup in 1992, was swept to power with the largest majority in the country's democratic history.</p>
          <p eId="para_2986">In April 2002, a coup was mounted against President Chávez by elements in the main business federation and the oil industry trade union. However, he was returned to office within 48 hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_2987">Since that brief rupture of the constitutional order Ireland, and its EU partners, have supported efforts by the Organisation of American States, the United Nations Development Programme, and the Carter Centre to facilitate dialogue between the Government and the opposition alliance known as the Democratic Co-ordinator. This is based on OAS Resolution 833 of 2 December 2002 which calls for a constitutional, democratic, peaceful and electoral solution, which was also supported by President Carter.</p>
          <p eId="para_2988">On 15 January the organisation called the Group of Friends of Venezuela, composed of the Foreign Ministers of Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Portugal, Spain and the United States, was formed to support the OAS in its mission.</p>
          <p eId="para_2989">The conciliation efforts of the OAS and the group of friends were complicated by the general strike organised by the DC opposition with the avowed aim of forcing President Chávez from office.</p>
          <p eId="para_2990">Following the ending of the 63 day general strike, which caused great economic damage including to the crucial oil sector, President Chávez and the DC opposition on 18 February agreed a "Declaration against violence and in favour of peace and democracy", under the auspices of the OAS.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_290">Throughout the crisis Ireland and its EU partners have supported the efforts of the OAS – and more recently the group of friends organisation – as the main interface between the international community and Venezuela in dealing with the problems that beset that country. We have stressed the importance of cultivating the necessary spirit of tolerance in order to create a  climate of reconciliation among the people of Venezuela.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_291">Ireland and the EU are ready to respond to any recommendation which may be made by our partners, Portugal and Spain, and the other members of the Group of Friends of Venezuela.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_2992">In recent weeks Kurdish representatives in Turkey, northern Iraq, Europe and the US have drawn attention to serious concerns at the implications for Kurds of any hostilities in Iraq. On 25 February the regional assembly in northern Iraq voted unanimously for a resolution calling on neighbouring states not to intervene militarily in Iraq. A number of Kurdish organisations and individuals worldwide have also issued appeals against the involvement of any neighbouring country in northern Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_2993">The position of the Kurds is an issue that arises in any substantive discussion of the Iraqi situation. The Government has continued to work with our partners in the EU to ensure that our concerns about the human rights of Kurds are raised in contacts with the relevant Governments in the region. I welcomed the human rights reforms adopted in Turkey during 2002 which, if fully implemented, will enhance the cultural and ethnic rights of all citizens, including those of Kurdish origin. The embassy in Ankara continues to monitor human rights in Turkey. I recognise that the recent heightened tensions have increased the level of concern among Kurds throughout the region.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_294">The Government has spoken out and used its influence at every opportunity to underline the need for a peaceful solution to the Iraqi crisis, and the avoidance of a situation in which concerns such as those being voiced by many Kurdish people could be realised. In addition to the threat of large scale loss of life, I have called attention  to the risk that conflict could destabilise a region which is already volatile. I continue to believe that it is possible for the situation in Iraq to be resolved without resort to the use of force. I again call on the Iraqi authorities to comply immediately and fully with their obligations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_295">The Government is concerned about the potential impact of military action on Kurdish populations in the region. It will continue to urge all Governments involved to exercise the greatest care to ensure that the rights and physical security of these populations are fully respected.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3057">I take it that this question refers to the concerns expressed recently by a number of non-governmental organisations over the new EC regulation on co-operation with Asian and Latin American  countries which is currently before the Council and the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_3058">The proposed regulation is aimed at providing a new legal framework for Community co-operation with the countries of Asia and Latin America. The new regulation will replace Regulation (EEC) No. 443/92, which was adopted on 25 February 1992.</p>
          <p eId="para_3059">In general terms, co-operation and assistance under the proposed regulation will take account of the objectives of development policy, as defined in Article 177 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and further developed in the Joint Statement of the Council and the Commission on 10 November 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_3060">At a European Parliament hearing last month a number of NGO representatives were critical of the proposed new legislation because it did not firmly establish the goal of the regulation as that of poverty reduction. They also argued that the Commission was seeking to reduce the regulation to the status of a legal enabling instrument without the policy content required to fulfil the above mentioned treaty objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_3061">I regard the current renegotiation of the EC's existing ALA regulation as an important opportunity to improve the effectiveness of the Community's development programmes with the countries of Asia and Latin America. The Commission's draft for a new regulation has a number of positive features, for example, its proposal for the untying of aid, for more streamlined management procedures and, above all, its central objective of poverty reduction and the promotion of sustainable development. In line with the primacy of poverty reduction in Ireland Aid policies we will continue to emphasise the central role which this objective must have in the new regulation.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_318">Negotiations are ongoing across the range of topics involved including, in relation to trade related issues in the areas of agriculture, services, trade related intellectual property rights, dispute settlement and trade and development. Ireland participates in the negotiations as part of the European Union and the EU and its member states are contributing substantially to the deliv ery of key outputs under the Doha work programme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_319">As a small open economy, particularly reliant on exports for economic development, Ireland supports a strengthening of the WTO and of the multilateral trading system and an ambitious approach to the elimination of remaining barriers to trade in goods and services. Issues of importance to Ireland under the current round are the conclusion of agreements in the areas of agriculture, services, market access and trade measures to assist the economies of developing countries in particular, focusing on how to better integrate developing countries into the global trading system.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_320">Specifically, in the area of intellectual property, efforts are continuing to respond to concerns about the possible implications of patent protection for access to affordable medicines in poor countries to overcome public health crises. The EU and Ireland are supportive of early agreement on this issue in order to assist those poorer countries with limited or no manufacturing capacity.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3084">Central Statistics Office trade statistics indicate that a total of 335,486 pigs were exported from Ireland to end November 2002. Revenue from veterinary inspection fees on such exports yielded €98,435 in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_3085">In so far as the procedure for certifying exports is concerned, trade in live animals, including pigs, between EU member states is governed by EU legislation requiring, <i>inter alia,</i> that animals must be accompanied by appropriate health certification and properly identified.</p>
          <p eId="para_3086">Prior to the foot and mouth disease crisis in 2001 special arrangements were established by bilateral agreement with the Northern authorities. These exempted trade in pigs and sheep on the island from the full rigour of normal intra-community trade requirements. During the course of the foot and mouth disease crisis on this island trade in pigs and other susceptible species with Northern Ireland was prohibited. Since the resumption of trade in certain live animals between the North and South, and in the light of the experience of the foot and mouth disease, it was agreed by both sides that normal intra-community rules should apply to trade in live animals.</p>
          <p eId="para_3087">The counties which are involved in the export of pigs are Cavan, Cork, Donegal, Kerry, Kildare, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford. The numbers of pigs exported from each of these counties is not kept in such a format as to be readily accessible.</p>
          <p eId="para_3088">Under the North-South Ministerial Council an animal health steering group was established. Its objective is the development of an all-island animal health strategy. The aligning of policies and measures is fundamental to the development of the strategy. Until these are further progressed, and approved by the British authorities and the European Commission as providing sufficient equivalent guarantees regarding the animal health status in both jurisdictions, the need for intra community health certificates for trade in live pigs to and from Northern Ireland will remain.</p>
          <p eId="para_3089">For the present full intra-community trade rules will apply to cross-Border trade in live animals. Within the parameters of those rules, which operate successfully throughout the EU, my Department will continue to facilitate the trade in pigs to the North. I am satisfied that my Department has been in a position to provide the necessary health certification for pigs being exported.</p>

          <p eId="para_3098">EUROSTAT is part of the EU Commission and, as such, is independent of member states. It is the statistical agency of the Community and exercises particular functions under EU regulations in regard to establishing and applying the accounting rules which govern the treatment of the general Government balance. The question of how public investment projects funded by the private sector impact on the GGB is one that is determined in this way. The CSO works closely with EUROSTAT in interpreting these rules as regards Irish projects. Both EUROSTAT and the CSO are bound by the same EU regulations when deciding whether a particular PPP project is outside or inside general Government. My Department, in conjunction with the CSO, makes returns to the EU of the GGB. This measures the net budget situation all central and local government and public bodies funded by the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_3099">One of the general principles underpinning the EU regulations which define the rules governing general Government is that if a deferred financing investment project, for example a PPP project, is funded by user charges with no Government funding, and transfers the main risks to the private sector, the upfront capital costs are not counted as part of Government spending. If the financial charges on a deferred financing project are funded by the Government with little risk to the private sector, the upfront capital costs are counted as part of Government spending during the period when the spending on the project takes place and thus become part of the calculation of the GGB in that period. The capital costs of the bundle of five PPP schools which is funded by Government over a period of 25 years were regarded by EUROSTAT as a charge against the GGB over the construction phase. Any further deals structured on the same basis will also come within the general Government balance during the construction phase.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_322">As the issues regarding the application of these rules can be complex, I have established a standing committee to advise Departments on the GGB implications of projects financed by the private sector or the NDFA and generally to assist the CSO in its work. The committee consists of nominees from the Department of Finance, the Department of the Taoiseach, the NDFA, the CSO, the Department of Transport and the Department of Education and Science. An independent expert will also be appointed to the committee shortly. Ireland is represented on a separate EUROSTAT task force on the accounting treatment of PPPs by the Central Statistics Office.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3103">In 1995, Scots guardsmen James Fisher and Mark Wright were convicted of the murder in 1992 of Peter McBride, a 19 year old father of two from north Belfast. They were released on 2 September 1998 by the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. Mowlam, following a review by the Life Sentence Review Board. Dr. Mowlam said that the cases had been considered earlier than usual because of the circumstances under which the murder took place and the lack of premeditation. After serving six years, both men were readmitted to the British army despite their murder convictions. The victim's family has since been seeking their dismissal from the British army but several appeals of army board decisions to retain them, the most recent in January 2003, have been unsuccessful.</p>
          <p eId="para_3104">I originally outlined the Government's objection to the continued retention of Mr. Fisher and Mr. Wright in the British army in an Adjournment debate in December 2000, in which I told the Dáil that the Government was deeply disturbed by the decision to retain as serving members of that army two men convicted in a court of law of murder. I added that the decision sent a negative message to the people of Northern Ireland and to the McBride family. I stressed that it was vital that the security forces not only uphold but be seen to uphold the best standards of conduct demanded by a democratic society in order to move forward in the North, as we must. We have regularly pressed the British Government on this issue since then. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, met Mrs. Jean McBride on 28 November 2002. He expressed the Government's concerns about the handling of this case since the guardsmens' release from prison in 1998. He assured Mrs. McBride that both the Government would continue to pursue these concerns directly with the British Government at every appropriate opportunity.</p>

          <p eId="para_3108">I am aware of the suggestions to which the Deputy refers. I do not share the assessment that a merger between the EU and NATO, or elements thereof, is a likely development. The nature and structures of each organisation remain distinct from the other, particularly in so far as mutual defence aspects are concerned. While NATO has a commitment to mutual defence as a core element of its membership, the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy is focused on humanitarian and crisis management tasks. A comparison can be made between the roles of the EU and NATO, as both organisations have focused on crisis management and peace support operations. Co-operation between the EU and NATO in this regard has taken place in accordance with principles established by the Feira and Nice European Councils. The principles provide that there should be full respect for the autonomy of EU decision making, recognition of the different nature of the EU and NATO and no discrimination against any of the member states.</p>

          <p eId="para_3110">The Government shares the Deputy's concern about the issues raised in his question. It believes that every effort should be made to resolve the Iraq crisis without recourse to the use of military force, as it is concerned that such force could destabilise a region that is already volatile, particularly in view of the conflict between Israel and Palestine. The Iraqi leadership has refused to comply with its obligations for 12 years and it is to be regretted that only the credible threat that further non-compliance with Security Council resolutions will lead to military action appears to hold any prospect of inducing a change in this attitude. The Government has repeatedly expressed its preference for a solution that would avoid the use of force, and it hopes that the Security Council's determination, expressed in Resolution 1441, will convince Iraq of the seriousness of its situation and the need for it to comply without delay. Ireland considers that scaling back expenditure on arms could contribute to a reduction in tensions regionally and globally, with consequent advantages for economic and social development.</p>
          <p eId="para_3111">The figures concerning hunger currently emanating from Africa are stark. The UN world food programme estimates that at least 28 million people will be affected by the food shortages in the horn of Africa and southern Africa. At least 38 million people are at risk in Africa and the figures seem to be increasing on a daily basis. The disaster that is unfolding is unprecedented in its scale and extent. The international community, including Ireland, is responding to Africa's food needs. The world food programme has primary responsibility for the purchase and distribution of food assistance to those most in need. The programme is feeding over 22 million people across Africa, a number that is set to rise as new donor contributions come on stream. A further 16 million people are being assisted by other organisations and agencies. The problem could worsen as more people drop into the most vulnerable category.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_325">In the short-term, the international community has a duty to respond more generously to ensure that food stocks are adequate to meet the needs of the poorest people and to save millions of lives. In the long-term, the situation will not improve until the issues of economic collapse, poor management and HIV and AIDS are fully addressed. Ireland Aid, the Government's official aid programme, delivered over €20 million in emergency and humanitarian assistance to Africa in 2002. €16 million was targeted at the affected countries  in southern Africa and the horn of Africa. Funding was allocated to key international agencies such as the world food programme and Irish and international NGOs. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who has special responsibility for development assistance, visited the famine stricken regions of southern Africa and the horn of Africa in 2002 and in January 2003. The visits gave the Minister of State an opportunity to view the food security crisis at first hand and to meet and speak with those directly involved. A number of Ireland Aid officials have visited the regions and continue to monitor the situation closely.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_326">Ireland's humanitarian support is complemented by political action. The Government worked closely in 2002 with its EU and UN partners to develop strategies to address immediate food needs in Africa at national and regional levels. Ireland will continue to try to deliver effective assistance to those most in need in the parts of Africa affected by famine and the Government will use every opportunity to highlight the issue internationally. We will stimulate and support efforts to address the fundamental causes of food insecurity. In 2002, Ireland delivered over €80 million in long-term development support to southern Africa. Africa will continue to be the most important region for Ireland's long-term development assistance and emergency support.</summary>

      the current situation in Shannon Airport regarding the refuelling of planes on their way to the Gulf.

          <p eId="para_3113">The Deputy will be aware of my statement to the Dáil on 29 January, which set out clearly and comprehensively the arrangements regarding the refuelling of aircraft in Shannon Airport. The situation remains as set out in this statement. The arrangements for granting permission for foreign military aircraft to land are the same for all countries. Permission is granted under the terms of the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952, which prohibits foreign military from flying over or landing in the State, except by the express invitation or permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Permission is normally granted on condition that the aircraft is unarmed, not involved in intelligence gathering and not engaged in military exercises. Civilian aircraft carrying unarmed troops are treated as normal passenger freight and do not require special authorisation to land. Permission is required for wearing foreign military uniform in the State, however.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_327">Under the terms of the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973, as amended in 1989, civilian aircraft seeking to carry weapons or munitions require a specific exemption from the Minister for Transport from the prohibition that  usually applies. The civilian carriers involved routinely request such exemptions from the Department of Transport to carry personal weapons and any other military cargo falling within the scope of the 1973 order. I have made it clear that the Government will review the current arrangements in the event of a UN decision to sanction military action against Iraq, or in the event of an action outside the UN framework by any country or group of countries.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3115">I do not agree with the Deputy's contention. The Government remains totally committed to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and is showing full and practical respect for all its provisions. The Deputy is aware that all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, including that to which he referred, are intended to bring true and lasting peace to the North and to establish a new beginning of harmonious relationships between North and South and among these islands. That peace was achieved at all is due in no small measure to the invaluable support provided by successive US Presidents and Administrations and the US Congress. The Government's approach to the implementation of the Agreement and to Ireland's broader international responsibilities has been entirely consistent. It is designed to optimise the prospects for lasting peace and stability on this island and at international level. The UN Secretary General, Mr. Annan, and the head of UNMOVIC, Dr. Blix, have confirmed that the pressure placed on Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime has had an impact. Weapons inspectors would not be back in Iraq without that pressure. In that context, and in acknowledgement of its international responsibilities, the Government has permitted the use of Shannon Airport as a refuelling point for US aircraft and service personnel.</p>

          <p eId="para_3120">Ireland joined the United Nations on 14 December 1955 and has had a continuous presence in UN peacekeeping operations since 1958. Irish personnel have served on over 50,000 individual missions on UN peacekeeping operations. Ireland's involvement in peacekeeping represents a major contribution to international peace and security. It is a record of which the Irish people can justly be proud. Some 277 Irish personnel – 226 troops, 31 military observers and 20 gardaí – are currently serving on nine UN missions. Tragically, 84 Irish personnel have died while serving as UN peacekeepers. The Deputy's question refers to the attempted sidelining of the UN but, far from being sidelined, the Security Council is working intensively on a wide range of issues of international peace and security. During its recent Security Council membership, Ireland worked hard to ensure that the Security Council assumed responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and that its primary role in that regard was fully respected.</p>

The orthodontic guidelines were issued by my Department in 1985 and are still in use. The orthodontic guidelines are used to ensure that orthodontic resources are prioritised for and applied equitably to the most severe cases. When a health board orthodontist decides that a child is in clinical need of orthodontic treatment in accordance with the criteria, he or she is then placed on a treatment waiting list. The guidelines are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those in  greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. A child who has been assessed and comes within the guidelines will remain on the waiting list until treatment commences.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_344">The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that at the end of December 2002 the board's orthodontic service was providing orthodontic treatment to 1,496 patients. This is an increase of 139 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the boards orthodontic service when compared with the equivalent figure at the end of June 2002. I expect that this activity level will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services continue to impact positively on the capacity of the service.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_3568">As the Deputy is aware, sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 allow health boards the discretion to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for each health board in the context of meeting the requirements of the subvention scheme within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act 1996.</p>
          <p eId="para_3569">The information requested by the Deputy is not routinely collated in my Department. My Department has therefore asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to provide the information, which will be forwarded to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_3570">In relation to the specific case raised by the Deputy, responsibility for the provision of health services in Cavan rests with the North-Eastern Health Board. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply direct to him as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <p eId="para_3586">To begin with, I feel it is necessary to point out that access to retained data for the purpose of the investigation of serious crime and in the interest of the security of the State is already allowed in law. Section 98 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 as amended by the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 allows for the disclosure of information concerning the use made of telecommunications services in a number of circumstances on a request from a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent and a member of the Defence Forces not below the rank of colonel. Fundamentally, what is now proposed is that, following on from EU directives concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector, a time limit be set on the period for which certain data on telecommunications usage must be retained for possible access, under specific circumstances and subject to specific safeguards, by the Garda Síochána for the investigation of serious crime and by the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces in the interest of the security of the State. The time limit being considered is three years, which is shorter than the period which licensed operators historically retained such information for billing purposes.</p>

I am aware of the report of the all-party parlia mentary Internet group to which the Deputy refers. I must point out that this group is fundamentally different in nature to a Dáil committee as it is a self-appointed group of Members of Parliament with an interest in Internet issues. That being said, all views from whatever source in relation to this issue are being considered including the report of that group. I do not propose to refer the issue to a Dáil committee at this stage.

          <p eId="para_3592">The appropriation account for the Irish Prison Service for 2002 is currently being finalised and as such the figures given in this reply are provisional. The outturn, including capital expenditure, for 2002 was €298 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_3593">The Irish Prison Service is committed to helping prisoners to develop their sense of responsibility and encouraging those attitudes and skills which will assist them to return to society with the best chance of leading law abiding and self-supporting lives after release.</p>
          <p eId="para_3594">The service employs a number of means to encourage prisoners to bring about positive development within themselves, including: individual and group counselling on offending issues; programmes in the areas of education, vocational training and lifeskills; drug treatment; specific programmes to address criminogenic factors, thinking skills, anger management and sex offenders treatment programmes; one-to-one counselling and support; and facilitating the involvement of voluntary organisations in providing appropriate prisoner support services. These programmes are delivered by a wide range of specialist services that operate in the prisons, such as psychologists, teachers, probation and welfare officers and prison officers. It is not possible to disaggregate, with any degree of accuracy, from the total Irish Prison Service spending, the element that relates to crime prevention measures or drug treatment services. However, the following brief explanation and approximate costs in relation to various programmes and specialist services may be of interest to the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_3595">Education in prison is provided in partnership with a range of educational agencies in the community including the vocational education committees, public library services, colleges and the Arts Council. Broad programmes of education are made available which generally follow an adult education approach. Since the 1990s, most prison education units have become significantly involved in areas that address offending behaviour or the personal problems of prisoners, through pre-release courses, post-release support, health education, addiction awareness, anger management, group skills, parenting etc. Very often such courses or activities are run on a multi-disciplinary basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_3596">A sum of €1.1 million was expended on this service in 2002 – this figure does not include the salaries of the 215 whole-time equivalent teachers who work in the prison, who are paid from the Vote of the Department of Education.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_346">The work and training programme operates at each prison. As well as organising necessary services such as catering and laundry, it also provides work and training opportunities for prisoners whilst ensuring a high quality of service  delivery within the prison. The programme provides structured vocational training so that people in custody can acquire the skills they may require to obtain employment after their release. A sum of €2.4 million was expended on this programme in 2002, a further €500,000 was expended on manufacturing.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_347">The objective of the Connect project is to create effective pathways for prisoners to follow from custody to employment after release. Central to this is the preparation of an individualised vocational programme plan which takes a holistic perspective towards prisoners vocational needs and which involves the prisoner in planning how to use the services that are available both inside and outside the prison system in a co-ordinated manner to achieve his/her goals. A sum of €6.517 million was expended on this project in 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_348">The probation and welfare service has an active role during the course of the prisoner's sentence in helping maintain links with family and community agencies, encouraging offenders to address their offending behaviour and engaging prisoners in individual counselling and group counselling programmes such as offending behaviour, addiction, violence and sex offending. The service also provides supervision in certain cases under temporary release provisions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_349">Prison chaplains promote the spiritual and pastoral welfare of prisoners and also participate with other services in the secular care of offenders. The work of the chaplaincy service involves extensive contact with prisoners on personal and family matters as well as other issues which arise in relation to their confinement in prison.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_350">The principal aim of the psychology service is to provide, in co-operation with others, a generic therapeutic service to prisoners aimed at addressing their psychological needs and at reducing re-offending.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_351">The prison service adopts a multi-faceted approach to drug treatment. This involves provision of detoxification, methadone maintenance, education programmes, an information forum, addiction counselling, drug therapy programmes and the operation of drug-free areas.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_352">The Irish prison service expended €4.5 million on the provision of medical services to the prisoner population in 2002. It is not possible to further analyse this figure into the amount spent on treatment of prisoners who have drug problems.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_353">A sex offender treatment programme has been operating in Arbour Hill Prison since 1994. A similar programme has been operating in the Curragh Place of Detention since 2000. Plans to develop a new multi-disciplinary sex offender treatment programme are well advanced. A steering group overseeing this work is in place with a research consultant engaged in preparing a treatment manual for this purpose. This programme will see prison officers directly engaged in co- delivering a structured rehabilitation programme for sex offenders.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_354">The thinking skills course is an offending behaviour programme delivered by multi-disciplinary teams, including prison officers. The aim of the course is to equip participants with a range of problem-solving skills and social skills, that will make it easier for them to avoid criminal behaviour and to engage in legitimate activities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_355">The Children Act 2001 introduces a wide range of innovative measures that will provide a statutory framework for the future development of the juvenile justice system in accordance with modern thinking and best international practice. Three Government Departments have a role in implementing the Act; the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science.</summary>

Garda juvenile liaison officers are specially trained members of the Garda Síochána responsible for administering the programme at the local level.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_357">In relation to Part 4, sections 29 to 43 of the Children Act 2001, which concern the holding of Garda conferences in respect of an offending child, I am pleased to report that, in May 2002, a sum of €76,000 was provided to the Garda authorities to conduct further training of members and to further support the cost of conferencing. A further €56,180 was allocated to this purpose in November, 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_358">Garda youth diversion projects are crime prevention initiatives which adopt a multi-agency partnership approach to tackling crime and anti-social behaviour at community level.

        <summary eId="sum_359">Through a combination of intervention and prevention programmes, Garda youth diversion projects aim to prevent crime through community and multi-agency co-operation and to improve the quality of life within the community; divert young people from becoming involved in criminal/anti-social behaviour; provide suitable activities to facilitate personal development and encourage civic responsibility; support and improve Garda-community relations.</summary>

As the Deputy may be aware, I have recently given a commitment to replace, as soon as possible, all traditional padded cells with new safety observation cells which, while soft-surfaced so as to protect the prisoner from self-harm, will fully meet the needs and respect the dignity of prisoners in every way consistent with his or her safety. New guidelines for the use of the special cells will be issued to ensure that they are used under strict supervision and only as a last resort. In this context, an implementation group has been set up in the prison service to determine the most appropriate design for these cells and other related matters and to draft revised guidelines for the future use of these cells. I expect that this group will present their recommendations to me in the near future.</p>

      his views on whether the notification of landowners whose land has been designated as a proposed special protection area does not constitute adequate consultation; and his further views on whether such a consultative process involving individual landowners, local elected representatives, the farming organisations, local community groups and independent scientific experts is essential prior to the publication of the proposed SPAs in early April 2003.

          <p eId="para_3604">The Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002 was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 18 December 2002. As an exceptional measure, a circular letter containing provisional guidance issued to each local authority, by e-mail on 19 December. This was necessary in the light of the upcoming holiday period and the significant changes to the housing supply provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000, including the repeal of the provisions under which planning permissions would have expired on 31 December. The Act came into force on 24 December 2002. On 7 January 2003 a further circular was issued to local authorities, by e-mail, in relation to the Act.</p>
