      [15757/03]

        </question>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_1">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_3">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">The total cost of the communications unit since June 2002 is €261,628. It should be noted that €58,358 of this is a direct cost to my Department with, on average, €40,645 being borne by the five other Departments which have staff seconded to the unit. Since January 2003, the cost is €93,497, with €38,090 of this being a direct cost to my Department and, on average, €11,081 being  borne by the five other Departments which have staff seconded to the unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">The unit provides a media information service to Ministers and their Departments. It furnishes news updates and transcripts which ensure that Departments are kept informed of any relevant news developments in a fast and efficient manner. In this way, Departments are able to provide a better service to the public. The communications units works an 18 hour day, based on a flexible rota of three working shifts. The unit is staffed by six established civil servants, five of whom are seconded from other Departments. The work of the unit means that Departments have greatly reduced their use of external companies and ensures they no longer duplicate work such as transcripts and tapes. It is conservatively estimated that the communications unit saves Departments approximately €175,000 in a full year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_6">The Taoiseach described the essence of the work done by the communications unit as informing Ministers and Departments of relevant news developments. Would he admit that part of the work of this unit is to  monitor the media appearances of Opposition politicians – work that can only be described as political?</p>
          <p eId="para_7">Will the Taoiseach comment on the remarks made by one of his former employees, Mr. Whelan, who referred to systematic failure in the Government's communications system, particularly in the defence of the Department of the Taoiseach?</p>
          <p eId="para_8">Does the Taoiseach agree that, at a time when hospital beds are being closed and the disability sector is protesting on the streets, it is obscene for Departments to be spending €9 million in a year on public relations?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_9">I do not believe the communications unit does any political work. I have said many times that it monitors what comes over in the various Dublin-based and national forms of media in the order in which they come. The unit makes no political comment and carries out no analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">I have no comment to make about any former members of staff. The communications unit is conservatively estimated, according to the old figures, to cost about €175,000. I am not sure what the figure would be on an updated basis – there have not been any updates for a number of years to work out what the cost would be. The communications unit spends €261,000 in full costs in a year and I do not think that is an excessive amount for providing a service to Departments, not only to Ministers but to about 100 users across Departments.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_11">I assume the information is supplied to Ministers and Departments electronically – it is hardly posted out in written form. If that is the case, and no political work is involved and it is that harmless, it should be circulated to everyone in the Oireachtas by those electronic means. It only involves the push of a button. Will the Taoiseach do that so we would all know what we are competing with? Will the Taoiseach comment on the fact that there is an unprecedented level of anger in the community and the fact that the Government spending €9 million on public relations in one year is unjustifiable given present circumstances? He is, after all, the Head of Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_13">Today, in a written reply to another question, I have given the full costs of the media in my Department. Other than the GIS, I do not have any contracts or individuals involved in such work. I am not sure where the Deputy got this figure or how it is made up but I am answering for my Department and there is no such figure. An electronic copy is available to over 100 users throughout Departments.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_17">An electronic copy is available to over 100 users throughout all Departments. Like any other information that is drafted or put together within the Government, the service is available to the Government side. I noted when Deputy Kenny was asking these questions that it was obvious the media had received lists of the format for the day previous and the Deputy would have seen that there was nothing other than the main items and a brief summary. That is all that is involved.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_11">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_18">At a time when his colleague, the Minister for Finance, is asking all Departments to examine their range of responsibilities regarding cutbacks, can the Taoiseach identify what cutbacks he considers appropriate within the communications unit? Does he believe at a time of cutbacks in terms of essential services to many deserving people in real need, as demonstrated outside the gates of this House only this morning, that a communications unit is a priority? Does the Taoiseach agree that the time spent by people in this particular unit within his Department might be better served in formulating and implementing Government policy and Government commitments which have, by and large, not been carried through by Government during the past 12 months since its re-election, rather than watching the media reaction to Government or Opposition spokespersons?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_12">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_19">The Deputy will be aware that €38,000 million is being spent across services in all Departments. We are talking here about expenditure of €261,000. The staff engaged in the unit provide a good service in ensuring that Ministers, Ministers of State and across 100 people in the system are aware of what is going on and are thereby able to react and deal with the issues of concern to the public in order that they can provide a more efficient service through their Departments. In so far as any changes under the embargo are concerned, the last individual who left the post has not been replaced, as is happening in many areas of the public service. The unit is now working with one person less.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_13">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_20">Does the Taoiseach intend to allow the communications unit to continue in business? In recent times it must have been dispiriting for Ministers to have reflected back to them the accurate but restrained coverage of their performance in the media. Does the Taoiseach think this could demoralise his Cabinet, that he had better shut it down and make a saving and, perhaps, find some positive use for the money?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_14">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_21">No. I do not intend to go back to the old system where outside agencies were used to get transcripts and tapes, thereby costing considerable sums of money and probably producing material a week behind, rather than the present system where there is a prompt service and people know what is happening and what are the issues and where staff in ministerial offices or elsewhere are aware of what is going on. That is an important service covering 18 hours of the day. It is neither reasonable nor likely that officeholders or senior civil servants would be in a position, during their busy working days, to watch issues, when a few sheets on the media can provide can provide them with these issues. When people want transcripts or data they can get them. As Deputy Rabbitte is aware, much of the national news each day is made up not only of what we say but of many other international and domestic issues.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_15">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_22">I am worried about demoralising the Taoiseach's colleagues.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_24">Does the Taoiseach agree that when one takes away the gloss, the communications unit is really the Taoiseach's own personal listening post and that of the Government? Instead of having some objective public service role, it is an advance warning and alert system for Government to be used for nakedly political purposes and to warn Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats of trouble that may be brewing in the long grass in order that the Taoiseach and Ministers can take pre-emptive strikes to try to minimise damage to themselves. Is not that the real reason for the communications unit?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_18">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_25">That is not the reason; there is nothing pre-emptive about it. The Deputy will be aware from listening to his car radio on the way to the House that the benefit is they—</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_29">The benefit is that information is communicated over 18 hours each day by five people to about 100 users to let people know what is happening. When they want tapes or transcripts – a service which has existed for years – it is provided efficiently at a reasonable cost. Successive Governments provided the service and according to the last figures available, which are those for 1997, the cost was €175,000. If Ministers or individuals in Departments become aware of something and take action, it is a good thing. It helps the efficiency of the system.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_23">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_30">Recently, the Taoiseach's colleague, the Minister for Finance, stated that when a Government is re-elected the media and the public take it out on its members. Does the Taoiseach agree with that view? Should members of the public direct their anger at the Government's failure to deliver on commitments made during the general election campaign in May 2002 at the media rather than at the Taoiseach and his colleagues? Is this the ethos of the Taoiseach's colleagues and associates in the communications unit?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_24">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_31">That is not the ethos. The Minister for Finance was following up on a comment he made a year ago in which he predicted what would happen in the year ahead. He was simply demonstrating that he had been right.</p>

To help ensure an excellent service to our customers, my Department will also participate in a pilot for the new quality customer service charter. My Department has been involved in providing central co-ordination and impetus to the information society and e-public service agenda. Internally, it has prepared an e-strategy and is engaged in a number of e-Government projects, notably the e-Cabinet model which it is planned to introduce during 2003. Work is ongoing on a number of human resource management initiatives, including the reorientation of the human resource function, the upgrading of training facilities and the develop ment of an integrated human resource strategy and staff development plan. The human resource strategy will support the objectives of the Department identified in its strategy statement and business plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">The performance management and development system underpins this strategy. A gender equality policy for the Department was agreed as part of the partnership process and circulated to all staff and most of my departmental staff have received equality awareness training. My Department is among the leading Departments in implementing the new management information framework and a new financial management computer system was introduced in July 2002. The approach used by my Department has since been adopted as a model by a number of other Departments. My Department is also one of the lead Departments in implementing the new human resource management system chosen for the Civil Service, which went live in the Department in March of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">A key mechanism to verify that targets are robust and to monitor the effectiveness of the implementation of the strategic management initiative in my Department is the performance verification group, which comprises management, trade union and independent members. In relation to the current performance verification process, an action plan for my Department has been developed establishing performance indicators regarding the implementation of the provisions on co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change set out in Sustaining Progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">The Department's action plan has been informed by the service-wide evaluations of the strategic management initiative which were undertaken recently. Within my Department, the modernisation programme is subject to regular review. It is monitored on a regular basis by the change management working group, which is a sub-group of the partnership committee, the partnership committee itself and the management advisory committee, where it is a standing agenda item at their fortnightly meetings. Progress regarding modernisation is also outlined in my Department's annual progress report. To date, I am satisfied with my Department's contribution to achieving the Government's objectives through the implementation of its strategy, including the modernisation objective.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">I refer the Taoiseach to the studies on the SMI carried out by the NESC and PA Consulting, both of which found serious deficiencies in the way in which public projects are managed by Government on behalf of the people in terms of value for money and control of public expenditure. The NESC said that neither Government of the traditional kind, nor social partnership as it currently exists, are capable of meeting the key challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">Is it not a failure of management to find the lunacy at the Red Cow roundabout, or the mad  cow roundabout as it is known, whereby the Luas is to cross the busiest intersection in the country, or to find a major project like the Dublin Port tunnel which is incapable of taking thousands of trucks per day? Surely, therefore, responsibility for the failure of the strategic management initiative in managing major public projects must be placed firmly at the door of the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">I could get into debating the mad cow roundabout, the Red Cow roundabout or whatever cow the Deputy wishes to talk about. However, as far as the Dublin Port tunnel is concerned, I am aware of the issue and I hope nobody changes the current height restriction to cater for a few large trucks which have bedevilled my own community for years. I have a very simple view on whether trucks of any height or size should be allowed to plough through the area if they wish, and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, is following that view. The height restriction is applicable and people cannot bring any height of truck they like into the country. If people do not wish to bring their vehicles here  they need not bother. That would not worry me one iota.</p>

          <p eId="para_52">The NESC report pointed out that 67% of public servants were unhappy with the way that underperformance was being dealt with, while the partnership agreement contains vague commitments on value for money and improved efficiency and productivity. Does the Taoiseach believe that the SMI, and the Government, are in a position to achieve more measurable and effective results in terms of the benchmarking awards, for example, to which public servants are properly entitled, but in respect of which there is a responsibility to deliver more measurable, real and effective services to the public who pay for them?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_53">I agree and that is included in Sustaining Progress, which moves on from the objectives of earlier partnership programmes. Action plans, a verification process, agreed targets, and an input by staff through trades union representatives are correct measures, and increases should be based upon performance and delivery under these measures. I am opposed to the idea of these systems being put in place and increases being given regardless of whether people work them or not. There was considerable debate in setting up the last programme about how to verify service improvements, but this programme includes agreed verification mechanisms. They are not one-sided mechanisms designed by management or the Government. There is an agreed mechanism to deal with what has to change, what is to be delivered by the change management unit, a verification system and areas in which the management side wants to see progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">An obvious area in this regard is the increased use of technology in Departments and other flexibilities management is seeking to secure. This is included in Sustaining Progress and the pay increases provided for will be based on verification of these aspects by a group which includes members from the trade union group. That is the correct approach as I do not believe the State can afford to pay out large sums of money which, while they may be correctly awarded, are given without any return. The entire agreement is predicated on this.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_59">The Deputy's last questions deal with the national health strategy and should be directed to the Minister. The PA report on the implementation of the strategic management initiative indicated that there were still deficiencies and that more attention should be paid to customer service plans, the use of technology and a change agenda. The report suggests how this can be monitored and recommends that a Secretaries General group should be actively engaged, as is now the case, and that various committee structures be established to ensure that change occurs. It also recommends the involvement of a considerable number of civil servants in the process and that meetings should be focused and not too lengthy. These initiatives are working.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">From the point of view of civil servants, these developments mean that their jobs are more interesting, they have a greater awareness of developments and they have an input into their departmental plan. I have addressed many seminars dealing with this issue and the feedback from civil servants is that they consider they are more involved and active and that they have a say, although they would like it to be greater.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">The report also shows that the Civil Service is far better managed and more effective than it was a decade ago. It points out that the modernisation programme has undoubtedly been the critical factor and driver of change in Departments and that more has been achieved on the outward facing issues of openness and transparency. The report encourages greater efforts on this aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">The report also identifies what should be done in terms of human resource management and financial management systems. The latter was modelled on my Department and commenced last June. Many other Departments are using that model. The report also provides data on information systems and the modernisation programme, and includes the recommendation that the present programme be repositioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">Not all Secretaries General serve on the Secretaries General group, but its membership is rotated. It is the committee that drives change through for civil servants and although I am not saying it has come to the end of what the PA evaluations contained, progress has certainly been made and the initiatives that have been taken are good. Individual civil servants feel that they have a  more meaningful role in, and a better input into, their jobs and also know that their work is now monitored in a different way than it was previously. The strategic management initiative, which is an effective system, has been running now for about 11 years. Each time civil servants evaluate their work they change it; they are not sticking to the one plan but have changed several times over the last 11 years.</p>

          <p eId="para_64">I hope that what the Taoiseach says is right but what is the evidence for the statement that the Civil Service is managed better now than it was ten years ago? There is certainly a greater resort to consultants but what is the tangible evidence that the service generally is better managed? Could the Taoiseach draw the attention of the House to a single, tangible, meaningful achievement of SMI? What is the correlation between SMI and benchmarking?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_44">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_65">I could give many examples but the best one is public opinion. A major survey carried out last year showed the public's reaction to the Civil Service in a set of questionnaires, based on independent criteria, which sought the public's opinion in all areas. I cannot remember the figures off the top of my head but there was almost 90% satisfaction with public services and that was across the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, line Departments and my own Department. The public was asked about service, courtesy and deliverability and civil servants came out very well against previous similar reports. That survey, which is in the public domain, was the third such survey, carried out on a three year or 30 month basis, covering a range of issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">The correlation between SMI, modernisation and benchmarking, is that under the change element in the agreement on benchmarking, benchmarking payments cannot be obtained unless one has delivered on the change agenda and on what has been verified by the verification committees. The incentive is for staff to deliver on what management has asked them to do on the change agenda and they have responded well to that as they did in the last two programmes where there was something for them to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">On improvements, if one were to go on public opinion alone, based on survey findings, the turnaround and the speed with which letters and other correspondence are being dealt now is far more efficient in terms of time lags. The use of technology which has come out of change management in Departments is now probably as good as it has been anywhere. Departments and civil servants have genuinely taken to the various Government and other initiatives, such as e-government, now in operation so that has worked extremely well.</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_47">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_97">I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 31, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">Progress on An Agreed Programme for Government is kept constantly under review. Deputies will be aware that for every full year of the last Government's term of office we published an annual progress report. They will also be aware that last week we published the first annual progress report of the current Administration. I am therefore pleased to have this opportunity to make a statement to the House on the implementation of An Agreed Programme for Government between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">Our programme for Government is both clear in intent and specific in detail. It is the agreed agenda for this partnership Government over five full years. The starting point for the current programme for Government was rooted in a recognition that, in an ever-changing world, the reform process is never over. As a Government, we are determined to keep driving forward. In implementing this programme for Government, we will not rest on past successes. Instead, we will build on the solid foundations we have put in place since 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">In setting out to implement our commitments, we will bring forward and make progress on the most ambitious legislative programme in the history of this State. Since the present Government took office on 6 June, 33 Bills have been published, 25 Bills have been already enacted into law and, in addition, there are currently 36 Bills  before the Oireachtas. Given the scale of the Government's legislative programme and the large number of specific commitments set out in An Agreed Programme for Government, it would be impossible in the time allotted to detail fully the progress already delivered; the details are, in any event, more appropriate to address to individual Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">The cornerstones of An Agreed Programme for Government are based on our desire to build a better Ireland for everyone and our promises to protect and expand prosperity for all, to strengthen peace and reconciliation, to guarantee improved pensions, to reform and develop our health services and to invest in better public services. Without economic strength, there will never be an Ireland where everyone can prosper and fulfil his or her potential. A key objective of our programme for Government is to sustain a strong economy and to keep the finances of general Government close to balance or in surplus. In that regard, I congratulate the Minister for Finance on his achievement of an end-of-year Exchequer surplus of €95 million. By continuing to provide strong leadership and manage our way through the current period of uncertainty, the Government will ensure that Ireland will be well poised to take best advantage of the inevitable upturn when it comes.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">Our over-riding priority as set out in the programme for Government is to secure lasting peace in Northern Ireland, and we have worked intensively towards that objective. Other key commitments which have been delivered or where major progress has been made include: our commitment to submit the Nice treaty on enlargement to the people in a referendum in a way which addressed their concerns as expressed during previous referendums and in the National Forum on Europe was delivered on last year; our commitment to play a full part in the European Convention, and the Europe-wide debate on the future shape of the European Union is being spearheaded in part by the work of Minister of State, Deputy Roche; our promise to establish a National Development Finance Agency to finance major public projects is being worked on, with the necessary legislation steered through the Oireachtas; our commitment to address Ireland's infrastructural deficit in a coherent and determined way, and I draw Deputies' attention to the total investment in the national roads programme in 2003 of over €1.26 billion, the highest provision for national roads in the history of the State; our commitment to implement a multistranded approach to addressing housing needs across the spectrum has resulted in 2002 in another record year for new housing output, surpassing the previous year's record of almost 53,000 houses; our commitment to encourage a better spread of jobs throughout the country, and people should not forget that our rate of unemployment is amongst the lowest in the EU; our commitment to bring forward a programme of fundamental reform of  the insurance industry, and I remind Deputies of the comprehensive set of interrelated measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market published by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment last October; our commitment to rural development and, in particular, the delivery on our pledge to widen the CLÁR boundaries as a result of the relevant data from the census; our commitment to ensure the implementation of the penalty points system at an early date, something that has made an impact on road safety in the country; our commitment to ensure the putting in place of open-access broadband nationally, and I draw Deputies' attention to Deputy Dermot Ahern's launch earlier this year of the roll-out of a new €65 million national broadband scheme which will deliver high-speed Internet access to 19 key towns around the country; our commitment to complete the national spatial strategy – which we have now published – will help ensure that all regions develop to their potential; our commitment to introduce a Proceeds of Corruption Bill modelled on the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, to target white-collar crime and corruption further and establish a corruption assets bureau, on which work is advancing; our commitment to gain the maximum benefit for public patients from private hospital capacity through initiatives such as the treatment purchase fund, which has treated over 2,000 patients from its inception in July 2002; our commitment to implement the national health strategy, which has already seen progress on 70% of its targets; our commitment to ensure that every school building attains modern standards is underlined by the €343 million school building programme for 2003; and our commitment to protect the fundamental principles of CAP has been underlined by the strong stance that we have adopted in defending the benefits achieved under the Agenda 2000 agreement in the current CAP reform and WTO negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">On social partnership, the negotiations on the successor agreement to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (PPF) concluded in February, and each of the four social partner pillars has now formally ratified the new agreement Sustaining Progress. The new agreement covers the period 2003 to 2005 in respect of the wider policy framework and provides for an interim pay agreement of 18 months' duration. I am pleased with the recent announcement that the farming organisations decided to pursue their goals within the framework for social partnership.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_106">The Taoiseach referred to the ever-changing world and said the Government was going to keep driving forward. How much did the  document of self-defence which was produced last year cost? Is it not true that this glossy document was no more than an expensive work of fiction which did not outline the broken promises and commitments which were not adhered to? It was a tissue of aspirations which the Taoiseach and his colleagues knew could not be implemented even as they were drafting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">Last night 700 farmers met in Loughrea to discuss the CPSU strike and there are now 300 people on the streets protesting about the disability sector. Thousands of taxi drivers are about to descend on Merrion Square. There is an unprecedented level of anger among people all over the country as a result of what the Taoiseach has done.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_109">The Taoiseach just rhymed off another list of figures. Will he admit for once that he set out to buy his way back to power and to do whatever he had to do to get back? He has achieved that and he should now tell the truth. What about the 200,000 medical cards, the 2,000 gardaí and the 400 schools which cannot be built? The litany is endless. What the Taoiseach read out comes from the communications department and is nothing more than spin. Will he tell us for once that he is in a hole and that he has stopped digging? Then we might come to his rescue.</p>

If people have nothing else to write about for the weekend and decide to make a story out of that, that is okay with me. That was handy enough for me. If what I do at 11 a.m. on a Tuesday morning keeps them busy for the week and fills the newspapers, that is all right with me. I continued with my work for the week.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_101">
          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_165">I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 90 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">I was pleased to announce on 25 May 2003 a new package of measures costing €42 million in a full year and for which provision will be made in the Department's Estimates for 2003 and 2004 to further address and ameliorate the problems faced by students from low to moderate income households in accessing third level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">As Deputies will be aware, this package combines substantial improvements in the level and coverage of the maintenance grant for those on low to moderate incomes, with increases in the level of top-up grant for those who are most disadvantaged. The package will increase grant levels by 15%, benefiting an estimated 56,000 students. It will extend the thresholds and increase the gradations as follows: €0 to €32,000 for the full grant; €32,000 to €34,000 for 75% grant; €34,000 to €36,000 for half grant; and €36,000 to €38,000 for 25% grant. An extra 5,000 students will qualify for a full maintenance grant. Overall, it is estimated that some 11,000 students  will receive some benefit for the first time. Furthermore, the package will increase the top-up grant to the maximum personal rate of unemployment assistance. It is estimated that in excess of 7,500 students will benefit. It will extend the threshold for the €670 student service charge from €36,897 to €40,000. This will benefit some 4,000 students from households with moderate incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">This substantial package will provide the unprecedented opportunity to students from disadvantaged backgrounds to achieve their full potential in the education system. I recognise that third level access is only one part of the picture in addressing educational disadvantage and that success in third level education must be built on a solid foundation of general education that fosters self-esteem, a love of learning and experience of success in learning.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">Early investment in measures to address disadvantage is critical to success. I am determined, therefore, to continue to invest substantially in primary and post-primary education, including learning supports, curricular reforms and teacher development. All of these investments are inter-related and contribute to addressing disadvantage and supporting access to a quality education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">The package is in addition to the significant increase in funding for third level access over the past five years. Such funding has increased from a base of €508,000 in 1997 to €26 million this year. This, together with targeted funding by the Higher Education Authority – more than €6 million in 2002 – and funding to the institutes of technology, has enabled the implementation of many of the key recommendations in the report of the action group on access to third level education to be set in train. I am committed to progressing these recommendations further.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">The promotion of quality in, and equitable access to, education, higher education in particular, has consistently been identified as one of my key policy priorities since taking office. If we are to break cycles of disadvantage, create opportunities and optimise our broader economic and social potential we must ensure the broadest possible level of participation in higher education. My overriding objective is to target those who are most in need and to do so at an appropriate level.</p>

          <p eId="para_172">The Minister's answer is full of contradictions, particularly of what he has said over the past ten months on third level fees. When he first discussed the free fees initiative, which was introduced by the rainbow Government, he said it did not work—</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_104">
          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_174">I am trying to frame the question. The Minister said that the free fees initiative did not increase access. He also spoke about access in respect of pre-school, primary and second levels.  Therefore, why has this initiative focused on post-leaving certificate students and on entry to third level?</p>
          <p eId="para_175">The Minister stated that he has increased funding for programmes on disadvantage at primary and second levels, yet he stated that significant numbers of people from disadvantaged backgrounds are not making the breakthrough. Therefore, does he accept that the investment he has made over the past five years has failed to increase the number of people in third level education? If he accepts this, as he should, what does he intend to do about it? Does he have further initiatives in mind? The current initiatives have not worked sufficiently.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">The Minister stated the money will be in place next year. Will this be an additional allocation from the Department of Finance or will it come from the existing education budget? Does he foresee further allocations to fund initiatives at pre-school, primary and second levels so people from disadvantaged backgrounds can make the breakthrough to third level?</p>
          <p eId="para_177">I welcome the initiative the Minister announced to keep people in third level education. Is this enough? Will he admit that it is dealing with the problem only at post-leaving certificate level and not at an overall level?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_105" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_178">I thank the Deputy for welcoming the package and for her questions. I made it very clear from the outset that the initiative to get more people from disadvantaged backgrounds into third level education was one small part of the effort I was making to end disadvantage at second level. More than €300 million has already been allocated towards various schemes at first and second levels. Since I became Minister for Education and Science, we have been looking at those schemes. I have said before that there are too many of them and that they are not focused enough. However, plenty of money is being spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">The schemes are having an effect. The fact that 3,500 people availed of the top-up grant last year shows that more people from disadvantaged backgrounds are benefiting and getting through to leaving certificate and third level. We changed the top-up grant system last year and the number of people from disadvantaged backgrounds availing of the grant rose from 3,500 to 7,000. The people at whom we are targeting the package in question, who are only now coming through the system, are getting a chance. They would not have benefited fully over the past ten years under the various schemes. They needed the extra help and assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">I have no doubt that the schemes in place, such as Breaking the Cycle, are working. They may not be working as effectively as they should and that is why we are re-examining them. The €42 million package will help those who have just come through the system or who have nearly come through it. It will have a profound effect on their attitude and the attitude of many people in  aspiring to third level education for the first time. The package is additional and will be seen to be such in the Estimates next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_181">I welcome the fact that the third level fees kite has finally been grounded by the Minister and I welcome the funding that has been made available. Obviously, this funding will be required in the future. Can I have assurance from the Minister that the money will not be made available at the expense of other areas funded by the educational budget, particularly the budget to address student disadvantage?</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Will the student service charge of €670 remain at this level in the forthcoming year? Will the funding currently used for access programmes for third level continue to be made available in the manner that it has been this year? This funding needs to be increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">People have expressed their concerns to me regarding access programmes aimed at children in primary school. In my university, the University of Limerick, I was discussing the access programmes that bring primary children to the campus. Will these programmes be continued and extended into the future?</p>
          <p eId="para_184">Does the Minister intend to reform the assessment procedure for grants, which is clearly unfair to many students?</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_185">The €42 million package for a full year is an extra. It will not be taken from any of the many schemes we have put in place. In 1997, when the Opposition was in power, just over €500,000 was being paid out to help students from disadvantaged backgrounds. We handed out about €50 million to people who could afford to pay fees and did not target it at disadvantaged students.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">The amount of €500,000 paid for disadvantaged students in 1997 has now increased to €26 million. Various other access programmes, student assistance funds, etc., will not be affected. This package of €42 million deals with the area of student support and is targeted at the less well-off. I do not intend to take any of the money from top-up grants, student assistance or anything else. It is a good package and will not affect the other areas we currently finance and fund. The present €380 million for student supports will be increased by the amount I said.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_112">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_192">The education centres referred to in the Deputy's question are not scheduled for closure. A report has been presented to my Department by the Centre for Management Organisation and Development, CMOD, of the Department of Finance which recently undertook a review of the education centre network. This report contains a wide range of recommendations, including the closure of three full-time centres in Kildare, Kilkenny and Sligo and the closure of all part-time centres excluding the Gaeltacht part-time centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">The CMOD review and the wide range of recommendations made in it are being considered in my Department at present. Decisions regarding the recommendations contained in the review will be taken following a thorough consideration of all the relevant issues and in the context of consultation with the Association of Teachers' Education Centres in Ireland, ATECI. This process is currently under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">A new centre, an tIonad Náisiúnta Oideachais Gaeilge, is to be established in Baile Bhúirne, County Cork. This centre will have a specific remit regarding support for teaching of Irish and teaching through Irish. However, since it will have none of the characteristics of the existing education centres in terms of remit, constituency or structure, it has not been considered in the context of the CMOD review.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">As regards an tIonad Náisiúnta Oideachais Ghaeilge at Baile Bhúirne, officials of my Department have been in discussions with officials of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs regarding the latter Department providing financial assistance towards the capital cost of this project. While agreement in principle has been reached in this matter, the precise details are yet to be resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">Additionally, a number of matters relating to the acquisition of the site and the overall design of the centre are currently being examined. When all of these matters are finally determined, the question of authorising the invitation of tenders for this project will be decided. I wish also to clarify that there were no previously announced plans to extend the standard education centre service – the service as covered by the CMOD report.</p>

        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_113">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_197">I am concerned by reports I read in the media recently. We have often received the same denials in the health service. It is a case of treating it as no smoke without fire. Will the Minister agree that his Department's proposal to close three education centres, which cost €2 million to refurbish during the past three years, would be a retrograde step and a classic case of false economy? The proposal also includes reassigning teachers in the schools that use the three centres to other education centres at great cost in terms of travel, time and expenses. The proposed closures also represent a case of waste of educational resources and of a key professional development service for teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">Has the proposed €1.9 million educational centre for Ballyvourney in County Cork been long-fingered? Its function is to support the teaching of Irish from pre-school to third level, and it should have been given precedence over other projects. It is also to be a national centre to assist teachers. Does the Minister agree that the education centres, formerly known as teachers' centres, were set up as an imaginative and innovative means of providing teachers with education materials? Their objectives are the educational support of teachers. They aimed to be centres where teachers could meet, share and discuss common problems. They also offered the opportunity to break the isolation of teachers, particularly in rural areas, by providing them with a networking infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">The education centres also provide a wide range of aids to teachers including videos, laboratory equipment—</p>

          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_201">Does the Minister agree the centres should be maintained? Teachers get older and need to be kept abreast of things. They have to reinvent themselves a number of times throughout their lifetime as teachers, often at their own expense. The resource centres provide excellent value for money. I would like to hear the Minister's comments on this matter.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_202">I am not sure what the question was, it sounded more like a statement. I agree the education centres serve a useful purpose and it is my desire to ensure that they are even more useful. Leaving aside the recommendation made in regard to the possible closure of a  number of centres, a matter I dealt with earlier, the report made a number of other useful recommendations in regard to rationalisation, geographic remit, etc., which the centres would accept. I agree the centres have acquitted themselves well. There are faults that can be addressed. I understand I will shortly receive submissions from the teacher centres' representative body, the ATECI, which will make positive suggestions.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">I reiterate that this is not a Department proposal. The Department has made no proposals in regard to closure of the education centres. CMOD produced a report which made that kind of proposal to the Department. It has not responded yet because it is engaging in consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">In regard to Baile Bhúirne, I have heard the rumours being touted that the project is being long-fingered. There has been progress and I am talking with my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív. We have made good progress although there are issues that need to be addressed in regard to the site and the cost of the initial building plan put forward, which was a luxury model. However, there is nothing that cannot be overcome. A number of colleagues besides the Deputy have expressed interest in the matter. I assure the Deputy that it is not being long-fingered.</p>

          <p eId="para_207">Notifications from such schools are required to reach my Department before 31 October 2003. A support team consisting of a national co-ordinator and regional development officers will be in place from September 2003 to provide an in-career development programme for teachers. The support team will provide advice to principals and school staff, and a help line, and will support the development of school networks. Schools not intending to adopt the revised syllabus from 2003 to 2004 may continue to use the old syllabus.</p>

          <p eId="para_208">My first question concerns the use of the word "optional". Does the Minister agree this is optional for the schools not the students? If a school does not offer the new syllabus, students – the users of the service who are supposed to benefit from the education system – have no options. If all of the schools which the Minister states will take up the service do so, how much will this extra grant cost? From where will come the substantial resources required? Will this affect other grants? Is it guaranteed that it will be paid, unlike the ICT grants and the capitation grants which I know will be paid but which are being reviewed midstream?</p>
          <p eId="para_209">Given that this is an eleventh hour negotiation, will it be implemented even by those schools which choose to do so? Has the Minister considered how this will affect book lists and similar matters? Will the fact that the two syllabuses are to be run together require more inspectors? Has the exams commission guaranteed equality of marking for the junior certificate science syllabus in 2006? Does the Minister think it a level playing field if students are to sit exams based on two different syllabuses?</p>
          <p eId="para_210">This type of deal is almost like a bribe of which only some schools can avail. The reality is that the most disadvantaged schools, those with the worst science facilities, have no options. Does the Minister agree that they will not be able to take up the syllabus because they physically cannot teach it as they do not have the necessary equipment? Despite that, if they do not take up the syllabus, they will not get any grant. Does the Minister think that a satisfactory situation for schools and, in particular, pupils to be placed in?</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_213">When we could not get agreement from unions and management bodies, I took the decision that I would not deprive many of the teachers and all of the students taking these subjects of the opportunity to go with the new syllabus which was agreed and recommended by all. Everybody felt it was a good and positive change and I was not prepared to allow it to be held up.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">The various schools were surveyed. I was told about serious deficiencies and faults in labs in schools but when they were surveyed, that was not quite the case. About 12 schools are not in a position to go ahead with this for the school year 2003 to 2004. Some 250 schools will be able to go ahead with a small grant of about €3,500 and it is estimated that a further 460 schools will be able to go ahead with a slightly larger grant – perhaps two or three times €3,500 – based on information the Department has and findings on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">The Department did not see any justification for depriving students of the opportunity to become involved in a subject in a new and exciting way, particularly when everybody has been crying out for a new syllabus in junior science. I make no apologies for that. The Deputy mentioned that this was optional. I hope, in the best spirit of partnership within the schools, that students will be given an opportunity to decide whether they want to go forward with this, and that they and their parents, as partners in education, will be consulted. I hope there will not be a decision by one union or by the management of a school to deprive students of this opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">The cost of the grants plus the cost in regard to schools for which the Department's building unit would have to provide new facilities totals about €12 million. That will be prioritised in the building programme and the funding will come out of the Department's general Estimates next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_217">The Minister's hope is well and good. However, he is responsible for the provision of education. I have visited schools, as I am sure the Minister has, where there are no science labs. It is not an option for some schools to choose to implement a new curriculum that requires 30 mandatory experiments for which equipment is required. More than 12 schools will not be in a position to take this up. What does the Minister intend to do beyond hoping?</p>
          <p eId="para_218">This is to come out of next year's schools building programme. Is there to be a special new fund for science laboratories in particular?</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_219">A total of 12 schools are not in a position to provide a minimum of a double period per week access to laboratory facilities. I said that the Department's building unit would make contact with those schools if they opt in. The other schools are in a position to undertake this. The equipment we are discussing is already in use although there may not be enough of it in some schools. This is a little extra.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">With regard to the teachers, most of whom were involved in the change that took place at leaving certificate level, some 1,700 biology teachers, 1,000 physics teachers and 900 chemistry teachers have already received substantial in-service training for the leaving certificate, which uses exactly the same methodology as the junior certificate. Contrary to the impression which some people were trying to create in order to get an extra lab assistant in every school at a cost of €18 million, it is feasible to go ahead with this and we will do so. I hope all of the schools will participate.</p>

      <b>Mr. Crowe</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
      if his attention has been drawn to the fact that Dublin has the second lowest participation rate in third level education of any county in the State and is well behind other EU capitals in access to third level education.
      [16003/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_124">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_222">I am aware of the report by Professor Pat Clancy on his fourth national survey of access to higher education which found that Dublin, by comparison with other counties, had a low level of participation in third level education. However, it should be noted that this survey, based on entrants to higher education in autumn 1998, was carried out before the significant additional funding committed by Government to further and higher education.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">New measures have been introduced specifically aimed at increasing access to third level education. There is a provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling almost €121 million, over the period 2000 to 2006, to tackle disadvantage at third level. The report of the action group on access to third level education, which was established to advise on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability at third level, was published in July 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">To date, a number of measures have been taken in response to the main recommendations in the report: special rates of maintenance grants, usually referred to as top-up grants, payable to disadvantaged grant holders, were introduced with effect from the 2000 to 2001 academic year and the annual income threshold for the special rates was increased by 32% for 2002 to 2003. I also increased the special rate of grant to €4,000 for non-adjacent grant holders. The number of students qualifying for the top-up grant in 2002 to 2003 has more than doubled to some 7,500 students.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. The total allocation for the 2001 to 2002 academic year was €1.2 million. For 2002 to 2003, I increased the provision for the fund to €2 million and some 50 area partnerships and community groups have received allocations.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">I anticipate that the national office for equity of access will be in operation prior to the start of the coming academic year and that it will facilitate the aim of increasing third level access by the three target groups, in partnership with my Department, the third level institutions and other stake holders and agencies. The student assistance fund assists students who, due to their financial circumstances, might be unable to continue their third level studies. Some €8.9 million was allocated from this fund in 2002 in respect of the 2002 to 2003 academic year.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">I have already advised the House of the measures which I announced on 25 May, costing €42 million in a full year, to address the problem  of disadvantage in third level education. This package of measures will be the catalyst that enables students from disadvantaged backgrounds to reach their full potential in the education system, and in their subsequent careers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_125">
          <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_228">While I realise that the figures go back to 1998, they are the only figures from which we can work. On that basis, why is Dublin the second lowest? The lowest is Donegal and one could argue that there are problems there with regard to access to education, transport and so forth. However, in Dublin there is access to transport. Is it, as Deputy O'Sullivan suggests, an issue of encouraging people into third level education and encouraging students to visit universities? According to the figures, there has been a decline in participation in Dublin. Why Dublin? In other cities and urban areas there is an increase in the number of people attending third level. Why is that not happening in Dublin? It is a fair question.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The figures also suggest that Dublin has the lowest percentage of entrants to third level education receiving means-tested financial aid and the highest rate of social class inequality. Why? The Minister referred to the action report. Few of the 80 recommendations have been implemented. When will they be implemented? One key recommendation was that there be further development and more support for guidance counsellors. That was also a recommendation of the Dublin employment pact. Will the Minister recruit more counsellors to encourage young people into third level education? The Minister spoke about means testing, payments and so forth. One of the recommendations is that this function be transferred to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Is there any movement on that?</p>
          <p eId="para_230">Why is Dublin second lowest in the scale? There are all sorts of excuses for rural areas, such as access, transport and so forth. However, many of the main universities are located in Dublin but Dublin people are being denied access to them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_126">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_231">I accept the Deputy's sincerity in asking that question. I do not have a straightforward answer. It is only in certain areas of Dublin where the figures are as low as 5% for participation in third level education. These are, generally, the large, working class, disadvantaged areas of Dublin. Their participation rates of 5% are dragging down the overall average for Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">This brings us back to the issue of socioeconomic disadvantage. There are areas in Dublin where, in generations of families, only some members might have got past primary level and few of them reach leaving certificate level. Other data and surveys show that participation depends on one's postal district in Dublin. Some areas of Dublin have 77% participation levels, which is way above the level for other counties. It is all explained by social class, financial background  and so on. There are serious problems with disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">I welcome the interest people have started to take in disadvantage and in disadvantage in education. If they think, however, that we will resolve the problem of educational disadvantage without upsetting some people, usually well-off people, we are going nowhere. If there is a closure of ranks behind the middle and upper middle classes and the wealthy in this country every time we try to tackle disadvantage and redistribute wealth, we will not make much progress over the next four or five years. Given the views that have been expressed regarding a commitment to disadvantage in education, I hope the next time we try to do something about it a few more voices will be raised in support in this House.</p>

      <b>Mr. Gogarty</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
      the specific measures in place to tackle the schools accommodation crisis in Lucan, County Dublin, to ensure that there are sufficient places to meet the needs of children in the area for September 2003.
      [15832/03]

        </question>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_128">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_236">I am conscious of the issues raised by the Deputy. Lucan is the fastest growing area in the country and, as a result, there has been a marked increase in the demand for primary school places in Lucan, particularly in the south Lucan area in the electoral division of Lucan-Esker. In order to meet this demand, my Department has taken steps to increase the capacity of existing primary schools in the area concerned by way of the provision of permanent and temporary accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">Building projects have recently been completed at Scoil Áine junior school and St. Thomas's senior school to increase the capacity of each of these schools to 16 classrooms. Construction of the new Lucan Educate Together national school will be finalised for September 2003. The capacity of the school will be 16 mainstream classrooms and an autistic unit. My Department is also arranging for the installation of a prefabricated unit at Archbishop Ryan national school. This unit will be installed over the summer and will be available for September.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">With regard to accommodation for Griffeen Valley Educate Together national school, my Department has instructed the property management section of the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of the Department regarding site acquisitions generally, to enter into negotiations with the owners of the site reserved for primary school purposes in Griffeen with a view to acquir ing the site. However, at this stage, it is unlikely that the site will be available for the forthcoming school year. My Department is currently in communication with the board of management of Griffeen Valley Educate Together national school with a view to arranging alternative accommodation, as an interim measure, for September 2003. Primary provision in the Lucan area and, in particular, south Lucan will continue to be monitored by my Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_239">The population of Lucan south increased by approximately 7,000 to 21,000 between 1996 and 2002. The situation is at crisis point. I will have to continue drawing attention to this because the Minister's answer is not satisfactory. Griffeen Valley Educate Together was banking on getting that land but if there is humming and hawing about having to get an alternative site, there will be no clarity for the many people who are waiting to get their children into the school.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">The building at Scoil Áine and St. Thomas's is welcome but those schools are in Esker. There is a major problem. If a child is a Catholic or a Traveller in Lucan south, he or she has a better chance of getting into school. If the child is non-Catholic, and this is an area where a large number of people are from various ethnic and religious backgrounds, he or she cannot get into Archbishop Ryan school because of the priority system. That is fair enough, given that it is a Catholic school, but the multidenominational school, Lucan Educate Together, is full and Griffeen Valley Educate Together has no clarity about its future. The Church of Ireland school, St. Andrew's, recently got sanction for works but it is still vastly overcrowded.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">A task force is required. Will the Minister consider setting up such a task force to deal with these schools? Will he provide funding to allow Archbishop Ryan school become a junior and senior school and allow Griffeen Valley Educate Together school to secure its land sooner rather than later? The Minister is aware of this crisis but I will continue to raise it until it is resolved.</p>

I outlined what the Department has been doing to try to meet the immediate problem and we will continue to do that. An interim solution has been proposed for September 2003 and I hope that will give us the breathing space to solve the problem for Griffeen Valley Educate Together during the next 12 months.</p>

      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
      if his attention has been drawn to a call made by the National Parents Council primary for a debate on the teaching of religion in schools; his plans to initiate such a debate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [15752/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_131">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_244">The National Parents Council primary has not, in fact, formally called for a debate on the teaching of religion in schools. I have no plans to initiate such a debate at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">I am, however, aware that a number of issues relating to religious education are of real concern to parents. The increasingly multicultural nature of the schoolgoing population; the growing diversity of beliefs, values and lifestyles in Irish society; the desire of parents to arrange for their children's education in a school whose religious ethos coincides with their own religious beliefs; the growing numbers of children attending denominational schools who are of differing faiths or of none; and the demand for increased choice have all given rise to a focus on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Any consideration of this concern must take account of recent legislation and curriculum changes. These have acknowledged the rights of the individual with regard to values and beliefs and made provision for the wide range that now exists in Irish society. Under section 30 of the Education Act 1998, no student can be required to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student. The Act also requires that, in prescribing curricula for recognised schools, the Minister must take due account of the characteristic spirit of a school or type of school. Section 15 of the Act also requires boards of management of schools to uphold and be accountable to the patron for upholding the characteristic spirit of the school including the moral, religious, social, educational and spiritual values which inform the ethos of the school.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">At primary level, my Department recognises the rights of the different church authorities to design curricula in religious education and to supervise their teaching and implementation. This right is enshrined in the Education Act 1998. Consequently, although religious education is part of the curriculum for primary schools and schools are obliged to allocate 30 minutes per day for religious instruction, the content of the religion programme is determined by the patron of the school. The revised curriculum for primary schools espouses the importance of tolerance towards the practice, culture and lifestyle of a range of religious convictions and states explicitly that the beliefs and sensibilities of every child are to be respected.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"><i>Additional information.</i>The legislation has been enacted, the new curriculum is being implemented and primary school authorities are taking their responsibilities in this regard seriously. This should alleviate some of the concerns of parents. Looking to the future, my Department has established the new schools advisory committee whose task is to scrutinise applications for new schools and to advise on future provision. Part of its remit is to ensure  diversity of provision and, clearly, the issues outlined above are central to its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">At second level, a new syllabus for religious education was introduced on a phased basis in September 2000. This syllabus is concerned with understanding religion as a phenomenon in the world and is designed to be studied by students of all religious faiths and of none. It will be examined for the first time in the junior certificate examination this year. For the students taking this course, a syllabus for religious education at leaving certificate, higher and ordinary levels, will be introduced this September for examination in 2005. Within three years, religious education will be an available option to all post-primary schools as an examination subject.</p>

          <p eId="para_250">I read in that austere newspaper, <i>The Irish Times,</i> that the National Parents Council's primary section called for an examination of this issue. Therefore, I am not sure on what basis the Minister says it did not or whether the newspaper is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">Does the Minister agree that this issue must be confronted sooner rather than later, given the changing nature of society and the rights of parents to have their children educated in a manner appropriate to their own religious ethos or not to be taught according to any specific religious ethos? Does he further agree with the INTO's suggestion that a convention on interdenominational education should be set up to examine all these issues? The Minister is obviously aware of the growing demand for interdenominational education, particularly with the growing requests for Educate Together schools. Does he therefore agree that it is important this issue be addressed in an organised manner, perhaps through a convention or an examination of the issue, particularly in view of the situation which arose in the Minister's own constituency, where there was a real confrontation with regard to the rights of parents in regard to religious teaching in schools? I am interested to hear the Minister's response to this issue which is of growing concern for parents.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_252">By way of clarification, the basis for my statement that the National Parents Council had not formally called for a debate on the teaching of religion was based on an assurance from the chief executive of the primary section of the organisation. No formal approach has been made by the National Parents Council to the Department in this regard. The Department has established a new schools advisory committee whose task is to scrutinise applications for new schools and advise on future provision, part of whose remit is to try to ensure a diversity of provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">The concerns which have been expressed by parents who want to have a choice will be taken into account. If people choose to go to a school with a Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or any other  ethos or no ethos, they have the opportunity to do so. The position generally regarding religious education at primary and secondary level is satisfactory. There has been one well-publicised incident which gave rise to some calls, but the issue itself was apparently centred on religion in the schools, whereas the essence of the problem was more to do with someone acting contrary to the wishes of the board of management. It was a separate issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_254">I disagree that all parents have a choice because if one is located in a rural area, one does not have a selection of schools from which to choose to send one's children. Does the Minister accept that now is the time to have a forum on this topic, whether or not it has been requested? Some people have been seeking one, although they may not have done so formally.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">I am in favour of people being taught their own religion within the school system. Other people hold different views from mine but, rather than having further confrontation, would it not be better to have a forum at this stage to discuss the issues, particularly for the benefit of those who do not live in areas where choice is available?</p>

If they live in the city and have access to transport, they have that choice. However, there is a growing number of parents who have not been able to access schools which share the same ethos, particularly outside cities and towns. Is the Minister satisfied that those parents have appropriate opportunities for their children with regard to not having to sit in on a religious class which is not in accordance with their own beliefs?</p>

          <p eId="para_258">Adequate provision is made for that. I accept that we cannot have a series of non-denominational, multi-denominational and single denominational schools at every crossroads in the country. There are already some 3,500 primary schools in place and the State has an obligation to provide educational facilities, but it does not have a constitutional obligation to provide schools of a particular ethos everywhere they are demanded. It is worthy of note that, in recent years, most of the schools that have been provided have been non-denominational schools, generally gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</p>

      his plans to contact schools or public representatives who were given assurances in advance of the general election that certain schools would have urgently required building work completed and who are still waiting, in the light of recent documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and published in a newspaper (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_260">I thank Deputy Gilmore for the opportunity to inform the House of the factual position relating to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">In April 2002, my predecessor published, on the Department's website, a list of schools building projects which were to be progressed as part of the 2002 school building programme. This list of intended projects was based on a revised budget allocation of €172.64 million for primary school buildings. One of the crucial aspects of managing a multi-million euro annual capital programme is the timing of allowing projects to proceed to tender and construction. Some projects were scheduled to proceed to tender and construction in early 2002 and others were scheduled for later in the year. A substantial number of projects did proceed through design and on to construction. However, it became clear in late 2002 that the funding allocation for 2003 might be less than anticipated. On this basis, it was prudent not to proceed in late 2002 with the projects intended to go to tender and construction and to defer consideration of these projects until funding for 2003 was certain.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">The publication of the Estimates in November 2002 detailed the 2003 funding allocation of €147.7 million for primary capital projects. Subsequently, I reallocated €20 million from within my overall departmental budget to increase the funding available to €167.7 million. The 2003 school building programme was based on this increased allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">I understand the frustration felt by schools that believed that their project would proceed to tender and construction in late 2002 and early 2003 and subsequently did not. However, Deputies will understand that I could only allow projects to advance within the funding available for capital projects at primary level.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">I am pleased to advise Deputies that I am in ongoing discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to secure a four to five year funding envelope for the school building programme. I consider that this four to five year envelope will allow me give more certainty to schools on the timescale for their building projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">I intend to continue the process of publishing changes to the school building programme on my Department's website. I consider that the publication of the programme is the best way to provide the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students, and all other interested parties. It also shows that the programme is being operated in an open and transparent manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_266">I was not talking about the list of schools as published by the Department of Education and Science but about the letters that schools, boards of management and even residents in certain areas received from candidates in the general election that stated schools would move forward where, subsequently, that has not been the case. Does the Minister not agree these people are entitled to an explanation? I respect the fact that the Minister did not make the promises at the time, but will he explain why these promises have not been kept? My party leader and I visited St. Nessan's school in Mungret in County Limerick on Friday. That school was clearly told its building project would proceed so will the Minister explain to it when the programme will get under way? The school knows that if it has not got the nod for this year, it may get it next year but it is most likely that it will be well into the future because of the hundreds of schools that are on the same list. Will the Minister go around the State to talk to these schools to tell them what is happening, as he did with the ASTI?</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_269">Anyone who has difficulty reading it should contact the Department and I will ensure the information is made available. There is a list on the website of all projects that are in architectural planning in the Department and the stage at which they are. That should be clear. There was, however, a degree of confusion when we allocated the contingency fund, which was clearly indicated in section one of the Department's website and on the hard copy. If people read the full website there is more information than was ever previously available, including the criteria under which we will advance these projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">What will happen in 2004 depends on the funding we get in the Estimates for that year. I hope, over the next six weeks I will have agreed a funding envelope for the next four or five years with the Minister for Finance. If I do that, I will be able to show everyone that is on the programme how they will progress in the next five years. Nothing could be fairer or more straightforward. It will ensure that people can see the information on the website whether or not there are elections and the information will be factual.</p>

There are procedures allowing for the completion of the contract but it is the responsibility of the board of management to put the process out to tender once more. That happened in Cappoquin but I am not sure what has happened in the case mentioned by Deputy Sherlock.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">The inclusion of the building programme on the website is the best guarantee anyone can have that it will be open, transparent and accountable. Deputies who are concerned about political inter ference in the system should be honest with people when they are asked to make representations to have a school moved up the list and say that there is nothing that can be done and that the list is final.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">Today a number of groups representing the rights of those with an intellectual disability took the opportunity to protest outside the gates of Leinster House to highlight the horrendous impact this Government has had on people with a disability. Many of those who would have liked to protest here today were unable to travel because they cannot get respite hours. These people are demanding only their basic rights – a right to adequate health care, a right to access to necessary facilities, a right to educational facilities and, above all, a right to equality of treatment. The Government has equivocated on this matter for too long. Last year it withdrew the disabilities Bill. It promised there would be two Bills in the House debated together and now the disabilities Bill has been put on the long finger.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has turned his back on the proposed UN convention on the rights of the disabled. Is it not time, in this the European Year of the Disabled and with the Special Olympics almost upon us when the eyes of the world will be on Ireland, the Taoiseach spelled out what the Government intends to do in respect of rights for the disabled? Will the Taoiseach avail of this opportunity or will he tell the House and all those interested in this sector, who have been so discriminated against, that he will enshrine in law rights for persons with disabilities and that he will do so at the earliest opportunity?</p>

          <p eId="para_293">It is the intention to try to pass two legislative measures this year – the disabilit ies Bill and the education for persons with disabilities Bill. The education for persons with disabilities Bill is almost ready. As soon as that Bill is completed, we hope to move on to the disabilities Bill. During the past 12 months consultation has taken place with many of the bodies and organisations and the Bills have been substantially amended and improved. Work on the disabilities Bill is not finished but the work on the education for persons with disabilities Bill is finished and it is being drafted. It is hoped that will come before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">On the issue of funding, this is a difficult year. During the past five or six years there has been an unprecedented level of investment in the health funded services for people with disabilities. I have said many times that is as it should be.

We are not saying there is no problem. We are saying that in the past few years we have brought the services and the expenditure on an ongoing basis up to the levels I have just mentioned from a very low base. We have to try to continue to improve those services as resources permit. Additional resources have been provided this year. The number of persons with intellectual disability or autism resident in hospitals at the end of last year was almost 500. That number is down on previous figures.

People want the legal ability to vindicate their rights because they have no confidence in the Government to deliver services for them. Will the statement of rights be hedged around qualifications about funding and will the adequacy of funding be allowed to be questioned in court? Why is it that so many cases now have to go to court at great cost to vindicate people's rights when a judge has said this is a wasteful use of good money? How does the Taoiseach react to a letter received by a parent of an 18 year old with a mental age of six months who was told this week "there will not be a day service for your daughter in September"? What kind of conscience has a Government that can send out such a letter to any parent who has given day and night, over many years, to deal with this issue? Some 400 individuals with severe learning disabilities are placed in unsuitable long-stay facilities.</p>

The image that will go to the world outside is that everything is all right in Ireland, that we celebrate and honour our people with disabilities. How can the Taoiseach reconcile that message and say that everything is all right in Ireland when almost 30 members of the Special Olympics team have received letters pointing out  that they may not be assured of services after the games?</p>

          <p eId="para_327">What exactly is the Taoiseach saying in response to Deputy Kenny's question? The Taoiseach says the House will enact two Bills relating to disability, but he did not tell Deputy Kenny when the major disabilities Bill would be enacted nor did he say if the legislation will be rights-based. The Taoiseach did not tell Deputy Kenny if he was prepared to introduce an emergency Estimate to deal with the crisis in day and residential care services. The Taoiseach failed to answer Deputy Kenny's question in regard to moneys accumulated from the dormant funds and the proposal of the DIRT inquiry. The purposes here envisaged are perfectly consistent with that proposal which was accepted by the Minister for Finance. Why cannot the €165 million in the dormant accounts fund be used to alleviate the stress suffered by many families who cannot be assured that day or residential care provision will be made for their children in the coming year?</p>

The legislation has been negotiated extensively with many of the organisations involved, although I cannot say it has been discussed with every interested organisation in the country. It will be seen to be a fine Bill which has had the input of many people. The heads of the disabilities Bill have long been completed and the legislation was almost completed one year ago. Many disabilities groups argued that there should be more extensive discussions and I attended a conference a year ago at which they asked us not to proceed with the Bill to allow dialogue to continue.</p>

We have provided an additional 1,700 residential places which are based mainly in the community. The 2001 report of the national intellectual disabilities database, which as Deputy Rabbitte said is its most recent, is being finalised. Preliminary information in the database indicates substantial increases in the numbers of people accessing services, particularly in the residential and respite areas. The figures reflect the impact of the development programme which indicates that over the last few years there has been a 10% increase in the number of persons availing of full-time residential places. The increase in the area of respite services has been more than 200%. The numbers in receipt of multi-disciplinary services increased by more than 300% while the number of children accessing early intervention services has risen by 200%.</p>

The Taoiseach sacked the Minister subsequently even though it was the Cabinet, not the Minister, who approved the Bill. Will that Bill be enacted this year? If the heads of the Bill are available, why is the Taoiseach not making them available to this side of the House to allow us to consult with the organisations involved? The Taoiseach is doing that wherever it suits his purpose. When the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government wishes to reintroduce rates, he ensures that Deputies Gilmore and Allen are right beside him and he involves them all along the way. He learned that from the Taoiseach. If this approach is good for bringing  back rates, why is it not good for dealing with people with disabilities?</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Will the Bill include a legally enforceable right to an assessment as demanded by interested people and organisations? What is the position with regard to the €165 million in the dormant accounts? Will some of this money be directed to the immediate alleviation of stress among the most vulnerable people in our society? That is the question. The Taoiseach's answer will read in such a way that nobody will be able to make a distinction between the two Bills. He has them mixed up. The record will not say one thing or the other. Will the Bill be introduced or will it not? I am not interested in any Bill but the disabilities Bill which collapsed during the last Dáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_359">Does the Taoiseach agree that his promise of substantial improvements in services for people with intellectual disability rings hollow with the many hundreds of parents who experience, as we speak, actual cuts in those services? Far from being improved, the services are being cut. The Taoiseach spoke during the last session of the hundreds and thousands of euro which will be provided to his communications unit. He does not need a communications unit to tell him that in St. Vincent's in his own constituency there has been a 40% reduction in respite care and that there will be no weekend service from the month of June. What does the Taoiseach say to those families from St. Vincent's to Beaufort in Kerry who have been sent letters to tell them that there is nowhere for their profoundly handicapped children aged 17 and 18 to go next year when they leave the current service? How does the Taoiseach react to that?</p>
          <p eId="para_360">It is not a matter of more resources, rather the Government has made a political decision to shift resources which could go to address intellectual handicap to privileged sectors of our community. In the 2002 budget, the Minister for Finance provided €329 million in corporation tax cuts and provided a further €305 million in cuts to the corporate sector in the budget for 2003. The Taoiseach has made a political decision to put on the back burner the vulnerable people who suffer from intellectual disabilities and their long-suffering parents and families while the corporate sector, the millionaires and the bankers are looked  after by the Government. The National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland stated today that only €35 million would be needed to prevent cuts in services across the board and to meet the minimum requirements for the remainder of the year. Will the Taoiseach now make emergency provisions for 2003 to ensure that none of those cuts take place and to go forward to provide comprehensive services?</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_369">Why does the Taoiseach fly in the face of the facts? Up and down this country, service providers are writing to families and stating in black and white that they cannot continue the level of service that existed up to now. They are providing for actual cuts. Why does the Taoiseach stand up and point blank deny the fact when this is happening?</p>
          <p eId="para_370">If the Taoiseach knows something that the service providers do not or that the families and parents do not know, would he please tell us now? Is what he said a guarantee that the funding will be made available to service providers and that families need not worry about respite care and about the fact there is no place for their children to go after leaving their current care services at 16 or 17 years of age? Is the Taoiseach giving a guarantee that the extra funding needed for those services will be provided?</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The dormant accounts fund is all very well, and those funds could be invested here, but the Taoiseach did not answer the point I made at the beginning, and I ask him to answer it now. Why did he decide this year, for example, that millionaire stud farm owners on the plains of Kildare or elsewhere would be protected from any taxation, which could bring in tens of millions to provide services like this and prevent the intellectually disadvantaged from having to face this situation? Finally, I refer to the Special Olympics. If this issue is not resolved, if there is not a cast iron guarantee that the necessary funding will be made available immediately and the families assured, would the Taoiseach agree that it is utter hypocrisy for him and members of the Government to swan around opening events at the Special Olympics as if they were the champions of the disadvantaged and the disabled, when in fact the opposite is the case?</p>

          <p eId="para_373">I have also talked about where the level of funding has been brought up to, and nobody can deny that. I can go back through the figures if Deputies wish but I do not think that is necessary. The simplistic idea that if one creates a tax it will yield hundreds of millions of euro is utter nonsense. It would not even yield tens of millions. We would just wipe out another area of activity in this country by doing some of the things the Deputy suggests. The Government has put an additional €500 million into the whole area of disability and we will continue to put in substantial funding. We have made it a priority for the last number of years. We have provided additional places and services and large numbers of staff. The Government is committed to maintaining expenditure at the level we have got it up to, and hopefully we can build upon this as resources permit. Of course there are some current difficulties which the Minister and the Minister of State have to deal with, and I have already said that we will deal with the legislative base.</p>

On Second Stage, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform described it as a minor housekeeping Bill. He quoted Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee and no doubt he saw himself in the Winston Churchill role. The Minister stated: "This is a measure that has been lying around for some time and is one of the less headline grabbing minor housekeeping exercise with which the House must deal."  The purpose of the Bill is to put the temporary release of prisoners on a statutory basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_401">The proposal to deal with these items together makes it difficult to select one from the other and in view of this I wonder if, for some reason, the Government is seeking to bounce the Opposition into calling a vote. Nos. 9 and 10 deal with diverse issues. The increasing number of those who are members of the VHI and BUPA because they cannot depend on public health would wish to see No. 9 debated more fully, rather than being referred to a joint committee. Likewise, in view of the year of the disabled, No. 10 should also be debated more fully. While I have no objection to the proposal regarding No. 11, we must object to the Government combining these items in a composite proposal.</p>

          <p eId="para_402">With regard to the proposal to refer to a joint committee the proposed approval by the Dáil of the National Council for Special Education (Establishment) Order, 2003, it will be recalled that this proposal was an important element in the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2002, which was flawed legislation and was subsequently withdrawn following objections by those involved in the various disability campaigning groups. While the Taoiseach indicated to the House during Leaders' Questions that the education for persons with disabilities Bill is expected to come before the House within the coming week – I ask him to clarify that – the proposal regarding No. 10 is to be adopted without debate, despite the fact that the subject matter is outside the impending legislation. It should be included in the legislation because otherwise, the National Council for Special Education will be established with all of the flaws intact and without the context of the impending legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_405">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has circulated a raft of amendments to what is effectively a new criminal justice (temporary release of prisoners) Bill. There was no advance notice of this and there will be no Second Stage debate because Second Stage has concluded on the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Bill, the purpose of which was to put on statutory basis the temporary release of prisoners. The amendments proposed by the Minister will extend it to provide a statutory basis for committing people to prison. The House is entitled to adequately scrutinise what is tantamount to a new Bill. In view of this I ask the Taoiseach to proceed with the original Bill, or, if these amendments are to be tabled, that appropriate time be provided for a Second Stage debate on what will effectively be a new Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_538">Amendment No. 11 and the associated amendments Nos. 12 and 13 are the centre point of the Bill as far as we are concerned. My amendment seeks to amend the Bill to ensure the convention provisions shall have the force of law in the State and that everyone within the jurisdiction of the State shall enjoy the rights and freedoms specified therein. It is as simple as that and the amendment sums up our position.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">We argued this point over many days in committee and previously on Report Stage in the House. As it stands, I will ask the House to vote on this amendment because it is the point at which the Minister has gone wrong in the way he formulated the Bill. The Minister has adopted the singular, minimalist and indirect approach to incorporation; the sense of which is not clear to anybody but himself. It is an approach which has been condemned by all Opposition parties. The Minister may say that is understandable, but he does the occasional thing which I am prepared to compliment. However, this has been condemned by all Opposition parties in addition to independent groups, including the Law Society of Ireland, his colleagues in the Bar Council, the National Union of Journalists, the Human Rights Commission and virtually any NGO with an interest in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">The Minister has taken the wrong approach for reasons which are not clear to me. I have listened to him and it is obvious he is ideologically committed. However, he is dressing up that ideological commitment in phoney constitutional arguments. The Opposition wants the convention to be part of our domestic law subject to the Constitution. It is quite clear from any investigation I have undertaken, from anybody to whom I have spoken and from the experts who have advised that it is not only feasible but that it is the right thing to do. However, the Minister refuses to follow this approach. Not only is it wrong from a domestic point of view but it is wrong from the point of view of the European convention.</p>

The Minister is ignoring the provisions of Article 13 of the convention which clearly provides that anyone whose rights or freedoms set forth in the convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority. The way in which he has structured this Bill  does not provide that effective remedy and from that point of view, he fails the test of the convention.

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_553">We should introduce this Bill in the best possible way and to the maximum rather than to the minimum degree. I see no reason it cannot be incorporated into domestic law subject to the provisions of the Constitution. That is the usual way we incorporate international law into our domestic law, including international conventions to which we sign up. I see no reason to depart from that procedure in this case. We have incorporated international covenants and agreements into domestic law under the auspices of the Constitution and subject to its provisions and none is as important as this one, that is, the famous European Convention on Human Rights. It is part and parcel of the direction in which this country is going in terms of the family of European countries. This is a fundamental part of this project.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">We are crossing the Rubicon on this issue. There is a fundamental difference in the approach in terms of the manner in which we engage with Europe on human and civil rights. The question is whether we do so wholeheartedly, robustly, fully and vigorously or do so on an interpretative basis hemmed with caveats and  with a considerable degree of bureaucracy and issues which will arise that will cause difficulty in giving redress to Irish citizens in the implementation of their rights and in ensuring their rights are underpinned.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">We make a last plea to the Minister to see the error of his ways and that he may just be out of line. We could improve the legislation. None of these amendments would have been tabled and the Bill could have been passed quickly if the Minister had accepted my amendment or Deputy O'Keeffe's or Deputy Ó Snodaigh's amendments on Committee Stage. Will the Minister accept the spirit and the substance of these three amendments?</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_389">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_556">Like Deputies Costello and Jim O'Keeffe, I believe this aspect of the Bill has been thrashed out sufficiently and I will not rehash the arguments they have made. The Minister has heard them and, unless he has had a change of heart since we last dealt with this matter, I do not believe he will accept direct incorporation, despite its being the method favoured by the human rights sector, including the Human Rights Commission, the Bar Council and the Law Society of Ireland. This is a pity because we have  an opportunity to grant extra protections to our citizens without detracting from the constitutional rights they already enjoy. In many ways, their constitutional rights would be enhanced by the direct incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law. A society with maximum protection of rights is a healthy one and can thrive in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">The Minister made some eloquent arguments but I disagree with him, just as some of the aforementioned organisations have disagreed profoundly with his minimalist approach to the convention. I appeal to him to think again and accept these amendments or their spirit so as to provide for direct incorporation.</p>

          <p eId="para_558">The Minister is a lost cause and totally closed to logic and the arguments of every responsible organisation that has examined this issue. He is convinced that everybody is out of step except himself. This may be fortunate from his point of view, but it is unfortunate for the country. He is in a position to hold his station. He is making a retrograde step in terms of human rights. His decision is sending out all the wrong signals and people will suffer as a consequence.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_394" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_574">The convention binds states not individuals in states when dealing with each other. Therefore, the rule of interpretation, which is of huge significance in section 2, obliges a court in interpreting any statutory provision or rule of law to do so in a manner compatible with the State's obligations under the convention provisions. For instance, if two people sue each other in a dispute over land, the convention does not arise on a citizen to citizen, horizontal basis but only on a public law, state to citizen basis. It is not intended to make the convention into a horizontal measure which applies citizen to citizen but purely state to citizen. That is the reason the requirement is set out in the terms it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">It has been commented on a number of occasions that the interpretative approach is not far-reaching. I ask the House to consider the term "statutory provision" as defined in the previous section where it is taken to mean any provision of an Act of the Oireachtas or of any order, regulation, rule, licence, by-law or any other like document issued or otherwise created under a  statute which continues in force by virtue of Article 50 of the Constitution. That includes every statute establishing the courts and every statutory instrument providing for court procedure. Those who have argued it is an incomplete or inadequate provision should recall that.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">It is important to note that this also applies to the rule of law, including common law. Any provision of law such as the law relating to, for instance, hearsay or that relating to the compellability of a spouse against another spouse, or any rule of law of that kind which is not to be found in statute, is also comprehended by this section. It also applies to laws both before and after the passing of this Bill, is prospective and retrospective and is a thorough interpretative provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">The obligation on the courts to interpret our laws applies to the extent that not to so interpret them would be inconsistent with the State's obligations under the convention. Some have argued that there should be an attempt to introduce lateral application of the convention and that the convention should be made a set of rules for everybody dealing with everybody else. In other words, all provisions which are State orientated should also apply to individuals dealing with each other, should be enforceable and, if one wants to go that far, should be actionable horizontally as between citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">As the House will know, our Constitution is actionable horizontally. However, it is not proposed to affect the general law of tort by conferring new causes of action on citizens as against each other. The general law of tort, like any other law in so far as it is not statute based but common law based, will, nonetheless, be subject to interpretation in a manner compatible with the State's obligation under the convention but not in such a manner as to confer obligations or to cast duties upon people, citizen to citizen.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_579">I will not unduly press the point. However, I will put down a marker for the future by asking how bad would it be if there was horizontal application. If there is horizontal application of our fundamental rights under the Constitution, the question arises why there should not be horizontal application of rights under the convention. While I accept that, as the Bill is framed, the Minister does not so intend, I raise the issue as to why he does not so intend. If there were to be horizontal application, the amendment I have proposed would need to be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">I do not intend to press the issue further as it is probably one for another day and is probably a by-product of the broader issue we were discussing. To allow more detailed discussion of other aspects of the Bill, I will not press the amendment at this stage.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_581">I will give a relevant example. Recently, in a somewhat unusual ruling of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg – one which I did not anticipate – in regard to aircraft using Heathrow Airport, it was deter mined that some particular pattern of flights which interfered with people's sleep amounted to a breach of the convention. Whether that is right or wrong or whether all of us if sitting <i>en banc</i> in Strasbourg would have made a similar decision is a different matter. However, I do not want somebody to say that, extrapolating from that decision, Aer Rianta is somehow now to be liable in tort to somebody in Santry or Ranelagh. I do not want to have unintended consequences in this regard. For that reason, it is the State's obligations with which I am concerned. I do not want to create a new, wholly unpredictable and not thought out system of torts. Every tort, in so far as it confers a right on the alleged victim of the tort, imposes an obligation not merely to compensate but to abstain also from infringing the other person's right in regard to the tort.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I do not wish to create a new system of parallel law. If we want to change the law regarding flight paths and sleep at night, let us do it in this House and not look to the ECHR as a means of affecting rights in this area as between citizens. It is complex enough to deal with it as it affects the obligations of the State to its citizens.</p>

          <p eId="para_583">The Minister is too timid in his approach to the European convention. Therein lies the difference between us. I would adopt the convention more wholeheartedly. We have nothing to fear from it. One can always think of an extreme example and envisage an outrageous consequence arising but that has not been the experience in other countries and I doubt that it would be our experience. We already have strong protection of fundamental rights under the Constitution. We are talking about issues on the margin and a court that will not be trying to direct us in that 5% or 10% area. However, the die is cast at this stage. I will not press the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_588">"(3) Where an issue in respect of the interpretation or application of the Convention arises in a case before the District Court or Circuit Court, the District Court or Circuit Court may refer the matter to the High Court and the High Court may give a direction to the District Court or Circuit Court as to the interpretation of the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">(4) In the event that the District Court or the Circuit Court is of the opinion that a statutory provision may be incompatible with the provisions of this Act, the Court shall refer the matter for determination by way of case stated to the High Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">(5) The Rules Committees of the District and Circuit Courts may make rules in relation to the procedures to be followed in respect of the reference of issues arising out of or in relation to the Convention to the High Court.".</p>
          <p eId="para_591">The intention of the amendment is to ensure there is a remedy available at all levels of the justice system, to bring justice closer to the people and to make the system more accessible in terms of time and resources spent on securing a judgment. Under the Government's proposal, claimants can only take a case to the High Court. If they want effective remedy or redress beyond an award of damages or a possible award of compensation at the Government's advisory discretion, they still must go to Strasbourg. They can only go to the High Court to claim under the ECHR if they have exhausted all available constitutional remedies.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Section 3(2) appears to require prior proceedings as a condition for the initiation of section 3 proceedings. Instead, it should be possible to rely on convention rights as an alternative within existing proceedings and it should not be necessary to demonstrate by prior proceedings that there is no other remedy available. The District Court should be permitted to have jurisdiction under section 3(2).</p>
          <p eId="para_593">This is not a major issue for some people but for the majority of citizens, access to the justice system is through the lower courts. They should be entitled, through the District Court or the Circuit Court, to refer issues rather than be required to clog up the already full agenda of the High Court. The Minister should take on board the need for the District Court to have the power to deal with issues relating to the convention. Those courts should also have the power, if need be, to refer the matter to the High Court.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_594">I will speak to amendment No. 38. The point that arises here is how to deal with an issue regarding the convention that arises in a lower court. The Minister said on Committee Stage that a court which might be dealing with a prosecution about a bicycle light would not devote too much time to dealing with convention provisions. However, serious issues can be dealt with in both the District and Circuit Courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Points regarding the Constitution are not decided in the lower courts. However, the courts are subject to the Constitution and accepted principles under the Constitution can be quoted there from time to time. The same situation could arise regarding the convention. What happens if there is a dispute over the interpretation or application  of the convention in such a situation? There is no reason that the convention should not be applicable if a relevant point arose. However, a dispute on interpretation or application could arise. What should happen in that case? There should be a case stated to the High Court in the same way as any other point of law which is not agreed in the District or Circuit Court is sent to the High Court to have the point of law resolved. Why should the same not apply regarding the convention? Why should we not specifically provide for case stated to the High Court if a point must be decided? That is the issue. It is a simple and straightforward point.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_402" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_596">There are differences between the two amendments. Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment proposes to insert a new provision in section 6 of the Bill while Deputy Ó Snodaigh proposes to insert his amendment in section 2 of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">Deputy Ó Snodaigh makes the point that the new subsections should be added to section 2. There is a misunderstanding here. Under section 2, the District Court or the Circuit Court, in considering any law or rule of law, is obliged to do what the High Court is obliged to do, which is to interpret the section in accordance with the convention. The rule of interpretation provided for in section 2 applies to all courts, at all times and in every circumstance. When any court is interpreting a provision of any law, it must do so in a manner compatible with the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment seeks to insert a similar provision into section 5, which is the declaration of incompatibility. In that context, he wants to provide that somebody who wishes to argue in the District Court that a provision of law is incompatible with the convention should have the right to state a case to the High Court for a decision by that court. However, that does not happen in constitutional matters in terms of the validity of a law under the Constitution. If a lawyer in the District Court in Skibbereen or elsewhere comes to the conclusion that, for example, section 49 of the Road Traffic Act infringes his or her client's constitutional rights, the lawyer does not ask the court to refer it by way of case stated to the High Court for its views. The judge in the District Court will adjourn the case and advise the lawyer to issue proceedings in the High Court if he or she wishes to challenge it.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">The judge takes the law as he or she finds it and does not have jurisdiction to consider a point of law as unconstitutional. This Bill provides for the same procedure. In the District Court one can argue that the law must be interpreted a certain way just as one can, at present, argue in the District Court that a constitutional interpretation of the law requires X or Y interpretation to be applied by the judge in coming to his or her conclusion. However, if both the lawyer and the District Court judge are of the view that the law is against the person but the lawyer wants to make the point that the law contravenes the Constitution, the lawyer must invoke the jurisdiction of  the High Court by a separate proceeding. One cannot state a case to the High Court for its consideration on this issue. Likewise, that will not be the case with this Bill in respect of convention incompatibility declarations.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">In the sequence of events, a declaration of incompatibility will be the last step open to the High Court, because it will have gone through an interpretative approach, in respect of any law, rule of law or provision of an Act, and will have asked itself if it is compatible with the Constitution and will decide that it either is or is not. It will only be in the minority of cases – where it believes a provision is both compatible with the Constitution and incompatible with the convention – it will go into the process of considering a declaration of incompatibility. This will be an extremely rare circumstance, since the court will have failed to deal with the issue on an interpretative basis, examined the Constitution and found the provision constitutional and found that, even so, it is still incompatible with the convention. It is only in this extremely narrow area, where the High Court – and possibly the Supreme Court on appeal – comes to a view that the legal provision is fully compatible with the Constitution and yet there is an issue to be determined as to whether it is compatible with the convention, that this jurisdiction under section 6, will be invoked.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">I sincerely hope the Judiciary, in applying the interpretative power under section 2 and then, if necessary, being driven to the constitutional point, will make declarations of incompatibility extremely infrequently. As I understand it, there are few points of divergence between the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court in respect of fundamental rights and that of the European Convention court in Strasbourg.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked that a case stated procedure be inserted into section 2. That is misplaced because, under section 2, the District Court is obliged to carry out that interpretative function itself and to consider the terms of the convention if called upon to do so. Deputy O' Keeffe's amendment only comes into play in the case of the High Court dealing with an incompatibility issue. What the Deputy is arguing for is that the District or Circuit Courts could stop a case halfway through and put the point to the High Court for a declaration of incompatibility. The reason I am against that is that the scheme of the Bill is that the Supreme or High Courts will only make an incompatibility finding when they have ruled on the constitutionality of a particular section or legal provisions. That will be extremely rare. I do not want that to start in the District Court by way of a clever point made halfway through a bicycle lamp or section 49 prosecution or a trial on indictment in the Circuit Court. Rather, I want it to be operated more or less on the same basis as the High Court's and Supreme Court's constitutional jurisdiction is at the moment. It is something which must be invoked separately and the District Court, Circuit Court, Special Criminal Court and Court of  Criminal Appeal take the law as they find it and do their best to interpret it in accordance with section 2. However, they do not go into questions of incompatibility, either with the Constitution or the convention.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_603">In a funny way, the Minister wants to have it both ways here. I have been arguing that the convention is subject to the Constitution. The Minister makes the point that, if a point of a constitutional nature is argued in the lower courts, there must be separate proceedings to decide that point in the High Court. To a degree, that is because I was not regarding the convention as being of a constitutional nature. I was expressing the view that a point raised should be dealt with in the same way as any other point of ordinary law. When a legal point arises in the Circuit or District Courts, it is referred on by way of a case stated. It has been put to me by a number of advisers that perhaps there should be a similar provision for referring such a point from the District Court to the Circuit Court to the High Court by way of a case stated when dealing with a point on the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">To a degree, the Minister elevates a point under the convention to nearly constitutional status when he says he wants to see any such point argued on a constitutional basis first, only then allowing the decision to be made in relation to the convention. If that is the procedure the Minister has in mind, I would understand that the case stated procedure would not arise. I am concerned because I prefer a more direct application and consideration of the convention in all courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">I am a bit rusty since I have not practised for some time. Does the Circuit Court still hear slander proceedings? If a point arose in the Circuit Court regarding article 10 of the convention, the Bill would seem to preclude the point being made in such proceedings. It would seem to require such a point being addressed in separate proceedings in the High Court. If that is what the Minister has in mind, it will involve more cost and delay.</p>

          <p eId="para_606">I will clarify that point. On the contrary, section 2 would require the Circuit Court to interpret any law or rule of law which was in issue before it, in a manner compatible with the convention. It is clearly obliged to do so. In any ordinary day to day case, if an issue arises as to the compatibility of any law or rule of law with the convention, both the District and Circuit Courts are obliged, as a matter of legal interpretation, to do their best to see a convention compatible interpretation of any law or rule of law before them.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_610">Yes. There will be no reference upwards or downwards. The courts will make their decisions, which may be set aside on appeal one way or the other in the ordinary course.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">At the moment, if any issue arises in respect of any section or rule of law in the District or Circuit Courts, any day of the week, it is open to any party in those courts to submit to them that the constitutional interpretation of, say, section 49 of the Road Traffic Act or the Public Order Act, is one rather than the other interpretation. The District Court is fully seized of the right, and obliged to give any constitutional meaning it can, to interpret any section in a constitutional manner. That is the District Court's function. If it finds there are two meanings open – one constitutional and one unconstitutional – it must opt for the constitutional meaning. The District Court and Circuit Court are not precluded from considering the Constitution when interpreting a law, they are obliged to do so as things stand. We cannot say the law is to be interpreted in a different way in different courts or that the District Court and the Circuit Court will never have regard to the convention but the High Court will be expert in these matters. Otherwise the crazy situation would exist where a case would go on appeal from the Circuit Court to the High Court and the same legal provision would have two different interpretations because one court would be told to interpret it by pre-existing common law rules and the next told to interpret by reference to the convention. That is not what is in mind. Every court is covered by section 2 in its ordinary dealings with every statutory provision and rule of law.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">Deputy Jim O'Keeffe says it is inconsistent to say that is the interpretative approach but it is only when the constitutional argument fails that the question of a declaration of incompatibility arises. That is not the case because if, in any court, a judge is bound by section 2 when making a decision on interpretation, if he is then driven to the view that is the law and it has particular meaning, it is open to any party at present to say that if that is its clear meaning, it is unconstitutional and to institute an action in the High Court for a declaration that it is unconstitutional. It is only if that fails, as happened in Senator Norris's case where he challenged the Sexual Offences Act and was turned down in the Supreme Court by a majority decision, that we would expect someone in his position to say that might be all very well constitutionally but there is the Dudgeon case in Strasbourg which was ignored in the judges' decision when they said the law cannot be interpreted according to the convention. If there is a claim that a breach of his  constitutional rights has been ignored, the last thing he could ask the judge to do is to declare that even if it is constitutional, it is incompatible with the convention and to tell the Oireachtas so that he does not have to go to Strasbourg to get a finding in his or her favour. That is where the declaration of incompatibility will arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">Going back to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment, he would say that in ordinary cases, where the issue of compatibility arises, it would somehow be referred upwards. That is not the scheme of this Bill. This Bill requires the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court and any other court to do its level best to interpret the law in a manner compatible with Ireland's obligations under the convention. If it cannot, it cannot. If the law is clearly incompatible, if the law says "black" and the convention says "white" and there is no room for argument on the subject, it is open to a person to go to the High Court and claim it is unconstitutional.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_615">No, because at the moment it would unduly complicate matters. There is no similar case at the moment related to constitutional matters. If a person is confronted in the District Court by a statute that he must give a pint of blood to a garda who suspects him of drunk driving, and he says that is an invasion of his constitutional rights and two millilitres would do, he cannot argue in the District Court that that section of the Road Traffic Act is unconstitutional but he can ask the District Court for an adjournment while he makes the case in the High Court. He cannot ask to have the constitutionality of that section referred upwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">I do not propose to create a "reference-up" mechanism on convention compatibility issues when I am not creating a "reference up" mechanism for constitutional issues. I am not being niggardly, I am trying to ensure the sequence is logical and that in any case, any court will do its best under section 2 to interpret any law we pass or have passed in a manner compatible with the convention. At the end of that, if it is still unsatisfactory from a party's point of view and he claims his rights are being challenged, he can go to the High Court and seek a declaration that his fundamental rights under the Constitution are being infringed.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">If he fails in that, and the law is found to be compatible, he will be given one last relief, the right to inform this House that although the law cannot be interpreted in a convention friendly way, and although it cannot be attacked under the Constitution, it nonetheless is incompatible with the convention and in that extremely narrow band of territory, which I hope will be very rare, a declaration of incompatibility will be handed down by the courts, put before this House and we will be given the opportunity to amend the law  without forcing the person to go to Strasbourg to get the remedy Senator Norris got there.</p>

          <p eId="para_623">Section 1 specifically states that the organs of State must pay due consideration to the provisions of the convention but the courts are excluded in the determination in that section.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">Under section 2, a District Court or Circuit Court will effectively make the decision and interpret the matter itself. The problem could arise that a District Court judge does not feel he or she has sufficient authority to interpret a matter related to the compatibility or otherwise of the convention in the context of the Constitution. We could create a situation where there is an onus on the District Court to make a decision because it feels obliged to do it because there is no other mechanism unless the party involved makes an appeal to a higher court. The court itself cannot state that this is a serious matter involving the Constitution and an issue of incompatibility. I find this complex and it would be best if it was not dealt with in the District Court. Rather than it making the determination, there should be a mechanism for the judge to refer it to a higher court. There should be an in-built appellant function available to the judge in such a context.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">Section 2 places a considerable onus on the District Court in giving it that right of constitutional interpretation while it is not being given the legal mechanism for the judge to state that this is a matter for the High Court or a court other than the very basic court dealing with it. There will be very few instances so those where it arises will be quite complex.</p>

Those rights will not be affected by this. The only thing one cannot do in the District Court is say to the judge that this Bill is unconstitutional and that it should be referred to the High  Court. Under the Constitution, the only court which has the right to hear those complaints is the High Court. The District Court cannot refer a question of constitutionality to the High Court but a District Court judge can, and frequently does, ask the High Court if it is correct to interpret the law this way or that way. That will include questions under section 2. Therefore, one will be able to get a consultative case stated under section 2.</p>

          <p eId="para_642">We are dealing with section 3 and a variety of problems in that section and, perhaps, they can be taken together. We debated these in detail on Committee Stage. The case has been made to me that the section as drafted will give rise to sufficient difficulties of principle and practice. The basic approach I have been seeking at all times is  that people will be able to enforce their convention rights with the minimum of delay and expense. It has been suggested to me that section 3 as framed will not allow for that. To show how reasonable I am on this issue, if the Minister can convince me of that I am open to being convinced but I have not been convinced so far.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">There are a couple of problems in section 3(2), in particular the phrase, "if no other remedy in damages is available" the person can then institute proceedings. How does one prove that no other remedy in damages is available? It also gives rise to the issue as to other remedies, apart from damages. The point has also been made to me that if one were to proceed under section 3 it may be necessary to show that prior unsuccessful proceedings have been launched and brought to a conclusion before one is able to proceed under section 3. That is an issue that has caused concern to a number of people. Rather than waste time on a variety of amendments, I raise the various concerns expressed to me regarding section 3 and perhaps they can be dealt with together.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_432" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_644">The amendment in the names of Deputies Ó Snodaigh and O'Keeffe seeks to remove section 3 in its entirety. I presume that is in the context of proposing alternatives to it rather than simply getting rid of it. This is a far-reaching section which is not available in the United Kingdom and which gives to the High Court and to the Circuit Court jurisdiction in accordance with the levels of damages that those two courts have at present for torts, to award compensation to anybody who claims against an organ of State that it has infringed his or her rights under the convention an entitlement to compensation in damages. This is far-reaching section. It is a new tort and the level of compensation envisaged is not what I would term "convention" compensation, it is compensatory damages along the Irish model of compensation which, generally speaking, has been seen as more generous.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">This new provision which will be available to people in Ireland against organs of the Irish State is a very far-reaching remedy which should not be sniffed at. Some have asked why we do not make it available in the District Court. It may be that in the fullness of time we will consider making it available in the District Court. At present the District Court is under pressure because it has a good deal of work to do in other cases and, by definition, the cases under which these kinds of damages will be awarded are complex. As Deputy O'Keeffe is aware, the District Court does not have equity jurisdiction. It does not have defamation jurisdiction as things stand. There are some things which it is felt are so complex and require so much attention, that a court which is charged with summary, civil and criminal justice and given significant responsibilities especially for family law, should not have responsibility for this matter. These issues will not be capable of being  disposed of in half an hour or an hour like simple car crashes because they will be immensely complex. The cases under this section will not be simple. It is not in any sense pyramid-type snobbery in relation to the courts that has us saying the District Court will not have jurisdiction under this head of quasi tort. It is simply that the cases will be of such complexity that for parties to have them properly dealt with – just like a libel case – it does not make sense to lumber the District Court with the additional obligation of having to set aside time to deal with cases of this kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">It may be that in the future, once this beds down, somebody will suggest extending it to the District Court as it is working so simply and summarily in the Circuit Court that there is a case for giving that jurisdiction to the District Court. I am trying to operate a workable law which does not swamp the District Court with all types of claims that require many hours and many learned lawyers on both sides arguing high points of what happened last week. This is analogous to judicial review because it is damages in respect of actions by the State against its citizens. The District Court does not have a judicial review function at present. In terms of jurisdiction, it strikes a happy balance in giving this jurisdiction to the Circuit Court and High Court. If I was asked for my genuine judgment as to whether this will be a workable provision, I think it is workable in its present form.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Deputy O'Keeffe asked why there is not some other remedy. I presume he had in mind injunctions, things which are not declarations and non-damage based remedies. The simple fact is that it is not necessary to have it in that context.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_649">We are providing people with a remedy in damages. If one wants to injunct a State body from carrying out a function of one kind or another, one does that in the High Court by judicial review orders which used to be called <i>mandamus</i> and <i>certiorari,</i> and through injunctions. One does not usually get those in the Circuit Court. I do not want to swamp a system which is already under pressure. The courts system is not sitting there waiting for cases to flutter down like butterflies on a lazy afternoon. The entire system is under pressure and it must be organised. Some matters are of a degree of seriousness and complexity which suits them to some courts rather than others. In this context, if one were to introduce something like an injunction or a declaration, one would replicate in large measure the law relating to judicial review.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">I ask Deputy Jim O'Keeffe to remember that uniting section 2 with judicial review law as we understand it – the law relating to <i>mandamus,</i>
                        <i>quo warranto,</i>
                        <i>certiorari</i> and the declarations and injunctions which go with those – will provide substantially what he asks for. Convention issues will be melded into judicial review law. In exercising its judicial review function over State bodies  in public law matters, the High Court will, by virtue of section 2, incorporate the convention into all of its decision making processes. Some of the critics of this Bill have been very quick to dismiss it on the grounds that it does not provide for certain things. If one marries our existing law of judicial review to section 2 of this Bill, one will have a very complex system of enforcement of what some might call “convention-based rights”. If I felt I was doing an inadequate, mean or niggardly job on this, while knocking out provisions for the sake of it, I would confess to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_666">If the Minister were to wake up in the morning to find that he was in breach of the convention in 30,000 cases last year, there would be the same difficulty. We should have the same limitation period as for the normal tort. There should not be a specifically limited limitation period for a convention claim. The Minister has not made a very good argument for having a special limitation of one year. We are perhaps agreed about the need for reducing the general limit, but we will discuss the matter separately.</p>

          <p eId="para_668">There is an arguable case there. Why not have the same limitation period for claims brought under this section? It all seems to be part of a restrictive, tight, miserable and niggardly approach to the European Convention on Human Rights. It concerns me as it is not the correct approach. I am sad to see the Minister adopting it.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_452">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_669">We are touching on the other important issue in the Bill; the question of the remedy in relation to a matter of incompatibility between the convention and existing legislation. We are unlikely to get to discussion of amendment No. 36, but I raise at this point the issue of a pardon which the Minister promised to examine as part of a remedy process. In the section we are discussing there is reference only to damages which is not adequate to suit all cases. The Minister will recognise that himself. He might say the remedy is generous, but he would be the only one to say so. He describes his critics as being ungenerous, but they would hardly be critics if they were too generous with regard to what the Minister proposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">A serious problem arises in section 3 and flows on to section 5 in terms of an appropriate remedy where we find ourselves in a situation of incompatibility. I would like to spend some time exploring the reason the Minister has limited the remedy to damages and the reason he will not examine some other form of compensatory remedy. Obviously, a release mechanism would be one such remedy whereby a person would get a relief more appro priate to their circumstances. It is extremely limiting to provide a single form of remedy. The Minister provides in section 5 for an <i>ex gratia</i> compensation remedy, but he will not consider proposing a pardon in another instance where it would be appropriate to a particular offence. It would be a useful remedy in the circumstances which might arise. I ask the Minister to deal with that. It is unlikely we will get as far as section 5, but the substance of what we are trying to deal with is in section 3.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_673">I move:</p>
          <p eId="para_674">That Dáil Éireann:</p>
          <p eId="para_675">– noting the recent critical reports on the treatment of people with mental illness by Amnesty International, the Irish Psychiatric Association and the Inspector of Mental Hospitals;</p>
          <p eId="para_676">– concerned that Irish mental health policy and service provision remain out of step with international best practice and that the institutionalisation of the mental health services in Ireland has failed to live up to World Health Organisation standards;</p>
          <p eId="para_677">– believing that the high admission and re-admission rates to psychiatric hospitals are due in large measure to the lack of community based facilities;</p>
          <p eId="para_678">– concerned at the lack of dedicated psychiatric facilities for adolescents, the lengthy waiting lists for treatment and the lack of consistency in the provision of mental health services throughout the country; and</p>
          <p eId="para_679">– deploring the fact that people with intellectual disability continue to be inappropriately accommodated in psychiatric facilities in violation of human rights law; condemns the Government for its neglect of the mental health sector and failure to vindicate the human rights of people with mental illness and for the reduction in the percentage of the health budget spent on  mental health and calls on the Government to immediately bring forward a comprehensive package of measures, including appropriate finances, to provide:</p>
          <p eId="para_680">– a comprehensive, needs-based, service-user-led review of the mental health care services, promptly and fully implemented, ensuring that they meet international human rights standards and best practice in line with the World Health Organisation 2001 annual report, with an emphasis on community-based care;</p>
          <p eId="para_681">– regular quality research in all areas of mental health care needs and service provision, an essential prerequisite for the development of a quality service;</p>
          <p eId="para_682">– full financial provision for all areas of mental health care;</p>
          <p eId="para_683">– all necessary resources and assistance for the Mental Health Commission in its securing adequate care and conditions for people with mental illness;</p>
          <p eId="para_684">– effective action on all relevant recommendations made in the reports of international treaty-based committees, annual reports of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, and Government reviews and reports;</p>
          <p eId="para_685">– a comprehensive system of personal advocacy and an effective complaints procedure to ensure that people with mental illness are assisted in exercising the full range of their rights;</p>
          <p eId="para_686">– specialised mental health care for all who need it, including children, the homeless, prisoners, people with other forms of disability, Travellers, asylum seekers and refugees, and other minority or vulnerable groups;</p>
          <p eId="para_687">– a public education and awareness campaign to counter the stigma of mental illness, emphasising the rights of people with mental illness; and</p>
          <p eId="para_688">– rights-based disability and mental health legislation to give full effect to its international human rights obligations, with due regard to its obligation to enable persons with disabilities to exercise their rights on an equal basis with other citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">I welcome the opportunity to introduce this motion and welcome the Minister of State and fellow Limerick representative, Deputy O'Malley, who has responsibility for mental health services. Mental health is one of the most neglected areas of the health services. The Minister for Health and Children has chosen to ignore the great stress, pain and suffering caused by the  scandalous lack of resources to deliver a semblance of a mental health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">Society will be judged on how it protects and deals with its weakest members. Surely among the weakest are those with a psychiatric illness. The State practically ignores them and the mental health services are neglected. I will develop this argument in the course of my speech. I ask the Minister of State to deal with the issues rather than, as his civil servants often suggest, give us a history lesson.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">John Saunders, director of Schizophrenia Ireland, has stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_692">Mental health care services are in crisis, characterised by decreasing funding, inequitable distribution of resources, antiquated and poorly maintained facilities and poor community support services. This has lead to a situation of low staff morale, insufficient treatment and care programmes and higher involuntary admission rates to hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">The internationally respected psychiatrist Professor Anthony Clare stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_694">The mentally ill are now the most systematically stigmatised group in our society. They . . . are the lepers of today.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">We call on the Dáil to support our motion condemning the Government's neglect of the mental health sector and its failure to vindicate the human rights of people with mental illness. I sincerely welcome the Amnesty International report Mental Health – the Neglected Quarter, which has strongly voiced its concern at the inattention paid by the Government to a series of national and international reports critical of its failure to fully respect the human rights of people with mental illness.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">Irish mental health care policy and service provision does not comply with the best practice. This report is one of the most comprehensive investigations and examinations of the mental health services and is a bible for anybody interested in this area. I again congratulate Amnesty International for putting in the time and resources to produce such an excellent report and for making 2003 its year for campaigning for those with a mental illness.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">Amnesty International is clear where the responsibility lies. It states that "ultimate responsibility for compliance with international law lies with the Government, not with the individual Government Departments, health boards, Civil Servants or service providers". The House must recognise that the systematic discrimination against people with mental illness is an abuse of their human rights. The United Nations principles for the protection of persons with mental illness and for the improvement of mental health care, known as the M1 principles, were adopted in 1991. These apply to all persons with a mental illness, whether or not in in-patient psychiatric care. They state that all persons with a mental illness, or who are being treated as such persons,  shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person and shall have the right to exercise all civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights as recognised by the universal declaration of human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">It also provides that all persons have the right to the best available mental care. The Government is failing to provide this. In fact, Amnesty International has identified seven international treaties of which the Government is in breach. It is a disgrace that the human rights of those with mental illness are not being protected as a result of neglect over decades of the need to invest in facilities for those who have mental illness. The Government has failed to introduce a rights based disability Bill, which is the key to ensuring that the rights to which I have referred are implemented by law.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">Prior to the last election an unacceptable Bill was introduced which was not rights based. We were informed in the Dáil that a short period of consultation would take place and an amended Bill would be introduced. One year later, on 13 May, the Taoiseach stated in the Dáil, in response to my question, that "It is the view of those who are authorities on this issue that the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill should be brought forward and passed first". This was repeated today to Deputies Rabbitte and Kenny. This is an affront to our intelligence and is a recipe for burying the Bill indefinitely.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">It is fairly well known that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is not in favour of rights based legislation. Such legislation would force the Government to face up to its responsibilities to the 1,711 individuals living at home with intellectual disabilities who require full time residential service, 861 who require a day service and 1,014 who require a respite service and are being denied. The Government should come clean with these people and their carers and tell them the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">In general, our treatment of people with disabilities is often at variance with international standards. The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in its 2002 concluding observations on Ireland, noted "the persistence of discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities, especially in the fields of employment, social security benefits, education and health" and expressed concern that "the principals of non-discrimination and equal access to health facilities and services was not embodied in the recently published national health strategy".</p>
          <p eId="para_702">It is a scandal that there are still more that 400 people with intellectual disability living in totally unsuitable conditions in long stay psychiatric hospitals. The inspector for mental hospitals has, over the years, pointed out the inappropriateness of this both for those suffering from an intellectual disability and those suffering from a psychiatric disorder.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">We welcome the fact that the number of people in psychiatric hospitals at any one time has plum meted over the decades. In 1958 there were 21,075 in-patients in public psychiatric hospitals compared to about 4,500 at present. This has been largely due to a change in the approach to psychiatric institutions. In previous decades these were often used to overcome social difficulties and some people were in psychiatric institutions who nowadays would have no necessity to be long stay patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">There was a certain view that once people had a psychiatric illness they were placed in a psychiatric institution and allowed to live out their days in the institution. Medical advances in the psychiatric area, society's greater understanding of the opportunity to treat those suffering from a mental illness and the policies of subsequent Governments to reduce these numbers have brought about the present situation. The reduction in in-patient psychiatric beds was largely due to the death of long stay patients and, to a lesser extent, to the community resettlement of long stay patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">In the 1980s, the de-institutionalisation occurred with a move from placing people in large psychiatric hospitals to more a community based model of service provision. However, this process has met with some difficulties, with sufficient resources not being made available by the Government to ease the transition to community care. In 2001 the Health Research Board noted that "the number of admissions to psychiatric hospitals and units has changed little over the last 20 years. In all there were 24,282 admissions in the year 2000 and 70% of these were re-admissions. This exemplifies both the enduring or re-occurant nature of much major mental illness and the need for a greater expansion of community based alternatives to long stay hospital care".</p>
          <p eId="para_706">In 2001, the World Health Organisation stated that the institutionalisation process had three essential components in preventing inappropriate mental hospital admissions, namely, the provision of community facilities, the discharge to the community of long-term institutional patients who have received adequate preparation and the establishment and maintenance of community support systems for non-institutionalised patients. Institutionalisation in Ireland has failed to live up to this standard. Ireland has excessively high admission rates to psychiatric hospitals, both voluntary and involuntary, due in large part to the lack of community-based alternatives. There is a shortage of acute beds for those in need of emergency admission due to inappropriate non-acute admissions of those who do not require emergency in-patient care because of the lack of appropriate alternative services.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">The 1984 strategy, Planning for the Future, lists seven components of community care which are broadly similar to the WHO specifications. These include prevention and early identification, assessment and diagnostic treatment centres, in-patient care, day care, out-patient care, community-based residence and rehabilitation and  training. The Minister must accept it is a disgrace that, almost 20 years after the publication of the strategy, none of these have been adequately provided. I call on him to immediately commence a comprehensive review of the mental health care services to ensure they meet the international human rights standards and those of best professional practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">Fine Gael's programme, Health of the Nation, states that there is overwhelming evidence that psychiatric services concentrating on rapid response community settings are superior to more conventional services. It is Fine Gael policy to introduce a community-based early intervention service to provide a rapid response for patients with mental illness. This service will see patients in their houses, and other appropriated settings, including general practices, the community base, day centres, or, relatively rarely, hospitals. This will be styled on the hospice home service. The team will be multi-disciplinary including senior psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, social workers, psychologists, and occupational therapists. The overall philosophy is to try to treat all mental disorders outside hospital in the first instance, with particular emphasis on joint working with other agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">While many people with mental illness will be best served by community-based care, for others admission to acute in-patient care is necessary and is the best available mental health care required by international law. In Ireland there is a shortage of psychiatric beds for acute admissions with the result that many are left waiting for the care they need or people in hospital are inappropriately moved. Mr. John Dolan of the Disability Federation of Ireland has stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_710">People with mental illness continue to live in acute beds in mental hospitals for no reasons other than the lack of suitable accommodation for them in the community. People are remaining in long stay institutional care for far longer than they require. We continued to abandon people with mental illness in unsuitable and inappropriate institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">The 2001 report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, published in 2002, highlights that, in particular, older people, people with alcohol problems and homelessness are remaining in institutional care for longer than they require. The report states:</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Currently close to 46% of persons in psychiatric units in hospitals are over 65 and in some instances, particularly among the long stay patients, this figure exceeds 50%. Many, but not all, of these older persons now show little sign of behavioural disturbance related to psychiatric disorder and, among the more elderly of them, in particular, their needs and disabilities relate to their age rather than to any psychiatric disorder. Their continued residence in long stay psychiatric facilities is neither appropriate nor best suited to their needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">The report details a catalogue of substandard hospitals and units, overcrowding and poor living conditions and a failure to comply with the United Nations principles which provide for the right to privacy in patient care. The majority of patients interviewed by the inspector complained of a lack of privacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">The report highlights a number of concerns. The physical health examination of in-patients, as documented in in-patients records, was often infrequent, desultory and superficial in nature. Given that psychiatric patients are known to enjoy poorer health and have higher mortality than the general population, it is particularly important that this be addressed, especially for long-stay patients in psychiatric hospital or community residence. The occurrence of sudden deaths in psychiatric in-patients due to asphyxia from the inhalation of food or other material, mainly in older patients, reveals a need to train staff in appropriate procedures in cases of foreign body airway obstruction and to provide the care necessary in feeding many older, feeble patients with poor swallowing capacity. Suicides among psychiatric patients at local level are not the subject of any formal audit, and there is a need for local services carefully to audit cases of suicide so that lessons may be learned to make risk assessment and management more potent and effective in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">I call on the Minister to immediately address these matters of concern to the inspector. Many of the long-stay institutions were constructed in the middle 1800s and many are totally inappropriate for modern day hospital standards and would be considered a national scandal if general hospital patients were being treated in such conditions. These substandard conditions are both an affront to the dignity of the patients and the working conditions of the staff. They are symbolic of a different era.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">All psychiatric institutions in a poor state of repair should be closed down where practicable or refurbished where not. These should be replaced by modern purpose-built hostels for long-stay patients. Acute psychiatric units should be provided in general hospitals for patients in need of acute, short-stay treatment, or similar. Modern special secure facilities should be provided for the relatively small number of long-term, severely-disturbed patients. These changes should include the segregation of younger patients, functional psychotic patients and patients with intellectual disability so they do not share the same ward.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">As many as 18% of the child population under the age of 16 will experience significant mental health problems at some period of their development, yet services in Ireland for them are very few. They are difficult to access and there are long waiting lists. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has noted that the lack of dedicated adolescent services reduces the child service ability to treat younger children so that waiting lists for child psychiatry services are lengthened  further by the need to respond urgently to adolescents.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">Many of the child psychiatric teams currently in place throughout the country do not have the full complement of team members. Psychiatric disorders increase in incidence and prevalence during adolescent years. The incidence and prevalence of deliberate self-harm and attempted suicide also increase with increasing age through the adolescent phase. Epidemiology studies show that psychological disturbance of varying intensity exists in up to 20% of adolescents, yet it is a disgrace that there is a lack of dedicated adolescent psychiatric services. Most areas are seriously short of adolescent psychiatric facilities and in some there are none at all. It is also a disgrace, as I said earlier, that children with mental health needs are placed in psychiatric hospitals. The Government must immediately recognise the difficulties experienced and redirect the lives of children with, or at risk of, mental illness with a comprehensive provision of dedicated mental care services, particularly given the relationship between mental illness and other life difficulties such as homelessness and poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">Information on the prevalence of mental illness, and the mental health care needs of Ireland's homeless, and research into appropriate effective responses is very limited. Policy makers and advocacy bodies must consequently operate on estimates and various sources put the proportion of Ireland's homeless suffering from a mental illness at between 30% and 50%. The Government has provided very few specialised mental health teams and outreach services dedicated to this population. Given that the community care services for the homeless are so deficient, with a particular shortage of community-based residential care accommodation, high numbers of people with mental health problems are becoming homeless.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">In the European context Ireland is exceptional in the underdeveloped nature of its service to mentally ill people who are homeless. In particular, supported housing is a neglected and under-provided area in Ireland. Additional difficulties exist for homeless people in accessing medical care due to the sectorisation of psychiatric services into catchment areas, introduced on foot of the 1984 Government strategy Planning for the Future which is inappropriate to the needs of the homeless. Strictly speaking, homeless people in need of mental health care should return to their previous place of residence effectively leaving many of them without a service. It is obvious that a system, which operates on the basis of place of residence excludes the homeless. The Government must immediately and adequately address the high level of mental illness in Ireland's homeless population.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">Many homeless people remain in hospital over long periods of time. The inspector of mental hospitals in his recent report stated "time and again the inspectorate has been struck by the number of current psychiatric in-patients who are  homeless and are accommodated in acute or long stay hospital wards despite being suitable for community residential placement". In its report Health Plan for the Nation, Fine Gael states:</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The practice of discharging those treated for mental health who are homeless back on the streets will be addressed. Each health authority will provide specialised hostel accommodation for three months for homeless patients discharged from mental institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">The abysmal failure to build adequate and appropriate community psychiatric and psychological services for the mentally ill and unwell people in prison has resulted in mental illness becoming criminalised. People who urgently need medical attention go unnoticed in society and are left unattended for years. Many become homeless. Some die by suicide. Others end up in prison. The Irish Penal Reform Trust estimates that almost 40% of the prison population may be suffering from some level of psychiatric or psychological illness or disturbance. The prison environment is detrimental to their mental health. To say there is inadequate psychiatric and psychological treatment in prisons is the understatement of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">The mental health service in our prisons can best be summed up by the use of the strip or padded cell. These cells are small, empty, furnished only with a thin mattress on the ground and a blanket. The prisoner is often left naked and at most with an underpants or night dress. The windows are sealed, thus the cells are inevitably stuffy. If there is a slopping out bucket, it is very smelly. Some prisoners are locked up for 24 hours. These are usually people who are suicidal. Prison records show that 78% of those detained in padded cells are detained for mental health reasons while just 13% are so detained for punishment. Dr. Valerie Bresnihan of the Irish Penal Reform Trust has stated that "to use these cells as a substitute for appropriate medical services is scandalous. Most of all it is an absolute denial of human rights". Dr. Smith of the Central Mental Hospital has stated that the gross overuse of the padded cell for psychiatric disability "is a grotesque way of storing a human being". If I had the time I could give the Minister of State numerous examples of people with mental difficulties who are in padded cells for up to 18 days. In one case the person was in a padded cell for 25 days out of 30 in solitary confinement when international research shows that after three days there is a psychological difficulty with confinement.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">The results of a survey of psychiatric services in Ireland, conducted by the Psychiatric Association which was published in March of this year, indicated that psychiatric resources are already overstretched and, rather than being concentrated in areas of greatest need, have paradoxically been developed in areas of greatest affluence. The absence of an up to date national mental health strategy for developing the service is one of the  main causes of current inequities in resource distribution. The Psychiatric Association states that the lack of a national strategy has also led to a situation where there is a very limited availability of specialist services. There is an urgent need for forward planning of mental health services in Ireland to avoid <i>ad hoc</i> and inequitable distribution of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Rather than resources concentrating in areas of most need, this survey found that the reverse is true. The number of beds per head of population is widely accepted as a reliable index of medical resources. This survey found that resources were concentrated in the most privileged rather than the most deprived areas. This inequity was most marked in Dublin but was true for the country generally. The survey also found that the number of consultants relative to population levels was significantly reduced in areas with the highest levels of social deprivation, more significantly, the number of temporary, relative to permanent, consultant appointments was greater in deprived areas. Basic specialist services were generally not available outside Dublin and availability within Dublin is based on geographical proximity to special services. There is no neuropsychiatry service available to Irish patients with psychiatric disorders with the result that individuals with brain injury, brain disease or those with a psychiatric disorder as a result of a neurological disease do not receive specialist treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">Public services for those suffering from eating disorders are largely restricted to those in the east coast area health board in Dublin. Fine Gael's Health Plan for the Nation states that the need of this group must be recognised. It is Fine Gael policy to train people in the management of eating disorders in each health authority area. A dedicated service should be set up through out-patient and, where necessary, in-patient care.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">In the first half of the 1960s, an average of 64 people died by suicide per annum. In the past five years an average of 456 died. In 2002, 451 people took their own lives and about 10,000 attempted suicide. The true figure is higher. If a jumbo jet crashed in Ireland and all the passengers died, the tragic loss would be greeted with horror. An immediate, extensive, and probably expensive, investigation into the circumstances of the accident would be held. The response of the Government to this serious public health issue is to cut the 2003 budget for suicide prevention and research by 40% to €655,000. A total of 379 people were killed on the road last year. Coroners have found that some of these were suicides. This was 72 less than the suicide rate. Yet the contribution to promoting road safety, which is under-funded, is €22 million, 33 times that spent on suicide prevention.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">Dr. Connolly, secretary of the Irish Association of Suicidology has stated that "up to 90% of those who take their own life suffer from a psychiatric illness. The introduction of a community-based mental health service will have a considerable effect in reducing levels of suicide  and attempted suicide."  Finally, as my time is running out, mental health and mental illness are key questions deriving from the value structure of a rapidly expanding modern society like ours. Mental illness is not understood by many, and when a family is touched by one of these illnesses the reaction is often one of stigma, shock and incomprehension. This adds to the suffering both of the victim and the victim's family. Negative attitudes to mental illness need to be addressed. The low level of awareness in the general public of all areas of the service limits the assessing of those in need of the service. The Government should introduce a public awareness campaign through the media on all aspects of mental illness and positive mental health issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">I wish to draw the Minister of State's attention to the fact that there is no dedicated service for those with personality disorders or with anti-social disorders. It is not appropriate that they are referred to psychiatrists, as they are not mentally ill. Each health authority area should provide a dedicated facility for in-patient and out-patient care staffed with expertise in cognitive psychology and forensic psychiatry-psychology. I commend the motion to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">I wish to share my remaining time with Deputies Crawford and Ring.</p>

        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_457">
          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_733">No doubt whatever time I do not fill will be filled by Deputy Ring.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">I congratulate Deputy Neville. Following what he said about those who had been looked after in mental hospitals, it is important that I mention that the move towards keeping people out of long-term care started in my area under Dr. Owens in St. Davnet's. He and the staff have done a tremendous job to ensure that as many as possible are moved out into the community and looked after there. They may go too far at times, and I have had some differences with them over individuals, for we must be sensitive to family needs and the situations in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">This is the year of the disabled. The Special Olympics torch is on its way to Ireland and will arrive here in the next few days. No doubt when the crowds line up in Croke Park the world media will be there. There will be no one better than our Taoiseach to utilise every camera and photo call to show our involvement in the games. It is marvellous that we have brought the Special Olympics to this country. It is time that our Taoiseach and Government look into their own hearts and souls and ask themselves whether they are meeting their commitments and the needs of people with such problems, ensuring that there is a proper structure for them and that finance for them is not curtailed when it is still available for many other questionable issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">There is currently a place for a physically handicapped person in the training centre in Monaghan, but there is no funding for a personal assistant to cover it. That used to be dealt with  by community employment. When CE was curtailed, we were assured that funds would be provided through the health board, education or some other conduit to ensure that such posts were provided. That young person is not achieving his potential and will certainly be damaged mentally by sitting at home instead of getting proper training. There is a brand-new training centre in Monaghan, set up with help from EU funds. I was fortunate enough to be with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, when he announced that the money had been provided for that centre. It is helping to train 40 people with different levels of mental and physical disability. There is no doubt that it could train at least 40 more if the funds were available, which would be of great benefit to parents and, more especially, to the individuals concerned, helping them support themselves better.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">Respite care is another major issue. When one sees two girls, no longer in the first bloom of youth, being looked after by their 86 year old mother – last year, they were not able to get respite care for them for two weeks to allow their mother a holiday with her only other daughter in England – one feels sore that the Celtic tiger economy cannot cater for such a thing. They could possibly have been facilitated in the St. Davnet's complex, but for all the right reasons the family did not feel that that was the proper place for them. In spite of the difficulties we may be going through financially, I would not like to think that that lady, now 86 years old, who has looked after not only those two but other long-deceased children from birth, would not get the little help to which she is entitled, ensuring that she can get a reasonable holiday to restore her body and soul. That is the type of case.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">A total of 207 personnel are now not having their contracts renewed. Those people were looking after the disabled, and I urge the Minister to look seriously at the area. I congratulate Deputy Neville for raising the matter at this level.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_458">
          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_739">I too compliment Deputy Neville for putting this on the agenda. The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, has a serious job in the Government protecting the people concerned, for they will not be able to march on Dáil Éireann. They will not have the voice or support of the general public and have not had it hitherto. I compliment Deputy Neville and Dr. Connolly in Castlebar for putting on the agenda the problem of suicide in this country over many years when others tried to sweep it under the carpet, not putting the necessary funding in place or discussing the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">Many thousands of families have been affected by suicide. As an elected politician, I always know when I go to a funeral home, if I have not heard what the person has died from, that it is suicide. The family does not know whether to grieve, cry or get angry. They do not know where to turn or what the community is thinking about them. It is time that resources were put into mental health.  For too long in this country, if people had any kind of mental illness, they were locked away for life. Now they are being pushed out onto the streets, and there is no place for them. They have no middle ground. I am not saying that the mentally ill should be locked up. I believe in what the Government has been doing over the years to bring them out into the community, but there is no point in throwing such people onto the streets if there is not proper supervision and care in place or proper professional help for them. Deputy Neville is right when he says that thousands of people are on the streets every night.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">We see where resources have gone, hearing daily about Government jets and €30,000 spent on junkets for members of the Pensions Board. The money should be spent on people with such difficulties as these. I heard the Minister say on national radio that he had visited many hospitals. People are still complaining. We are now in 2003, and we still have facilities in this country not fit for human beings. That should not be allowed. We elected politicians should be ashamed that we are not here fighting for the underprivileged and those who have no one to fight for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">I listen at my clinics to people whose family members have mental illnesses. They feel that there is no one for them, that they are left alone and that the State has sold them down the river. They think that the next-door neighbours wonder what is wrong with them. Why have we such great sympathy for drunkards that one can go up the streets and everyone will say what a poor fellow he is? He has inflicted that on himself, but the poor person with a mental illness has not done so. We do not say that he or she is a poor devil and ask what we are doing about it and why we cannot help the person or put facilities in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">I congratulate Deputy Neville and Dr. Connolly for putting suicide on the agenda and bringing this motion before the Dáil. As I said, if we do not discuss it in this House and provide the necessary resources, those people will not be able to march and hold up Dublin city. They will not be out tomorrow holding up the city. Fianna Fáil, Labour Party and Fine Gael Deputies will not go out to meet them, shaking their hands and welcoming them, promising to do what they can. They are forgotten and left alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">There is nobody to support them. It is shameful for society that we have not put the resources into mental health. We have let those people down. Since the foundation of the State we have locked them up and now we are throwing them out on the street without giving them the necessary medical help. It is wrong that they are out on the street and it is wrong of us not to provide the necessary resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy O'Malley, has a job to do and he will have to cry foul if he is not getting the necessary resources for these people. If he does not get the money to put professionals in place he will have to say: "This cannot go on.  I do not want to be part of a Government that is not putting funding in place."</p>
          <p eId="para_746">I compliment Deputy Neville for putting this on the agenda. The cutbacks can affect any other part of society but there should be no cutbacks in the mental health area. Increased funding and professional help should be put in place.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</from>
          <p title="amendmentProposal" eId="para_747">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p eId="para_748">To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and to substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_749">– welcomes the Government's commitment to prepare a national policy framework for the further modernisation of mental health services which will take account of recent legislative reform, developments in the care and treatment of mental illness and current best practice;</p>
          <p eId="para_750">– commends the action taken by the Government and the former Government since 1997 in improving mental health services, in particular, the further development of community-based services and the development of new acute psychiatric units in general hospitals; and</p>
          <p eId="para_751">– acknowledges the need for the further development of services to people with a mental illness over the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">I propose to share my time with the Minister for Health and Children. I am pleased to speak on issues relating to the provision of services to people with mental illness and to outline the measures being taken by the Government in this area. I have listened carefully to the contributions to this debate so far and I fully recognise the need to further improve standards in our mental health services. I assure the House that there is an equal amount of compassion on this side of the House regarding the issue of mental health services. No one person has a monopoly of compassion in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">Amnesty International's report, Mental Illness – The Neglected Quarter, which was published earlier this year, highlighted areas of genuine concern in relation to mental health services. These are concerns which the Government shares and fully intends to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">It would be helpful to begin by referring to the document which has been the cornerstone of mental health policy for successive Governments for almost 20 years. The report, The Psychiatric Services – Planning for the Future, developed the concept of a comprehensive psychiatric service located in the community close to where people live and work. It was envisaged that this would replace the centralised and largely institutional services which were planned at a time when modern treatment methods were not available.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">Unfortunately, the rate of progress over the past 20 years in closing down the old hospitals  and building up the community services has not been as fast as had been hoped. It has to be acknowledged that, over the years, the mental health services have frequently lost out to other services which have been given priority in the allocation of development funding. If we are to sustain and develop the concept of a comprehensive psychiatric service located in the community, adequate funding and support must be provided. I fully recognise that much needs to be done in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">Substantial capital funding under the national development plan has been allocated to the development of mental health facilities. Approximately €190 million is being provided over the lifetime of the plan which will enable the further provision of acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals and the provision of additional community-based facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">The Inspector of Mental Hospitals plays a crucial role in providing an independent and detailed analysis of the mental health services. On the publication of his report for 2001 in September of last year, I was the first to acknowledge that more needs to be done to further improve the quality of our services. Notwithstanding the shortcomings which have been identified, there have been many improvements in the services, which have been outlined in successive annual reports of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. These relate particularly to the increase in the number of acute psychiatric units associated with general hospitals. In 1983, prior to the publication of Planning for the Future, there were ten such units in place; this has now increased to 19, with a number of others at various stages of development. The number of community residences in 1983 was 111 with less than 1,000 places. In 2001, this had increased to 404 with more than 3,000 places. In the same period the number of in-patients in psychiatric hospitals and units has reduced from approximately 13,000 to just over 4,000. The decline in numbers of new long-stay patients does not necessarily reflect a decline in the incidence and prevalence of psychiatric illness as a whole. However, it is clear that hospitalised prevalence of serious psychiatric illness has declined greatly in recent years. Patients are increasingly being cared for in settings other than in-patient care with less disruption to their daily lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">I intend to continue to accelerate the growth in more appropriate care facilities for persons with a mental illness with the further development of community-based facilities throughout the country. Substantial additional revenue funding has been provided since 1999 for the enhancement and development of community-based mental health services. This is being used in the main to provide additional medical and health professional staff for expanding services. Again, this commitment of funding has led to considerable progress being made in increasing the number of new mental health centres, day hospitals and other day facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">Since coming to office I have visited a number of psychiatric hospitals and have seen at first hand the commitment of professional and nursing staff to the provision of a high quality service. From the outset, I accepted that further investment needed to be made in upgrading or replacing some of the physical facilities and that a greater capital investment was required to provide a community-based infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">The World Health Organisation's 2001 report, Mental Health: New Understanding, New Hope, was aimed at raising public and professional awareness worldwide of the burden of mental illness and its costs in human, social and economic terms. It is a comprehensive review of all aspects of mental health, from prevalence and treatment to service provision and planning and it concludes with a set of ten broad recommendations for action.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">Steady progress has been made in this country over recent years in many of the areas covered by the World Health Organisation's recommendations, for example, in the shift from institutional to community-based care and in the reform of mental health legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">The Amnesty report also recommended that a comprehensive review of the mental health services be undertaken. I welcomed that recommendation at the time, because the National Health Strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You, published in 2001, had recognised the need to update mental health policy to take account of recent legislative reform, developments in the care and treatment of mental illness and current best practice. The strategy gave a commitment that a national policy framework for the further modernisation of the mental health services, updating the 1984 document, would be prepared. An expert group will be established shortly to undertake this work.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">Work on a draft scoping document and terms of reference for the group is almost finalised within the Department and I am pleased to inform the House that the recommendations of the World Health Organisation will be among the matters to be considered in the formulation of this new framework. The present Inspector of Mental Hospitals plays a crucial role in providing independent and detailed analysis of our mental health services and I pay tribute to Dr. Dermot Walsh, Inspector of Mental Hospitals, for his Trojan work in this area for many years. The inspectorate has provided both expertise and assistance in identifying problems and outlining the need for improvements. Under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001, the existing office of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals will be replaced with the office of the Inspector of Mental Health Services, thus giving the new inspector a much broader statutory remit than that of the current inspector. I understand that the Mental Health Commission is currently recruiting the new inspector and it is hoped that he or she will be in a position to commence inspections in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">In addition to the annual inspections of in-patient facilities which are carried out at present, the new inspector will be required to carry out an annual review of all mental health services, including community residences and day centres as well as acute in-patient facilities. The inspector's review of the services, including reports of inspections carried out, will be published along with the Mental Health Commission's annual report and will be laid before the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">Another important responsibility of the inspector will be in the area of the regulation of standards in the mental health services. The new Mental Health Commission will maintain a register of approved centres, in which each hospital or in-patient facility providing psychiatric care and treatment must be registered. Regulations will be made specifying the standards to be maintained in all approved centres, including requirements regarding food and accommodation, care and welfare of patients, suitability of staff and the keeping of records. The execution and enforcement of these regulations will be the responsibility of the Mental Health Commission, through the work of the Inspector of Mental Health Services.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">It is my firm belief that this will lay the foundations for achieving a sustained improvement in the quality of care provided in our mental health services. Both the Mental Health Commission and the new Inspector of Mental Health Services will play a pivotal role in this regard. The current Inspector of Mental Hospitals has, however, already begun this process. A document entitled Guidelines on Good Clinical Practice and Quality Assurance in Mental Health Services was prepared by the current inspector and published by the Department in 1998. The guidelines are an educational endeavour to increase awareness of the main quality issues in service delivery and their monitoring, refinement and improvement. They have been circulated to mental health professionals and service providers around the country. I anticipate that similar guidelines and other measures would be developed by the new commission to assist service providers in their pursuit of excellence in care delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">In the period 1999 to 2002, an additional €70.7 million was invested in the mental health services. In the current year, additional revenue funding of €7.6 million is being provided for ongoing developments in mental health services, to develop and expand community mental health services, to increase child and adolescent services, to expand the later-life psychiatry services, to provide liaison psychiatry services in general hospitals and to enhance the support provided to voluntary agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">Priority is being given to the development of mental health services for psychiatry of later life and child and adolescent psychiatric services. Additional resources have been made available by my Department to enable ongoing developments in these services. I recognise that the  increasing number of people living to advanced old age will require the development of specialist mental health services which will meet the specific needs of older people. Psychiatry of later life is therefore a key area for development and over €7 million of additional revenue funding has been committed since 1999 to enable a start to be made on the establishment of specialist services in health boards where no such service had heretofore existed. I am committed to the continued development of this specialist service in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">In relation to mental health services for children and adolescents, I acknowledge that services for this group still require substantial development. However, we have already come a long way. In 1997, there were few child and adolescent psychiatry services available outside the major cities. Now each health board has a minimum of two consultant-led, multi-disciplinary teams.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">A working group was established by my Department in June 2000 to review child and adolescent psychiatry provision and to finalise a plan for the further development of this service. The group published its first report in March 2001. It emphasised that the treatment of ADHD and AHKD is an integral component of the provision of a comprehensive child and adolescent psychiatric service. It recommended the enhancement and expansion of the overall child and adolescent psychiatric service throughout the country as the most effective means of providing the required services for this group. It also recommended that priority should be given, in the first instance, to the recruitment of the required expertise for the completion of existing consultant-led multi-disciplinary teams. The report also called for closer liaison and interaction with the education system and other areas of the community health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">In its first report, the working group also examined the issue of in-patient psychiatric services. It recommended that a total of seven child and adolescent inpatient psychiatric units for children ranging from six to 16 years should be developed throughout the country. It envisaged that the focus of these centres would be the assessment and treatment of psychiatric, emotional or family disorders, including major adjustment disorders, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, eating disorders and schizophrenia. At present, four of these child and adolescent psychiatric in-patient units are at the planning stage and project teams have been appointed to oversee their development. These units will be built in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">In addition to the above, the working group has also considered the provision of psychiatric services for 16 to 18 year olds and its report on this important issue was formally presented to me earlier today by the group's chairperson, Dr. Paul McCarthy. I welcome the findings of this latest report. It recommends that priority should be given to the recruitment in each health board area of a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist with a special interest in the psychiatric  disorders of later adolescence. This consultant should have the support of a full multi-disciplinary team. The report also emphasises the need for closer co-operation and liaison between the child and adolescent psychiatric services and the generic adult mental health services. As I said, I welcome this latest report which will serve now as a basis for policy making and planning in this area. I would like to place on record my appreciation of the work of Dr. McCarthy and the other members of the working group.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">The working group on child and adolescent psychiatry is now examining the needs of persons suffering from eating disorders and how appropriate services can be developed in the short, medium and long term. The working group has invited submissions from interested parties on how the needs of persons suffering from an eating disorder can best be met and will be preparing its report on the matter over the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">Over the past few years my Department has given special attention to the resourcing of suicide prevention initiatives. As we are all aware, suicide has become a serious social problem that is not confined to Ireland but is a growing global problem. Suicide is now the most common cause of death among 15 to 24 years olds in Ireland, exceeding deaths due to cancer or road traffic accidents. Apart from the increase in the overall rate of suicide, a disturbing feature is the significant rise in the male suicide rate. The most recently published figure from the Central Statistics Office indicates that there were 451 deaths from suicide in 2002. The figure highlights the need to intensify our efforts and to put extra resources in place for suicide research and prevention programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">Since the publication of the report of the National Task Force on Suicide in 1998, there has been a positive and committed response among both the statutory and voluntary sectors towards finding ways to tackle this tragic problem. A suicide research group has been established by the chief executive officers of the health boards. Resource officers have been appointed in all health boards with specific responsibility for implementing the task force's recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">The task force recommended that steps be taken to make the mental health services more accessible to the public, particularly to young people. Concern was also expressed at the risk of suicide in older people. Additional funding has been made available to further develop consultant-led child and adolescent psychiatry and old age psychiatry services to assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and provide the necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk. Many of the task force's recommendations require continual development, particularly in the area of training and in the development of services relating to suicide and suicide prevention.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">Additional revenue funding of €0.655 million has been provided this year for suicide prevention programmes. Therefore, since the publication of the report of the National Task Force on Suicide  in 1998, a cumulative total of more than €13 million has been provided towards suicide prevention programmes and for research. This includes funding to support the work of the National Suicide Review Group, the Irish Association of Suicidology and the National Suicide Research Foundation for its work in the development of a national para-suicide register. This Government is fully committed to ensuring that further investment takes place in this area, building on the achievements to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">The development of advocacy services is a very recent occurrence, but it is another example of the significant improvements taking place in the provision of mental health services. An advocate can be someone who represents and defends the views, needs, wishes, worries and rights of individuals who do not feel able to cope on their own. Advocacy can help service users to participate in and make decisions about their care and treatment. It can be a mechanism for changing attitudes of the public and media towards mental illness and those experiencing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">The importance of advocacy is far-reaching. Not only does it allow the patient to express his or her concerns but it may also foster recovery by assisting patients to take control of their lives. The power of self-help is a critical factor in any healing process. A sense of being able to share and discuss one's fears and emotions within an understanding environment is invaluable and of tremendous solace at a time of crisis. That is at the core of the advocacy process.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">Patient advocacy in the mental health services is still in its infancy. However, some groups have been providing informal advocacy services to patients and families of the mentally ill for some time. In recent years, a national patient's advocacy network has been established, with funding from the Department of Health and Children and various health boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">The Government has made clear its support of the development of advocacy services by assisting initiatives to provide independent advocacy services. I made available €251,000 in 2002 and an additional €100,000 in 2003 for the development of mental health advocacy services nationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">Substantial progress has been made in recent years in ensuring that those in need of mental health services receive care and treatment in the most appropriate setting. However, I accept that much remains to be done. The Government is committed to the provision of quality care in the area of mental health, to upholding the civil and human rights of those who suffer from mental illness and to encouraging measures aimed at combating the stigma that is often associated with such illness. Advances in the management and treatment of mental illness now allow many sufferers to live within their own communities, carry on with their lives and continue to contribute to society in a positive and fruitful way.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">During my term of office as Minister of State with special responsibility for mental health, I will  be endeavouring to secure additional funding for the mental health sector. I will also be overseeing the development of the new national policy framework for mental health. This will devise a sound policy base for the further enhancement and modernisation of our mental health services over the next decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">The initiatives which I have outlined will reassure this House that mental health services are not being neglected by the Government and that the service shortcomings identified by recent reports are being addressed.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_460">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_785">I thank my colleague, Deputy Tim O'Malley, for sharing his time and also the Deputies who have contributed to this debate. It is fair to say that there is broad agreement on the need for further improvement in our mental health services. Most people would have to agree that people with a mental illness are among the most vulnerable in society. Our health and personal social services, including the mental health services, are first and foremost about people – the patients and their families who receive the services and the staff who provide them.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">We live in a society that is patient-oriented. All State services, including the mental health services, must be responsive to this trend. The consumer in the psychiatric service is the patient and his or her family and friends. Just as the power of the consumer has made itself felt throughout the market economy, it is now being felt in the mental health services. The growing advocacy user movement in mental health, which was launched in County Monaghan, is yet another strand to this development, and one which I initiated and welcomed. We now have advocates in every health board area, which is an unprecedented development. It represents a significant achievement particularly for users of the services who have managed to put in place the network which advises decision makers and authorities to influence the development of policy and facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">I am determined to continue developing a comprehensive, community-based mental health service. Along with the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, I fully recognise that much needs to be done to bring about the necessary improvements and developments. This will involve both investment and reform. I refer not only to reform of structures, but also of the way in which we do things. Having looked at different models in different health boards, I realise that some units and teams have managed to develop models of community care within existing envelopes of income because they did things differently. They had a more team-based approach as opposed to the hierarchical approach evident in some of the more traditional models of delivery. They were not afraid to delegate to other team members or to move to the community setting.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">The move to the community setting is obviously influenced by investment issues. There  has been a significant move away from the old institutional buildings of the earlier part of the last century. Since the development of the policy document in 1984, there has been a movement towards the development of acute units in general hospitals and a significant decline in the numbers in the institutions or in-patient care. Some of the obstacles and barriers did not just relate to investment; certain practices and work approaches retarded the rate of progress in some areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">As my colleague, Deputy O'Malley, has already informed the House, approximately €190 million is being provided over the lifetime of the national development plan for mental health services. A significant part of this funding has gone towards the development of acute psychiatric units linked to general hospitals as a replacement of services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals. St. Michael's unit in Mercy Hospital, Cork, and the new unit in Ennis, which is a model of its kind, serve as examples. People talk about the stigma associated with mental health. On visits to Ennis I recall meeting some ten different committees about the major general hospital, but one rarely meets a committee in connection with an acute psychiatric hospital. I was delighted to be able to open the unit in Ennis, which represents a great addition in terms of services. The unit in St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny is similar and there are more on the way. They must be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">In addition to the 19 acute units already in place, there are more at various stages of development. The funding will also provide for more community facilities such as mental health centres and community residences, which will accelerate the phasing out of the old psychiatric institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">Reference has already been made to the need for a comprehensive review of the mental health services. This was highlighted in the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You. The strategy acknowledged that there is now a need to update mental health policy to take account of recent legislative reform, developments in the care and treatment of mental illness and current best practice. That has followed the consultation process which led to the strategy. People who criticise us for having another review should note that those who use the services and all the representative organisations, through the national consultative forum, pushed for inclusion in the strategy a commitment that we would review, modernise and make more comprehensive the 1984 document. As Deputy O'Malley said, it is intended that a review group will be established shortly to undertake this work.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">The enactment of the Mental Health Act 2001 in July 2001 was very significant and I was happy to steer its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Act represented the first significant reform of mental health legislation in this country for more than 50 years. The Mental Health Commission, which I established in April  2002, is now the main vehicle for the implementation of the provisions of the Act. Its establishment is an important milestone in the development of our thinking on mental illness. Its ongoing work will lay the foundations for achieving a sustained improvement in the quality of care provided in our mental health services. The primary objective of the Act is to address the civil and human rights of the mentally ill.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">The purpose of the Act is twofold. First, it provides a modern framework within which people who are mentally disordered and who need treatment or protection, either in their own interest of in the interest of others, can be cared for and treated. In this regard, the Act brings Irish legislation concerning the detention of mentally disordered patients into conformity with the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">The second purpose of the Act is to put in place mechanisms by which the standards of care and treatment in our mental health services can be monitored, inspected and regulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">The detailed work of the Mental Health Commission is a matter for the commission to determine, in accordance with its statutory functions under the Mental Health Act. However, the commission has indicated that one of its priorities over the next few years is to put in place the structures required for the operation of the mental health tribunals. These will operate under the aegis of the commission and will conduct a review of each decision by a consultant psychiatrist to detain a patient on an involuntary basis or to extend the duration of such detention. Recruitment is currently under way for an Inspector of Mental Health Services as provided for by the Act which will help to put in place a system of annual inspections and reports under the auspices of the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">My Department also recognises the critical role played by the voluntary sector and emphasises the importance of health boards continuing to support and work closely with voluntary groups. The recently published Amnesty International report acknowledges the funding which is being made available by my Department to support groups and organisations, such as Schizophrenia Ireland, Mental Health Ireland, GROW and Aware, to heighten awareness and develop support services for service users and carers. We have increased funding significantly over the last number of years above and beyond what these groups were used to receiving. This is important because they are powerful moulders and shapers of change of attitude in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">I had the opportunity to visit the Central Mental Hospital, the oldest forensic secure hospital in Europe early this year. We have set up a project team to work on a new development there. The estimates of the cost range from €35 million and we are looking at various mechanisms in terms of how it can be financed. We accept that the physical conditions are not satisfactory.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">In regard to service agreements, a committee was established to draw up a service level agreement on the admission of mentally-ill prisoners to the Central Mental Hospital. This acknowledges and addresses the issue of delays in the transfer of mentally-ill prisoners to the hospital.</p>

          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_799">I propose to share my time with Deputy Moynihan-Cronin. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this interesting debate. When I volunteered to speak I did not expect a full press gallery as this is not an issue that attracts attention. Other issues in the health portfolio would ensure a full Gallery, a full press gallery and much more focus. However, there are few issues that are as important as this or that will impact on as many of our citizens and families. I congratulate Fine Gael, in particular Deputy Neville, for his personal interest in this issue which has been neglected in the health portfolio for a long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">There has been much focus during the last number of months on health issues which, as the Minister knows, are seldom out of the news. Mental health seldom gets the spotlight or interest, a fact acknowledged by both the Minister and the Minister of State. Some would say that mental health is the Cinderella of the service. I know, from my own time in Hawkins House, that the Minister and Minister of State will have heard that point made by umpteen groups and deputations. Society needs to take cognisance of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">The Fine Gael motion makes reference to a number of recent reports which I have had the opportunity to look through. The only conclusion one can come to on reading those reports is that we are all shamed by the status of mental health services in this first world, developed, wealthy country. I say this as a former office holder in the Department of Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">Deputy Tim O'Malley is a new Minister of State, only 12 months in this House. In honesty I must say to him that it is disappointing that the response to this well thought out important motion is standard. I know he did not draft it. These responses are brought up on the system and are brought to Cabinet and rubber stamped on the day. However, it would have been refreshing if he had come in and said that he agreed that a lot needs to be done and that there is merit in the motion. He could have said he did not know if he would get the resources to improve things but he would do his damnedest to do so. If he had said that and tabled that sort of a motion I believe—</p>

          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_804">The amendment the Minister of State proposed commends the Government and everything that happened since 1997 as if nothing good happened before then. There is merit in this House having a little more faith in the nature of debate in the Chamber and in the debate of real issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">Ireland must face this issue. As a developed and increasingly stressful society, for all generations, we cannot escape the fact that one person in four will experience mental illness at some point in their lives. That is a difficult matter with which each of us must deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">The Minister of State made reference in his speech to the World Health Organisation 2001 report. That comprehensive and worthy report, Mental Health – New Understandings New Hope, was devoted to mental health issues and was acknowledged internationally. It comprehensively identified the status of mental health services in the world and what needed to be done. It is important that we use the ten key recommendations made by the WHO as a yardstick to judge our performance to date. I know the Minister of State made reference to two of the ten points.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The first recommendation was to provide treatment in primary care. Have we done that? We have begun but have not developed a structured comprehensive way to do it. There is resistance to it and while good in parts it is patchy and non-existent in many places. The second recommendation was to increase the availability of psychotropic medication. I do not know whether this has happened but perhaps the Minister of State will inform us of what progress has been made on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">The report recommends that mental health care be provided in the community where possible. We have made good progress in this area. The bringing of patients into the community did not start in 1997, year zero according to the amendment. I remember receiving a reasoned and understandable letter during my own time as Minister for Health from a woman who occasionally went into deep depression. She was concerned that psychiatric hospitals would all be closed. She wrote and said, "I need a place to go and be mad."  She did not want the resource of a community house in the middle of a housing estate. I think what she said was a sane thing to say. We should not have a "one size fits all" policy. We need a variety of responses. There is often an awful response to the siting of community housing. We must get our planning right and ensure that communities understand the need for integration in a structured way. It should not be left to one division of health care providers to establish.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">Let us look quickly at the other recommendations. We should educate members of the public. We have certainly not done much in that regard. We have not even resourced voluntary groups to do so. We should involve communities, service users and families in the delivery of care. How well have we done this? We must establish national policies, programmes and legislation in regard to mental health. We have made some progress in regard to new, long-promised, legislation recently but have yet to resource or fully implement it.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">We must develop appropriate human resources of which there is not a sufficient supply in place. We must also develop links with other sectors. The mental health service is compartmentalised and not yet fully integrated. The idea of having acute psychiatric wards and reception areas in every acute hospital has been very slow to happen – some ten to 15 years – and, to date, there are very few acute psychiatric wards attached to hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">These issues need to be prioritised and we need consensus to achieve that. Mental health in the community should be monitored and research supported. These are the guideline issues which we need to tackle. We need to measure ourselves in regard to those issues and debate them in the House. My judgment is that on all of these issues, Ireland has a long way to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">While we can claim to have improved public attitudes somewhat from the days of shame and hiding referred to by Deputy Neville, we are now faced with new challenges and grave issues. There has been much debate in recent months about out of control adolescents, binge drinking, drug taking and, most worrying of all, increased levels of suicide, an issue touched upon by every speaker so far in this debate. It is quite shocking and we should be stunned when the Minister of State tells the House that suicide is now the most common cause of death among 15 to 24 years olds in this country, exceeding cancer deaths and road traffic accidents. Deputy Neville is right to say that if a terrible virus was killing over 450 young people every year, we would spend millions dealing with it to ensure that our youth and our future was preserved.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">In a shocking report published in March, the Irish Psychiatric Association found that there was an almost complete lack of adolescent psychiatric services in the State, which is hampering efforts to curb rates of suicide and drug and alcohol abuse. While this may be an over-argued case, it is a shocking statement. The report found that 88% of psychiatric service providers had no access to adolescent psychiatrists, which is an entirely neglected area. The report is there to be read and acted upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">This is clearly an area of increasing stress. The trauma of meeting families of children who have committed suicide, which we have all experienced, is beyond measure and almost beyond understanding. Suicide leaves a deep wound, and a yawning gap filled with a lack of understanding, hurt and despair. We must do what we can to address it. It must be one of the most awful events for any family to deal with, yet it is now being dealt with by an enormous number – some 451 families last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">With regard to recent initiatives, the Mental Health Act 2001 established the Mental Health Commission to foster and promote high standards and good practice in the delivery of mental health services. It is unfortunate timing that the legislation for which we have waited so long is coming on stream at a time when resources are  being rolled back. The commission, established in April of last year, has still to appoint its inspector of mental health services – the key provision. The Minister of State has informed us tonight that it will happen next year, which is another delay.</p>

          <p eId="para_822">There are great deficiencies in regard to services. I was contacted today with regard to St. Ita's, Portrane where there are 230 residents but where there has not been a GP service for some time. Why is that? The Minister should do something about it. Another problem arises in regard to the continuing inappropriate placement of mentally handicapped children in psychiatric hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">A final point which I do not have time to develop but to which I wish to make reference is the scandal of having so many people with psychiatric problems in prisons. A UK study which I have recently considered showed that 50% of remanded males in Britain and 30% of sentenced males had a diagnosable mental disorder. From the figures given by Deputy Neville, I do not think the Irish figures would be dissimilar. We cannot continue using our prisons as dumping grounds for those with mental disorders. This is a critical issue and a critical debate, and it merits a serious response from all in this House.</p>

        <speech by="#BreedaMoynihanCronin" eId="spk_470">
          <from>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</from>
          <p eId="para_824">I welcome the opportunity to speak tonight although it is unfortunate that I have such a short time to cover a wide range of issues. There was a protest outside Leinster House today by families of children and other people with disabilities, both physical and sensory. I spoke to an elderly mother of one child with a disability. The child has finished mainstream education and will have no place in September. The mother's worry is that if she dies, the only place available for her child will be in a psychiatric hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">My father began working as a psychiatric nurse in Killarney in the 1940s. The psychiatric hospital where he worked was a place near which nobody went because it was a dark dungeon. However, he led the way 40 years ago in trying to take away the stigma from the psychiatric hospitals. He also, without great funding being required, encouraged employers to employ those with a disability. A commercial operation was set up in Killarney, which is still going today, where a majority of the employees had a disability. There was no Celtic tiger at the time but that was done.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">We have moved a long way from the big psychiatric hospitals to services in the community. However, the Minister of State should not let the community houses become dark dungeons again and should spend some money on them. I visit such community houses because I know many of those working there and many patients. The houses are very dour and dark. A can of paint or a little new furniture would make a huge difference, although I only know of the houses in my own town of Killarney. Funding has been promised for a number of years to provide for brightening them up. This is deserved and would not cost much.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">The Minister's speech addressed the issue of facilities for those with eating disorders, from which a huge number of young people are suffering. I am aware of a case where a person from County Kerry is travelling to Dublin twice a week because the required facility is not available at home. They have approached the health board on many occasions for a small sum of money to assist them with travelling expenses but the door has been closed on them. The parents of this girl will beg, borrow or steal to get the money to bring her to Dublin to be cured. If a facility is not available in the Southern Health Board area, patients who must travel elsewhere should be supported. It is not their fault that the facility is not available in their area. I urge the Minister to consider this.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">Deputies Howlin and Neville spoke about suicide. I commend Deputy Neville for not letting this issue slide. I also commend him on his work in this area. All Members are aware of people who have suffered this tragedy in their families. However, often in these cases the problem starts small and then escalates. When a person needs treatment for an eating disorder and the facility is not available in his or her health board area, the Minister must ensure such people are given financial support to help them to travel to the facilities that are available in other areas.</p>

        <speech by="#BreedaMoynihanCronin" eId="spk_471">
          <from>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</from>
          <p eId="para_829">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. It concerns the number of teachers in Scoil  Ceann Trá in Ventry, County Kerry, and the shocking and sudden way in which the fourth teacher at the school was withdrawn for the forthcoming year. I am anxious that the Minister answer a number of important questions. I hope he does not have a prepared speech because he does not know the questions I will ask.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">Scoil Ceann Trá in Ventry is a Gaeltacht school which caters for children from multicultural backgrounds in multistream classes where teaching is through the medium of Irish. The teachers in the school are a particularly dedicated and hard-working group of people. However, they as well as the pupils and their parents have been treated appallingly by the Department of Education and Science in recent months. I will outline the timetable of events in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">In 2000, the board of management at the three-teacher school in Ceann Trá was advised by the Department's inspector to apply for a fourth teacher because of the chronic overcrowding at the school. In 2001, the fourth teacher was sanctioned on a temporary basis by the Department on condition that 73 pupils be enrolled in September 2002. Enrolment in September 2002 was 80 and it has remained above that number since. The enrolment for this September is 83.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">Last March, the board of management at Scoil Ceann Trá was informed that the fourth teaching post would be suppressed from 31 August 2003. That was a shock for the parents and teachers. I cannot explain the decision and I am hoping the Minister can. Given the number of students in Ceann Trá and the fact that it will increase, why is the Department reducing the number of teachers? This has not been adequately explained and I call on the Minister to justify this disgraceful decision. As one of the parents pointed out to me a few days ago, the teacher was appointed when there were 73 pupils but she is being removed when there are 83.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">Appeals to the Department of Education and Science were turned down. Frustration was so great that parents were recently forced to withdraw their children from the school for a day of protest. However, they still await answers from the Minister. They will travel to Dublin tomorrow in the hope that they can meet the Minister and put forward their case. They firmly believe their case did not get a hearing. If it had, they would have retained the fourth teacher.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">Does the Minister agree that the retention figure for pupils in gaelscoileanna is 76? If this school were located 12 miles down the road and outside the Gaeltacht area, this appointment would not be an issue. The other outlandish story told to the board of management was that it would first have to solve the school accommodation problem and that it should apply to the Department for better accommodation. The issue of the fourth teacher would then be addressed. I have never encountered such ludicrous excuses. How long will it take to complete building work in the school? Does this mean the pupils might  be waiting years to sort out the teaching appointment, given that it will take that long to address the accommodation situation?</p>
          <p eId="para_835">There is no problem with the accommodation in the school. It could do with another room but it is not vital. The school has four classrooms and the teachers are willing to deal with the situation. I am seeking a full and frank explanation from the Minister for this fiasco and the shoddy way in which the matter was handled by the Department. I also urge the Minister for Education and Science to meet immediately with the board of management, the parents and the teachers to sort out this sorry mess.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_836">I am glad to have the opportunity to outline the Department of Education and Science's position regarding this issue. The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. The number of mainstream posts is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is finalised for a particular school year following discussions with the education partners. The staffing schedule is set out in a circular which issues from the Department of Education and Science to all primary school boards of management. Accordingly, all boards are aware of the staffing position for their school in any school year. The staffing schedule for the coming school year, 2003-04, is outlined in the Department's circular 9/03, which issued to all primary schools in February 2003 and is also available on the Department's website.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">The allocation of additional teaching posts in recent years for children with special needs and improvements in the staffing schedule together with a decline in enrolments has helped to ensure that the overall pupil teacher ratio in primary schools has improved substantially.</p>

          <p eId="para_839">This includes a decrease in the overall maximum class size in primary schools by reference to the staffing schedule from 35 in the 1995-96 school year to 29 in the 2002-03 school year. In the 2001-02 school year, the school mentioned by the Deputy was allocated an additional permanent teaching post on the basis of 73 pupils on roll as a result of an administrative error in the Department. However, as the post had already been sanctioned the school was allowed retain it for the 2001-02 school year.</p>

          <p eId="para_847">Consequently, the sanction of teaching posts on space grounds was withdrawn.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">The school is seeking the appointment of the third mainstream class teacher on the basis that it expects to have an enrolment of 83 in September 2003. If this enrolment is achieved and if there is no change to the staffing schedule, the school will be entitled to the additional post in September 2004. It is not open to the Department to sanction an additional post in advance of the next school year and based on an estimated level of need.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">The school submitted an appeal to the staffing appeals board for the allocation of an additional teacher under the criterion of exceptional accommodation difficulties. The appeals board considered the application on 9 April 2003 and the appeal was rejected. The school authorities were notified of this decision on 10 April 2003. The independent appeals board on mainstream staffing allocations was established in August 2002 and commenced operation at the beginning of the 2002-03 school year. The purpose of the board is to allow for the independent consideration of appeals, under certain criteria, against the mainstream staffing schedule as issued to schools. The appeals board allows for equitable and transparent treatment of all primary schools and its decision is final. It is not open to the Minister for Education and Science or his Department to interfere in this process. I hope my response is helpful.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_485">
          <from>Mr. B. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_852">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important issue and I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children is here to respond to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">People in the catchment area of Cavan General Hospital are particularly alarmed and concerned that surgical services are under threat. In early May, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland notified the North-Eastern Health Board that it was withdrawing recognition of five surgical trainee posts from 30 June. The reason given was that interpersonal problems at the level of consultant surgeon in the unit were creating an environment that was not conducive to training. According to local media reports, a special committee, set up by the RCSI, told the health board these concerns related to both interpersonal and clinical issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">With 1 July approaching, the threat to the future of the surgery department of Cavan General Hospital looms larger. The decision by the RCSI to cease recognition of the five training posts in the department of surgery on the last day of June leaves the future provision of full surgical services hanging in the balance. I also note from local media comment, that the director of surgical affairs at the RCSI confirmed that it was possible for the problems to be resolved in time for accreditation to be reinstated in the hospital by 1 July. Hopefully, the necessary resolution can be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">Along with other Members, such as Deputy Connolly, I have been pursuing this matter with the health board. The health board recently informed me that the RCSI has suspended the hospital's ability to recruit non-consultant hospital doctors who require basic surgical training. In its correspondence, the health board also outlined that it is attempting to recruit non-consultant junior doctors who do not require basic surgical training, in order to alleviate this problem and ensure that surgical services at Cavan General Hospital will continue to be delivered at their current level.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">The message I wish to impart to the Minister of State, his Department and the House, is that these difficulties must be resolved without further delay. If the health board has not made the necessary progress by now, I suggest that Department officials, along with senior health board management, officials of the RCSI and the relevant personnel from the department of surgery at the hospital, sit down and resolve the issues which are causing difficulty in order to ensure that the relevant accreditation is restored and to ensure the continuation of full surgical services at the hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">Throughout Cavan, and the wider constituency, I have met numerous people who express satisfaction at the work carried out by the personnel  in the surgery department of the hospital over many years. In every parish, I have heard the utmost praise for the personnel. Outside Leinster House this afternoon, a gentleman, whom I did not know, told me that had it not been for the department and its personnel, he would not be alive. I was glad to hear that comment and it is one I have heard throughout the catchment area of Cavan General Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">I cannot over-emphasise the importance of that department and the high esteem in which its personnel, working in all disciplines, are held by the community of Cavan, Monaghan, north Longford, south Leitrim and north Meath. This issue must be resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">Every Member of the House, including the Minister of State, receives daily queries about the health service. Generally, it is about inadequate funding or delays. However, this is not a question of funding. It is a question of people sitting down and giving leadership to resolve some outstanding issues. There is no reason for this issue to be protracted and delayed. The only people who will suffer are those who need surgery. The personnel in the hospital want to have these issues resolved. We want that fine modern hospital working to full capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">I could not better sum up the high esteem in which the hospital is held by the community than by quoting from the leading article of a recent issue of <i>The Anglo Celt</i> which reads:</p>
          <p eId="para_861">The surgical department of Cavan General Hospital has given an outstanding service, both in professional excellence and patient care, to the people of this region. It is a service very greatly appreciated and it is one the region cannot do without.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">I am particularly grateful and delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, is here because, only last week, he provided €1.1 million in additional funding to ensure that the nursing unit in Virginia can open by mid October. I thank him.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#IvorCallely" eId="spk_486">
          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_863">I welcome the opportunity to clarify the position regarding the issues raised by the Deputy. I appreciate his interest in the enhancement and development of health services in the Cavan-Monaghan region and, in particular, the unit to which he referred about which he asked me to intervene and invited me to visit. I am pleased that we have made progress together. I congratulate Deputy Brendan Smith on his endeavours and his interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">Responsibility for the provision of services at Cavan General Hospital rests with the North-Eastern Health Board. The Department is advised by the North-Eastern Health Board that it has been informed by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, that the RCSI council, on the advice of its basic surgical training committee, is to cease recognition of five posts in the department of surgery of Cavan General Hospital for  basic surgical training with effect from 30 June 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">It was brought to the attention of the BST committee of the RCSI, through hospital inspector's reports and through the regular counselling sessions for all trainees on the BST scheme, that interpersonal problems at the level of consultant surgeon in the unit were creating an environment that is not conducive to training. The health board further advises that a group was set up by the BST committee to interview the Cavan trainees. The interviews highlighted a number of serious concerns which are interfering with the work.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">The chief executive officer of the North-Eastern Health Board is currently examining and considering a number of concerns relating to the unit which have been brought separately to his attention by the consultant surgeons. The chief executive officer sought the advice and guidance of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland regarding clinical issues raised. The response of the RCSI is currently being considered by the chief executive officer. The Deputy will be pleased to learn that it is anticipated that the chief executive officer will seek an early re-inspection by the college with a view to restoring recognition of the basic surgical training posts. I concur with some of the views expressed by the Deputy regarding the need and benefit accruing from this facility in Cavan.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">The North-Eastern Health Board advertised for fully-registered candidates for the five posts in the department of surgery at Cavan General Hospital. Interviews have now taken place and I am pleased to report that a sufficient number of fully registered candidates were selected to fill the available posts. The health board hopes – as do I – that all posts will be filled and that services will continue as heretofore. I hope the Deputy finds that reply helpful.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_487">
          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_868">The reason I have had to raise this important matter on the Adjournment is that, despite raising it with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda, regrettably, nothing has been done about this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">Residents in the area have had much experience with local pollution. As a Ringsend resident myself, I know what we had to deal with when Bioburn was operating there. There was a medical incinerator which released huge puffs of thick black smoke over the area, which we subsequently discovered to have a very high dioxin content. Now that this is gone, we are now faced with people burning the plastic or PVC off copper wire. I regret that my constituency colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform cannot be here this evening. It seems to be a trend that the relevant Minister no longer comes in to reply to an Adjournment debate and it is a lapse in the way we do our business in the House. That is no reflection on the Minister of State,  Deputy Callely, but I wish the Minister could be here because he promised a lot in dealing with law and order and in regard to the incinerator in my area. He stated that if he were elected to Government, he would do all in his power to stop this but I do not see that happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">Last week when we were discussing incineration the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government told us that there were more dioxins caused by domestic and other fires than by incinerators. I said that there were still many dioxins in the ash from the incinerators and we should be concerned about that but, notwithstanding, if he is really concerned about the dioxins caused by these sorts of fires, particularly the burning of PVC, he and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should do something about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">When I put my questions to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 9 April and 7 May, I asked him what legislation needed to be enforced in this case. I was told that people could be prosecuted under the Litter Pollution Act 1997, the Waste Management Act 1996 and the Air Pollution Act 1987, yet nothing has been done. Recently I raised the issue of the use of a Garda car to take a rugby player from Kiely's pub to the airport, a misuse of Garda resources. When people in the city, however, call the gardaí about serious issues, they sometimes cannot get a Garda car to respond. In this case, people have telephoned the gardaí on numerous occasions and I have been in touch with them myself but nothing has been done. That is regrettable. If this sort of activity were taking place closer to the Ranelagh home of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, something would be done. This is a working class community in Ringsend and for that reason it is often neglected which represents an unacceptable political apartheid.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">It has been suggested that some of the groups carrying out this activity are from the Travelling Community. I do not want to discriminate against that community – we could act constructively by asking what business activity is being carried out because it is not necessary to burn PVC off copper wire, there is equipment which can be used to do it. If this is the case, it should be investigated and we could come to a positive resolution allowing people to carry on their traditional business while protecting local residents from serious pollution.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">This is not an exaggeration, I have seen the thick, black smoke and if it is the result of the burning of PVC, it contains toxic substances. It is for that reason that I am asking the Minister to act.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#IvorCallely" eId="spk_488">
          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_874">I am standing in for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who would have attended except he had a long standing diary commitment prior to this issue being raised on the Adjournment.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that a number of families are currently  camped at Hanover Quay. From time to time, these families have been known to light small fires for the purpose of burning plastic covering from copper wire or to dispose of domestic waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">The relevant legislation falls within the remit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Air Pollution Act 1987 and Licensing of Industrial Plant Regulations 1988 prohibit the burning of such waste without a licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">The licensing of such industrial plant and the enforcement of regulations made under the Act are matters for the relevant local authority. Also, under the Air Pollution Act 1987, the occupier of any premises, other than a private dwelling, is required to use the best practicable means to limit, and, if possible, to prevent an emission from such premises. Emission is defined to include a smoke emission. In addition, the occupier of any premises is prohibited from causing or permitting emissions in such a quantity or manner as to be a nuisance. The Act empowers a local authority to serve a notice on the occupier of any premises from where there is an emission specifying the measures necessary to prevent or limit air pollution.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">The Waste Management Act 1996 places a general duty on the holder of waste not to hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. Local authorities have specific powers under the Act to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused by the holding or disposal of waste, and mitigate or remedy the effects on the environment of any such activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">The local authorities and the gardaí enforce the relevant Acts within their respective remits. With regard to the local authority, section 13 of the Air Pollution Act 1987 provides that an offence under the Act may be prosecuted summarily by the local authority in whose functional area the offence is committed. With regard to a notice served by the local authority to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit pollution, section 26 of that Act provides that if a person on whom such a notice has been served does not, within the period specified in the notice, comply with the requirements of the notice, the local authority may take such steps as it considers reasonable and necessary to secure compliance with the notice and may recover any expense incurred from the person.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">Section 11 of the Waste Management Act 1996 provides that summary proceedings for an offence under that Act may be brought be a local authority or the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">With regard to the Garda Síochána, the Minister understands that a number of complaints have been received regarding the activity referred to in the motion, but, regrettably, Garda investigations have so far failed to gather sufficient evidence to support a prosecution against any individual. Any resources required to attend to any  matter brought to the attention of the gardaí are being made available.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">As the Deputy will appreciate, the Minister has no function in the investigation and prosecution of offences by the Garda Síochána, and he is therefore not in a position to ensure, as the Deputy requests, that any particular individuals are arrested or prosecuted. The Minister has been assured, however, that the gardaí are continuing to monitor the situation and any further action required will be taken in consultation with the other agencies with responsibilities in this area including, in particular, Dublin City Council.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardAllen" eId="spk_489">
          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_883">I understand that the Minister of State has expressed his regret that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not here but when dealing with such a serious issue, I expected the Minister to listen to what we have to say when we ask for a ministerial inquiry into this incident. I acknowledge the presence of Deputies Lynch, O'Flynn and Dan Wallace, a demonstration of the importance attached to this serious incident. I wish to share a minute of my time with Deputy Lynch.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">On 27 February 2002, I raised on the Adjournment the matter of a tragic incident that occurred on 26 March 2001. Two parents were woken from their sleep and by two gardaí and told they would have travel to the South Infirmary Hospital in Cork because their son, Adrian, had been involved in an accident. Unfortunately, before they left home to go the hospital, they received further information that their son had died as a result of an incident that had occurred inside and outside a night club in Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">The following day two detectives arrived at the Moynihan home and told the family that the gardaí had taken two videos of evidence from the club where the tragic incident had occurred and had taken the names of 200 people who were in the club. The gardaí said they would contact the family again as soon as they had more information.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">On Saturday, 31 May, the family read in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> that three men had been arrested by the gardaí in connection with the incident. Weeks went by and the family inquired as to how the case was progressing. They were told by a senior Garda source that the Garda was still taking statements and that the best thing for the family to do was to leave it to the Garda and not to talk about the case or refer to the three people who had been arrested as it might jeopardise the case. The family agreed to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">Months passed and the family was telephoned to say the investigation was complete and that a file had been sent to the DPP along with 70 statements and two tapes of video evidence. The family had to wait until January 2002 when a garda arrived at the family home to tell Mrs. Moynihan,  mother of the deceased young man, that the decision of the DPP was that there would be no prosecution on the grounds of insufficient evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">An inquest was held on Adrian Moynihan's death and was adjourned when the coroner requested the gardaí to return the file to the DPP for further consideration. This was done but, unfortunately, the DPP returned the file with a decision not to prosecute. The inquest has since been reconvened and on 6 May 2003 returned a verdict of misadventure. If time permitted I would repeat the six questions I posed on 27 February 2002, but I want to allow Deputy Lynch to contribute. I would appreciate if the Minister would address those questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">This case is an example of what is happening in our cities and towns. A man is killed and the offence goes unsolved and those involved go unprosecuted. Why is a case such as this, a most serious case, shrouded in mystery and why is the family being kept in the dark? A "Prime Time" programme on RTE showed the incident where the young man was dragged alive from a Cork laneway into a nightclub and left that nightclub dead.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to speak with the Attorney General and to ask or direct him to get an explanation from the DPP as the Attorney General is empowered to do as to why there is no prosecution. The DPP may be independent but there should be accountability. I ask also that the Minister carry out a full inquiry into this tragic event. Andrew Moynihan, the father of the late Adrian Moynihan, is on hunger strike on Kildare Street outside the gates of Leinster House and has stated he will remain there until such time as a full inquiry takes place into the circumstances of his son's death and the reason no action has been taken.</p>

        <speech by="#KathleenLynch" eId="spk_490">
          <from>Ms Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_891">I thank Deputy Allen for sharing his time with me. To lose a child in whatever circumstance and no matter what age is the nightmare every parent dreads. The incident was recorded on video tape. The Garda stated there were at least 70 witnesses and yet there has been no explanation. Justice demands several things and we all look at it differently. Some look for revenge, others for their day in court but the Moynihans asked for none of this. They simply asked that the investigation into the death of their son would be conducted in a thorough and proper manner. They have no evidence as to whether the investigation was carried out properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">We are here as Deputies representing the Moynihans and others in the constituency who are equally concerned about the events surrounding Adrian's death, to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to approach the Attorney General and demand of the DPP the reason there is no prosecution. The Moynihans have stated that it does not have to be a charge of murder. No prosecution was preferred against anyone. They are entitled to an explanation  which must come from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>

          <p eId="para_894">In addition to Deputies Allen and Lynch, I am conscious of the fact that a number of the Cork-based Deputies have expressed concerns in regard to this case. Deputies O'Flynn, Dan Wallace, Kelleher and Dennehy have also done so.

          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_898">I thank Deputy Allen for raising this matter on the Adjournment and for giving me the opportunity to extend my sympathies and that of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and of the House to the family of Adrian Moynihan, a young man who so tragically lost his life. The circumstances of his death can only add to the grief of losing one so young. The House will appreciate that the Minister is constrained as to what can be said about this or any individual case.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that a full and comprehensive Garda investigation was carried out into all aspects of this tragic case. The completed Garda investigation file was forwarded through the State solicitor to the Director of Public Prosecutions on 2 July 2001 for decision as to what prosecution, if any, should be instituted. The DPP issued directions on 9 January 2002 that no prosecution should be instituted.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">The circumstances of Adrian Moynihan's death were subsequently the subject of an inquest which returned a verdict of death by misadventure. As the House will be aware, the purpose of an inquest is to establish the facts surrounding a death, place those facts on the public record and make findings on the identification of the deceased, the date and place of death and the cause of death. In accordance with the provisions of the Coroners Act 1962, a coroner is a statutory officer exercising judicial functions, in relation to which he or she is independent. It would not therefore be appropriate to comment further on the conduct of, or the verdict in, this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">The Minister would, however, like to clarify that there is no conflict between the coroner for Cork city and the Director of Public Prosecutions. He has been informed that during the inquest into the death of the late Adrian Moynihan, on the basis of evidence given at the inquest, the deputy State pathologist, Dr. Marie Cassidy, altered her own deposition in relation to the cause of Mr Moynihan's death. In light of this, and in accordance with the law, the coroner adjourned the inquest to allow the Garda to have the opportunity of consulting with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to the new evidence. The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that the file was resubmitted to the DPP on 16 September 2002 for further consideration. On 24 January 2003, following a full review of the file, the director confirmed that his original decision should stand. While I appreciate the points raised in this debate I will consult with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the morning on the circumstances of the case and the points raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">The prosecution of offences and the preparation and presentation of prosecution cases, are functions which are prescribed in law on the DPP. The director is independent in the discharge of his statutory duties.

          <p eId="para_903">The Minister noted with particular interest the coroner's comments concerning the training and regulation of door security staff. The need for a proper regulatory system for the security industry has been apparent for some considerable time, and this need is addressed in the Private Security Services Bill which has been referred to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. The Bill represents a balanced and progressive response to the needs of the private security industry and the concerns of the public who increasingly come into contact with it on a daily basis. The Bill provides for the establishment of a private security authority to control and supervise—</p>

This is a matter in respect of which we can make a difference by bringing that law into operation. The Deputy's matter refers to the ever increasing incidence of violence in urban areas. Last month, the Minister was pleased to announce that he had received the approval of the Government to draft a new Intoxicating Liquor Bill. The Bill will amend the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2000 to respond to certain recom mendations of the Commission on Liquor Licensing as well as to concerns outlined in the interim report of the strategic task force on alcohol. The proposed Bill will combat drunkenness and disorderly conduct by imposing stronger penalties for supplying intoxicating liquor to drunken persons in licensed premises. It will strengthen existing provisions relating to the maintenance of order and the prohibition on riotous behaviour and disorderly conduct on licensed premises. It is also proposed to prohibit certain promotional practices.</p>

          <p eId="para_927">In response to its pending accommodation difficulties the board of management of Donabate-Portrane Educate Together national school made a proposal to my Department, which would involve the lease or purchase of a site reserved for educational purposes, from Fingal County Council in order to house the school in temporary accommodation on the site.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">The school was granted provisional recognition in September 2002. The school authorities were advised at that time that the question of permanent recognition would be considered when the Department was satisfied that long-term viability had been demonstrated and that the school was operating in accordance with the rules for national schools. Until such time as permanent recognition is granted to the school, my Department will not consider purchasing a site to permanently accommodate the school. If and when permanent recognition is granted, budgetary factors will then determine the rate of progress on the acquisition of a site and on the delivery of permanent accommodation for the school.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">Officials of my Department have recently written to Fingal County Council to confirm that my Department has no objection, in principle, to the Council entering into negotiations with the authorities of Donabate ETNS in regard to leasing the site to the school for educational purposes.

      his plans in relation to the development of third level education.
      [15760/03]

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_933">As experience over recent decades has shown, the role of the higher education sector in Ireland's broad economic and social development is a central one. In line with other economies at a similar stage of development, the objective for the next phase of Ireland's economic development is based on building competitive advantage around skills and knowledge, by making the transition from an investment-driven economy to a knowledge and innovation economy. The fostering of an environment of top class research and development through significant investment in infrastructure and institutional research strategies under the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, and through mission-oriented research is of major importance for our future economic and social development. We have made dramatic strides in recent years in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">There are now more than 2,000 additional researchers working in the Irish third level sector as a result of the recent initiatives for research funding and over 80% of publicly funded research and development in Ireland takes place in the higher education sector. Our national research effort is an ongoing one and the strategic objectives that it underpins are critically important.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">The contribution of the higher education sector in meeting broad economic, social and cultural needs also goes beyond that. It has a key role in responding to rapidly evolving labour market needs in terms of the numbers, disciplinary mix and competencies of the graduates it produces. In terms of social development, higher education has a fundamental role in the achievement of progress in areas such as social inclusion, equality and justice.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_42">The sector faces a number of important challenges at this time. Demographic projections of a reducing school leaver cohort indicate future change in the profile of entrants to higher education in Ireland and will require the further development of activities aimed at reaching out to hitherto under-represented groups such as  mature students, part-timers, those from lower socio-economic backgrounds, students with disabilities and overseas students.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_43">The 2002 report of the taskforce on lifelong learning pointed up significant participation rate gaps for adult learners in full or part-time education between Ireland and the EU. The concept of lifelong learning is key in terms of supporting broad strategic objectives for a knowledge-based economy and in addressing issues of social exclusion. Of significant importance in this context is the development of a national framework of qualifications, led by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, to provide for access, mobility, progression, transfer and transparency of prior learning.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_44">In considering future provision of higher education, the need to balance the question of supporting and facilitating diversity within and between institutions and ensuring that collectively they meet national needs is of key importance. The Higher Education Authority, HEA, is currently looking at the development of a framework for addressing questions around disciplinary balance in Irish higher education and I am awaiting their report in this regard. As the Deputy will be aware, there are also plans for the transfer of administrative responsibility for the institute of technology sector to the Higher Education Authority and a number of important issues are under consideration in the context of that transfer.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_45">The recent strategic reports commissioned by the Dublin Institute of Technology, "Towards an Integrated System of Tertiary Education", and by the Council of Directors of the Institutes of Technology, "Institutes of Technology and the Knowledge Society – Their Future Position and Roles", are welcome contributions to the policy debate in this area. I am aware that the Conference of Heads of Irish Universities is also carrying out a similar analysis of future strategic direction for the university sector. It is my intention that the Irish higher education sector will be fully equipped to meet the many demanding challenges that it faces over the coming years and to play a lead role in Ireland's social and economic progress over that period. I look forward in this regard to engaging with all interested parties, both within and outside the education sector, to explore how we can best ensure that this happens.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_46">In this context, I have asked officials in my Department to engage the OECD to undertake a wide-ranging review of the higher education system in Ireland. Draft terms of reference for the study are under preparation and initial discussions have taken place with the OECD in this regard.</summary>

          <p eId="para_939">My Department's design team procedures have been devised to ensure that there is a consistent approach to the architectural planning of school buildings, with a view to ensuring quality school buildings, built at a cost that represents value for money. During the early stages of architectural planning of projects – stages 1 to 3 – the design and planning of the project is developed from the assessment of site suitability through to the detailed design. Stages 1, 2 and 3 are combined for many projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">The more advanced stages of architectural planning – stages 4 and 5 – involve the obtaining of planning permission and the preparation of pre-tender documents. Stages 4 and 5 are combined for the vast bulk of projects. Stages 6 to 9 relate to the procurement of tenders, the placing of contracts, the commencement of construction and post-contract cost control.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_47">The Deputy will appreciate that the rate of progress of a building project depends on factors such as the complexity and size of the project, the time required to undertake architectural planning, the period of time required for the granting of planning permission and obtaining a fire certificate, the availability of funding, the outcome of the tender competition and the procurement, where relevant, of bonds, insurance and tax clearance by prospective contractors. It is not the case, therefore, that projects can be allowed proceed to tender and construction without having completed certain basic architectural planning functions. Even if it were possible or prudent to dispense with these procedures, my Department would have to take into account the cost of design team fees and there would obviously be constraints in the number of projects that could pro ceed to tender and construction in the context of the funding available for the schools capital programme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_48">I am pleased to advise the Deputy that my Department is, however, exploring ways of reducing the time frame for processing projects through architectural planning and new standard plans are being devised, initially, for eight and 16 classroom schools. The main advantage is that my Department will be in a position to respond more quickly to building needs, having regard to the level of funding available. The process will also reduce the number of stages that a project must proceed through in architectural planning and it is expected that savings will be achieved on design fees.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_49">In addition, my Department is also endeavouring to reduce the level of temporary accommodation being provided and to include more small schools in the annual capital programme. In this regard, the devolved building initiatives that I initiated on a pilot basis in this year's school building programme demonstrate my commitment to find innovative and flexible solutions to the difficulties faced by schools seeking to refurbish their buildings or to provide additional accommodation quickly. These schemes fund schools to respond quickly to accommodation difficulties. There is minimal interaction with my Department and the school is fully empowered to drive the design and construction process. I fully expect that this initiative will inform future policy and that the scheme will be expanded to include more schools in future years.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_50">The approach outlined in relation to the rural primary school initiative and the devising of standardised plans are approaches that could be applied to school extensions. I am conscious from my previous experience in the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government that innovative building methods could reduce costs and provide top quality accommodation and I have asked the building unit in my Department to consider these methodologies in the context of school buildings.</summary>

          <p eId="para_949">The objective of achieving a 90% retention rate to completion of upper second-level or equivalent by 2006 is a key target of the Government's national anti-poverty strategy. The latest information, published in the NESF report of 2002 on early school leavers, indicated a retention level to completion of senior cycle of 82%, with 3% leaving school without any qualifications. My Department is currently preparing an up-to-date analysis of pupil retention rates and the results of this will be available shortly. My Department is also funding an annual school leavers survey which is being conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute in respect of leavers from 2000-01 and this will be  available in the coming months. I will arrange for the latest statistical information to be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">My Department's policy in relation to the retention of young people who are at risk of early school leaving is to support young people in school and to support schools to adapt to the needs of the young people experiencing difficulties. It also involves the development of a range of appropriate interventions in the community to support pupils, who are still of compulsory school-going age and are outside the formal school system, with a view to supporting their progression over time back to mainstream education.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">Provision by my Department for programmes specifically designed to tackle educational disadvantage up to and including upper second-level education amounts to approximately €145 million in the current year. All of these programmes contribute either directly or indirectly to combating the problem of early school leaving. The approximate expenditure in each year since 1999 on programmes with a specific focus on this area, including the school completion programme, the National Educational Welfare Board and youth encounter projects, is as follows:</p>

          <p eId="para_969">My Department does not compile literacy statistics for specific geographical areas and so the information requested by the Deputy is not available.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">I remain fully committed to meeting my Department's commitments under the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, in relation to child literacy. Along with key targets relating to adult literacy and early school leaving, the NAPS commits my Department to halving the proportion of pupils with serious literacy difficulties by 2006. Child literacy is also a key focus of the new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which includes a special initiative to tackle educational disadvantage.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_55">In order to ensure progress is made towards the NAPS target, my Department has undertaken the following steps: The first fully representative survey of reading literacy in disadvantaged schools will be conducted this year in order to establish much needed baseline data on current reading standards in such schools. This survey will be followed in 2004 by a national assessment of reading in first and fifth classes. The teacher guidelines that accompany the new English curriculum for primary schools recommend a range  of teaching methods designed to improve children's reading and writing abilities. The primary curriculum support service has been engaged in disseminating the content and methodologies recommended in these guidelines.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_56">To complement the work of mainstream teachers, all primary schools now have access to the services of a learning-support teacher to help children who have low achievement in literacy and numeracy. In addition, more than 2,300 resource teachers have been assigned to children with special needs. A dedicated support team has been recruited and has completed a national programme of in-service training for learning support teachers and resource teachers which will help them to set appropriate learning targets for children who have learning difficulties, to plan individual programmes to address their needs and to continually monitor children's progress. I have also made resources available to organise seminar days on implementation of the guidelines for learning support teachers, published in 2000, for whole staffs in schools in areas designated as disadvantaged. The purpose of the seminars will be to ensure a whole-school approach to tackling literacy difficulties. These seminars will include a presentation of the NAPS targets and schools will design a literacy framework for their school so that swift progress will be made towards the achievement of the targets. This training will be completed by the end of June 2003. Planning is in train in relation to the continuation of this support in the coming school year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_57">In consequence of the success of the reading recovery programme, which had been piloted in the Louth, Monaghan and Cavan area, I have now extended the programme to 15 schools, mainly in the central Dublin area. Reading recovery provides intensive individual support to children who are experiencing literacy difficulties. The further extension of the programme will be considered in light of its success in the 15 schools in the Dublin area.</summary>

          <p eId="para_974">The indemnity agreement between the State and CORI provided for 18 religious congregations to make a contribution of €128 million to the Residential Institutions Redress Fund. In return, the Government agreed to grant an indemnity to the religious congregations that were parties to the agreement. This indemnity applies only to cases which are eligible to be dealt with under the terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002, but which are not resolved within this scheme, and in respect of which litigation is commenced within six years of the date of the agreement – 5 June 2002. In the event of a religious congregation deciding to run a case itself then the indemnity will not apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">It is hoped that all, or certainly the vast majority of cases will be dealt with by the Residential Institutions Redress Board rather than through the courts. Therefore, it is expected that the indemnity will apply to relatively few cases. However, as there is no way to predict at this time how many claimants will opt to go through the courts rather than the redress board, I am not in a position to estimate the likely cost of the indemnity to the State. To date, the indemnity has not been applied in any case.</p>

          <p eId="para_977">Under the terms of the indemnity agreement between the State and CORI signed on 5 June 2002, the State had a period of nine  months to consider the properties offered by the religious congregations in respect of the properties to be transferred list. On 5 March 2003, officials at the residential institutions redress unit of my Department requested a further period of two months in order to give further consideration to a number of the properties on offer. CORI agreed to this request. Following further examination of the properties on offer, officials at my Department wrote to CORI's legal representatives and outlined a number of properties which the State was prepared to accept a fee simple interest in. However, a number of other properties were rejected on the basis that no benefit to the State could be identified by acquiring a title.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">Section 8 of the agreement states that in the event that the State party rejects a property offered, the religious congregation has the right to replace the property with an alternative property or cash sum equivalent. CORI can now submit a schedule of alternative properties which the congregations propose to offer the State in place of the properties the State has declined. The nine month period for consideration of these properties will then commence. As negotiations are ongoing and the issue is commercially sensitive, I do not intend giving any details of the property aspect of the agreement at this stage. When agreement is reached, a list of the properties will be made available.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">There is no time limit of nine months on the schedule entitled properties already transferred. Officials from my Department have sought additional information from CORI to ensure that each of these properties qualify under the criteria laid down in the indemnity agreement regarding valuation, title and restriction on transfer for a 25 year period. To date, none of the properties on this list has been accepted.</p>

          <p eId="para_983">Physical education is part of the prescribed curriculum for primary schools, and schools at second level must offer a physical education programme. The focus in the physical education curriculum is on the child's holistic development, stressing personal and social development, physical growth, and motor development. Goal-setting, within the curriculum, focuses on individual improvement and not on winning or being the best.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">At primary level, a revised curriculum in physical education was published as part of the primary school curriculum in 1999. A revised syllabus for physical education for junior cycle, as a non-examination subject, is being introduced to second level schools on a phased basis from September of this year. Initially, 200 schools will participate in this project with the remaining schools becoming involved over the following years. It is planned that the revised physical education syllabus for senior cycle, as a non-examination subject, will be introduced to schools on a phased basis from September 2004 and while the syllabus for leaving certificate, for examination, is expected to be introduced from September 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">In October 2000, my Department introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools. Since the introduction of the scheme, my Department provided in excess of €5.5 million in grant aid to primary schools under this scheme to enable schools to provide coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or for the purchase of resource materials associated with the provision of physical education. Material and equipment purchased by schools in previous years will generally be still available to them for the current year. In 2002, primary schools designated as disadvantaged received a grant of €1,270 while other recognised primary schools received a grant of €635. Approximately €2.4 million was allocated to primary schools in 2002 under this scheme.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_60">In the light of the current budgetary constraints, I decided to withdraw payment of the  grant in 2003. I will keep the position under review for future years.</summary>

          <p eId="para_987">For the purpose of the school transport scheme, the country has been divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary centre. One of the main objects of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from school and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly. The catchment boundary system is used to determine eligibility for school transport services. Having an open system would be unsustainable in terms of the costs involved and would be difficult to organise. My Department is currently reviewing the question of the re-drawing of the catchment boundaries in the Schull-Bantry area and a decision on this matter will be taken as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_992">A revised syllabus for science at higher and ordinary levels will be introduced on an optional basis in September 2003 for examination in the junior certificate examination in 2006 and following years. My Department has issued a circular letter to the management authorities of second level schools inviting them to opt in to implementing the revised syllabus from 2003-04 and, if their school is in the free education scheme, to apply for a once-off equipment-resource grant by completing an application form. Applications for the grant for 2003-04 are required to reach my Department before 31 October 2003.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_61">The grant scheme provides for a grant of €3,500 per laboratory in cases where schools are adequately equipped to implement the current science syllabus or have had a major capital investment since 1995 and an enhanced rate of  grant for schools whose equipment and resources are not deemed adequate to deliver the current syllabus, by reference to an itemised indicative resource list issued with the circular. Payment of the grant is conditional on the implementation of the revised syllabus.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_62">While the actual cost of the measure will not be known until the applications for 2003-04 have been received and processed, the overall cost of equipping all schools to deliver the revised syllabus has been estimated provisionally at €12 million. This includes provision for a small number of schools that are not currently in a position, with optimum time-tabling, to provide for a double period per week access to laboratory facilities. My Department's building unit is entering into discussions with these schools to see how best their needs can be met as quickly as possible.</summary>

          <p eId="para_994">In general terms, the existing empirical evidence does not allow us to determine whether money spent on early interventions at primary and pre-primary school level can yield savings on special support at later ages. However, the studies to which the Deputy refers do provide evidence that early intervention programmes in the arts can and do serve as an agent of change in learning.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">Qualitative studies have highlighted repeatedly that the arts, including music programmes, provide opportunities for learning, enabling young people to reach for and attain higher levels of achievement. One of the critical findings of such research is that learning in and through the arts can help "level the playing field" for young people from disadvantaged circumstances. Research clearly shows that engagement in the arts nurtures the development of cognitive, social and personal competencies.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_65">Programmes of support for disadvantaged school communities funded by my Department are mindful of the vital role and impact of the  arts on learning. In addition, the primary school curriculum, 1999, is underpinned by the understanding that experience of the arts is at the heart of learning. The curriculum actively encourages partnerships between the school and arts organisations that offer in-school and out-of-school support programmes in specific disciplines such as music, drama and art.</summary>

          <p eId="para_998">I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 147 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">Since 1997, my Department has provided grants amounting to some €50 million to primary schools and grants amounting to some €30 million to post-primary schools for the purchase of computer equipment. In addition, a range of ICT support services and teacher training programmes have been provided by the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, for which funding of some €40 million has been provided by my Department over the past five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">As a result, significant progress has been made in developing computer facilities and applications in schools and pupil-computer ratios have improved considerably since the schools ICT programme was initiated in 1998. Data recently obtained by my Department indicate that pupil to computer ratios have reduced in primary schools from 35:1 in 1998 to a current level of just over 11:1 and in post-primary schools from over 16:1 to a current level of 9:1. Moreover, in special schools the ratio has reduced from 9:1 in 1998 to 4:1 at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">The Government remains fully committed to providing continued support to schools in the promotion of ICT in teaching and learning. The NCTE has recently conducted a nationwide census of all schools on behalf of my Department in order to determine progress achieved in meeting the ICT needs of schools as well as resource requirements going forward. The findings of this census, which will be available shortly, will inform future policy and funding priorities in this area having regard to available budgetary resources.</p>

          <p eId="para_1003">Dealing with educational disadvantage remains a key priority of this Government and my Department has introduced a range of key interventions and programmes in primary schools aimed directly at tackling the problem of educational disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">The Breaking the Cycle pilot project was launched in 1996 and the aim of the project was to discriminate positively in favour of primary schools in selected urban and rural areas which have high concentrations of children who are at risk of not reaching their potential in the education system because of their socio-economic backgrounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">When the project was launched there were 33 schools in the urban dimension and 123 schools in the rural dimension. However, due to amalgamations and withdrawals, there are now a total of 32 designated disadvantaged schools included in the urban dimension and 120 small rural schools in the rural dimension. The 32 schools in the urban dimension are benefiting from a targeted programme of teacher and funding supports which includes extra staffing to allow for a maximum class size of 15:1 in all junior classes. The maximum class size in senior classes was 29:1 but this has been reduced to 27:1 from September 2002. For the 120 small rural schools shared teacher-co-ordinator supports and funding supports are also made available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">The five-year pilot phase of Breaking the Cycle ended on 30 June 2001 and all schools included in the project are now included in Giving Children An Even Break, an expanded programme providing additional supports in respect of disadvantaged pupils to over 2,300 primary schools. The schools in Breaking the Cycle have retained their existing entitlements under the former scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">In addition, the schools that were included in Breaking the Cycle pilot project may also qualify for additional resources under Giving Children An Even Break based on the level of concentration of pupils at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">Such concentrated and focused deployment of funds is intended not only to lead to more and more young people going on to complete second-level education, but also to make their experience of school more positive and worthwhile and so help to alleviate the problem of educational disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">Both Breaking the Cycle and Giving Children An Even Break will continue to be monitored to ensure that they are addressing the needs of the educationally disadvantaged pupils targeted and any programme modifications or future interventions in this area will take account of this monitoring.</p>

          <p eId="para_1011">Funding for the provision of science facilities in post-primary schools forms part of the overall post-primary capital allocation. In the period from 1997-2002, close to €750 million has been invested in delivering post-primary educational infrastructure. Additionally, this year a further €175 million is available for post-primary capital projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">It is not possible to disaggregate from this overall total the specific sum expended on delivering science facilities. This is because when assessing the needs of schools for new or improved facilities, an analysis of existing accommodation is conducted and identified deficiencies including deficiencies in the science facilities are addressed as part of the overall strategy to deliver new or improved facilities at a school. The Deputy can be further assured that all science laboratories being provided in post primary schools are equipped to a high standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">Apart from works done as part of the overall post-primary building programmes, in recent years grants in excess of €13,000 per school were paid to schools in the free education scheme that offer one or more of the physical science subjects at senior cycle towards the cost of purchasing science equipment including ICT equipment. These grants are in addition to the <i>per capita</i> grants also made available to schools.</p>

Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, my Department now provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_67">A total of 2,350 schools are participating in Giving Children an Even Break and are in receipt of a range of additional supports including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The levels  of disadvantage were established as a result of a comprehensive survey of primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, in March-April 2000 at my Department's request. All primary schools were invited to complete the survey questionnaire and over 75% of primary schools participated and returned completed survey forms to the ERC.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_68">Any school in which there was at least one pupil which satisfied any of the criteria associated with socio-economic disadvantage was entitled to additional resources under Giving Children an Even Break. Resources are allocated to schools on a sliding scale, and schools with greater proportions of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds are allocated proportionately more resources than those with fewer numbers of such pupils.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_69">Every participating school is entitled to a special €63.49per capita grant in respect of the percentage of pupils with disadvantaged characteristics and schools receive a minimum of €952.30 per annum. Schools categorised as urban in Giving Children an Even Break with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils are being supported, where necessary, through staff allocations to implement reduced pupil/teacher ratios of 20:1 in junior classes, infants through second class, and 27:1 in senior classes, third through sixth class. In line with normal staffing arrangements for national schools, teacher post allocations for the purpose of Giving Children An Even Break in respect of the 2003-04 school year will be determined by reference to enrolments in junior and senior classes at 30 September 2002.</summary>

      if his attention has been drawn to the findings of the report prepared on behalf of the Dublin Employment Pact which showed that Dublin had the second lowest participation rate in third level of any county in the Republic and lags well behind other EU capitals in this area; if he is planning targeted measures to address this imbalance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_1043">I am aware of the report by Professor Pat Clancy on his fourth national survey of access to higher education which found that Dublin, by comparison with other counties, had a low level of participation in third level education. However, it should be noted that this survey, based on entrants to higher education in autumn 1998, was carried out before the significant additional funding committed by Government to further and higher education.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_71">New measures have been introduced specifically aimed at increasing access to third level education. There is a provision within the national  development plan for a third level access fund totalling almost €121 million, over the period 2000-06, to tackle disadvantage at third level. The report of the action group on access to third level education, which was established to advise on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability at third level, was published in July 2001.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_72">To date a number of measures have been taken in response to some of the main recommendations in the report. Special rates of maintenance grant, usually referred to as 'top-up' grants, payable to disadvantaged grant holders, were introduced with effect from the 2000-01 academic year; following a review in 2002, I increased the annual income threshold for the special rates by 32% for 2002-03. I also increased the special rate of grant to €4,000 for non-adjacent grant holders. As a result of the review, I am pleased to state that the number of students qualifying for the "top-up" grant in 2002-03 has more than doubled to some 7,500 students.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_73">A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. Area Development Management Limited, ADM, under whose aegis the partnerships operate, accepted my Department's request that it would administer the fund for the 2001-02 academic year. The total allocation for the 2001-02 academic year was €1.2 million, with 37 partnerships and community groups receiving allocations from the fund. For 2002-03, I increased the provision for the fund to €2 million and 50 area partnerships and community groups have received allocations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_74">I anticipate that the national office for equity of access will be in operation prior to the start of the 2003-04 academic year and that it will facilitate the aim of increasing third level access by the three target groups, in partnership with my Department, the third level institutions and other stakeholders and agencies.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_75">The student assistance fund assists students who might, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The sum of €8.9 million was allocated from this fund in 2002 in respect of the 2002-03 academic year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_76">The under-representation of students from lower socio-economic backgrounds in the higher education system remains unacceptable and is, and will continue to be, one of my key policy priorities. In this context, the Deputy will be aware that on the 25 May I announced a package of measures costing €42 million in a full year to address the problem of disadvantage in third level education. The package comprises an increase in the maintenance grant levels by 15%; a significant increase in the income thresholds for purposes of determining grant eligibility and an expansion in  the number of thresholds, benefiting a greater number of students; an increase in the top income threshold from €36,897 to €40,000, ensuring that a significantly higher number of students from households with moderate incomes will not have to pay the €670 student service charge; an increase in the amount of the higher rate of the top-up grant to the level of the maximum personal rate of unemployment assistance and approximately 7,500 grant holders will benefit under this measure.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_77">This package of measures will be the catalyst that enables students from disadvantaged backgrounds to reach their full potential in the education system, and in their subsequent careers.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1075">I propose to take Questions Nos. 124 and 393 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">The 2002 NESF report on early school leaving estimated that approximately 1,000 children do not transfer from primary to post-primary on an annual basis. It is my intention to put in place a primary pupil database which will facilitate the collation of comprehensive data on transfer rates in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">My Department operates a number of programmes at primary level that are designed to tackle the problem of early school leaving. The Giving Children an Even Break programme provides additional financial and teaching supports for children from disadvantaged backgrounds who are most at risk of early school leaving. Expenditure on this programme in 2003 will be in excess of €17 million. A key role in this regard is also played by the home school community liaison scheme, which has been extended to each of the 314 designated disadvantaged primary schools in the country. This scheme helps parents to develop their skills as the primary educators of their children and also operates transfer programmes to help primary school pupils to make the transition to post primary level. Expenditure on this scheme will be in the region of €7 million in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">The main programme within my Department for tackling the issue of early school leaving is the school completion programme, which was launched in 2002. The school completion programme incorporates the learning, experience and best practice derived from previous early school leaving initiatives and assimilates the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative, ESLI, and the stay-in-school retention initiative at second level, SSRI. The programme is based on an integrated cross-community approach to tackling educational disadvantage, involving primary and post-primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies. Its objective is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_81">Eligible schools were selected on the basis of their pupil retention rates from my Department's post-primary pupil database. Schools are grouped into 82 clusters of one or more second-level schools and their main feeder primary schools. Each cluster has established a committee composed of principals, voluntary and statutory agencies including county development boards, local drug task forces, area partnerships, the local programme co-ordinator, parents, community interests etc. This committee is responsible for developing and overseeing implementation of a  fully costed, integrated plan to tackle early school leaving in the area, including specific retention targets.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_82">Retention plans have been submitted to my Department by all clusters and have been approved. Average funding per cluster is approximately €195,000 in 2003. At present, 400 schools have been included in the school completion programme, 288 primary and 112 post-primary, which is supported by a national co-ordinator and four assistant co-ordinators.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_83">The Educational Welfare Board, which was established under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, is the single national agency with responsibility for school attendance. The Act requires schools to draw up school attendance strategies in order to promote regular attendance and tackle the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The strategies will focus on arrangements for the identification of children who are at risk of dropping out of school at an early stage so that appropriate interventions may be put in place.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_84">The board appointed an interim chief executive officer in August 2002 and directors of corporate services and educational services and a number of other head office staff have recently taken up their posts. On 5 July 2003, 37 former school attendance officers who were employed by local authorities under the previous legislation were transferred to the board in accordance with Section 40 of the Act. These staff are currently providing a service in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Waterford. Of the 37, 25 have recently accepted the terms and conditions of employment of EWO and will henceforth be carrying out the full range of EWO duties and providing a year round service rather than the school-term based service they were providing as former school attendance officers. My Department has recently received sanction from the Department of Finance for the recruitment of an additional 36 staff by the board, including regional managers, senior educational welfare officers and educational welfare officers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_85">I have allocated a budget of €5.4 million to the board for the current year and it is my intention that the board's proposals will be taken forward in the context of these resources and budgetary allocations in future years.</summary>

      the measures proposed and funding allocated at pre-school, primary and secondary levels to facilitate greater access to third level education from pupils living in disadvantaged areas.

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1082">Since taking office, one of my top priorities has been the promotion of quality in, and equitable access to, education including, in particular, higher education. If we are to break cycles of disadvantage, open up opportunity and optimise our broader economic and social potential we have to ensure the broadest possible level of participation in higher education. It is my over-riding objective that support has to be targeted at those who are most in need and at an appropriate level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">This Government has ensured dedicated funding at an unprecedented level for third-level access programmes. Such funding has increased from a base of €508,000 in 1997 to €26 million in the current year. This, together with targeted funding by the HEA, over €6 million in 2002, and to the institutes of technology, has enabled the implementation of many of the key recommendations in the report of the action group on access to third level education to be set in train. I am committed to progressing these recommendations further.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">I was particularly pleased, therefore, to be facilitated by the Government to announce, on 25 May 2003, a new package of measures costing €42 million in a full year and for which provision will be made in the Department's estimates for 2003 and 2004 to further address and ameliorate the problems facing students from low to moderate income households in accessing third-level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">As the Deputy will be aware, this package combines substantial improvements in the level and coverage of the maintenance grant for those on low to moderate incomes, with increases in the level of top-up grant for those who are most disadvantaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">I also granted approval in November 2002 for the establishment of the national office for equity of access to higher education within the Higher Education Authority which will be responsible for allocating funding for initiatives to promote equity in access. It is anticipated that the national office will be in operation prior to the start of the 2003-04 academic year.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_86">In addition to the above named measures specifically designed to broaden access to third level education, I have also allocated more than €133 million in 2003 on measures at pre-school, primary and post-primary level which provide additional financial and teaching resources for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, thereby encouraging their continued participation in formal schooling and increasing their chances of progressing to third level education. This includes  provision in the following areas: a sum of €7 million for pre-school programmes such as the early start pilot project which caters for pupils aged three to four years who are most at risk in areas of social disadvantage; over €70 million for disadvantaged programmes at primary level such as the disadvantaged areas scheme, home school liaison scheme, and the Giving Children an Even Break programme; a sum of €33 million for post-primary level disadvantaged schemes such as the disadvantaged areas scheme and home school community liaison scheme; and a sum of €23 million for the school completion programme in 2003 which encompasses primary and post-primary level and is a key component of my Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1105">The Education (Welfare) Act 2000, which is now fully commenced, established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">To discharge its responsibilities, the board will develop a nation-wide service that is accessible to schools, parents/guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, educational welfare officers are to be appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused services to support regular school attendance and discharge the board's functions locally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">The board appointed an interim chief executive officer in August 2002 and directors of corporate services and educational services, along with three function managers, have recently taken up their posts. Five additional head office staff are in the process of being recruited. A total of 37 former school attendance officers, who were employed by local authorities under the previous legislation, were transferred to the board on 5 July 2002 in accordance with section 40 of the Act. These staff are currently providing a service in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Waterford. Of them, 25 have recently accepted the terms and conditions of employment as educational welfare officers and will henceforth be carrying out the full range of EWO duties and providing a year round service rather than the school term based service they were providing as former school attendance officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">My Department has recently received sanction from the Department of Finance for the recruitment of an additional 36 staff by the NEWB, including regional managers, senior educational welfare officers and educational welfare officers. Advertisements were placed in the national media on 5 and 6 June. The additional cohort will bring the number of service delivery staff available to the board to almost 100 by the end of 2003.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_88">The Government is fully committed to the on-going development of the educational welfare service. As part of the phased expansion of this new service, priority will be given to those the areas which had a service under the previous legislation as well as to disadvantaged areas, especially areas covered by the RAPID programme. The board must also develop the  capacity to take action in relation to urgent cases wherever they arise.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1112">This year the school building programme amounts to €342.9 million. The 2003 programme will deliver 146 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition, approximately 433 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme and, of course, all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works. The programme is designed to give the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students and to give an assurance that it is being operated in an open and transparent manner. The criteria for prioritising school building projects were also published for the first time.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_89">The Government is determined to consolidate the substantial progress that has already been made in order to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time. In this regard already this year I have introduced two new initiatives at primary level. Firstly, I have put in place a pilot initiative that is aimed at devolving responsibility for the planning and construction phases of improvement works to school authorities. Specifically, the initiative is focused on small and mostly rural primary schools where the enrolment profile is stable. Twenty primary schools were invited to participate in the pilot phase of the initiative, which will be reviewed at the end of 2003 with a view to its expansion, subject to the availability of funding. Secondly, I am endeavouring to reduce the level of temporary accommodation being provided. The new pilot  initiative funds schools to respond quickly to accommodation difficulties. There is minimal interaction with my Department and the school is fully empowered to drive the design and construction processes. I fully expect that this initiative will inform future policy and that the scheme will be expanded to include more schools in future years.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_90">I am conscious from my previous experience in the Department of Environment and Local Government that innovative building methods could reduce costs and provide top quality accommodation and I have asked the building unit in my Department to consider these methodologies in the context of school buildings. In particular my Department is exploring ways of reducing the time-frame for processing projects through architectural planning and new standard plans are being devised, initially, for eight and 16 classroom primary schools. The main advantage is that my Department will be in a position to respond more quickly to building needs, having regard to the level of funding available. The process will also reduce the number of stages that a project must proceed through in architectural planning and it is expected that savings will be achieved on design fees.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_91">I will be looking closely at the potential for using PPP mechanisms as an additional method of advancing the school building programme. However, it is likely that only larger green-field site projects will be suitable for consideration under the PPP process.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_92">A submission has been made to the Department of Finance for a multi-annual financial envelope for educational infrastructure. A decision in the matter is expected shortly.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_93">In order to assist the long-term planning of capital provision through a precise and detailed identification of accommodation needs in schools, my Department has undertaken on a pilot basis a comprehensive inventory of accommodation of 115 primary and post-primary schools in County Kildare. The information gained from the survey has been placed on a geographic information system database. The Department is at present undertaking a detailed assessment of the pilot phase of the inventory with a view to extending it further, having regard to available resources.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_94">In relation to the tender cost of school building projects, my Department's cost limits have not been revised upwards for some time. The Society of Chartered Surveyors' index shows that the current tender prices reflect December 2000 levels and there is no reason to believe that there will be any increases in tender levels over the coming year.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1129">However, at this stage, it is unlikely that a site will be available for the forthcoming school year.

          <p eId="para_1135">In 2001, following a review of the school transport scheme and taking account of the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee report on school transport, a number of improvements were put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">These included reducing the qualifying distance for eligibility for school transport for primary school pupils aged 10 and over from three to two miles, so that all primary pupils are treated equally for eligibility purposes.

All school transport vehicles were provided with a communication system to enable the driver to have ready access to the depot.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1140">The report of the task force on autism is lengthy and complex. It contains approximately 180 individual recommendations ranging from measures aimed at identifying prevalence rates and early intervention, through issues relating to diagnosis and assessment, the centrality of the role of parents, the required models of education and health care services and the need for specialist training for those involved in service provision, to structural, constitutional and policy issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">The scope of these recommendations is such as to require a multi-faceted response. My Department's key focus to date has been on progressing the fundamental structural and legislative measures which are necessary to underpin the development and delivery of services for persons with autism in line with the task force's recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">A key development on the structural front has been the decision to establish the National Council for Special Education. The national council, which will have a local area presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including persons with autism. It will have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to address particular areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties. Arrangements for the establishment of the council are now well advanced. A chief executive has been appointed and the objective is that the council will be vested shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">I will also be bringing forward legislation, based on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2002, aimed at establishing the rights and entitlements of children with special needs, including autism, to an appropriate education service and providing the necessary framework for effective service delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">My objective is to secure the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_96">In the meantime, investment in special support services for children with autism is continuing to  develop, having regard to the recommendations of the task f orce. To date, 115 special classes dedicated to children with autism have been established. These include three special classes for pupils with Aspergers' Syndrome, which is on the autistic spectrum. Further such classes are being established on an ongoing basis in response to assessed needs. Each class caters for a maximum of six pupils and is supported by a teacher and two special needs assistants.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_97">Children attending such classes attract a special rate of capitation funding of €589.50 per annum. Such children are also entitled to avail of the special school transport service which includes escorts on school buses. Expenditure on the special transport service last year is estimated at €40 million with an additional €4.4 million being spent on the escort service.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_98">My Department allocates additional resources to individual second-level schools to cater for special needs pupils enrolled in those schools. Applications for resources are referred to the national educational psychological service and each case is considered on its merits.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_99">In addition to school-based provision, there are seven facilities in the State delivering educational services using alternative educational methods for teaching children on the autistic spectrum. These facilities, together with the school based services, are currently being evaluated by my Department's inspectorate. It is expected that the evaluation process will be completed this year.</summary>

Currently, the annual number of clients of the general adult literacy services provided by the vocational education committees is 28,000. Literacy funds are being used to expand the scale and scope of provision, improve outreach and referral links and promote flexibility and quality. In addition to expanding the general adult literacy services, specially-targeted programmes have been introduced for people with special literacy requirements, in such areas as family learning, workplace learning, provision for special needs, and catering for those for whom English is not the mother tongue. To try to reach as many people with literacy needs as possible, use is made of radio and television, so that people can access help in the privacy of their own homes.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_104">The most significant spending recommendation of the report of the action group on access to third level education concerned the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, commonly referred to as top-up grants. These recommendations were introduced, with retrospective effect, from the 2000-01 academic year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_105">Following a review early in 2002, I increased the annual income threshold for the special rates by 32%. For 2002-03, I also increased the special rate of grant to €4,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and to €1,600 for students residing within 15 miles of college. This is equivalent to a "top-up" of €1,490 and €596 respectively, for eligible students, on the ordinary maintenance grant. As a result of the review, it was expected that the number of students qualifying for the "top-up" grant in 2002-03 would double to 7,000 students. Recent figures show that this target was exceeded with approximately 7,500 students receiving the "top-up" grant in 2002-03.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_106">A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. Area Development Management, ADM Limited under whose aegis the partnerships operate, administered the fund for the 2001-02 academic year. The total allocation for the 2001-02 academic year was €1.2 million, with 37 partnerships and community groups receiving allocations from the fund. For 2002-03, I increased the provision for the fund to €2 million. ADM Limited, which is continuing to administer the fund, notified 50 area partnerships and community groups of their allocations in respect of the 2002-03 academic year. The report of the action group on access to third level education sets out a co-ordinated framework of actions required to improve equity of access to third-level. The group considered that a single co-ordinating body was essential in order to realise the  framework. Accordingly, a key recommendation of the group was that a national office for equity of access to higher education be established to ensure the effective implementation of many of the recommendations in the report.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_107">I have given approval for the establishment of the national office for equity of access to higher education, within the Higher Education Authority. My Department is engaged in discussions with the Higher Education Authority with a view to bringing the national office into operation in time for the academic year 2003-04. I anticipate that the national office will facilitate the aim of increasing third level access by the three target groups, in partnership with my Department, the third level institutions and other stakeholders and agencies. Some of the action group's recommendations relate to the achieving of targets for access to third level education, over the period of the national development plan, in regard to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_108">I am committed to progressing these, and other, recommendations in the report of the action group on access to third level education and to ensuring that the issue of equity of access to third level education remains a priority during my tenure of office as Minister for Education and Science. The Deputy will be aware that on 25 May I announced a package of measures costing €42 million in a full year to address the problem of disadvantage in third level education. The package comprises an increase in the maintenance grant levels by 15%, a significant increase in the income thresholds for purposes of determining grant eligibility and an expansion in the number of thresholds, benefiting a greater number of students, an increase in the top income threshold from €36,897 to €40,000, ensuring that a significantly higher number of students from households with moderate incomes will not have to pay the €670 student service charge, an increase in the amount of the higher rate of the top-up grant to the level of the maximum personal rate of unemployment assistance.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_109">The position in relation to teaching practice is that it is not a paid activity in any institution but  rather is viewed as training rather than employment. It is an integral part of the curriculum of the degree programmes in education and there is no special financial assistance available to students.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_110">I would point out that teacher education programmes provided in approved third level colleges, are approved courses for the purposes of the higher education grants scheme. Under the terms of that scheme, grantholders who are required to participate in off-campus placement as an integral part of their course may have their grant entitlement paid in the normal manner. Where the college requires a grantholder in receipt of the adjacent rate of grant to relocate from his-her residence in order to undertake a placement of not less than one academic term-semester, the non-adjacent rate of grant may be paid for the duration of such placement. Accordingly, student teachers who are eligible for grant assistance continue to receive their entitlements while undertaking teaching practice.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_111">I have no plans to introduce a scheme of financial assistance, over and above current provision, for travel and materials cost incurred by student teachers while on teaching practice.</summary>

In practical terms, this will translate into the definition by the council, on foot of research that it conducts or commissions, of appropriate educational responses for categories of special need, along with assistance by the council in the delivery of educational services to individual children at ground level through its provision of information, co-ordination and facilitation services.</p>

          <p eId="para_1287">As the Deputy is aware, I indicated my intention to widen the consultation process when the education for persons with disabilities Bill was restored to the legislative process and I encouraged all interested parties to participate in the ensuing consultative process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288">As a result of this consultation process, 39 groups and individuals responded to the invitation for submissions on the Bill and 25 groups met officials of my Department for detailed discussions on their submissions. The new Bill will take into account the views which emerged from consultations with the various interest groups. This phase of consultation is now complete and I intend to bring the revised legislation to Government shortly. I anticipate it's publication before the end of the month.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289">My objective is to bring forward legislation which will: identify the special educational needs of children with disabilities and provide for an education appropriate to their needs as early as possible in their lives; ensure that parents have a central role in their child's education; provide for the planning for the child's future special education needs as an adult; and ensure that the various agencies involved in providing for special education and related support services are required to act within specified time limits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">I also propose that the legislation will build on and strengthen the structures set out in the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2002, especially the national council for special education and the special education appeals board. It will also be an objective for revised legislation that it will closely dovetail where necessary with legislation being prepared by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform relating to the broader issue of services for people with disabilities.</p>

          <p eId="para_1292">Music, the visual arts and drama pro vide for sensory, emotional, intellectual and creative enrichment and contribute to the young person's holistic development. Education in these areas encourages ideas that are personal and inventive and makes a vital contribution to the development of a range of intelligences. The activities and experiences encompassed in arts education help the young person to make sense of the world, to question, to speculate, to find solutions and to express and understand feelings. The aims of education in the arts include the encouragement of individuality and the fostering of confidence and self-esteem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">Sport and physical education, although closely linked, are not synonymous. Sport begins in play and develops through games, competition and challenges, supporting teamwork and leadership. The focus in the physical education curriculum is on the child's holistic development, stressing personal and social development, physical growth, and motor development. Goal-setting, within the curriculum, focuses on individual improvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">The physical education curriculum at both primary and second level is designed to enable young people to develop their physical abilities and talents to the greatest extent possible. Physical education also enables young people to develop desirable personal and social skills, such as the acceptance of rules, the capacity to accept winning and losing with equanimity, the concept of fair play and the ability to co-operate in group activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">In my view, the arts and physical education, including sport, are essential elements of a curriculum that is designed to develop the whole person. There are many facets of both arts and sport that promote life skills and develop positive attitudes and self-esteem, and they can be particularly important in motivating and developing children experiencing educational disadvantage. Young people who acquire these attitudes and skills, whether through their experiences at school, in the home or in the wider community, will be well equipped to cope with the challenges of life.</p>

          <p eId="para_1332">I fully appreciate the difficulties being experienced by many schools in the recruitment of fully qualified teachers, and accordingly a number of initiatives have been undertaken by my Department to substantially increase the supply of trained primary teachers and alleviate the current supply difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333">In order to improve teacher supply, the intake to the B.Ed. programme in the colleges of education has increased dramatically in recent years. Since 1999, over 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the B.Ed. programme. This represents a doubling of the number admitted to the programme in 1996.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334">The total intake in the 2002-03 academic year is approximately 1,350 students. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are currently some 3,500 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education. In addition to increasing the output of graduates, other initiatives have been introduced to increase the number of trained personnel. B.Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualifications, are now recognised as fully qualified.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335">Montessori trained teachers who have successfully completed the full-time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, or the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the AMI College, are recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers and are recognised to teach in certain categories of special schools, special classes and as resource teachers in primary schools. The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336">My Department is also consulting with the colleges with regard to the provision of modular type courses for secondary trained teachers with the necessary academic requirement in Irish. I reassure the Deputy that, in dealing with the issue of teacher supply, my Department will continue to consider new initiatives and keep existing initiatives under review.</p>

          <p eId="para_1340">Responsibility for arranging insurance cover on school property and against public liability is a matter for the managerial authorities of primary and voluntary secondary schools, which are privately owned. Many reasons have been put forward by management authorities for the current insurance increases, ranging from school factors such as claims history, location, curricula offered, size of school and factors affecting the international insurance market. <i>Per capita </i>grants towards the operating costs of primary and voluntary secondary schools may be used for this purpose. Such grants have increased significantly in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341">In the case of secondary schools, the standard <i>per capita</i> grant of €224.74 that applied in 1997, has been increased to €266.49 in this school year. For disadvantaged schools the increase has brought the per capita grant to over €300. In addition, secondary schools have benefited under the school services support initiative, since its inception some two years ago. This annual grant was increased by €10 per pupil from January last. This latest increase has brought the support services grant in the case of secondary schools to €127 per pupil from 1 January 2003.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_124">This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to €15,554 per school, €44.44 per pupil per annum that was also approved for secondary schools in the past two years. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. In my view this is, in gen eral, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific initiatives. For example, in a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to €100,000 per annum and annual grants of €236,761, –€255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools – towards general expenses and support services, including insurance costs. The school referred to by the Deputy has a current enrolment of 619 pupils and has disadvantaged status.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_125">In the case of the school referred to by the Deputy, my Department recently provided capital grant aid in the amount of €32,140.24 for security fencing in order to meet their insurance company's directive. No further applications have been received from the school in this regard. In recent years my Department has received applications from a number of voluntary secondary schools for works to be carried out in accordance with insurance company directives to ensure continued cover. In all cases the applications are dealt with as a priority or capital grant aid has been provided to allow the works be carried out.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_126">Tackling the difficulties that are being caused by high insurance premiums is a clear priority for the Government and for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A key concern to which the Tánaiste is giving priority is the cost and availability of liability insurance. Although the Tánaiste's Department is responsible for the supervision of insurance companies, EU law prevents Governments from intervening in relation to premium levels or the risks that insurers are prepared to underwrite. However, government's are free to take appropriate action, which could influence cost reduction by the industry. A comprehensive set of measures is contained in An Agreed Programme for Government, the underlying purpose of which is to bring about an improvement in the functioning of the insurance market and in the system. In this context, last October the Tánaiste announced a comprehensive programme for the fundamental reform of the Irish insurance market. Key initiatives in the reform programme include the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and publication of the action plan for the implementation of the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. While the MIAB was essentially concerned with motor insurance, the recommendations also relate to other forms of insurance and to public and employer's liability in particular. The action plan reflects this. An Agreed Programme for Government also contains a commitment to remove unwarranted constraints on competition in all sectors of the economy.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_127">As part of this commitment, and complementary to the reform programme, the Tánaiste's Department, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, is undertaking a study of competition in the insurance marketplace, with particular reference to motor, employers' liability and public liability insurance. Work on the study is in progress. It is envisaged that the bulk of the work  will be completed this year and that a report will be produced in the early part of 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_128">The Government considers that these measures, taken as a package, constitute a programme that is capable of delivering very real reform and that reductions in insurance costs will translate into significant reductions in premiums.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1343">Pupils and parents enjoy a number of legal rights regarding their choice of school for primary education. These derive from the Constitution, legislation and my Department's rules. Statutory rights to choice of school derives from the Education Act 1998, section 6 of which provides for a number of objects to which those concerned with the implementation of the Act must have regard, including promoting "the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice having regard to the rights of patrons and the effective and efficient use of resources". In addition, section 15(2)(<i>d</i>) of the 1998 Act provides that a board of management of a primary school shall “publish, in such manner as the board with the agreement of the patron considers appropriate, the policy of the school concerning admission to and participation in the school, and ensure that as regards that policy principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are respected and such directions as may be made from time to time by the Minister, having regard to the characteristic spirit of the school and the constitutional rights of all persons concerned, are complied with”.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_132">At present, officials in my Department are in consultation with officials in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government with a view to drawing up regulations under the Act governing the preparation of admissions policies. This work is ongoing and will be concluded as speedily as possible. The purpose of these proposed regulations is to promote greater consistency, transparency and accountability in decision-making at school level and to further the objective, under the Education Act, of equality and  participation in education. It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission or the terms or conditions of admission of a person as a student to the school.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_133">Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student themselves, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with in 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the board of management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of. In addition, in cases where parents experience difficulties in having their child admitted to the school system, my Department gives assistance in securing a suitable school placement through the involvement of the inspectorate in a consultative process with the school authorities.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1345">Significant improvements in the levels of capitation funding to schools have been made in recent years. The standard rate of capitation grant for primary schools was substantially increased from €57.14 per pupil in 1997 to €111.58 per pupil in 2003. This represented an increase of 95% in the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level over the period. In addition, the ancillary services grant has been increased from €38.09 – £30 – per pupil in 1999 to €127 per pupil in 2003. Since 1997, significant improvements have been made in the level of funding to voluntary secondary schools. For example, the standard <i>per capita</i> grant in 1997 was €224.74. This has been increased to €266.49 in the current school year. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of €38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total <i>per capita</i> grant in the case of these schools to over €300. In addition, under the school services support initiative, second level schools have benefited from further significant increases in the support services grant from €25.40 per pupil in the year 2000 to €99 per pupil this school year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">Further improvements also include a range of equalisation measures designed to reduce historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. Under the terms of a recent equalisation measure, the support services grant was further increased by €28 per pupil with effect from September 2002. This brought the support services grant in the case of secondary schools to €116.88 per pupil from September 2002 and to €127 per pupil from 1 January 2003. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to €15,554 per school –€44.44 per pupil – per annum approved for secondary schools in December 2001.</p>

          <p eId="para_1351">The latest information, published in the NESF report of 2002 on early school leavers indicated that approximately 1,000 young people do not transfer annually from primary to second level. Of those who entered second level in September 1993, 2,400 – 3.2% – left school before completing the junior certificate three years later in 1996. Almost 10,600 of those who sat the junior certificate in 1996 did not sit the leaving certificate. In all, at the end of the 1990s, about 13,000 – 18.4% – young people leave school annually without the leaving certificate according to the NESF report No 24, March 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352">My Department's policy with regard to the retention of young people who are at risk of early school leaving is to support young people in school and to help schools to adapt to the needs of the young people experiencing difficulties. The problem of early school leaving is a complex issue to resolve and requires movement on a number of fronts which includes legislative and curricular reforms and preventative interventions. This is the approach my Department is taking. The Education Welfare Act 2000 and the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board provide a comprehensive framework for promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The Act requires schools to draw up school attendance strategies to promote regular attendance and tackle the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The strategies will focus on arrangements for the identification of children who are at risk of dropping out of school at an early stage so that appropriate interventions may be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353">To discharge its responsibilities, the board will develop a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents, guardians and others who are concerned with the welfare of young people. Educational welfare officers, EWOs, will be appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board's functions locally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354">With regard to curriculum, my Department's strategies have included widening the educational experience available to students. The aim is to achieve a greater level of inclusiveness in curricular provision and meet the needs of the diversity of pupils in our second level schools, by expanding funding for programmes such as the junior certificate schools program, JCSP, the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, vocational preparation training, VPT, and the leaving certificate applied, LCA.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_134">The school completion programme has been implemented to directly target those in danger of dropping out of the education system and is a key component of my Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving. The focus of the school completion programme is on young people between the ages of four and 18 years and aims to develop local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people of school-going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes. Such concentrated and focused deployment of funds should lead to increased numbers of young people completing second level education and in that way, most effectively  assist in redressing the problem of early school leaving.</summary>

A key development on the structural front has been the Government's decision to approve the establishment of the national council for special education. The national council, which will have a local area presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including children with dyslexia. It will have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to consider specific areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties. Arrangements for the establishment of the council are now well advanced. A chief executive officer designate has been appointed and an order to establish the council will shortly be brought before the Oireachtas.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_136">I will also be bringing forward legislation, based on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2002, aimed at establishing the rights and entitlements of persons with special needs, including dyslexia, to an appropriate education service and providing the necessary framework for effective service delivery. My objective is to secure the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1361">My Department has issued guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. These guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspensions and expulsions only as a last resort. Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated, while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a  relatively disruption-free environment. This code should include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362">The report on discipline, commissioned by my Department and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin, deals comprehensively with the issue of discipline in schools, and sets out models of best practice in this area. A copy of the report has been made available to all schools.</p>

          <p eId="para_1364">I have no plans to provide funding for the development of a website for school book exchanges. Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level, mainly relating to language subjects, school books are not approved or prescribed by my Department at first or second level. Decisions on which books to use are taken at school level. Many schools operate book rental schemes and second-hand book exchanges. I consider locally-operated schemes to be the appropriate and efficient way to address this issue. School authorities have been advised that books should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary. Syllabus planners are conscious of the need to avoid over frequent changes, primarily in order to minimise increases in the cost burden for parents. However, textbooks have to be changed periodically to enable teachers to keep their own and their students' work educationally stimulating and to ensure that content and methodology are kept up to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_1365">I am satisfied that the problem of disposal of unwanted textbooks is minimised to the greatest extent possible by the policies operated by my Department. My Department operates a grant scheme towards the cost of providing school textbooks for pupils from low-income families in schools at first and second level. For the purposes of these grants, a needy pupil is a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, single parenthood, or other family circumstances, such as substance abuse, which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship. Principal teachers administer the book grant schemes in schools in a flexible way under the terms of the schemes based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_1368">The issue of non-completion at third level is a complex one which has been a matter of concern for some time. The most recent figures on non-completion rates for third level institutes of technology are the result of research carried out, at the request of my Department, by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, in Drumcondra, Dublin. The quantitative element of the study was submitted to my Department in February 2001 and examined the completion rates of first-time entrants to eleven institutes of technology in 1995. The study shows an overall non-completion rate of 42.61% across the institutes surveyed. The Dublin Institute of Technology also conducted a similar study which showed an overall non-completion rate of 39.46% for the 1994 cohort of full-time first-year students pursuing courses in the institute.</p>
          <p eId="para_1369">The non-completion rate in respect of certificate, diploma and undergraduate degree courses is published in tabular format in chapter 5 of the ERC study by broad fields of study. There are five broad fields of study with regard to national certificate level courses, four at diploma level and three at degree level. Non-completion rates are not available for post-graduate degree courses. Chapter 2 of the Dublin Institute of Technology study details retention rates per faculty and field of study at undergraduate level. Due to the volume of the statistical data requested by the Deputy, I propose to forward this information directly to him as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_1371">The Universities Act 1997 provides a framework of legislation that is compatible with the role, function and operation of universities in modern society. The Act, which was the first Act of general application to all the university institutions since the foundation of the State, was a culmination of an extensive process of consultation and debate both within and outside the Houses of the Oireachtas. Among the significant features of the Act was the provision for revised governance structures for the universities, which ensure that all major stakeholders are represented on the university governing authority which is the principal decision making body of each institutions. The Act also sets out a framework for interaction between the universities and central government. This framework strikes a  measured balance between the institutional autonomy of the universities and the requirements of public accountability. The Act explicitly recognises the centrality of academic freedom and institutional autonomy to the mission of the universities, while addressing the obligations of the institutions in relation to equality of opportunity and access, quality assurance, the effective and efficient use of resources and the requirements of public accountability. The Higher Education Authority is given key functions in respect of these areas of the operation of the universities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1372">The Universities Act 1997, in addition to providing for strengthened governance arrangements at an institutional level, also provides a wider public interest protection in cases where the Minister is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for contending that the functions of a university are being performed in a manner which prima facie constitutes breach of the laws, statutes, or ordinances applicable to the university. This general protection is set out under sections 19, 20, and 21 of the Act, which provide for the appointment of a visitor at the request of the Minister in such circumstances. The visitor has powers to inquire into the academic affairs of the university or to conduct an inspection relevant to this inquiry. On foot of the recommendations of the visitor, the Minister may recommend to the Government the suspension of the governing authority and the termination of the membership of its members.</p>
          <p eId="para_1373">I assure the Deputy that all reasonable and necessary arrangements are in place to ensure that universities exercise full compliance with all of the legislative and other requirements within which they operate on a daily basis.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1375">Since taking office, the promotion of quality in, and equitable access to, education including, in particular, higher education has consistently been identified as one of my key policy priorities. If we are to break cycles of disadvantage, open up opportunity and, indeed, optimise our broader economic and social potential we have to ensure the broadest possible level of participation in higher education. It is my over-riding objective that support has to be targeted at those who are most in need and at an appropriate level. This Government has ensured dedicated funding at an unprecedented level for third level access programmes. Such funding has increased from a base of €508,000 in 1997 to €26 million in the current year. This, together with targeted funding by the Higher Education Authority – over €6 million in 2002 – and to the institutes of technology, has enabled the implementation of many of the  key recommendations in the report of the action group on access to third level education to be set in train. I anticipate that the national office for equity of access will be in operation prior to the start of the 2003-04 academic year and that it will facilitate the aim of increasing third level access by the three target groups, students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability. I am committed to progressing the report's recommendations further.</p>
          <p eId="para_1376">I was pleased, therefore, to announce, on 25 May 2003, a new package of measures costing €42 million in a full year, and for which provision will be made in the Department's estimates for 2003 and 2004, to further address and ameliorate the problems facing students from low to moderate income households in accessing third level education. This package combines substantial improvements in the level and coverage of the maintenance grant for those on low to moderate incomes, with increases in the level of top-up grant for those who are most disadvantaged. The key elements of the package are as follows: increasing grant levels by 15%, benefiting, it is estimated, approximately 56,000 students; and extending the thresholds and increasing the gradations from €0 to €32,000 for full grant, €32,000 to €34,000 for 75% grant, €34,000 to €36,000 for half grant and €36,000 to €38,000 for 25% grant. An extra 5,000 students will qualify for a full maintenance grant. Overall, it is estimated that some 11,000 students will receive some benefit for the first time. The amount of the top-up grant will be increased to the maximum personal rate of unemployment assistance. It is estimated that in excess of 7,500 students will benefit. The threshold for the €670 student service charge will be extended from €36,897 to €40,000 to benefit some 4,000 students from households with moderate incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1377">This substantial package of measures will provide the opportunity, in an unprecedented manner, for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to achieve their full potential in the education system. I recognise that third level access is only one part of the picture in addressing educational disadvantage and that success in third level education must be built on a solid foundation of general education which fosters self-esteem, a love of learning and experience of success in learning. Early investment in measures to address disadvantage is critical to success. I am determined, therefore, to continue to invest substantially in primary and post-primary education, including learning supports, curricular reforms and teacher development. All of these investments are inter-related and contribute to addressing disadvantage and supporting access to a quality education system.</p>

          <p eId="para_1402">My Department's customer action plan 2001-04 gives a commitment to providing services through Irish to those who require such service and gives practical expression to the Government's commitment to deliver a quality service to Irish speakers made in Delivering Better Government. This has been reinforced by the proposed Official Languages Equality Bill 2002 being brought forward by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. My Department also complies with the recommended guidelines for public sector organisations 1999 in relation to providing web services on a basis which gives equal recognition to both the Irish and English languages. The Department's commitments to improve the level of service through Irish include: answering correspondence in the language in which it is written; making major publications issued since 1998 available bilingually; facilitating visitors and telephone callers, where possible, to conduct business through Irish; ensuring signage throughout the Department is bilingual; promoting and funding Irish language courses for staff; and ensuring that a record of staff with Irish language abilities is recorded on the Department's intranet.</p>
          <p eId="para_1403">The Irish language training needs of staff in the Department of the Taoiseach are predominantly met by the centre for management and organisation development, CMOD, which provides Irish courses for the public service – Gaeleagras na Seirbhíse Poiblí costs are met from the central budget. A number of staff have participated in a Gaeleagras scholarship scheme. In addition, a new diploma course in applied Irish – Dioplóma sa Ghaeilge Fheidhmeach – to be run by the Department of Modern Irish UCD from September –€700 per person – is being offered to staff. It is envisaged that 100% of these fees will be refunded to staff this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1404">The Department's integrated human resource strategy and staff development plan commits to considering any additional measures to ensure that the Department fully meets its obligations with regard to provision of services in the official languages.

        <summary eId="sum_152">The Central Statistics Office uses three separate sets of indices to monitor the trends in food prices. Each source of data is designed to measure a specific stage of the whole production process from farm through factory gate and on to the final consumer. The agricultural output price index monitors trends in prices paid to farmers for their produce. Monthly and annual indices are produced for the main livestock categories and agricultural products. The CSO publishes absolute monthly prices for selected products only. The wholesale price index, WPI, is designed to measure, in index form, the monthly changes in prices received by Irish manufacturers for goods  fully or partially produced in Ireland and sold to home or export markets. Some 41% of the food products produced in Ireland are sold to the home market, while the remaining 59% are destined for the export market. Monthly and annual indices are published for ten aggregated food categories. National average prices are not compiled within the wholesale price index.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_153">The consumer price index, CPI, is designed to measure, in index form, the monthly changes in the cost of purchasing a fixed representative basket of consumer goods and services by all private households in the country and by tourists on holiday within the territory of Ireland. Monthly and annual indices are published for 46 aggregated food categories. National average prices are compiled for 50 individual food items. The available absolute prices for agricultural products and food products purchased by the consumer are given in tables 1 and 2. In addition, index numbers for the three series are given in tables 3,4 and 5.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2217">In my role as head of Government, I have announced projects funded by other Departments. In respect of my Department, the eCabinet project was announced in February 2002. This project is funded through the Department of the Taoiseach from the Government's information society fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_2218">The overall estimated cost of the project at that time – as articulated in the feasibility study conducted by consultants PWC and published by my Department in February 2002 – amounted to a total of €6.76 million. This cost combines estimated centralised costs of €3.4 million, estimated departmental costs of €1.18 million, plus potential implementation management costs of €1 million and VAT amounted in total to approximately €6.7 million. The project is progressing well. Current cost projections would indicate actual delivery costs for the initiative in the region of €3.5 million to €4 million. This, if realised, would represent delivery of this flagship eGovernment initiative very substantially below original estimates. A more precise analysis and cost comparison will be made later this year when more of the actual implementation cost figures will be available.</p>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_188">The current round of multilateral trade negotiations, the Doha development agenda, was launched at the WTO Ministerial meeting in Qatar in November 2001. It was agreed then that the negotiations would be concluded by the end  of 2004 and that progress would be reviewed at the next WTO Ministerial meeting, which is scheduled for Cancún, Mexico, in September of this year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_189">The negotiations have been ongoing in Geneva for the past one and a half years. Progress has been slow and it has not been possible so far to meet a number of the deadlines set for the various phases of the negotiations. It is important, therefore, that the upcoming Cancún Ministerial meeting provides a political impetus as the time left for reaching agreement is relatively short.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_190">Ireland has participated in the negotiations as a member of the EU. Comprehensive co-ordination is necessary in order to fully reflect Irish interests in all EU proposals. My Department consults on an ongoing basis with other Departments, Government agencies, sectoral organisations, businesses and NGOs. In this regard, I met with representatives of the Trade Matters Group of NGO's on 9 April for a discussion on their trade justice submission on the Doha negotiations. I welcomed the very useful input to the consideration of these WTO issues during the lead in to Cancún. I undertook to have matters raised in the discussion taken into consideration. In addition, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business will be discussing these issues at its meeting of 11 June, at which my Department will be represented.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_191">The Irish priority has been, and is, to see the process of trade liberalisation continue in a fair and balanced way and the WTO continue to provide a stable and consistent framework for the regulation of world trade. Central to our approach, and that of the EU, is a commitment to respond positively in the negotiations to the concerns of the developing countries. This is an essential part of the Doha agenda and it is very clear that we will not have any agreement unless we can show clearly to the developing countries that they are being treated fairly.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_192">All of the various proposals put forward by the EU so far have reflected this and we support the continuation of this approach. This is important in terms of access to world markets for the exports of developing countries, special treatment for developing countries in the implementation of trade regulations and support for their full participation in the operation of the WTO.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2228">Following more than two years of negotiations, a comprehensive association agreement between the EU, the member states and Chile was formally signed on 18 November 2002. The  agreement comprises three main chapters: political dialogue, co-operation and trade. Respect for democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law are essential elements of the agreement. The promotion of sustainable economic and social development and the equitable distribution of the benefits of the association agreement are guiding principles for its implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_2229">The EU-Chile association agreement is a mixed competencies agreement. The bulk of the trade chapter, the institutional framework and the trade-related co-operation provisions of the agreement have been provisionally applied since 1 February 2003. The remaining provisions will enter into force once all of the 15 member states of the EU have ratified the agreement in accordance with their domestic procedures. The motion for Ireland to ratify the agreement was referred to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs on Tuesday, 27 May and the committee will report back by 17 June.</p>
          <p eId="para_2230">The elements of the agreement dealing with trade cover all aspects of trade relations. The FTA with Chile goes well beyond the respective WTO commitments, which has a high degree of trade liberalisation, which is underpinned by a set of strong and transparent rules. Trade with Chile in the year 2002 amounted to €73.781 including €36.645 in exports and €37.136 in imports.</p>

FÁS is also currently undertaking an internal review of CE and the job initiative programme, which is well advanced and should be finalised shortly. The outcome of these various initiatives, which I expect should be completed by the third quarter of 2003, will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future of these programmes.</p>

          <p eId="para_2262">The management of the IDA's industrial property portfolio, including policy and strategy in regard to location and cost of individual units, is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency as part of the statutory responsibility assigned to it by the Oireachtas for the attraction of foreign direct investment to the State and its regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_2263">While the IDA is not a commercial State company, the management of its property portfolio requires it to operate in a competitive environment where policy and strategies that are or have been pursued in regard to individual property units can have an enormous impact on its ability to carry out future negotiations and obtain value for the taxpayer. As such it is important that the agency be given freedom to carry out commercial transactions in accordance with its statutory remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_2264">The IDA owns 164 buildings throughout the country, of which 22 factory buildings are currently vacant and three are reserved for companies. The date of construction of these properties ranges from 1973 to 1985 with the exception of one factory, which was built in 1969. In addition, the IDA currently has a 35-year lease on a further 91 buildings. The date of construction of these properties ranges from 1980 to 1985. The IDA has entered into 35-year leases on these properties at an annual rental cost of €1,971,392. Some 28 of these leased factories are vacant, bringing the total number of IDA vacant factories to 50.</p>

Reports under the initiative will be published and I anticipate the report on the IDA's property portfolio to be available by early 2004.

          <p eId="para_2295">The issue of job creation is a day-to-day operational issue for the industrial development agencies under the remit of my Department and not one for which I, as Minister, have direct involvement. Only a small number of the jobs announced in any given year would normally be expected to be created within the same year, as there is usually a time lag between the announcement of new jobs and the creation of those jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_2296">Factors which influence this time lag are the time taken to locate and acquire a suitable site for the companies' operations, construct the facility and to install plant and machinery, in the case of manufacturing plants, and to recruit and train staff. It should also be noted that frequently the number of jobs quoted in announcements refer to the number of jobs which a company expects to create over a number of years. The main agencies under my Department's remit which deal with job creation are Enterprise Ireland in regard to the development of indigenous industry, IDA Ireland in regard to the attraction of inward investment and Shannon Development in the Shannon region.</p>
          <p eId="para_2297">In the full year 2002, some 26 IDA Ireland projects with 4,499 associated jobs were announced out of the 55 projects approved for support. By November 2002, the date of the Forfás annual employment survey, 205 of these jobs had been created in greenfield projects while total employment in companies where expansions were announced was 3,672. In all a total of 11,743 jobs were created in IDA Ireland supported companies that year. In 2003 to date, a total of 17 IDA Ireland projects have been announced with 3,346 associated jobs. Job creation figures 2003 will not be available until November 2003, the date of the next Forfás annual employment survey.</p>

For 2003, 300 jobs were announced by me in companies in the Enterprise Ireland  portfolio at the end of May 2003. In the three companies announced in 2002, 85 jobs have been created to date. While achievement of the job targets is slightly slower than expected, it is anticipated that the balance will be achieved on a longer timescale, between 2004 and 2005. The lower than expected results are primarily due to the economic downturn in the IT sector. As the jobs announcements for 2003 were only recently made in May 2003, it is too early to report on jobs created so far. The plants involved are at the set up phase and operations will commence only in 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_200">In the Shannon region, which comes under the aegis of Shannon Development, the total number of job announcements made by me in the period was 355, of which 185 have already been realised. All these jobs are to be phased in by January 2006 and it is anticipated that the balance will be achieved on time. It is quite clear that most of these job announcements are currently on target, if not ahead of schedule.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2309">An application for the individual concerned was received on 24 April 2003. It is policy to process work permit applications in the order in which they are received. Assuming the application is completed correctly and is otherwise in order it is likely to be processed within the next two weeks. The Department is now issuing work permits at a rate of approximately 1,000 per week.</p>

          <p eId="para_2311">IDA Ireland has statutory responsibility, assigned to it by the Oireachtas, for the attraction of foreign direct investment to the State and its regions. Negotiations on grants or on the management of IDA Ireland's industrial property portfolio is a day to day operational matter for the agency and not matters in which I have a function. IDA Ireland informs me that the company in question purchased plant, machinery and stock from the liquidator of a company called Abelcrest which formerly operated in Ballinrobe. It is understood that the purchase took place against a background whereby the company were considering a number of options including establishing a production facility at Ballinrobe, in eastern Europe, or consolidating production into its existing facility in Wales.</p>
          <p eId="para_2312">Upon receipt of an application for assistance from the company IDA Ireland formally expressed its willingness to purchase the factory in Ballinrobe and sell it to the company, thereby incurring a substantial loss. In addition, IDA Ireland offered grant assistance based on a number of commercial factors and limited planned capital investment by the company concerned. However, the company has since informed IDA Ireland that the project will now proceed at its existing facility in Wales.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_203">IDA Ireland advises me that it is firmly of the view that the level and type of assistance offered  is appropriate for the type of project proposed and it has no plans to alter their offer. IDA Ireland is fully conscious of the need to provide high value employment opportunities in communities and considers it has reacted to the proposal from the company in a positive and innovative manner in the best interest of all parties.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_204">While I am disappointed that it has not been possible to bring the negotiations with this company to a successful conclusion, it would not be appropriate for me to second guess the judgment of IDA Ireland in deciding the appropriate level of assistance warranted in the case of individual projects. The law sets out the responsibilities clearly. IDA Ireland evaluates proposals and decides how to negotiate to get value for the country. It has done so in this case, as in all others, and it is convinced that its negotiations stance is the most appropriate in view of the proposal.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2318">The Redundancy Payments Act 2003 was passed into law by the Oireachtas last month. Under the Act, I have made regulations, which place the onus on employers to pay the enhanced statutory redundancy rates to employees who have been given notice of redundancy on or after 25 May 2003. Unfortunately, on advice from the Office of the Attorney General, I would not be legally entitled to place a retrospective requirement on employers to backdate redundancy payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_2319">My Department's records concerning statutory redundancy payments show that 62 employees of the company concerned received notice of redundancy after 25 May and accordingly are entitled to the payment of the enhanced rates under the 2003 Act. The records also show that 128 of the employees received notice of redundancy on various dates prior to 25 May 2003. Unfortunately, these employees would not be entitled to payment of the enhanced rates, which are provided for under the 2003 Act.</p>

When, having regard to age, condition and mileage, vehicles are considered by military transport personnel to have reached the end of their economic life, they are proposed for disposal. Before the disposal action can be commenced, each vehicle requires examination and certification by a military board of survey. Following such examination and certification, the policy to date has been to dispose of the vehicles by scrapping. The issue of setting in train a procedure whereby all military vehicles are disposed of by public auction is being considered at present but due cognisance has to be given to the age, condition and mileage of the vehicles and their suitability for sale in that manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_2428">I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 and 231 together.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_218">As part of their 2002 area aid applications, a number of farmers increased their share of Coumaraglin Mountain without furnishing documentary evidence of their entitlement to the shares/rights declared while one included a share  of the mountain for the first time again without furnishing the required evidence. However, these applications were processed with some reductions so as to facilitate payment to all concerned. Of those farmers who claimed a share of Coumaraglin Mountain on their 2002 area aid application, two have not been paid area based compensation as they have not responded to correspondence issued from my Department requesting details of their stock in order to ensure that these two applicants meet the minimum stocking density requirement of 0.15 livestock units/hectare. Further letters have issued to the farmers concerned.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_219">As regards special beef premium, all payments have been made to those claiming land on Coumaraglin Mountain with the exception of one applicant who is awaiting the 20% balancing payment. This producer's area aid application requires further clarification. At the behest of local farmer representatives and the farm bodies, officials of my Department attended two public meetings in December 2002 and April 2003 to indicate to farmers the options that were available to them in relation to the division of Coumaraglin Mountain for the purposes of area related payments. At these meetings it was explained that the commonage concerned was owned by five landlords and that there were a number of categories of entitlement to graze the commonage,viz. those with vested rights arising from an appurtenant from nearby lowland lands who had documentary evidence of same and those with long-term grazing rights based on prescription. It was pointed out that, although this is a registered commonage with some herdowners having vested rights, there was no quantitative allocation of these rights. In other words, each right conferred the right to graze the entire commonage. Equally, those with long-term grazing rights had, similarly, the right to graze the entire commonage.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_220">The Deputy will be aware that in cases where commonage land is declared for the purposes of drawing down aid, one of the conditions of eligibility is the provision of documentary evidence of entitlement to the shares/rights declared. Applicants must state the share of commonage which they are entitled to claim and must ensure that the documentation submitted as proof of entitlement is adequate to support this claim. In circumstances where no valid documentary evidence exists, my Department is prepared to a accept a joint affidavit signed by all shareholders/grazing rightsholders setting out the total number of commonage shares/grazing rights; each shareholder's entitlement in the commonage; each grazing rightsholder's allocation of rights and the extent to which such rights may be exercised; and an undertaking that, if at any future date, a person other than the deponents or their successors establishes a valid claim to a share in the commonage/grazing rights, such person would be accommodated by a proportionate reduction in  the existing shares/grazing rights as set out in the affidavit. Any such affidavit must also state that it will not be used for purposes other than those for which it was prepared. It must also show that every reasonable effort was made to establish a definitive list of shareholders/grazing rights relative to the entire area to which the affidavit refers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_221">Officials from my Department pointed out that should all of the farmers agree to the division of Coumaraglin Mountain and submit the joint affidavit in the format already outlined above that this will facilitate the processing of their 2003 area based and rural environment protection scheme applications. There was consensus at the second public meeting that the herdowners would get together and submit a joint affidavit to my Department. As regards the rural environment protection scheme for 2002, there are seven applicants who are claiming land on Coumaraglin Mountain, payment cannot be considered in these cases as neither documentary evidence or a joint affidavit has been submitted in support of the claims.</summary>

Nov. was agreed in response to the threat posed by this new organism and its measures became operative on 1 November 2002. Phytophthora ramorum has been found in  Ireland on a number of occasions. It has also been found in at least nine other member states, including all of our main trading partners. All infected plants that have been found have been destroyed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_223">Host plants of the disease – plants of rhododendron and viburnum species – within two meters of infected plants have also been destroyed as required under EU legislation. In addition, host plants within ten meters of infected plants are required to be quarantined for three months. A survey for the organism is being carried out in all member states. The survey results are to be forwarded to the Commission by 1 November 2003 and the decision must be reviewed by 31 December this year at the latest.</summary>

Payment of his 80% advance instalment for €3,945.04, issued on 29 October 2002. When processing the application for balancing payment it was found that the four heifers had calved during the retention period. Under the terms and conditions of the scheme an applicant who has applied on 14 animals or more must continue to own, possess, hold, and maintain on his holding, during the six months retention period, a number of suckler cows at least equal to 60% and at most equal to 85%, and a number of heifers at least equal to 15% and at most equal to 40% of the total number of animals for which premium has been requested, or acceptable replacements for those animals. In order to maintain compliance with the 15% heifer ratio requirement it would be necessary to replace three of the heifers that calved. However, due to the industrial action by the clerical staff in the Galway office who are members of the CPSU, the inquiry into this matter has not yet been completed.</p>

          <p eId="para_2898">The milk quota restructuring scheme is now the main means by which milk quota is acquired by producers. New and recent entrants to dairying are among the priority categories for the allocation of quota. Details of the 2003-04 restructuring scheme were published in April. I decided that from the 2003-04 quota year a young person who forms a registered partnership with a parent may, provided certain conditions are satisfied, qualify for an allocation of quota as a new entrant farming in partnership. However, this provision applies only in the case of a person who does not hold, or has not previously held, a quota in his or her name. I understand that the person named was already a quota holder prior to the commencement of the 2003-04 quota year.</p>
          <p eId="para_2899">An existing quota holder, who is under the age of 35 years on 31 March, may apply to purchase quota under the recent entrant category. The total owned quota of such a recent entrant, following the allocation of additional quota from this priority category, must not exceed 200,000 litres.</p>

          <p eId="para_2903">The herd number system is an administrative arrangement under the disease eradication schemes and is designed primarily for the purposes of disease control. The criteria used in assessing applications for, and retention of, herd numbers principally include independent management of the holding, separate housing and fodder, the availability of adequate testing without the possibility of intermixing with cattle in any other herd. Where these criteria are not satisfied, herd numbers are not issued and/or are withdrawn. Central records are not maintained in respect of withdrawals of herd numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_2904">Specific provisions are included in the Animal Remedies Act 1993 and in the Diseases of Animals Act 2001 which provide for the disqualification of any person who is convicted on indictment of an offence under these Acts from keeping animals, dealing in or having charge or control, directly or indirectly, of either or both any animal, or class or classes of animal, for such period, including where appropriate, for the life of the person, as the court thinks fit.</p>
          <p eId="para_2905">Although these provisions have not been utilised to date, a few persons have undertaken to cease farming activities, in accordance with judgments laid down by the courts.</p>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_241">The full report on the River Tolka flooding study, which is being funded by the Office of Public Works, is being carried out by consultants employed by Dublin City Council as part of the greater Dublin strategic drainage study. The final report was, initially, expected to be completed in May. However, as the consultants were heavily involved in producing interim reports for the  three local authorities concerned – Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council, Meath County Council – and also preparing the design of the interim measures being undertaken, it was not possible to meet that deadline. The consultants have now provided a draft technical report which is being studied by the councils and the Office of Public Works. While that report is being studied, the consultants will complete a cost-benefit analysis on the recommended scheme and will also carry out an evaluation of the issues raised in third-party submissions. A draft final report is scheduled for completion before the end of July.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_242">As the Deputy will be aware, not all of the recommendations contained in the interim report on flood alleviation measures on the River Tolka were included in the proposed works, which Dublin City Council exhibited in January and February this year. That was due to the considerable time it would have taken to implement proposals requiring site investigations and detailed design as well as the environmental considerations involved. Dublin City Council and the Office of Public Works were also very mindful of the fact that the full report on the River Tolka catchment is due to be completed shortly, which should provide additional information on what further decisions can be made.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_243">The recommendations in the report dealing with Distillery Weir and Distillery Road Bridge were not included in the proposed works as exhibited by Dublin City Council and could not, therefore, have been included in the schedule of works as provided by the consultants. The construction of a combination of reinforced retaining walls and embankments at various areas along  Botanic Avenue is being carried out in accordance with instructions received from the council. The construction of all embankments in this area along the Tolka is designed to retain flood waters and is being completed in accordance with the specification provided.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_244">In the days following the flood of November 2002, the Office of Public Works was approached by Dublin City Council to carry out emergency works to ensure the stability of houses on Tolka Road. That work, and all associated reinstatement work, has now been completed in accordance with instructions received from the council.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_245">The removal of tree trunks from the river just below the Botanic Gardens was not contained in the proposed works as publicly exhibited and, therefore, did not form part of the schedule of interim works. Following discussions with Botanic Gardens personnel it is intended to remove that material when construction work is being completed in the immediate area later in the summer.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3478">The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill 2002, Committee Stage of which will be taken in the Dáil this week, provides the statutory basis for the establishment of the commission and sets out in broad terms the mandate which it will have to oversee and control the day to day running and funding of the organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_3479">As indicated in my response to Deputy Burton on 20 May 2003, the Bill, as proposed, provides for rights, including property rights, of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas, contracts and liabilities entered into on its behalf to transfer to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission on establishment day. That provision is a fairly standard one. This is essentially precautionary to ensure that should any such rights happen to exist, they will not be lost as a consequence following a statutory reconstitution.</p>

          <p eId="para_3527">Since the severe flooding from the River Tolka last November, the Office of Public Works has been working closely with the three local authorities concerned – Dublin City Council, Meath County Council and Fingal County Council – to introduce some measures which would lead to a reduction of the risk of flooding from the river. To that end, the consultants, conducting the full study on flooding on the River Tolka, were asked to produce interim reports for each of the local authorities concerned, outlining what measures could be undertaken this year to alleviate flooding in the worst affected areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_3528">As a result of those interim reports, work has been in progress in the Dublin City Council area since January this year, which the Office of Public Works is undertaking on behalf of the City Council. The Office of Public Works has also carried out emergency works in the Meath area, and the council placed a package of works on public display in April this year, which will be carried out this summer and autumn if approved by Meath councillors. Most of the work will be undertaken by the Office of Public Works on behalf of the council. Discussions have also taken place between officials of Fingal County Council and the Office of Public Works to identify works from the interim report which could be carried out in the Fingal area immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_3529">The Office of Public Works will continue to work with all three local authorities to bring the maximum benefit to the whole Tolka catchment from those interim measures. I am sure that the Deputy will be aware that the draft final report of the River Tolka study on the whole catchment will be completed in the next few weeks, which will provide additional information on which further decisions can be made regarding the entire catchment.</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_3535">In my budget speech last December I announced a number of increases in the stamp-duty charges on various financial products such as ATM cards, Laser cards, credit cards, cash cards and cheques. The stamp duty on ATM cards was increased from €6.25 to €10 per annum, and a duty of €10 per annum was introduced for Laser cards. The stamp duty on a combined ATM/Laser card was increased to €20, and the stamp duty on credit card accounts was increased from €19 to €40 per annum. There have been no increases in those charges for many years. ATM cards were last increased in 1996, and credit card accounts and charge cards have not seen an increase in their levy since 1992.</p>
          <p eId="para_3536">I believe those products are well established, and are very valued by their users for their various advantages. When stamp duty was first introduced on those cards, it was claimed that it would stop people using them. However, there was a big increase in the numbers of such cards over the years and, since 1991, the combined number of ATM, credit, charge and Laser cards has trebled.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_247">I do not see such increases in stamp duty as preventing Ireland's adoption of electronic payment systems. Neither do I believe that something should not be subject to increases in tax over time simply because it is new technology. It is not anti-technology to tax products with a technological aspect, anymore than it is anti-work to tax wages or anti-industry to tax profits. I am satisfied that those increases will not have a significant effect on use of those products, but that they will raise substantial revenue. It makes sense that, at a time when we need to increase tax yield,  we increase such charges to broaden the tax base.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_248">Stamp duty is a significant contributor to the Exchequer and helps fund public services while keeping the direct tax burden low, thereby facilitating continued economic success. The changes are estimated to yield a total of about €52 million in a full year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_249">I do not have proposals to pay all State payments by electronic means only: the State sector consists of a wide variety of public bodies, which issue payments for many different purposes to large numbers of people and organisations. However, I support greater use of electronic payment methods by the State sector: there is already significant use of such methods, and developments are in train to increase it.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_3540">As the Deputy is aware, in the 1998 budget I introduced a system of capital allowances for expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of nursing homes that are registered with a health board. The purpose of that measure is to encourage investment in increased nursing home capacity and in improved facilities for the elderly and incapacitated, for which there is a growing demand. In the Finance Act 2002 I extended the scope of that relief by providing capital allowances for expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of housing units associated with a registered nursing home. That scheme acts as an incentive for the provision of suitable residential accommodation in caring for elderly persons who are no longer able to live alone without some level of care but  who do not as yet need to transfer to full nursing home residence.</p>
          <p eId="para_3541">I understand that, under the normal self-assessment rules, any person seeking to claim capital allowances in respect of a qualifying building would submit their claim on the appropriate tax return form. However, the form does not distinguish between capital allowances claimed in respect of nursing homes and on private convalescent facilities from those claimed in respect of other buildings entitled to capital allowances. Consequently, it is not possible for the Revenue to indicate the level of take-up of that specific incentive. I would like to assure the Deputy that all tax reliefs and incentives are kept under review, especially in the context of the budget and Finance Bill, to ensure that they continue to fulfil the objective or objectives for which they were introduced.</p>

Individuals are entitled to relief at their marginal rate of tax. However, it should be noted that under the schemes involving the capital allowances on buildings there is, since the 1998 budget, an upper limit of €31,750 which can be offset against the individual's non-rental income in a year of assessment.

          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_3579">Generally, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners is the main source of information, statistics and data on tax incentives and expenditures. The Revenue's primary function is firmly centred around the administration of the tax system and the collection of tax. The collection of statistical information flows from that primary function.</p>
          <p eId="para_3580">The simplification of the returns to be made by taxpayers has meant that the details of some tax reliefs are required in aggregate form on tax returns. The result is that total costs of the individual reliefs concerned cannot be readily identified. For example, capital allowances are treated in this way. Where information regarding individual reliefs is provided separately on tax returns form it can be captured electronically and may be examined centrally by the Revenue. An example is the data relating to the artists' exemption, where virtually all the information relating to numbers of claimants and the amounts exempted from tax can be obtained.</p>
          <p eId="para_3581">Information relating to claims for reliefs held in paper formats appended to tax returns cannot be extracted without undertaking a manual search on a case-by-case basis. The list of reliefs referred to by the Deputy in the 2001 Revenue statistical report largely falls under that heading.</p>
          <p eId="para_3582">I do not believe that reverting to the lengthy return of income forms, separately listing every relief, would be acceptable to compliant taxpayers or that it would be consistent with the efficient administration of the tax system and collection of tax to impose such an additional burden of compliance on them. While a detailed manual survey into individual reliefs is not normally possible given resource constraints, the Revenue nevertheless provides a significant body of information on tax reliefs, particularly where the information is identified separately on tax returns.</p>
          <p eId="para_3583">However, it is important that data be improved to facilitate assessments of such expenditures and reliefs. The Department of Finance is working closely with the Revenue Commissioners to investigate information and data-capture issues arising with a view to producing possible solutions. The challenge is twofold: the first is to identify the optimal manner of obtaining the information that is required to monitor and cost existing reliefs, and the second is to obtain such information with due regard not to overburden compliant taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_3584">I also point out that some changes have already been made in that area. As mentioned above, regarding the artists' exemption, considerable information is now available on some reliefs. More recently, as the Deputy will be aware, I stipulated in the Finance Act 2003 that returns of income must henceforth be made for stallion stud fees and commercially managed woodlands.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_256">Finally, I should mention that detailed reviews of the costs and benefits of various tax reliefs are  carried out from time to time. Recent examples are the reviews carried out on tax reliefs for urban renewal, films and the business expansion scheme.</summary>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_257">The issue of the Tobin tax has been considered in a number of fora, including the informal ECOFIN meeting at Liege on 22 September 2001. The Belgian Presidency indicated that it wished to pursue the matter in the context of a general study to be carried out by the EU Commission on the issue of globalisation. However, it would be fair to say that most Finance Ministers, myself included, continue to have reservations about the Tobin tax proposal, and believed that it was not  clear that a further examination of the issue by the Commission would ensure that satisfactory answers would be given to the many real questions concerning the tax including: the difficulties relating to practical implementation of the tax; its doubtful effect on short-term speculative capital movements; its conflict with the basic tenet of free capital movement in the EU; its disproportionate effect on small business and consumers; the probability that the tax would simply drive participants into other non-taxable alternatives; and the negative impact on liquidity in the foreign exchange market.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_258">Nevertheless, at a formal ECOFIN meeting on 16 October 2001, it was agreed that the Commission would carry out a study on globalisation and that the study would examine the arguments for and against a Tobin tax. That study, Responses to the Challenges of Globalisation, was published on 14 February 2002. On the matter of the Tobin tax, the study concluded that, "while as a source of additional revenue a currency transaction tax may look appealing, its feasibility is, however, not demonstrated".</summary>

          <p eId="para_3593">However, the question of the provision of tax relief for remedial education programmes which might be recommended arising from such assessments raises issues which go beyond the provision of tax relief for medical expenses.

In this regard, I point out to the Deputy that in the current year, direct provision for those with special education needs through the Department of Education and Science alone is likely to amount to almost €350 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_3613">The UN Office on Drugs and Crime, UNODC, based in Vienna, which conducts annual opium production surveys, recorded that during the 1990s Afghanistan had become the largest source of illicit opium and of its derivative, heroin, in the world. By 1999, Afghanistan accounted for approximately 70% of global illicit opium production, or 4,600 tonnes. In its last year in power, 2001, the Taliban imposed a ban on production – enforced by that totalitarian regime's characteristic methods of draconian repression – which caused production to plummet to 185 tonnes for that year.</p>
          <p eId="para_3614">The resulting depletion of supply caused a sharp rise in prices, coinciding with the removal of the Taliban from power, thus providing both an incentive and an opportunity for the planting of the poppy plant during the immediate post-Taliban power vacuum. According to the UNODC, by the time the newly established Afghan Interim Authority was in a position in January 2002 to issue its own strong ban on opium cultivation, processing, trafficking and consumption, most opium poppy fields had already begun to sprout.</p>
          <p eId="para_3615">In April 2002, the Afghan Interim Authority launched an eradication campaign. However, its efforts could not prevent opium production from rising to approximately 3,400 tonnes for the year 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_3616">President Karzai has rightly declared the continuing existence of an opium-based economy to be a matter of concern in regard to national security. It is also a matter of international security in the broadest sense of the term. The UNODC is mobilised to work with the Afghan administration, other UN agencies and donor countries, to address the broad issue of drugs and crime in Afghanistan through the implementation of a comprehensive strategy. The strategy involves five main sectors: (i) policy support, legislation and advocacy, (ii) drug law enforcement; (iii) mainstreaming drug control in development assistance, (iv) drug demand reduction, and (v) monitoring and assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_3617">Ireland has supported the global efforts of the UNODC in 2002 and 2003 through annual voluntary financial contributions of €500,000. Funding was specifically earmarked by Ireland in both years for projects in Afghanistan. In 2002, Ireland made a contribution of US$117,000 to a programme for a drug demand reduction information advice and training service for Afghanistan. We are committed to funding a larger project on capacity building for drug demand reduction in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_3618">Under the Action Plan on Drugs 2000-2004, the EU is engaged with the provision of a wide range of technical assistance to Afghanistan, including anti-production and anti-consumption schemes and support for alternative livelihoods in poppy producing areas, as well as complementary programmes aimed, for example, at reinforcing customs and border controls in the region.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_265">The action plan also aims to complete the assessment of the scale and nature of drug abuse  in Afghanistan and to establish appropriate prevention and treatment systems, as well as the conduct of a drugs awareness campaign including among particularly vulnerable groups such as refugees and internally displaced people.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_266">Regarding the general medical crisis in Afghanistan, the effects of many years of conflict, drought, and impoverishment continue to be felt by millions of people in Afghanistan. Social service infrastructure and basic health facilities are very fragile. As a result, child and maternal mortality rates in Afghanistan are among the highest in the world.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_267">Support for the primary health care sector and for sanitation and water supply are included in the Irish Government's commitment since 2002 of more than €10 million in bilateral development assistance for the people of Afghanistan.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_268">As a result of the efforts of the international community, including the EU, working with the transitional authority, some considerable improvement in the overall humanitarian and health situation has been reported in recent months. Comprehensive health interventions have brought Afghanistan close to polio eradication; rehabilitation of health facilities is under way in much of the country; and over two million refugees and displaced people have returned to their communities of origin.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_269">Together with our EU partners, Ireland will continue to support the international community's commitment to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan as a stable and peaceful democracy.</summary>

The 14 members of the committee met in February 2001 and during the following 12 months consulted widely with key development actors and stakeholders, in particular Irish NGOs, missionaries and the wider public. The committee conducted an in-depth analysis of the Ireland Aid programme and examined a wide range of policy options for the future. The work of the committee was presented in a report in February 2002 and the recommendations contained therein were approved by Government in March 2002. No payment or fees were made to any committee member. Certain travel costs in relation to two field trips and the travel costs of two committee members to attend meetings in Dublin were incurred.

I understand that she has since been brought back to the Rangoon area and is now in custody. Her exact whereabouts are still unknown, and no visits have been allowed.

Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way, or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route.

          <p eId="para_3665">The student support unit of my Department issues, annually, a copy of the information booklet Financial Support for Further &amp; Higher Education to the guidance counsellors in all second level schools. Information on all aspects of financial support is also available on my Department's website.</p>

The purpose of these information sessions is to make students aware of the assistance that is available to them, for further or higher education, and the process involved in applying for grants under my Department's student support schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_3667">I was pleased to announce on 25 May, 2003 a new package of measures costing €42 million in a full year to further address and ameliorate the problems facing students from low to moderate income households in accessing third-level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_3668">This package combines substantial improvements in the level and coverage of the maintenance grant for those on low to moderate incomes, with increases in the level of top-up grant for those who are most disadvantaged.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_290">In addition to the above named measures specifically designed to broaden access to third level education, I have also allocated more than €133 million on measures at pre-school, primary and post primary level which provide additional financial and teaching resources for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, thereby encouraging their continued participation in formal schooling and increasing their chances of progressing to third level education. This includes provision in the following areas: €7 million for pre-school programmes such as the Early Start pilot project  which caters for pupils aged three to four years who are most at risk in areas of social disadvantage; over €70 million for disadvantaged programmes at primary level such as the disadvantaged areas scheme, home school liaison scheme, and the Giving Children an Even Break programme; €33 million for post primary level disadvantaged schemes such as the disadvantaged areas scheme and home school community liaison scheme; and €23 million for the school completion programme in 2003 which encompasses primary and post primary level and is a key component of my Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_291">In 2002, my Department introduced the school completion programme or SCP, which is a new and significantly expanded programme to deal with early school leaving incorporating the learning, experience and best practice derived from previous early school leaving initiatives and assimilates the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative, or ESLI, and stay-in-school retention initiative at second level or SSRI.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_292">The objective of the school completion programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education. Evidence generated from the pilot phases of the school completion programme shows that the most effective way of addressing educational disadvantage is through an integrated approach involving primary and post primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_293">The 82 school completion project sites were selected to participate in the school completion programme in 2002. There are six SCP clusters operational in Tallaght: Brookfield/Fettercairn, Old Bawn, east Tallaght/Balrothery, Dublin 24/St. Mark's, Killinarden, and Jobstown.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_294">My Department also grant-aids two third level access projects which serve second level schools in the Tallaght area: the Trinity access project and the Tallaght access programme or ACE. There is one access project in the Clondalkin, Dublin west area, the Clondalkin higher education access project.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3691">I am aware of the case referred to by Deputy. The child in question is three years of age and my Department sanctioned ten hours per week home tuition on 30 April 2003. The home tuition scheme is intended to cater for children who are unable to attend school on a regular basis because of a grave medical ailment. It may also be provided for children who are awaiting an appropriate educational placement. The responsibility for procuring the tutor rests with the parent-guardian and my Department plays no part in this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_3692">All children of school going age with special education needs within the primary school system, including children with autistic spectrum disorders, ASD, have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. The special educational needs of children with ASD can be addressed in special dedicated schools, in special dedicated classes attached to ordinary schools, or on an integrated basis in ordinary schools. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each case are based on the professionally-assessed needs of the individual child. Many children at primary school level with disorders on the autistic spectrum are capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of resource teachers and or special needs assistants.</p>
          <p eId="para_3693">Where the level of the condition is of a more serious nature provision is made by way of special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools. All such facilities receive enhanced capitation grants and operate at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 6:1. Special needs assistant support is also provided, where required. There are currently 115 such classes for pupils with autism in the primary system. This includes three special classes for children with Asperger's syndrome, which is on the autistic spectrum.</p>
          <p eId="para_3694">There are seven facilities in the State using alternative educational methods for teaching children on the autistic spectrum. A decision on the future of these pilot projects will be taken in light of a valuation of provision for children with ASD currently being carried out by my Department's inspectorate. The evaluation process will also include educational services for children with autism in other settings such as special schools, special classes and in mainstream schools. It is envisaged that this process will be completed later this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_3711">The statistical information sought by the Deputy is not readily available. The most recent figures on attrition rates for third level are the result of research carried out at the request of my Department by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, at St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, Dublin. The ERC published quantitative surveys of non-completion rates in undergraduate courses in institutes of technology in 2000 and in universities in 2001. It should be noted, however, that there were differences between fields of study in both surveys with subject areas such as computing, engineering and science showing higher non-completion rates than business studies and the humanities.</p>
          <p eId="para_3712">The following table published by the ERC outlines non-completion rates over a four year period for first-time entrants to 11 institutes of technology in the academic year 1995-96. The Dublin Institute of Technology also conducted a similar study for the 1994 cohort of full-time first year students and its results are outlined as follows.</p>

The Higher Education Authority has for a number of years provided dedicated funding to the universities and other Higher Education Authority designated institutions to support new developments in areas of strategic importance in higher education. One particular priority area is that of broadening access to the universities and Higher Education Authority institutions for students from traditionally under-represented groups. These include students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and Travellers. In 2002, the Higher Education Authority provided over €6 million to support institutions in initiatives aimed at providing for such broadened access.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_3823">I propose to take Questions Nos. 349, to 354, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_3824">I am satisfied that the appeal committees, which hear and determine appeals under section 29 of the Education Act 1998, do so in an independent, impartial, fair and reasonable manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_3825">Appeals under section 29 of the Act are processed in three stages. The first stage allows time for a local resolution to emerge. The second stage involves the appointment of an independent facilitator. The facilitator seeks to resolve the issue underlying the appeal to the satisfaction of both parties. Appeals which are not resolved at the local or facilitation stages progress to a full hearing before an appeal committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_3826">A separate and distinct committee is appointed to hear each appeal. The committee members are drawn from a panel of experienced educationalists, many of whom are ex-school principals. These people bring a wealth of in-school experience and perspective to their task. Only one of the three appeal committee members is an official of my Department. Under section 29(2) of the Education Act 1998, each committee shall include in its membership an inspector. I do not accept the suggestion that the involvement of an inspector on a committee represents a conflict of interest between a child's right to an education and a school's responsibility for the health and safety of the entire school population. I am satisfied that all appeal committee members have the requisite expertise, experience and independence to serve on the committees.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_311">Each appeal is unique and is determined according to its particular circumstances. An appeal hearing is determined by the committee in the light of all the facts presented to it, including the views of any persons called by it to the hearing, and having due regard to: the established practices within the school for dealing with issues or grievances which are the subject matter of the appeal, including, where relevant and available, any statutory or non-statutory procedures, guidelines, regulations or other provisions in operation at any time; the educational interests of the student who is the subject of the appeal; the educational interests of all other students in the school; the effective operation and management of the school; any resource implications arising from the issues under appeal; where relevant, the policy of the patrons and the board of management in respect of the characteristic ethos of the school; and such other matters as the committee considers relevant.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_312">My Department has provided each member of the appeal committee panel with a briefing note. I have asked my officials to forward a copy of this briefing note to the Deputy. To date, 164 appeals under section 29 have been dealt with. Of these, 43 were withdrawn, seven were resolved at local resolution stage and 50 were resolved at facilitation. Of the 64 appeals which have proceeded to a full hearing by committee, 38 were upheld in favour of the appellant and 26 were not upheld. A high number of appeals are resolved at the facilitation stage to the satisfaction of both parties. Many of the facilitators also serve as appeal committee members.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_313">With regard to the question of resources it is the responsibility of school authorities to apply to my Department for the resources necessary for the continued education of any pupil. While an appeal committee may in the case of an appeal which is upheld, make recommendations to the Secretary General this does not in any way absolve the school of its responsibility in this regard. It is not the function of the appeal process to determine the type or level of resources that may be required by a pupil.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_314">The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, is available to all post-primary schools recognised by my Department. It can advise on the management of any difficulties which pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate, it can also advise on any educational supports which that be required to ensure that a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_315">I have no plans at present to amend section 29 of the Education Act. However, officials in my Department are conducting an administrative review of the procedures for hearing appeals under section 29 of the Act. As part of this review, my officials will shortly be inviting all of the education partners to submit their observations on the operation of the appeals. If the Deputy has received representations from  interested parties I urge him to forward these to the section 29 appeals administration unit of my Department so that they can be taken account of in the review.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3909">Having given careful consideration to the matter, I decided in April 2003 that the national centre as proposed should not proceed, having regard to the low and declining pupil numbers in the schools for the visually impaired and the development costs, estimated to be in excess of €30 million. However, my Department is willing to explore with the school authorities concerned how aspects of the proposed centre, including provision for children with additional disabilities, could be developed, in the context of available resources.</p>

In doing this, they are required to ensure that the welfare and educational needs of pupils take precedence over all other considerations.

Special consideration is given by boards before approving job-sharing for junior infant classes or special needs pupils.</p>

It also provides for the use of the combined talents of both teachers as well as assigning responsibility. Boards of management must be satisfied that the plean oibre adequately addresses all of the key issues and must also ensure that the job-sharing teachers agree to frequent out-of-school meetings to discuss their work. Boards of management are required to advise parents of the job sharing arrangement at the earliest opportunity by way of a special meeting.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_771">
          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_3957">Education has a crucial role to play in tackling social exclusion by providing full access to life chances and avoiding and breaking the cycle of disadvantage. Since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science, I have made it clear, at every opportunity, that addressing educational disadvantage is my top priority. It is my intention to ensure that available educational resources are targeted at the most disadvantaged people in the education system at all levels.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_331">My overall approach to tackling educational disadvantage is set in the context of the Government's national anti – poverty strategy, NAPS, and the latest partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. Education is a central element of the NAPS, which includes three headline targets for  education focussing on reducing early school leaving, and improving literacy levels in schools and in the adult population. The NAPS approach for education is based on a continuum of provision, from early childhood through adulthood, with the focus on preventive strategies, targeting and integrated community responses. These are designed to bring about an education system that allows all our citizens to realise their full potential.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_332">I have provided in excess of €455 million in 2003 for measures designed to counter educational disadvantage by targeting resources at pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. This includes provision in the following areas: a sum of €7 million for pre-school programmes such as the early start pilot project which caters for pupils aged three to four years who are most at risk in areas of social disadvantage; over €70 million for disadvantaged programmes at primary level such as the disadvantaged areas scheme, the home school liaison scheme, and the Giving Children an Even Break programme; a sum of €33 million for post primary level disadvantaged schemes such as the disadvantaged areas scheme, and the home school community liaison scheme; a sum of €23 million for the school completion programme in 2003 which operates at primary and post primary level and is a key component of my Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving; a sum of €12 million for disadvantaged youth schemes; a sum of €152 million for further education measures such as the back to education initiative, the Youthreach programme, and the adult literacy programme; and a sum of €158 million for measures specifically designed to broaden access to third level education for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_333">In all this work I am advised by the statutory educational disadvantage committee set up under the Education Act 1998 to advise on the policies and strategies to be adopted to identify and correct educational disadvantage. This committee, chaired by Dr. Áine Hyland, brings together experts from across the community of education interests and is a very important resource for me in ensuring that real progress is made in this area.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3973">The information regarding the amount of money spent by my Department that is allocated to private schools is being compiled and will be forwarded directly to the Deputy. The payment of teachers' salaries is part of a complex scheme of funding for fee-charging schools, which has traditionally sought to balance considerations of equity, pragmatism and State support for minority religions. Teachers in fee-charging schools, irrespective of the denominational ethos of the school, are paid by the State. This may well reflect a long standing pragmatism that the State would be required to provide teachers for the pupils in question were they located within the free education scheme.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_334">There are 58 fee-charging second level schools in the country, of which 21 are Protestant. The latter schools receive funding by way of the Protestant block grant, which has its origins in the desire of the State to enable students of the Protestant persuasion to attend schools, which reflect their denominational ethos. The block grant includes payments in respect of capitation and these schools also qualify for payment of such grants as the transition year support grant and  secretarial and caretaking grants. Fee-charging schools not embraced by the Protestant block grant do not qualify for payment of capitation or related supports.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_335">I have no plans, at this stage, to withdraw State support for the payment of teachers in fee-charging schools. This support has been a long standing feature of our education system and one continued by successive Governments.</summary>

A grant for the same amount, €39,800, issued to Educate Together in respect of 2003 in May. In regard to the accommodation difficulties facing Donabate-Portrane Educate Together national school, the Deputy may be aware that the board of management made a proposal to my Department, which would involve the lease or purchase of a site reserved for educational purposes, from Fingal County Council in order to house the school in temporary accommodation on the site.</p>
          <p eId="para_3977">The school was granted provisional recognition in September 2002.

Another group of up to 15 psychologists is due to join NEPS in September 2003. The recruitment of additional psychologists will be undertaken, as resources permit. Schools that do not yet have direct access to a full educational psychological service can avail of the scheme for commissioning private assessments which NEPS administers, pending the full expansion of the NEPS service to all schools.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3989">In order to ensure the long-term planning of capital provision through a precise and detailed identification of accommodation needs in schools, my Department has undertaken, on a pilot basis, a comprehensive inventory of accommodation of 115 primary and post-primary schools in County Kildare. The information gained from the survey has been placed on a geographic information system, GIS, database. My Department is at present undertaking a detailed assessment of the pilot phase of the inventory to determine the exact nature and extent of the nationwide survey, having regard to available resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_3990">In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, it is the responsibility of school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. Schools are obliged to identify possible hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate safeguards in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_3991">Individual school authorities are responsible, in the first instance, for ensuring the safety and welfare of children and others in their care. Primary schools are given an annual allocation of €3,809 plus €12.70 per pupil under the grant scheme for minor works which can be used entirely at the discretion of school management to address basic health and safety issues relating to the school infrastructure. In addition, my Department has recently published the allocations to date from the contingency sum of €10.7 million in the 2003 programme to deal with emergency works, including emergency health and safety works, in primary and post-primary schools.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_3994">I propose to take Questions Nos. 408 and 411 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_3995">The Government is determined to consolidate the substantial progress that has already been made in order to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time. This year the school building programme amounts to €342.9 million. The 2003 programme will deliver over 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition several hundred schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme and of course all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</p>
          <p eId="para_3996">I have also introduced two new initiatives at primary level. First, I have put in place a pilot initiative that is aimed at devolving responsibility for the planning and construction phases of improvement works to school authorities. Specifically, the initiative is focused on small and mostly rural primary schools where the enrolment profile is stable. Twenty primary schools were invited to participate in the pilot phase of the initiative, which will be reviewed at the end of 2003 with a view to its expansion, subject to the availability of funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_3997">Second, I am endeavouring to reduce the level of temporary accommodation being provided. The new pilot initiative funds schools to respond quickly to accommodation difficulties. There is minimal interaction with my Department and the school is fully empowered to drive the design and construction processes. I fully expect that this initiative will inform future policy and that the scheme will be expanded to include more schools in future years.</p>
          <p eId="para_3998">The recent update of the school building programme sets out the most urgent of the additional temporary accommodation projects that are being funded in 2003. I am pleased to advise the House that, in line with the concept outlined in An Agreed Programme for Government for a multi-annual programme schools' modernisation fund, I am in ongoing discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to secure a four to five-year funding envelope for the schools' building programme.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_340">The Government remains committed to continuing the work that it has started and to consolidate the substantial progress that has already  been made in order to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time. The process of investment in educational infrastructure begun by the previous Government will be continued as outlined in the agreed programme for Government.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4009">In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide targeted improvements in the education sector within the limitations of resource availability. Teacher allocations to individual schools are based on nationally applicable criteria which reflect the prevailing ratios and ex-quota allocations which have reqard to the needs of schools.

I have also established independent appeal boards to consider appeals under specified criteria from individual school authorities in regard to teacher allocations. A breakdown of prevailing pupil-teacher ratios on a county basis is not readily available in my Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_4067">On the question of health, no national or international health advisory authority has declared or even suggested that the radio signals from phone mast antennae are a hazard to health. The World Health Organisation, WHO, states explicitly in its phone mast fact sheet No. 193 that radio frequency fields around such masts are not considered a health risk. This view is supported by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, ICNIRP, and by the European Union Council of Health Ministers in their recommendation of July 1999 concerning limiting public exposure to electromagnetic fields. Individual countries who have issued statements in recent years reassuring their populations of the absence of health risks from phone masts include Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_4068">To further reassure the Tallaght residents who are concerned about their exposure to phone masts I will arrange, if required by the residents, that the national survey of public exposure to phone mast radio emissions, which is now being commenced by the Commission for Communications Regulation, will include measurements in their area. This should demonstrate whether actual exposures are typically thousands of times less than the exposure levels recommended as safe by expert organisations.</p>

          <p eId="para_4078">I propose to take Questions Nos. 437 to 441, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_4079">These questions relate to a specific afforestation project in the Coolea area of County Cork. Approval for the project issued in January 2003 having followed the appropriate pre-planting approval procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_4080">There were no recorded archaeological sites on the land in question. However, I understand that during the planting of the site some unrecorded archaeology was discovered. As soon as the forest service was notified its own archaeologist immediately undertook an archaeological examination of the site. The results of that examination were subsequently notified to Dúchas, which is satisfied that the correct protocol for such cases was followed. Furthermore the forest service has instructed the contracting forestry company to ensure that there is an archaeologist on site during any further cultivation of the site and to ensure that the afforestation is established in accordance with the forest service forestry and archaeology guidelines and the recommendations of Dúchas.</p>
          <p eId="para_4081">The forest service is satisfied that the site in question is capable of producing a commercial crop of timber and that the development is compatible with the protection of the environment. In addition, the requirements for grant approval include the condition that the rights or encumbrances enjoyed by others, for example, turbary rights, must be relinquished. It is not necessary for the applicant to place public signs to this effect. However, formal proof in this regard is required before payment of any grant can be authorised. It is a condition of qualification for the farmer rate of premium that the applicant resides on a permanent basis within 70 miles of the forest plantation. No application for premium payment in the case in question has been received to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_4082">The forest service is conscious of the cumulative effects of forestry in specific areas. Current arrangements provide for environmental impact assessments where considered appropriate and this issue is also being addressed in the context of the formulation by the forest service of indicative forest strategies.</p>

          <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_4085">The provision of passenger ferry services to islands is a matter in the first instance for the Department for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. My Department is responsible for licensing and certifying vessels as safe for use on such services. Earlier this year the maritime safety directorate MSD of my Department reviewed its decision not to allow transhipment to continue in Doolin after 2002. Transhipment of passengers to a larger boat using small boats has traditionally been a feature of ferry operations in Doolin, where very low tides prevented the larger vessels berthing alongside the pier. The decision not to allow transhipment to continue was made for safety reasons and was flagged to the operators over many years. The Department informed the main operator from Doolin to the Aran Islands, Doolin Ferries, in June 1999 that transhipment arrangements would have to cease in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_4086">Following its review of transhipment arrangements the MSD has decided that it will consider applications for transhipment subject to a number of conditions: a safety case/submission to be made by operators to the MSD indicating the hazards, risks and the management of these; a marine surveyor from the MSD to witness a demonstration of the transhipment operation and to be satisfied in regard to safety arrangements; insurance cover for the transhipment operation is to be in place; transhipment to be considered for a trial pilot period, during which monthly reports on the operation of the scheme will be submitted to the MSD and unscheduled inspections will be carried out by MSD personnel of the transhipment operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_4087">Following the review the MSD has been in contact with known interested operators in the area. To date an application from one operator in the Doolin area for transhipment operations has been received. On foot of this proposal a temporary licence to 13 June 2003 has been granted to this operator pending further submissions and completion of the assessment of the operators proposals by the MSD.</p>

          <p eId="para_4094">The 2002 draft accounts for the fishery harbour centres fund show an operating deficit of €544,990 and an aggregate deficit of €1.2 million. Without a significant increase in income the deficit will increase rapidly as staff and other operating costs increase. I should point out also that the Exchequer meets totally the capital costs of developing the harbours through the national fishery harbour development programme and is providing €28 million in 2003 for those purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_4095">Proposed new charges at fishery harbour centres were published on 21 May 2003, with the statutory consultation period of 21 days provided for until midnight on 10 June 2003. As that consultation period has not expired it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time. I will of course carefully consider the outcome of that consultation before making my decision.</p>

          <p eId="para_4104">Dublin Port Company claims ownership of certain areas of foreshore in Dublin Bay, including the area in which the company proposes to reclaim some 21 hectares. The company has, at my Department's request, furnished evidence of ownership of this foreshore. This information is being examined for my Department by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. If it is confirmed that the foreshore in question is owned by the Port Company, the proposed reclamation would fall to be considered in accordance with section 10, as amended, of the Foreshore Act 1933. Reclamation of State-owned foreshore requires authorisation by way of a foreshore lease granted under section 2 of that Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_4105">Approval under section 10 of the 1933 Act may not be refused unless the proposed development would be or would cause or be likely to cause an obstruction to navigation or to fishing, or would have or be likely to have significant adverse effects on the environment. Planning permission will also be required for the proposed reclamation.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_347">Wild seed mussels are a natural resource fished on an annual basis by the bottom mussel growing sector for the purpose of on-growing within aquaculture sites. Such a resource requires effective management in order to maximise the potential return to the sector. In view of increased pressure on the resource in recent years, a review of the management arrangements applying to wild seed mussel stocks within the jurisdictions of Ireland and Northern Ireland was carried out earlier this year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_348">Following the review by my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Northern Ireland, DARD, in consultation with government bodies and the bottom mussel industry, more formalised management arrangements have now been put in place for Irish and Northern Ireland vessels wishing to prosecute the fishery. This involves a revised application and assessment process. Applications will be assessed by a committee comprising my Department, DARD, the Loughs Agency, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the cross-Border aquaculture initiative team under a number of criteria and approved vessels will be licensed to fish maximum quantities within a specific area over a specific time period. Skippers may land only into designated ports and will be required to complete logbook data relating to fishing activity.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_349">Approximately 70 applications have been received to date. As in recent years, demand far exceeds projected seed supplies. It is expected that decisions on applications will be available within two weeks.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4294">Under the local authority swimming pool programme, capital grants of up to €3.8 million are available towards the refurbishment of existing pools or the provision of new pools. My Department has no role, however, in respect of the day to day running of such pools. This is a matter for the local authority in whose administrative area the pool is located.</p>
          <p eId="para_4295">Local authorities must have regard to the procedures for the planning, approval and financing of swimming pools and technical guidelines. Since 1986, these guidelines have provided that chlorine disinfection should not be installed in new pools. In the case of older pools, where gaseous chlorine disinfection is used, the guidelines set out recommended specific technical standards to ensure safe bathing conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_4296">I will have the recent reports examined by the relevant technical authorities to see if the guidelines need amendment in this area.</p>

In its report, presented in March 2001, the group recommended the enhancement and expansion of the overall child and adolescent psychiatric service as the most effective means of providing the required service for children with this condition.</p>
          <p eId="para_4345">The group found that the internationally acknowledged best practice for the provision of child and adolescent psychiatric services is through the multidisciplinary team. In 2002 additional revenue funding of €6.061 million was allocated to provide for the appointment of additional consultants, for the enhancement of existing consultant led multidisciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. A further €1.64 million was allocated in 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_4393">I propose to take Questions Nos. 489 to 491, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_4394">The public health review is also known as the Brennan review. It commenced in 1999 and published its recommendations in April 2002, not in 1994. The review was charged with reviewing the operations of public health departments and community public health medical services of the health boards in the context of the 1994 memorandum of agreement between the Department and the Irish Medical Organisation. It also considered future developments for these services. The group comprised representatives of my Department, the health boards and the Irish Medical Organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_4395">There was agreement on many of the matters considered by the group, including the need for a formally structured out of hours arrangement. There was one main area of disagreement. The IMO held the view that public health directors and specialists should have parity with hospital consultants, while management felt that this was outside the group's terms of reference. The report did not make a recommendation on the matter and the chairman recognised that any such issues referred to by the official side must be the subject of industrial relations negotiations. The report also acknowledged that there might be a need to revisit the recommendations in relation to public health following the implementation of proposed changes recommended by the health strategy and the primary care strategy.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_362">Formal and informal talks have been held with the IMO on these issues since the publication of the Brennan report. The issues central to the public health doctors dispute have been the subject of  negotiations between the IMO and management, comprising officials from the Health Service Employers Agency, my Department and the health boards over the past 12 months. Initially this was done through joint discussions and in more recent times under the aegis of the Labour Relations Commission.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_363">Since the commencement of strike action by the IMO efforts have been made at the highest level to reach a satisfactory conclusion. Management made a substantial offer to the IMO.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_364">On 14 March, at informal talks in the LRC, management made an offer of 10.5%, excluding benchmarking, through the independent chairperson. On 18 March the offer was confirmed in writing by the HSEA. The application of such an increase, as well as the increases awarded to public health doctors under benchmarking and the Sustaining Progress national agreement, would result in increases of between €11,000 and €29,000 for them between now and 2005.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_365">The IMO claimed that payment arrears are due since 1997, not 1994 as the Deputy has stated. Any retrospective element would form part of the overall agreement between management and the IMO.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_366">The HSEA also requested the IMO to agree to have all outstanding issues referred to the Labour Court. Unfortunately, the IMO did not agree to this request and the strike started on 14 April. On at least three occasions since then I have asked the IMO to return to the negotiating table. In addition, the national implementation body has urged the IMO to suspend its strike and to avail of the industrial relations mechanisms, in accordance with the conditions of the national pay agreement, Sustaining Progress.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_367">Earlier this month exploratory talks took place in the LRC with the HSEA and officials of my Department. At these talks management indicated its willingness to discuss the implementation of the recommendations of the Brennan report, including the development of a structured out of hours system. The 10.5% increase was again offered. During these talks management stressed that the issue of the granting of consultant status to directors and specialists was not the subject of a recommendation by the review group on public health.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_368">The 30% pay increase called for by the doctors is in addition to the Sustaining Progress agreement. The IMO was involved in the discussions which led to the recent partnership agreement. It was also a signatory, in its role as a member of ICTU, indicating their acceptance of the agreement. By their acceptance the parties involved agreed to preclude strikes or other forms of industrial action. When local negotiations prove to be unsuccessful they have agreed to refer any matters to the LRC or the Labour Court.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_369">The signatories of Sustaining Progress have committed themselves to stable industrial relations and the maintenance of a well managed industrial relations environment in order to mini mise disputes affecting the level of service to the public. The national implementation body emphasised this when, in its press release of 24 April, it called upon the IMO to suspend its strike action and to agree to a referral of the matter to the Labour Court.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_370">Across the health system different levels of staff enter claims about a variety of issues related to their terms and conditions of employment. If each of these claims was to be conceded, without challenge, the resources available would not be used effectively. There are general frameworks – for example, the various pay agreements – within which such claims must be examined and considered. There is also the formal industrial relations machinery through which valid claims must be processed. It is simply not within my power nor that of my Department nor the HSEA nor any other agent of management to simply concede major pay claims just because they have been demanded. Such a concession is not given to any group in the health system nor the wider public services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_371">Although the current out of hours system is unstructured and informal management has indicated its willingness to discuss the implementation of the recommendations of the Brennan report, including the development of a structured system. Since 31 May there has been a series of meetings at the LRC between management and the IMO. Although significant progress was made at the most recent meeting held on 6 June it was not possible to conclude a final agreement.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4402">I propose to take Questions Nos. 493 and 504 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_4403">Recently my Department advised the NPBA of an additional allocation of €5.85 million to relieve the underfunding situation of its member organisations, including the NCBI.</p>
          <p eId="para_4404">Further claims amounting to over €5 million have been made by the association. My Department is considering them in consultation with the ERHA, the health boards and the association, having regard to the availability of funds. Additional claims for extra staff numbers will also be considered in the light of available resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_4405">The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment. This is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by Government for 2003. Within this overall framework two thirds of the additional funding available for non capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_4406">The funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes, including services for people with disabilities. It is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003. My Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers on service provision this year.</p>

This new hospital will comprise a mix of up to 30 beds for continuing care and the remaining 30 beds made up by direct access beds, rehabilitation/convalescent, respite and palliative care beds. In line with what is generally provided in the board's district hospitals, the service will have a very significant mix of multi-disciplinary staff, including medical, nursing, nursing support, para-medical, as well as other complementary therapists. Coupled with this, the board would envisage the Tuam Hospital functioning at the hub of a comprehensive outreach service, providing home care programmes, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, chiropody, home nursing, home help, as well as other flexible packages of care. These specialist care services will be supported by social support services such as community welfare and home advisory programmes. This project does not, therefore, envisage the re-opening of the old hospital for nursing care purposes.</p>

          <p eId="para_4535">I am advised by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service – IBTS – that people returning to Ireland from parts of the world where malaria is endemic are deferred from donation for a period of six months. This is because the malarial parasite can be transmitted by blood over this period, even by asymptomatic donors and people who have taken the recommended courses of prophylactic drugs. Such an approach to malarial exposure is in line with current best practice in the developed world, and with draft EU requirements for blood donation procedures. Malaria transmitted by blood transfusion has caused fatalities in other European countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_4536">While blood tests do exist that detect either antibodies to malaria or the parasite itself in the blood of asymptomatic people who are harbouring the disease, the IBTS advises that these tests have not yet been shown to be safer than deferring donors for a period of six months. If and when they are, the IBTS will consider introducing them for such donors.</p>

          <p eId="para_4551">According to the latest census figures, a total of 157 psychologists are employed in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area. This represents an increase of 11.3% over the end of the 2001 position in wholetime equivalent terms. A breakdown of this figure is set out in the table below.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_384">Information on vacancies of health service personnel is not collected on a routine basis by my Department. Responsibility for human resource planning, including the monitoring and filling of vacant psychologist posts in the eastern region, rests with the regional chief executive of the East ern Regional Health Authority, ERHA. The regional chief executive, in managing the workforce in his region, is responsible for determining the appropriate staffing mix and the precise grades of staff to be employed in line with service plan priorities, subject to overall employment levels remaining within the approved regional employment ceiling. My Department has therefore requested information from the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority on the number of vacancies that exist for clinical psychologists in the eastern region and this information will be sent to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_385">At present, there are about 105 clinical psychologists undertaking post-graduate training in the State. Over 60 students are enrolled on the Psychological Society of Ireland's clinical psychologist post-graduate training diploma, 24 are enrolled on the doctoral programme in clinical psychology at TCD – 12 in first year and 12 in second year – and 19 are enrolled on the doctoral programme in clinical psychology at UCD – ten in second year and nine in third year. Since end-1999 there has been a threefold increase, from 26 to 83, in the number of trainee clinical psychologists employed in the health services. It is understood that both the National University of Ireland, Galway and the University of Limerick have plans to introduce doctoral programmes in clinical psychology in 2003 with an intake of a further 20 students in total.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_386">My Department is committed to working on an ongoing basis with health agencies, educational providers and the education authorities to ensure  adequate provision of training places in clinical psychology consistent with the medium-term human resource requirements of the health services and the important recommendations on investment in training and education detailed in the Action Plan for People Management published in November 2002. A particular priority is to secure the best return in terms of graduate output on the very significant financial resources currently invested in psychology training. In this context, the Department has recently initiated a review, to be completed in the coming months, with a sub-group of the directors of HR Group of the current training model for post-graduate psychology training. The main objective of the review is to underpin the maintenance and development of training provision on a planned and sustainable basis into the future.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_387">The Deputy may wish to note that other efforts have been undertaken to improve staffing levels in the psychological services, both at local and national level. Relevant developments include the recruitment of psychologists from overseas by the health boards, the introduction of a fast track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals including psychologists, the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications and the devolution of responsibility for recruitment of certain psychologist posts to health boards from the Local Appointments Commission. Ongoing pay enhancements through the implementation of the recommendations of the Public Service Benchmarking Body will make a further contribution to reducing current vacancy levels by increasing the attractiveness of employment as a clinical psychologist in the health services.</summary>

      <b>Mr. F. McGrath</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Health and Children</b>
      if his attention has been drawn to the massive crisis that persists for families of children and adults with disabilities.
      [15397/03]

        </question>
        <speech by="#TimOMalleyPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_878">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_4621">I am aware of the concerns regarding the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</p>
          <p eId="para_4622">Additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to €188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</p>
          <p eId="para_4623">The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</p>
          <p eId="para_4624">In particular, €14.6 million has been invested in health related support services for children with autism or an intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. A further €4 million has been allocated to these services in 2003. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and out reach support to children of school going age.</p>
          <p eId="para_4625">Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular even though the numbers of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</p>
          <p eId="para_4626">The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_392">This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved  in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4631">As the Deputy is aware, the health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. This should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. Due to the prevailing budgetary situation I regret that it is not possible to meet this commitment this year but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within the lifetime of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_4632">It should be remembered that health board chief executive officers have discretion in relation to the issuing of medical cards and also that a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances such as carers' allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of the chief executive officers, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical card, and a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify that.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_393">Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can avail of the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €70 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_394">The health strategy includes a whole series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board chief executive officers under the PPF which include: streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards; and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.</summary>

However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</summary>

Under EU regulations, the board issues form E112 to the person being referred to establish his or her entitlement to such treatment and to imply a commitment by the health board to pay the full cost of the treatment. My Department has issued guidelines which set down the criteria to be used by health boards when assessing applications for approval of forms E112, as follows: the application to refer a patient abroad must be assessed  before the patient goes abroad except in cases of extreme urgency; medical evidence must be provided by a hospital consultant giving details of the condition from which the patient suffers and of the type of treatment envisaged; and it must be certified by the consultant that treatment concerned is not available in this country, that there is an urgent medical necessity for the treatment, that there is a reasonable medical prognosis, that the treatment is regarded as a proven form of medical treatment and that the treatment abroad is in a recognised hospital or other institution and is under the control of a registered medical practitioner.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_4656">In relation to assisted human reproduction services generally, while there is no legislation regulating this area at present, medical practice is governed by guidelines issued by the Medical Council. These state that the creation of new forms of life for experimental purposes or the deliberate and intentional destruction of human life already formed is professional misconduct.</p>
          <p eId="para_4657">I am conscious of concerns about the absence of a statutory framework to regulate this area. With a view to addressing these concerns in a comprehensive and informed way, and following a Government decision on the matter, I established the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction in March 2000 with the following terms of reference: "to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all areas of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area."  When completed, the commission's report will provide the basis for informing public debate prior to the finalisation of any policy proposals. Given the complexity of the issues under examination, it is difficult to be definitive about when the work of the commission will be completed. I am satisfied, however, that it is working as expeditiously as is feasible.</p>
          <p eId="para_4658">In relation to EU-funded programmes, the following sets out the position with regard to both the Sixth Framework Research Programme for the EU, FP6, which will run from 2002 to 2006, and EU aid for policies and actions on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_398">The specific programmes for research under FP6 were agreed at the EU Competitiveness Council meeting on 30 September 2002 following  a Danish Presidency compromise concerning the funding of ethically controversial research under FP6. All member states, with the exception of Italy, accepted the compromise proposal. My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, who has lead responsibility for FP6, has advised that the agreement reached guarantees respect for national legislation and regulations, which means that FP6 cannot fund any research activity in Ireland which would not satisfy Irish ethical requirements. FP6 excludes several ethically controversial areas of research activity from funding, namely, research aimed at human reproductive cloning, modification of the genetic heritage of human beings and the creation of human embryos solely for the purposes of research or stem cell procurement.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_399">The agreement reached at the EU Competitiveness Council also introduced a moratorium up to 31 December 2003 on the funding of research under FP6 on human embryos and human embryonic stem cells, with the exception of the study of banked or isolated human embryonic stem cells in culture. The moratorium is designed to allow for a period of further consideration. Already, the EU Commission has presented to the Council and Parliament a report on human embryonic stem cell research which formed the basis for discussion at an inter-institutional seminar on bioethics in April 2003. The EU Commission is committed to submitting a proposal establishing further guidelines on principles for deciding on the Community funding of research projects involving the use of human embryos and human embryonic stem cells. The proposal will then have to be considered by the EU Council following full consultation with Parliament.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_400">In addition to the moratorium, a regulatory committee made up of representatives appointed by member states will be established and will be used if any proposed research actions involve ethically sensitive areas. Ireland will have a significant input into the work of the regulatory committee and the deliberations in Council on the proposal, which the Commission must bring forward.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_401">Regarding the financing of EU research in FP6, the only funding involved comes from the EU budget. Clearly, the Commission will have to respect the Irish Constitution, Irish regulations and Irish ethical principles if it proposes to fund any research in Ireland. Any suggestion that the Commission should, in effect, seek to apply provisions of the Irish Constitution to restrict activities in other member states where those activities are both legal and ethical cannot be sustained.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_402">In agreeing to the adoption of the specific programmes, Ireland entered a statement in the Council minutes which recalled our earlier statements and which shared a number of the concerns expressed by Italy, Germany, Portugal and Austria. It also pointed out that Ireland will continue to focus on the need to ensure the utmost respect  for human life and the protection of human dignity.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_403">The European Commission in March 2002 submitted a proposal to the Council and the European Parliament for a new regulation on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries. The previous regulation expired on 31 December last, having been in force since July 1997. The purpose of both the previous regulation and its proposed replacement is to allow the Commission to continue to support programmes in developing countries in the area of reproductive and sexual health and rights. The Commission's role in relation to development co-operation is laid down in Articles 177-181 of the treaty establishing the European Community.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_404">The previous regulation and its proposed replacement form an important part of the EU's development policy. In particular, the legislation addresses the specific UN millennium development goal relating to maternal health, which calls for the reduction of maternal mortality by three-quarters over the period 1990 to 2015. Throughout the developing world, and particularly in the poorest countries, hundreds of thousands of women continue to die in childbirth because health systems cannot afford proper medical care and appropriate services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_405">The draft regulation, like the previous 1997-2002 instrument, is based on the programme of action agreed at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development in 1994 and the "Cairo +5" follow-up conference of 1999. Ireland's position in the Council negotiations on both the draft regulation and its predecessor has been that they must be in strict conformity with the Cairo Programme of Action, which provides that abortion is not to be promoted as a family planning method and that regulations regarding abortion are solely for individual countries to decide. We are satisfied that the draft regulation in its current form meets this requirement and that it represents a substantial contribution by the Union towards implementation of the millennium development goals, to which the international community is committed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_406">I should point out that Article 4 of the proposed directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing and processing, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells, allows member states to maintain or introduce more stringent protective measures, provided that they comply with the terms of the treaty. The directive also allows member states to prohibit the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage, distribution or use of any specific type of human tissues or cells. This will safeguard the Irish position in relation to tissues and cells for human application. The directive does not cover the area of in vitro research which is outside the scope of Article 152 of the treaty, which is the legal basis of the directive.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4660">Patients may have their surgery cancelled due to a variety of factors, including bed and staff availability, infection control measures and pressures on elective services due to an increase in admissions through accident and emergency departments. Approximately 70% of all admissions to the major Dublin hospitals are through accident and emergency departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_4661">Despite the many pressures, the acute hospital system has continued to increase its productivity. About 968,000 people were treated in 2002 as either in-patients or day patients in acute hospitals. This represents an increase of 5% when compared to the 2001 figure. Since 1997, the number of patients treated in our acute hospitals has increased by approximately 23%.</p>
          <p eId="para_4662">On foot of the report entitled Acute Hospital Bed Capacity – A National Review the Government has decided, in the context of the health strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals by 2011. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland. In 2002, I announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 beds in acute hospitals. I am pleased to say that 550 of these beds are in operation and the remaining beds will be brought into use shortly. My Department is currently addressing the regional issues associated with the allocation of the remainder of the 3,000 acute beds.</p>

          <p eId="para_4666">As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of health services in the Dublin area is the responsibility of the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_4667">The three area health boards within the ERHA currently utilise a range of beds within the private sector, either through partial or full subvention of the cost. As of the end of April 2003, the area health boards subvented 3,006 people in private-voluntary beds. At the same time the number of registered nursing home beds in the region were as follows: private – 3,054, voluntary – 1,670. The cost of the subvention scheme to the area health boards for this period was €20.8 million. The full year cost in 2003 will be in the region of €62.4 million. It is important to note that there is a statutory obligation on health boards to remain within their funding allocation. The authority will be consulting with the private nursing homes over the next few months to explore in further detail, opportunities for rehabilitation and convalescence within this sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_4668">With reference to the cost of a private nursing home bed compared to the cost of a long-stay bed in a public facility, I should point out that not all the beds available in private nursing homes may be suitable for patients because of their location or because the nursing home may not be in a position to meet the nursing and care needs of particular patients. In addition, public long-stay facilities often provide a range of services to older people such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, chiropody, speech therapy, psychology services, social work services, public health nurse services and day care services. Not all of these services are available to older people in the private nursing home sector on a regular basis. Furthermore, the cost of medical input is not, to my knowledge, included in calculating the cost of a private nursing home bed while it would be a factor in the overall cost of a bed in a public extended care facility. Therefore, the cost comparisons are not on a like-for-like basis.</p>

Under the extension, approximately 130,000 women in the target population 50 to 64 years of age will be eligible for screening.

Following such extension and when the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service can be delivered at national level, consideration will be given to including older women and continuing the screening of women already in the programme who have reached 65 years of age.</p>

          <p eId="para_4683">At present, an insurer is not obliged to give medical insurance cover to persons aged 65 years or over, other than where a renewal of existing or recently lapsed cover is involved. Under current community rating arrangements, an insurer must charge the same premium for the same level of cover to all subscribers who enrol before the age of 65 years.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_407">Our voluntary private health insurance system is based on community rating. Under this system the young and healthy pay a higher premium than would be the case if rating was risk related, while the old and sick pay a lower premium than would apply under a risk rated system. In effect, the good risks subsidise the health care costs of the old and sick, but, under community rating they will be similarly supported when they become older. This principle is called inter-generational solidarity and is crucial to the integrity and sustainability of our system. Where people defer, or delay, taking out health insurance until they are at an advanced age, when they are more likely to  make claims, the operation of solidarity is undermined. This is known as ‘adverse selection' and it represents a potentially serious threat to the sustainability of community rating as it currently operates.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_408">The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2001 contains provision for the introduction of a system of lifetime community rating, which will involve allowing health insurers to apply late entry premium loadings to persons who take out insurance cover at or after the age of 35 years. Under this system, access to cover will be open to persons aged 65 and over. This system was recommended by an independent advisory group in order to strengthen community rating against the potential threat of instability which may arise from the practice of adverse selection. It is intended to pursue work on preparing regulations to implement a system of lifetime community rating, once the arrangements for introducing a risk equalisation scheme, which is necessary to support community rating, have been completed. A draft scheme is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.</summary>

A review of the last update on safety from the company, which includes worldwide data from 1996 to 2002, suggests that cases notified to the IMB appear to be similar to a cluster previously described in Sweden.

          <p eId="para_4740">Issues related to revenue generating measures such as the proposal outlined by the Deputy are a matter in the first instance for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_4741">The overall investment in recent years by this and the previous Government in services to persons with disabilities, which amounts to €555 million, is evidence of the priority which has been given to these services. Around €340 million of the €555 million has been invested in services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</p>
          <p eId="para_4742">Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular even though the numbers of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</p>
          <p eId="para_4743">The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot at this stage give specific commitments in relation to levels of expenditure in 2004 for any particular service area as these matters are part of the ongoing discussions on the Estimates and budget for that year between my Department and the Department of Finance.</p>

I am aware that it has proved difficult in recent years to recruit professional staff such as physiotherapists and occupational therapists and that a lack of such staff may be a contributory factor to some of the difficulties referred to by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_4766">With regard to the question of aids and appliances, I draw the Deputy's attention to section 16.2 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 (S.I. No. 227 of 1993), which defines a service which is considered to be essential to the maintenance of a person in a nursing home as including "aids and appliances necessary to assist a dependent person with the activities of daily living". The implementation of these regulations is a matter for the local health board.</p>
          <p eId="para_4767">If the Deputy has evidence of a patient receiving care in a private nursing home which is not consistent with what I have outlined, he should make that evidence available to the relevant health board in the area concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_4771">I propose to take Questions Nos. 576 to 578, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_4772">As the Deputy will be aware, public beds are available in each health board area in community hospitals and community nursing units. With increases in demographics, and with a higher percentage of our population now over 65 years of age, there is a greater demand on these public beds. This increase in demand was highlighted in the national health strategy with the commitment to supply an additional 850 public beds under a pilot public private partnership project, initially in the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Southern Health Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_4773">These beds will be provided in 17 new sites, nine in the Eastern Regional Health Authority and eight Southern Health Board areas. These additional beds will not be available by the end of 2003, as the process of providing services under a PPP arrangement requires the health board or authority to abide by EU procurement legislation for projects of this size. The health boards or authority in question have advertised in the Official Journal of the European Community for business advisers to assist them in progressing these pilot projects following which, it is hoped the detailed contracts will be drawn up and subsequent construction of the units will commence.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_416">The provision of these beds is consistent with the commitment in the health strategy to provide additional public long-stay beds to cope with additional demand arising from an increasing number of older people. It is acknowledged that we will need to increase our existing bed provision if we are to meet this demand. In addition to public beds, older people may be in long-term care in any of the approximately 400 registered private nursing homes around the country. Subventions are paid to residents who may have difficulty in financing the full cost of their care. In 1994, the first full year of the operation of the scheme, it cost €15.192 million and funding of €110 million is in place to fund the scheme this year. The amounts paid by each health board over the past two years are as follows:</summary>

          <p eId="para_4802">The specialty costing system for acute public hospitals used by my Department does not distinguish between the cost of a public bed and the cost of a private bed. The information available is in respect of the average cost of a bed day. At present specialty costing information is not available for every acute hospital, it is only available for the 32 acute public hospitals participating in the case mix budget model. There are many factors which affect in-patient cost per bed day. These include the complexity of the workload and specialties available, teaching obligations, tertiary referrals etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_4803">Subject to the caveats outlined, the average cost of an in-patient bed in a major teaching hospital for 2001, the latest date for which final financial information is available, was €554 per day. In relation to other acute hospitals the average daily cost of an in-patient bed in 2001 was €416 per day. It should be noted that the figures mentioned exclude costs attributable to day cases, out-patient services, long-stay cases, psychiatry and renal dialysis, nor do they take account of capital costs or depreciation.</p>

          <p eId="para_4844">I have received a copy of the report of the EU Committee on Petitions in relation to its fact-finding mission to Ireland in connection with the effects of taxi liberalisation. I met the delegation from the  committee on 4 April 2003 and outlined the background to taxi liberalisation and the establishment of the independent three person taxi hardship panel to them. I also explained that the panel was established by the Government to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship that may have been experienced by individual taxi licence holders arising from loss of income as a direct result of liberalisation and that based on legal precedent there can be no legal duty on the State to compensate taxi licence holders in relation to open market licence values that may have existed prior to liberalisation. This position remains unchanged.</p>
          <p eId="para_4845">On 17 December 2002 the Government approved the implementation on a phased basis of the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel in accordance with an Agreed Programme for Government. Any payments to be made as a result of this implementation will not represent compensation but rather compassionate payments in respect of extreme personal financial hardship experienced by taxi licence holders arising from the liberalisation of the taxi market. The report of the taxi hardship panel recommends the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence holders who fall into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_4846">The design and administration of a scheme to implement the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel and the arrangements to facilitate the making of payments to eligible persons is being progressed as quickly as possible so as to ensure that applications are dealt with on a confidential and objective basis.

          <p eId="para_4852">The use of bus lanes in this country is provided for in the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997, the primary purpose of which is to facilitate and promote bus based public transport. These regulations generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, to cyclists. Having regard to the role of taxis in providing on-street immediate hire services, an exemption to that limitation is allowed in respect of taxis when they are being used in the course of business. An overriding concern is the carrying capacity of bus lanes and the potential that their primary role to provide bus priority could be undermined if other vehicles are allowed access.</p>
          <p eId="para_4853">A review of the regulations was carried out in 2001 and it was decided on completion of the review that there should be no change in the existing bus lane access provisions at present. Representations continue to be received periodically from hackney, limousine and motorcycle interests on the issue of bus lane access but no request for access has been received in respect of wheelchair accessible private vehicles either in the context of transporting participants to and from Special Olympics events in 2003 or in a wider context.</p>
          <p eId="para_4854">Dublin Bus has made extensive arrangements to carry athletes, family and friends during the period of the Special Olympics.

Article 17 of these regulations provides that where the applicable traffic sign is provided at the entrance to a road, the driver of a vehicle, the unladen weight of which exceeds the weight specified on the sign, is prohibited from proceeding beyond the sign except where it is necessary for the vehicle to enter a road solely for the purpose of gaining access to or egress from premises accessible only from that road. The application of such restrictions is a matter for each local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_4865">Traffic management plans drawn up by local authorities may provide for the re-routing of heavy goods vehicles away from residential areas. The preparation of a traffic management plan taking account of the availability of tunnels is a matter for the road authority concerned. In the case of the Dublin Port tunnel, for example, it is a matter for Dublin City Council. I understand from Dublin City Council that a HGV management strategy will have three objectives: to ensure the optimal use by HGVs of the port tunnel; to minimise adverse effects of remaining HGV movements in the city; and to manage the movement of vehicles not within permitted dimensions, for example through permit systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_4866">I understand that Dublin City Council will undertake widespread consultation before implementing any HGV management strategy. I have been informed that the current position in relation to the development of the HGV management strategy is that Dublin City Council intends to issue a preliminary consultation document identifying the issues involved in the near future.</p>

          <p eId="para_4872">Despite the greatly increased levels of investment in the national roads programme, the increased cost of the programme combined with the more difficult economic and budgetary circumstances, which limit the capacity to allocate more Exchequer funding, require that we consider all possibilities for generating additional funding to accelerate the implementation of the national roads programme. Accordingly a number of options have been identified for examination which have the potential to generate additional funding for the programme. These include the extension of the proposed tolling regime on the Dublin Port tunnel and the sale of the facility. However, no decisions have been made pending the carrying out of the necessary detailed analyses and studies by the NRA. These will take some time to undertake and complete. Construction of the Dublin Port tunnel is proceeding as planned. Claims for any damage attributable to the construction of the tunnel are a matter for the contractors and Dublin City Council in the first instance.</p>

          <p eId="para_4895">The licensing and operation of public service vehicles, including taxis, are currently governed by the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002, which are made under the Road Traffic Acts. Under these regulations all applicants for licences to drive small public service vehicles, that is, taxis, hackneys and limousines, must satisfy the Garda Commissioner that they are a fit and proper person to hold a licence and that they have an adequate knowledge of general traffic regulations, the regulations relating to public service vehicles and the area in which they propose to make services available as a driver of a small public service vehicle.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_426">An Agreed Programme for Government sets out commitments in relation to taxi services, including the appointment of a regulator for the future regulation of licensing, standards and the quality of service. On 19 November 2002 the Government approved proposals for the establishment, initially on a non-statutory basis, of an office of national taxi regulator. Subject to the enactment of legislation, it is envisaged that the office of the taxi regulator will have a national focus and will have full effective control over the promotion of a professional, efficient and customer friendly service by all small public service vehicles, including taxis, hackneys and limousines. This will include the overall development  and application of standards for drivers, licence holders and vehicles.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_427">The preparation of the necessary legislation to support the establishment of a commission for taxi regulation is proceeding as a matter of urgency in my Department and I am bringing detailed proposals in this regard to Government today. While the necessary legislative changes are being prepared, the appointment of a chairman of the commission is being progressed independently so that the office can be operational on a non-statutory basis. As an interim measure, I have also appointed an interim chairman of the commission, Mr. Jimmy Farrelly, pending the recruitment of a statutory chairman. Mr. Farrelly has commenced a series of detailed consultations with those involved in the taxi, hackney and limousine industry, local authorities, the Garda Síochána and other interest groups with a view to assessing and addressing issues relating to standards in the industry. I have indicated that I am prepared to act on any recommendations proposed by Mr. Farrelly for urgent changes to the current regulations on standards proposed following this consultation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_428">Separate proposals are also being progressed to establish an advisory council, consisting of representatives of the industry, local authorities, the Garda Síochána, consumer, disability, tourism and business interests, and other relevant sectors, to advise the commission for taxi regulation and the Minister for Transport, as appropriate, in relation to issues relevant to small public service vehicles and their drivers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_429">Since the liberalisation of entry to the taxi industry in November 2000, the numbers of licensed taxis nationally have almost trebled. This increased availability has enhanced the service available to customers. The developments outlined will, in time, lead to new regulatory provisions which, I am confident, will further enhance the quality and standards of the services provided. The precise timing of substantive revisions to the regulatory regime will fall to be determined by the commission for taxi regulation.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4897">The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, make toll by-laws and enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is vested in the National Roads Authority under Part V of the Roads Act 1993, as amended by the  Planning and Development Act 2000. The NRA is required by the NDFA Act 2002 to obtain the advice of the NDFA in relation, <i>inter alia,</i> to the financing of national road projects. The development and implementation of toll based PPP projects by the NRA also takes account of Department of Finance draft interim guidelines on the assessment, approval and procurement of PPP projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_4898">Within this statutory and administrative framework, it is a matter for the NRA to negotiate PPP agreements for the funding, construction and operation of toll funded national road projects. The NRA carries out extensive financial, legal and technical evaluation for each national road project to be procured on a PPP basis. This evaluation focuses on ensuring that value for money is obtained and not on a comparison of private sector rate of returns and Exchequer cost of funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_4899">In assessing value for money, the NRA prepares a financial comparator which represents the cost under traditional procurement. This is compared to the cost to the public sector under a PPP arrangement to assess which offers better value for money. This value for money comparison is undertaken at different stages of the PPP procurement process. At the final stage the best and final offer submission which has been judged most economically advantageous is compared against the financial comparator to confirm that a toll-based PPP offers better value for money. In view of this approach to the assessment of PPP projects, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to set criteria for the NRA in relation to rates of return to private investors in tolled road projects.</p>

The review will address all of the major issues relating to speed limit policy, including the range of speed limits deployed on roadways and in relation to particular categories of vehicles, the signage used to indicate speed limits and the implications of the adoption of  metric values for speed measurement. A broadly based working group has been established to carry out this review and it is intended that the review will be completed this summer. In the context of that review my Department has written to local authorities requesting them to review the appropriateness of the speed limits in each of their areas and to make changes where warranted.</summary>

A consultation process involving my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána in relation to the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps is being progressed. The question of the relationship the corps will have with the Garda, in particular whether it will be under the overall control of the Commissioner, is central to the development of this proposal. The establishment of an independent dedicated traffic corps independent of the Garda Síochána would require the introduction of legislation, in particular to establish powers and functions of the corps and its accountability.</p>

Therefore, it is not possible for a driver to accumulate 24 penalty points under the structures provided for in the Act.</p>

          <p eId="para_4924">Last year, the Government agreed that the development of the Dublin metro should be undertaken on a phased basis and as a public private partnership. It also decided that a link from the city centre to Dublin Airport was to be included in phase 1. Since then the Railway Procurement Agency has concentrated its work on developing proposals for this phase. A preliminary public consultation has taken place and a pre-qualification exercise for potential bidders was launched by the RPA in mid-2002.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_433">In November 2002 my Department received the outline business case – OBC – for phase 1 of the metro from the RPA. The Dublin metro is the largest proposed infrastructure project in the history of the State. Careful consideration of the OBC is being undertaken. The estimated costs are substantial and a number of additional aspects of the proposal are being assessed as part of my evaluation of the OBC. These additional aspects concern the potential impact of the project on the general Government balance in the context of the EU Stability and Growth Pact and the legal, planning and technical considerations  based on practice elsewhere, particularly Madrid where the authorities have developed a strong international reputation for the speedy completion of the Madrid metro extensions at a relatively low cost.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_434">I have asked the RPA to refine the OBC for its preferred solution in the light of the above aspects and I expect to receive its response in the coming weeks. The actual cost of the metro to the Exchequer would be largely dependent on the bids received from the private sector. Following consideration of all these issues by my Department, I intend to bring proposals to the Government. I am also considering proposals for legislative change so as to accelerate and streamline the delivery of critical transport infrastructure projects, such as the metro, thereby reducing the cost of such infrastructure.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_435">In relation to a metro line to Tallaght, such a line is included in the Dublin Transportation Office's A Platform for Change metro proposals. However, it is not included in the proposed phase 1. The decision on any further extensions to the metro will be dependent on the results of the development of phase 1.</summary>

However, under the investment programme being undertaken by Irish Rail under the national development plan, involving the  upgrading of infrastructure and the acquisition of new rolling stock, faster journey times and increased service frequency will result on the intercity services.</p>
          <p eId="para_4929">It is expected that the new 67 mainline rail carriages that have been ordered for intercity routes will be operational in 2006. These new mainline rail carriages will primarily replace stock more than 30 years old within the Irish Rail fleet. The intention is that the new rolling stock will primarily be used on the Dublin to Cork line with carriages from that line cascaded onto other lines. The increased operational flexibility associated with the new rolling stock will allow an increase in frequency with one additional service each way between Dublin and Cork and an additional service each way between Galway and Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_4930">The removal of permanent speed restrictions along the main Cork to Dublin route will lead to significant journey time savings. It is envisaged that the removal of these speed restrictions and the benefit gained from continuous welded track on this line will bring a reduction in journey times of up to 31 minutes by 2008. It is envisaged that the Limerick line will achieve a journey time reduction of 20 minutes over the same time period.</p>
          <p eId="para_4931">The Galway to Dublin line is expected to have a 25 minute reduction by 2008. The relaying of this line with continuous welded trackwork is now complete and five minute time savings have already been achieved on the journey to Dublin. Further improvements are expected when construction works in Heuston Station are completed this year. The journey from Tralee to Dublin is expected to be reduced by 40 minutes by 2008 and Sligo and Westport will see journey times shorten by 20 to 30 minutes by 2008.</p>

          <p eId="para_4940">The provision of traffic signs in any area is the responsibility of the local authorities. In carrying out that responsibility local authorities must have regard to the traffic signs manual or directions issued by me and, in relation to regulatory traffic signs, the traffic signs regulations made under the Road Traffic Acts.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_436">In 2002 Dublin City Council devised signage proposals for the purpose of the determination of  orbital routes in the city. The initial proposals were not in compliance with the provisions of the traffic signs manual and were not proceeded with. Revised proposals for orbital signage have since been the subject of consultations between my Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the National Roads Authority and Dublin City Council. That consultation process recently concluded. I am currently examining proposals for orbital route traffic signs with a view to giving directions under section 95(16) of the Road Traffic Act 1961 regarding the type of non-regulatory signs that could be provided and used by any road authority on orbital routes. Subject to compliance with the general parameters that will be set in such directions, the content of the signs provided by any local authority will be a matter for its determination.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4942">In accordance with the medical standards for driving set out in EU directives which are transposed into national law in the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 1999, the medical examination as to general physical and mental fitness takes account of the susceptibility of the person concerned to fatigue such that such person's ability to operate the controls of the vehicle might be seriously impaired. In addition, certification of fitness to drive may be specifically curtailed in certain instances such as where the person suffers from prescribed illnesses or disabilities or if using medications which would have an adverse effect on driving. In many of these instances fatigue might be an attendant factor.</p>
          <p eId="para_4943">The question bank for the driver theory test includes questions regarding fatigue so that learner drivers are aware before they commence driving of the dangers of driving while fatigued. The National Safety Council, which has been mandated with responsibility for promotional and educational initiatives relating to road safety, has run a special promotion called "Driver Reviver". This campaign was launched at Easter weekend 2002 to address the problem of driver fatigue.</p>

The actual cost of the metro to the Exchequer is largely dependent on the bids received from the private sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_4947">The number of persons who have applied for asylum since 14 April 2003 is 1,082. The Reception and Integration Agency, which operates under the aegis of my Department, is charged with responsibility for implementing Government policy on direct provision and dispersal of all newly arrived asylum seekers. The agency is currently operating 64 direct provision asylum seeker accommodation centres located across 24 counties. A key determinant in providing accommodation for asylum seekers is maintaining in as much as possible a sensitive, balanced and proportional approach nationwide. The distribution of asylum seekers in direct provision centres across health board areas is such that in no case do the numbers exceed one fifth of 1% of the population of the health board area.</p>
          <p eId="para_4948">On arrival in the State, newly arrived asylum seekers are accommodated in reception centres in the Dublin area for ten to 14 days during which time they are offered health screening, their ongoing needs are assessed and their family profiles determined. After this initial assessment period, they are dispersed to accommodation centres throughout the State which have vacancies best suited to meeting their needs. The number of asylum seekers who have been dispersed to each health board since 14 April 2003 is set out in the following table:</p>

          <p eId="para_4991">I am aware of the concerns regarding the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the significant revenue investment, amounting to €188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</p>
          <p eId="para_4992">The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In particular €14.6 million has been invested in health related support services for children with autism or an intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. A further €4 million has been allocated to these services in 2003. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and out reach support to children of school going age.</p>
          <p eId="para_4993">Despite this significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, although the numbers of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_439">The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes, including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service  providers in relation to service provision this year.</summary>

The Garda authorities have now reported to me that any difficulties they are experiencing in this matter would be overcome by a provision whereby a senior officer of the Garda Síochána could issue a search warrant on grounds of urgency where a District Court judge is not readily available.</p>
          <p eId="para_4996">The criminal justice (Garda powers) Bill currently under preparation proposes to include a general provision in the case of all serious offences for a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent to issue a search warrant in circumstances of urgency where it might be impractical to apply to a judge of the District Court. This provision, which will be in addition to the current section 48 provision, will address any difficulties being experienced by the Garda Síochána under the 2001 Act. It is hoped to publish the Bill later this year.</p>

In a case of a missing person, the local Garda district officer takes direct responsibility for the investigation and will appoint an investigation team to include any specialised unit deemed necessary, such as, for example, the national bureau of criminal investigation or the technical bureau. The services of other agencies, such as Interpol and Europol, are also available to assist in the investigation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_444">In October 2002 I launched the missing persons helpline which is operated by Victim Support. This dedicated helpline is operating as a counselling and referral service and as a primary point of contact for the families of missing persons. The helpline provides advice and psychological support for families of missing persons as well as structured liaison with the Garda Síochána.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_445">The Garda authorities are satisfied that every effort is made to locate all missing persons and that the current procedures for dealing with missing persons are adequate. Their view is that, while specialist units prove extremely useful in detecting or investigating certain types of crime, the particular nature of missing persons cases requires specific local knowledge both about the area and the circumstances of the person themselves. All files on missing persons remain open and under continuous review until the person is located or, in the case of a missing person who is presumed drowned, a verdict to that effect by the coroner.</summary>

Any person who has attained 18 years of age may apply for an age card at his or her local Garda station in order to confirm that he or she has attained the legal age for the purchase of intoxicating liquor. The regulations came into effect on 19 April 1999.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_451">While the carrying of the age card is voluntary, the Government has approved the drafting of an Intoxicating Liquor Bill which will contain provisions designed to combat under age and excessive consumption of alcohol, including a requirement that persons under the age of 21, apart from those accompanied by a parent or guardian, must carry an evidence of age document in order to enter and remain in licensed premises. While the existing Garda age card remains a preferred option, a passport, an identity card issued by an EU member state or a driver's licence will also be acceptable. Provision will be made for prescribing other documents by means of regulations. If the PPS card issued by the Department of Social and Family Affairs was altered to feature a photograph of the card holder, the use of such a card for the purpose of the intoxicating liquor law would be possible under the legislative proposals being drafted currently. This new obligation to produce an evidence of age document is intended to assist licensees in complying with provisions relating to underage consumption of alcohol and to assist gardaí in enforcing the law.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5207">A number of different parties have sought to be provided with advance funding for the costs of representation before the Morris tribunal. For good reasons I am against such an approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_5208">On 13 May 2003 Mr. Justice Michael Peart delivered his judgment in the case of Frank McBrearty senior and the Honourable Mr. Justice Frederick Morris. He held that Mr. McBrearty and his extended family did not have a legal or constitutional right to have their legal representation funded or provided for in advance of the tribunal reaching findings. As I have stated on a number of occasions, the Morris tribunal is a tribunal of inquiry, not a court of law. It is inquisitorial not adversarial. The onus to establish the facts and inquire into the matters in question falls on the tribunal itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_5209">I do not propose to provide advance funding for representation of selected persons appearing before the tribunal. The question of costs is determined by the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2002. The Acts allow a tribunal, which is of opinion that, having regard to its findings and all other relevant matters, there are sufficient reasons rendering it equitable to do so, to order the whole or part of the costs of representation of a person appearing before it, to be paid. A tribunal, when determining whether costs should be paid, may take into account failure to co-operate or to provide assistance to or knowingly giving false or misleading information to the tribunal. The reasonable legal costs of participants are therefore effectively guaranteed in advance provided those persons co-operate with the tribunal, although actual payments are not made in advance. It would be wrong to make an exception in this case by deciding, in effect, to remove the tribunal's discretion to make provision for the cost of witnesses as it judges appropriate, having regard to all the facts.</p>

I am advised by the Garda authorities that the Garda racial and intercultural office was established in 2001 to liaise, monitor and advise on issues relating to interculturalism. Furthermore, 145 gardaí have been appointed ethnic liaison officers in districts and divisions around the country.

        <summary eId="sum_458">The Garda Síochána recognises the importance of the accurate and impartial recording of racially motivated offences in informing Garda management, Government and the public of the extent and nature of such incidents. The Garda authorities have also agreed a definition of a racially motivated incident and now have in place a nation-wide mechanism to record and gather information on racist incidents and offenders using the PULSE computer system. I am pleased  to add that a European innovation prize amounting to €30,000 was awarded to Garda community relations to fund the following two publications, Intercultural Ireland – Your Changing Community, which is issued to members of the Garda Síochána, and Intercultural Ireland – Your Police Service, which is circulated to members of ethnic minorities resident in Ireland.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_459">At a more general level, it is the role of the Equality Authority to promote awareness of the overall equality framework, of which anti-racism measures are a constituent part.

The Office of the Director of Equality Investigations, the Equality Tribunal, is the main body for investigating and mediating on cases of discrimination and harassment.</summary>

The NCCRI publishes its findings every six months and its third report, covering the period May to October 2002, was published recently. As I have said in the House before, the NCCRI is assisting my Department in the review of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989.

          <p eId="para_5223">The information sought by the Deputy is as follows. The total number of dealings pending at present in the Land Registry office is approximately 160,000. This number changes constantly as applications are lodged and completed. The number of dealings completed during 2003 to date is 70,127 or an average of 3,405 applications per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_5224">The average length of time taken to complete dealings is 47 weeks. This average figure incorporates all applications ranging from those that are completed within ten days of lodgement to those that are on hands for several years or are the subject of ongoing correspondence. The average time is calculated by dividing the total number of applications pending by the average daily output. The time taken to process individual applications varies and is affected by a wide variety of factors. For example, almost 40% of all applications lodged are the subject of further correspondence with the lodging parties, thereby adding considerably to the time taken to process them. At present, more than 34,000 of the total number of applications on hands are under query leaving a "live" arrear of 126,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_5225">The average time taken to complete subdivision applications lodged in relation to the five western counties at present is 115 weeks. The average time is calculated by dividing the total number of applications pending by the average daily output. The following is the approximate position for each of these counties with regard to the length of time for the completion of sub-division applications:</p>

          <p eId="para_5243">I propose to take Questions Nos. 670 and 671 together.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_462">As regards the Deputy's first question, section 33 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 already prohibits the consumption of intoxicating liquor in any place, other than a private residence, by under age persons. More generally, the gardaí have extensive powers under certain provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 to deal with drink related problems wherever they occur and irrespective of the person's age. These powers have been strengthened significantly in the recently enacted Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 which will come into force on 28 June this year. That Act is designed to tackle the  problem of drunken late night street disturbances and provides for the closure of premises such as pubs, off licences, late night clubs and food premises as well as the making of exclusion orders on individuals in addition to any penalty which may already be imposed under the 1994 Act.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_463">Furthermore, as I already announced, I intend to bring a new Intoxicating Liquor Bill before the Dáil shortly which will tighten up the law quite considerably in relation to the sale and supply of drink. As regards the matter of the supply of drink to under age persons, the Bill will replace the existing provision in section 32 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 with a stronger provision which will prohibit the purchase or delivery of alcohol for consumption by a person under 18, except where it is for consumption in a private residence and with the explicit consent of parents or guardians.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_464">In so far as specific measures to outlaw drinking in public open spaces, such as parks and green spaces are concerned, the provisions in the criminal law and intoxicating liquor laws which I have outlined above are general in their scope and effect and, as such, would certainly be capable of being enforced by the gardaí in these situations. However, as the Deputy has indicated, some local authorities have taken decisive action to control the consumption of alcohol in certain public places by adopting by-laws prohibiting the consumption of intoxicating liquor in public places within their administrative areas. I have been informed by the Department of the Environment and Local Government that the statutory basis for such action by local authorities already exists in Part 7 of the Local Government Act 1994 and the Local Government (By-Laws) Regulations 1995. The making of by-laws in relation to this particular issue is a matter for each local authority and no ministerial confirmation is necessary.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_5247">I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the issue of safety is always uppermost in their deliberations on the purchase of vehicles for the Garda fleet. In particular, all vehicles purchased for the Garda fleet must comply with all current legislation and the purchase specifications will reflect this fact; the tender competition held for the purchase of vehicles for the Garda fleet awards extra marks for "added value" which includes its ENCAP scoring; ENCAP, European new car assessment programme, scores are carefully monitored for any tender competition to purchase vehicles; vehicles are specified with safety features such as ABS braking, driver and passenger airbags, power steering, central locking, electric windows and anti-shatter film to all glass which minimises the injury risk to occupants from shattered glass in the event of a collision. These items are specified for all vehicles and can contribute greatly to increased safety. Vehicles are tested and evaluated on an ongoing basis to establish their suitability as Garda vehicles. Safety will always be an important feature to be considered in any evaluation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_5248">Four cars with a five star rating were purchased last year for evaluation purposes. There are more cars which now qualify for five star rating and the Garda Síochána is examining the possibility of purchasing some of these this year. It is also planned to purchase two further vehicles for evaluation purposes this year. These vehicles have additional designed in safety features, which reputedly make them some of the safest cars in their class. Many of the vehicles currently being purchased have safety systems that are an integral part of the vehicle design and are among the safest in their class, and way above the requirements in the specification. Again, these vehicles receive extra marks in the tender competition for added value.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_466">Any advice offered by the Health and Safety Authority is always taken into consideration by  the Garda Síochána, particularly where the safety of its members is concerned. All vehicles currently on order for the Garda will have side impact bars fitted as standard, and all vehicles purchased last year were fitted with side impact protection bars.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5250">The person concerned arrived in the State on 24 October 1999 on foot of a visa issued to allow him attend a music festival in Sligo as a member of a visiting choir. Once here the person claimed asylum. His claim for asylum was processed and was deemed to be manifestly unfounded. He was informed of this decision by letter on 10 December 1999; this letter was re-issued on 28 January 2000. He subsequently appealed the decision in relation to his asylum application. This appeal was unsuccessful and he was notified of this by letter dated 24 March 2000. In that letter he was informed of the options open to him, that is, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to make written representations to the Minister setting out reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_5251">Representations were subsequently received on the person's behalf. These representations were considered but his application for leave to remain was refused. A deportation order in respect of him was signed by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 11 May 2000. The person was notified of this decision by letter of 12 June 2000 and he was requested to attend at the then Immigration Registration Office in Harcourt Square, Dublin 2, on 18 June 2000 in order to make arrangements for his deportation. The person did not attend as requested. It subsequently came to the notice of my Department that the person concerned had returned to his country of origin without informing the Irish authorities.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_467">It appears that when he returned to that country he made an application from there for a permit allowing him to work in Ireland. The person did not make it known that he was subject of a deportation order and he was granted a work permit for one year from 16 January 2001. This work permit did not invalidate the deportation order issued on 11 May 2000. It should be made clear that, by law, a deportation order requires any non-national specified therein to leave the State  within such period as may be specified in the order and to remain thereafter out of the State. A deportation order can only be revoked on foot of an order made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The person was arrested by the gardaí on 25 May 2003 on foot of the outstanding deportation order and he was deported from the State on 28 May 2003.</summary>

In March 2002 it was announced that Government approval had been granted for revised funding of €19.027 million for the establishment of a shared services centre in the Department's finance division in Killarney. The timeframe for implementing the shared services centre is the three year period 2002 to 2004. In April 2002 sanction was obtained for an extension of the Garda national immigration bureau's computerised immigration registration system. The total expenditure sanctioned at that time was €5.044 million, exclusive of VAT. To date the total expenditure has been €4.415 million.</p>

These projects are being co-financed under the European Social Fund. All projects have commenced activity and range in duration from 12 months to 36 months. Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 – 2006, funding committed during the period 1 January 2002 to 17 May 2002 was €28,868,421.</p>
          <p eId="para_5290">In April 2002 a proposal to approve the making available of up to 20 places in St. Patrick's Institution was put forward. In pursuance of this Government decision, the Prison Service proceeded with the adaptation of one residential wing of St. Patrick's Institution as well as the construction alongside that wing of a dedicated education unit, counselling rooms, as well as other ancillary services which could operate independently from the existing institution. The unit is now almost ready for occupation and expenditure to date is in the order of €8.4 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_5298">The erection of all telecommunications masts requires planning permission from the relevant planning authority unless specifically exempted under the Planning and Development Act or regulations. My Department has no function in relation to the siting of masts at individual locations.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_472">In July 1996 my Department issued guidelines for planning authorities on telecommunications antennae and support structures. The purpose of  the guidelines was to assist planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, operators of mobile telecommunications services and the general public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications masts and base stations within the planning system. The guidelines now have statutory recognition under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 which provides that planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála must have regard to them in the performance of their functions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_473">The guidelines do not specify minimum distances between masts and other structures. However, they specifically recommend that only as a last resort, and if all alternatives are unavailable or unsuitable, should consideration be given to locating free-standing masts in a residential area or beside schools. A statement on health and safety aspects which the Departments of Health and Children and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources agreed with my Department, is included as an appendix to the guidelines. Health aspects are dealt with by requiring operators, as part of their planning application, to furnish to the planning authority a statement of compliance with international radiation protection association guidelines.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_474">The main concern relating to health issues of telecommunications masts is whether it is likely that there could be public exposure to non-ionising radiation in excess of those limits specified by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. Arising from concerns that there should be sufficient monitoring to ensure that radiation levels remain below those limits, my Department has been working with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to develop a new regime of monitoring. This will ensure that all telecommunication antennae adhere to the strict limits for non-ionising radiation emissions. The contract for the monitoring regime, which will involve monitoring of 400 sites, has been placed and the Commission for Communication Regulation, ComReg, formerly the Office of the Director for Communication Regulation, has recently sought nominations from members of the public who wish to have individual sites monitored as part of the programme.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5304">On foot of the success of the plastic bag levy, which has dramatically reduced the number of disposable plastic bags provided to consumers with a consequent positive impact on visible nuisance litter, the Agreed Programme for Government states that consideration will be given to the extension of the levy on plastic bags to other areas such as non-reusable packaging. I am, therefore, currently considering proposals to examine the possibility of introducing further environmental levies, similar to the plastic bag levy, to other problematic waste streams as one of a range of measures required to address the growing volume of waste being generated in Ireland year-on-year. However, decisions on the extension of the environmental levy on plastic bags to other areas such as junk mail will not only have to consider issues in relation to persistent or problematic litter, but also their impact on the promotion of reuse and recycling and the prevention and minimisation of waste.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_475">While I am actively considering the issues involved, final decisions have not yet been taken on the items which should be targeted as a priority in this regard. The introduction of a levy at source on junk mail would require considerable analysis and evaluation and would need, inter alia, to take account of a life cycle analysis of the materials in question and any consequential effects they may have on the environment itself. I will, however, keep the issue of junk mail, together with other areas such as non-reusable packaging, under review and will consider  whether further arrangements are required to influence a positive change by companies when engaged in the publication of brochures for mass-mailing campaigns to the general public.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5309">I refer to the reply to Question No. 444 of 18 February 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_5310">My Department is encouraging and facilitating the active involvement of all interested parties in the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, WFD, including public authorities, agricultural, commercial, industrial, recreational and community interests, environmental organisations and interested persons. A broad range of activities is required for this purpose and numerous actions are being pursued by my Department and other agencies at national, regional and local levels.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_476">At national level, information and consultation seminars on the WFD organised jointly by my Department and the Institute of Public Admin istration were held in Kilkenny on 8 November 2001 and Tullamore on 4 December 2001. The seminars informed delegates of the arrangements being developed for implementation of the WFD and provided an opportunity for commenting on those arrangements and water management generally. The Kilkenny seminar mainly served public authorities such as local and regional authorities. The Tullamore seminar was aimed at a broader stakeholder audience and included participation by NGOs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_477">A website, www.wfdireland.ie, has been developed by my Department to facilitate public access to information on the implementation of the directive and measures are being taken to promote and facilitate participation by all interested persons. A North-South consultation paper, "Managing Our Shared Waters", was issued on 18 March 2003 jointly by the Department of the Environment in the North and the Department of the Environment and Local Government in the South. The paper deals primarily with the designation of international RBDs and administrative arrangements for implementation of the WFD. A copy of the consultation paper, "Managing Our Shared Waters", is available on the website. The responses received are now being considered.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_478">The Heritage Council, now under the aegis of my Department, produced a consultative document in March 2003, "Seeking your Views on Water Quality", the purpose of which was to increase public participation in water management issues generally and in particular the WFD. This document was distributed to a wide range of interested parties. While the document is intended to stimulate response, it also seeks to pass on information on water quality and management issues, as well as information on the WFD. Responses are currently being considered and all responders will be invited to attend a discussion seminar later this year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_479">The implementation of the directive is being promoted and co-ordinated at national level by a co-ordination group of officials of Departments and other authorities involved in water management. A working group on public participation has been established to promote a harmonious and consistent approach nationally for encouraging public participation in the implementation of the WFD, particularly in the context of the river basin management projects, RBMPs, and to develop a common strategy and guidelines. The working group recently met with representatives of environmental NGOs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_480">In addition to specific measures being taken in  the context of the WFD, the effective participation of interested parties will be facilitated by the range of structures put in place, with necessary support, under the local government reform programme which have facilitated a greater input by community and local sectoral interests, including the social partners, into public service policy development at local level.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_481">At regional level, my Department is promoting and funding the establishment by local authorities of inter-authority projects to develop river basin monitoring and management systems and to provide the bulk of the baseline data required for implementation of the directive and for development of river basin management plans. Two such projects have already commenced, in relation to the following regions: south eastern region, Barrow, Nore, Suir, Slaney river basins and others – approved March 2002, operational since September 2002; Shannon River Basin – approved November 2002, operational since January 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_482">Approval of funding has issued in relation to a river basin management project for the eastern region, Avoca-Vartry, Boyne, Nanny, Dartry, Dodder and Liffey, and this project will commence shortly. A project has been approved in principle for the establishment of a river basin management project in relation to the western region, Lough Arrow, Carrowmore, Conn, Corrib, Mask and Rivers Bonet, Clare, Robe, Moy, and Owenmore river basins and others. A proposal for the establishment of a river basin management project for the south west region, which will include County Kerry, has been put forward by Cork County Council and is being examined by my Department.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_483">Central to these projects is a requirement for the development and implementation of a full programme of activity for public information and consultation. A regional seminar on public participation was held on 5 November 2002 in Kilkenny and marked the start of a process to facilitate and support stakeholder involvement in the implementation of the south eastern river basin management project, SERBMP. A workshop on public participation in the SERBMP will be held in Kilkenny on 14 June 2003. The Shannon RBMP and the SERBMP are both developing websites – www.shannonrbd.com and www.serbd.com – that will provide for the dissemination of information to the public at regional level and will have links to the other regional project websites as they come on-line as well as to the national WFD website.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5332">Wetlands include a variety of habitat types. Inventory and survey to date has focused on those considered to be most at risk, notably turloughs, lagoons and raised and blanket bogs. Fens are a remaining priority for survey. An inventory of blanket bogs suitable for designation as natural heritage areas, NHAs, under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 is being carried out this year, and similar consideration will be given to other wetland habitat types in subsequent years. The water framework directive will provide a context for further inventory and research on wetlands.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_491">The new national water conservation programme is designed to identify and substantially reduce the levels of unaccounted for water in Ireland's water supply network. The allocation of more than €276 million for the first round of the programme demonstrates the Government's massive commitment to maximising efficiency in the way our water resources are managed and utilised. Many benefits will arise from infrastructural water conservation among which will  be the day to day savings in water production due to reduced leakage, savings on provision of new capital infrastructure and increased revenue to local authorities due to better metering. Control of leakage will reduce demand on supplies from water treatment plants and will, thereby, allow greater concentration on efficient operation and quality control of the plants by local authorities.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5336">No specific research on the right to housing has been carried out by my Department in response to the draft bill of rights set by the Human Rights Commission in Northern Ireland. The National Economic and Social Council examined the broad issue of social and economic rights in their report, An Investment in Quality: Services, Inclusion and Enterprise. It emphasised the complex philosophical, political, legal and practical issues involved in the identification, creation, in legislating for and vindicating rights, especially social and economic rights. Accordingly, in the new national agreement, Sustaining Progress, particular emphasis is placed on ensuring that standards of public services are identified, monitored and achieved. This requires further substantive improvements in the delivery of quality public services, including housing, and requires a renewed focus on setting and achieving standards for the delivery of such services and monitoring progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_5337">The Government considers that the most appropriate way of addressing the rights issue in housing is to continue the various programmes and fiscal incentives currently in place, to secure the necessary level of funding to support them, to review their operation on an ongoing basis to ensure they are meeting their objectives and to put in place new programmes or measures as required.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_5370">I propose to take Questions Nos. 720 and 734 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_5371">The 1999 affordable housing scheme is one of a range of affordable housing measures which also include the shared ownership scheme, affordable housing delivered through arrangements under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and the affordable housing initiative contained in the new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. Under the 1999 affordable housing scheme a loan limit of €130,000 applies. This limit is currently being considered by my Department in the context of reviewing and defining the eligibility criteria applying to each scheme within the broad range of affordable housing measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_5372">The clawback provision of the 1999 affordable housing scheme was first introduced in June 2000 and is the same for all schemes. The provision for a clawback is necessary to ensure there is no short-term profiteering on the resale of a house provided on a subsidised site. It is not intended to alter this provision.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_493">My Department has entered into discussions with the Irish Mortgage Council, the association representing the Irish lending institutions, on the  question of providing mortgages under the scheme. As a result of these discussions, a subgroup has been established to resolve the technical issues involved in the financial institutions issuing mortgages to successful applicants under the affordable housing schemes. The subgroup will hold its first meeting on 11 June 2003. The arrangements relating to the affordable housing special initiative under Sustaining Progress are being addressed by a steering group, representative of Government and relevant social partners, established to advance the various special initiatives under the agreement.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5379">This case relates to the pollution arising from the discharge of radioactive waste from the plant and its associated facilities to the Irish Sea, the inadequacy of the environmental assessment undertaken by the UK Government in relation to the facility and the failure properly to assess the risk of terrorist attack on the Sellafield site or on international movements of radioactive materials associated with the site.

          <p eId="para_5390">Information published as part of the most recent assessment of local authority housing need undertaken at the end of March 2002 indicates that approximately 60% of households assessed as in need of local authority housing were on the local authority waiting list for less than two years. It is however the  case that some applicants for local authority housing are on waiting lists for longer periods on the basis that their housing need has a relative lower priority compared with the needs of households who have been allocated housing. The relative priority of households on the local authority waiting lists is determined in accordance with the authorities scheme of letting priorities, the making of which is a function reserved to the elected members.</p>
          <p eId="para_5391">The Government has been conscious of the increased level of social housing need and has been responding actively to this situation by expanding on our social and affordable housing output. For example, it is anticipated that total social housing output this year taking account of new local authority housing, vacancies arising in existing houses and output under other social housing measures will meet the needs of approximately 12,000 households compared to just under 8,700 households in 2000.</p>

A sample of these birds was sent for laboratory analysis, the results of which are not yet available. There is no evidence that abnormal amounts of shells and crustaceans were washed ashore prior to the deaths of the sea birds. While very regrettable, the death of 120 birds is not significant in the context of seabird populations in the vicinity and does not give cause for conservation concern. A recent census by staff of my Department on the Great Saltee Island, the nearest large sea bird colony in County Wexford, recorded some 21,000 guillemots and 4,500 razorbills, an increase from the previous census in 2000.</p>

          <p eId="para_5458">The amount of supplement payable depends on which of two categories of diet, for example, lower cost diet or higher cost diet, has been prescribed by the applicant's medical adviser as well as the income of the individual and his or her dependants. Separate rates are payable in respect of child dependants under 18 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_5459">In the case of an adult on a diabetic diet, which is considered a low cost diet, the amount of diet supplement payable is €34.28 less one third of the applicant's income, one sixth in the case of a couple.</p>
          <p eId="para_5460">In the case of an adult on a higher cost diet, the amount of diet supplement is €44.44 less one third of the applicant's income, one sixth in the case of a couple.</p>

          <p eId="para_5462">The rates of diet supplement are reviewed on a regular basis. In addition, in assessing an applicant's income for diet supplement purposes, increases in weekly social welfare payment rates since 1996 are disregarded under current arrangements.</p>

He appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office and the appeals officer considers that an oral hearing is required. This will be arranged as soon as possible. Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers.

          <p eId="para_5469">The fundamental aim of my Department's back to education allowance scheme is to assist people who are unable to get work because of a lack of qualifications or education and who  are caught as a result in a cycle of unemployment and disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_5470">The scheme has given many people who left school early a second chance for education which will improve their prospects for getting employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_5471">In previous years the scheme provided for payment of the allowance to be made to participants for the duration of the course of study, including the summer holiday period. As the allowance was not means tested, participants were permitted to avail of employment during their period while retaining entitlement to the allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_5472">The Independent Estimates Review in its report to the Minister for Finance commented that in many instances students find work during the summer period and it recommended that funding be discontinued for the summer period.</p>
          <p eId="para_5473">This measure is being implemented this summer. This decision applies only to BTEA participants who were in receipt of an unemployment payment prior to participation in the BTEA scheme. All other participants, lone parents and people with disabilities, on the scheme will retain payment during the summer period.</p>
          <p eId="para_5474">Where participants on the scheme who were previously in receipt of an unemployment payment are unable to find employment during the summer period, subject to satisfying the usual qualifying conditions, they may be entitled to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_5475">If all BTEA participants found work, then savings of some €12.5 million would accrue. It should also be noted that BTEA participants who are progressing to the next year of their course or progressing in qualifications will have their BTEA reinstated from the beginning of the new academic year, irrespective of whether they were employed or in receipt of an unemployment payment during the summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_5476">In framing proposals to change elements of the BTEA scheme, I was conscious of the need to ensure that payments were focused on those most at risk from long-term unemployment. I believe that I have ensured, in a situation where priorities had to be set and choices made, that people in the greatest need of assistance under the scheme have been protected.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_502">Farm assist was introduced in April 1999 and replaced the smallholders unemployment assistance scheme. The numbers on that scheme had declined from 9,900 in 1995 to 6,500 in 1998, that is by more than 1,000 per year. the 8,633 now receiving payment under the farm assist scheme in fact reflects a significant reversal of the trend in numbers who benefit from support. As the Deputy is aware, I revised the methodology in assessments last year to take into account current year income due to the impact of the severe weather conditions.</summary>
