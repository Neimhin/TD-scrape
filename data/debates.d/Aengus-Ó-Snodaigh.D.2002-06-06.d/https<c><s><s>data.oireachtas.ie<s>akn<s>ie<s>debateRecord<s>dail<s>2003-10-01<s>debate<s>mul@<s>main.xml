          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">Earlier this year, the Government decided to ban smoking in the workplace. During the summer, a senior Minister publicly disagreed with the collective decision of the Government and his lead was followed by a Minister of State and several backbenchers. On last night's evidence, it appears that the smoke signals coming from the Fianna Fáil workplace seriously undermine the Government decision. This is happening at a time when the newspapers today are filled with a veritable litany of mismanagement of the public's business and money. I do not know whether this is the ultimate smokescreen devised by Fianna Fáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">May I ask the Taoiseach a straight question? Who is in charge in this matter? Can I take it that the Government intends to adhere to its decision and introduce this legislation on 1 January 2004, as it announced during the summer, or are we to have a continuous stream of protest and smoke signals giving confusing messages between now and Christmas? Will the Government adhere to its stated decision and is the nation now to be told that this legislation will take effect on 1 January 2004 to put an end to this matter once and for all?</p>

          <p eId="para_3">From January 2004 smoking will be prohibited in the workplace. The primary purpose of the prohibition is to protect workers and the public from exposure to harmful toxic environmental tobacco smoke. The Minister for Health and Children is proceeding with this important public health initiative which is based on the recommendations of the Report on the Health Effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke in the Workplace which are already in the public domain. The report was prepared by an independent scientific group commissioned by the Office for Tobacco Control and the Health and Safety Authority and was published in January of this year. At that stage, the Minister announced the  ban would take effect from next January, which it will.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">I believe that there is consensus within the international scientific community on the negative health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.</p>

          <p eId="para_9">Some expressed other views about this issue as others in the public domain would do. The prohibition was announced a year in advance of the starting date to allow a reasonable time for employers, businesses and the public to adopt the changes required. To be able to work and socialise in a clean, smoke-free environment will have health benefits for all concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_11">Now that the air has been cleared regarding one matter by the Taoiseach reiterating that the legislation will take effect on 1 January 2004, in respect of the consensus he says exists within the international scientific community which does not seem to be paralleled within the political community of his party, is there to be a compromise in respect of the introduction or phasing in of the legislation because of the pressure of lobby groups, especially on Fianna Fáil backbenchers and Ministers, or is the legislation to be introduced fully, completely and effectively from 1 January 2004 as was the Government announcement when it made its collective decision in the first instance?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_12">I reiterate that from January, smoking will be prohibited in the workplace. The Minister will bring forward the order and the details of that are in the public domain. The Minister said previously that he would listen to all reasoned opinion on the matter but that does not change the principle of this, namely, a ban on smoking in areas that affect workers' health. That is the position.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_13">Waste of taxpayers' money and incompetent management are the hallmarks of the Government. The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General yesterday is one litany of  mismanagement, incompetence and waste. The party that is supposed to be able to run the country is running it into the ground. The worst waste of all is the deal with the religious congregations. Obviously the Taoiseach does not care about mismanagement of taxpayers' money. Many of his elected representatives, not to mention the fellows who visit the tent at the Galway Races, do not bother paying their taxes. How can he seek to defend the deal estimated by the Comptroller and Auditor General to be a liability in the order of €1 billion? How can he seek to dismiss the Comptroller and Auditor General's forensic report in the same fashion as he sought to dismiss the deficiencies in the deal, as I highlighted in the House last February?</p>
          <p eId="para_14">I am interested in the fact that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who was absent from the relevant meeting, has moved this morning to restore his damaged reputation. Finally, in a briefing this morning, he told journalists that Deputy Woods was wrong and that he was not involved in the deal. The report seems to bear out his statement, although the reason he was not involved is a different question. Together with an official from his Department, the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, attended confidential meetings with religious congregations in which the latter were accompanied by solicitors and a senior counsel, during which they did this shameful, secret, negligent and fraudulent deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">In the House yesterday, the Taoiseach misled us about the indemnity deed. Its terms were never debated in this House until Deputy Shortall raised the issue on 20 June, which was after the election and after the deal had been done. That was the first time the matter was raised in the House.</p>

The truth is that the only person who misled the House yesterday was Deputy Shortall. She is well aware that the indemnity was raised, discussed and debated in a number of questions. Deputy Rabbitte is correct that there was an Adjournment Debate in the House on 20 June, but that was 20 June 2002. Deputy Shortall is well aware that there was a full debate on the indemnity because she raised the matter on the Adjournment. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, replied for the Government. This was not the only occasion the matter was raised in the House. Prior to that, on 12 February 2002, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, addressing the Joint Committee on Education and Science, spoke at some length about the agreement between the Government—</p>

More and more patients are being treated on trolleys in corridors. Yesterday, in James Connolly Memorial Hospital 35 patients were on trolleys in corridors. During the summer, trolleys had to be removed from ambulances to provide trolley accommodation for patients in hospital wards. Health boards are facing continuing financial restraints. In the North-Eastern Health Board area this year, to the detriment of older people and people with disabilities, a total of 84,000 home help hours were cut from the 2002 figure. There is clearly no chance of Fianna Fáil fulfilling its commitment to the electorate before May 2002 to clear waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">Why have only half the promised new beds in hospitals been delivered? Why have there been bed closures in public wards, where cuts have continued to apply despite the Government's alleged commitment? Private wards and beds have been virtually immune to this attack. The Taoiseach must recognise that there is great injustice within the health system. I ask him to respond thoughtfully to my question. I do not wish to hear the litany of Government spending on the health services in recent years because there is no correlation between those statistics and the reality for ordinary people depending on the health service.</p>

One of the main reasons for the current pressure, as stated by the hospital, is the delayed discharge from acute hospitals of patients who have completed their acute phase of treatment. They are not discharged from hospitals. The health service has a name for them but I do not particularly like it so I will not use it here.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">The Minister for Health and Children recently allocated €3.8 million to the ERHA for a bed capacity initiative to facilitate the discharge of patients from the acute system. The high number of long-stay patients in acute general hospitals is creating a problem. The Minister has had a number of meetings with the management of those hospitals, even in the past week or two, to try to overcome these difficulties. The ERHA has said it is monitoring the situation. It is actively engaged with hospital management and is working closely with the consultants and nursing staff to try to address that problem. We should not seek to denigrate our health service every hour of every day. The staff are doing an excellent job and are treating enormous numbers of people, thankfully in better facilities than they had previously.</p>

          <p eId="para_92">There is no question about the excellent efforts of those who are providing the service. The question is whether the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children are doing their jobs in meeting the needs of ordinary people. Does the Taoiseach not agree, on this United Nations international day for older  persons, that it is an obscenity that many of our older citizens who are dependent on the public health system are forced to wait for months and, in some cases, years for procedures that will significantly improve the quality of their lives while those who can afford it can buy access to the same health system in a matter of days or weeks? Will the Taoiseach confirm that he is prepared to tackle the unjust and immoral two tier system of health care delivery that perpetuates this injustice and this unacceptable approach to health care?</p>

          <p eId="para_95">It is based on a policy of having more consultant led services and moving away from the traditional system of provision through junior hospital doctors. There will be more consultants and they will not, as has happened over the years, be in the same position within both public and private hospitals. That is one of the main reform elements of the policy. With regard to older people, I agree that the new community nursing units proposed by several health boards should be completed as quickly as possible. Over the past few years an additional 550 beds have been provided as well as 1,250 day places for older people. We should continue to improve in that area and resources should continue to be devoted to it every year. The Minister of State, Deputy Callely, recently outlined his proposals in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">Large amounts of money have been allocated to increased nursing home subventions, which also help older people in society, while approximately €100 million has been allocated to home help to support people in the community, including older people. These are important initiatives which the Government will continue to implement and, where we can, improve the service.</p>

        </question>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_87">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_101">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a statement to the House on the implementation of the agreed programme for Government between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. Our programme for Government is both clear in intent and specific in detail. It is the agreed agenda for this partnership Government over five full years.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">In regard to the query about elements of the programme for which my Department is responsible, implementation of the programme for Government is the responsibility of the Government collectively and of individual Ministers in respect of their areas of responsibility. My Department derives its mandate from my role as head of Government and, as such, it is involved to some degree in virtually all aspects of the work of the Government across the range of Departments. It provides support to me as Taoiseach and to the Government through the Government secretariat, the Cabinet committee system and its involvement in key policy areas and initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">The key areas for which my Department is responsible in terms of the agreed programme for Government can be broadly summarised as follows: supporting the development and implementation of policy in a co-ordinated way across Departments, including servicing the activities of relevant Cabinet committees; working with the British Government and the pro-Agreement parties to achieve the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects; co-ordinating the e-Government initiative to bring about an expansion in the range and quality of on-line Government services and ensuring that Ireland's key objectives in the European Union are carried forward in the context of my role as a member of the European Council and the forthcoming Irish Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">Our overriding priority, as set out in the programme for Government, is to secure lasting peace in Northern Ireland and we have worked intensively towards this objective. The Government, in partnership with the British Government and the pro-Agreement parties, is continuing to work for the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the restoration of devolved Government to Northern Ireland. The parties have indicated their commitment to resolving the outstanding issues as quickly as possible so we can proceed with early elections. The Govern ment is committed to working with all sides to ensure that elections go ahead and that an effective executive and assembly are returned.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">On European affairs, we honoured our commitment to submit the Nice treaty on enlargement to the people in a referendum in a way which addressed the concerns of the people as expressed during the previous referendum and in the national forum on Europe. We are committed to playing a full part in the European Convention and the Europe-wide debate on the future shape of the European Union, which is being spearheaded in part by the work of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Roche.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">With regard to social partnership, a new national agreement, Sustaining Progress, was negotiated and is seen as a reasonable basis for continuing the partnership process. In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, the review of models of participation in the social partnership process to examine ways of maximising both the efficiency of the process and the potential contribution of the diverse and vibrant community and voluntary sectors has been completed. The community and voluntary pillar of social partnership has been expanded and it now has 15 member organisations which have endorsed Sustaining Progress, six individual members and nine organisations in the strands of older people, disability, housing, children, rural, local-voluntary and care.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">Our commitment to funding a programme of data gathering on social indicators, to ensure that policies are developed on the basis of sound information, has already been addressed with the publication of the report of the steering group on social and equality statistics. Building on this report, the statistical potential of administrative records group was established. The group has now reported. The report gives a more detailed analysis of the data holdings of six Departments and makes recommendations for data developments in each of the Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">Progress on the Government programme is kept constantly under review. For every full year of the last Government's term of office we published an annual progress report and in June we published the first annual progress report of the current administration. As in previous years, the report was put together to a large extent by my advisory staff. In most instances, they sought material from other Departments, largely through ministerial advisers, and they edited and redrafted this material to fit the chosen format for the progress report. Accordingly, there were no additional costs accruing to my Department, in terms of staff or other matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">The Government Press Office distributed the document to the national and local media in the same way all reports are disseminated to the press. Arrangements were also made to ensure that copies of the report were made available to each Member of the Oireachtas on the recommencement of  the House. A full copy of the report can also be accessed on the website of the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">That will have to be examined in a budgetary light. As the Deputy is aware, last year we were not able to extend eligibility, but the matter will be looked at again as part of this year's budgetary process.</p>

          <p eId="para_116">Substantial progress has been made on hospital waiting lists. The last figures issued showed substantial decreases across all areas of hospital waiting lists. While their elimination is an enormous challenge, the Government is still doing its best, with staff, resources and additional beds put into hospitals to deal with the issue. In the order of 98,000 more people have availed of hospital services. Keeping waiting lists down is an ongoing challenge, but the last figures were encouraging.</p>

I am now told that it will not happen until 2006. Second, when will we see the establishment of the greater Dublin area land use and transport authority? There is no sign of the legislation. Third, when will we see the dedicated traffic corps promised within six months of the Government taking power? Fourth, what is the current status of the Government's programme for regional decentralisation? When is an announcement likely? When will public servants be transferred to the chosen towns?</p>

          <p eId="para_118">The Chair is reluctant to intervene in the nature of questions, but such detailed questions would be more appropriate to the line Minister with responsibility. In general terms, it is fair for the Taoiseach to answer, but it is not reasonable to expect him to answer detailed questions that are, strictly speaking, the responsibility of line Ministers.</p>

          <p eId="para_119">I will make brief replies. On decentralisation, the Department of Finance will introduce proposals before Christmas. The committee responsible has completed its work and has made preliminary recommendations to the Minister. On the traffic corps, both the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have been working on proposals. On the integrated ticketing proposals, this is a complex area. It is hoped to introduce proposals in the next year. The process is a complex one, but the Minister is committed to bringing forward proposals. On the land use Bill, as stated in reply to the question on legislation yesterday, the decision has been made to have a policy review and perhaps to proceed in another way. There is a number of Bills in the area and the proposal is to integrate them and bring them forward in a policy review. The Ministers, Deputies Cullen and Brennan, have been dealing with that.</p>

          <p eId="para_121">The Deputy should give the Minister credit for the progress made on penalty points and road safety. Anyone who was around the country in the summer will have seen the enormous infrastructural work going on. The road plans have been there for a long time, but with the implementation of those plans in many parts of the country we are now not too far from the vision of people in this House ten or 20 years ago of a major road from the Border to Rosslare. That was the big plan, but there were no resources to buy the land or design the roads. With the exception of the 11km road around Dundalk, which will shortly commence, the road will go all the way to Dublin, linking up with the port tunnel. There is also the enormous project through Ashford, Rathnew and the Glen of the Downs. These are major projects which have been started, not to mention—</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_128">May I ask the Taoiseach two questions? Has the Cabinet carried out any analysis of the procedures followed whereby the intent of major contractors appears to be to get in on the tender ladder, following which costs escalate wildly? An analysis of works already done and the outturn costs as against the tender costs submitted would prove interesting. There is a need for effective management in implementation of tender costs accepted rather than projects being delivered for wildly exaggerated prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">Has the Taoiseach given any consideration to the common good in respect of major projects which are often held up for long periods by objections, spurious or otherwise, to An Bord Pleanála? For example, Enterprise Energy bringing a major gas pipeline ashore is clearly in the common good. While cognisance has to be taken of legitimate objections by residents and so on, the Government should be able to make a decision in the common good in cases that are of major national import. Has the Taoiseach given any consideration to that issue in the context of the implementation of the programme for Government?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_106">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_130">I share many of Deputy Kenny's views in the area of public accounts reports and have done so for many years. The huge difference between tender prices and the outturn has been a major issue. What traditionally happens is that contractors come in on a price and then try to get all the extras. In fairness, a number of the contracts are now coming in on time. The proposal by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, which will take effect in the next few months, to issue the tender price against the actual amount spent on a monthly or quarterly basis will show people what happens. There is also the decision to bring in outside contractors. For example, the Kilcock-Kinnegad project is being carried out by a Spanish contractor and a number of other contractors.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">The Minister for Transport has informed me that all new contracts will be fixed price contracts in order to prevent the extras. The extras have been a feature of contracts. Lest I be attacked by members of CIF, in fairness it is not that there are not arguments for additional charges for such matters as road design or changes that are justified, but it should not mean endless disputes and discussions. Fixed price contracts tie it down far better and that means tying down the specifications at an early stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">On the question of the critical infrastructural Bill, the Government is considering it and believes it is necessary. We have looked at what happens in a number of other countries where there are large contracts. My view on this, and we have yet to finalise it in Government, is that one cannot do it for many projects. If legislation such as this were put on the Statute Book, future Members could be lobbied left, right and centre that everything was covered in the critical infras tructural Bill. If the Bill is drawn narrowly, that is the correct approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">Recently I had a meeting with the president of Shell who is concerned because it has literally put hundreds of millions of euro into that project. He asked if it was possible to have this legislation in place before he meets his deadline. I told him that was not possible or realistic. It is crucial for his company to start work for next summer's season. I said that, with the best will in the world, it is not possible in the timescale required to pass a major Bill that has not yet been drafted in the Department and has to come to Cabinet and to the Oireachtas. I gave him my best advice which was that he would have go through the existing process. Mayo County Council has been supportive and from my reading of the judgment, which I read before I met the president of Shell, An Bord Pleanála also seemed to be supportive. While he is the person who has to sign the allocation of a few billion euro to this project, he is loath to do so unless he believes there is a reasonable prospect of success. I could not give him a guarantee that he would get through the planning process. I did say that the country viewed this as a good project but he has to comply with the planning regulations. He did not inform me of the final decision but said there was a world board meeting in October where that decision would be made.</p>

Will it have time to complete its first round of work before December, given the volume and complexity of that work?

          <p eId="para_139">On the housing issue – I hope the Taoiseach will agree the community platform is still part of the partnership process – the Irish council for social housing is calling for the release of State lands for social housing in addition to land promised by the Government in July for affordable housing.

There are those in the partnership process who take this matter seriously and perhaps there are other groups who feel they should be included and there is a process for doing that. There are many within the present make-up in all the pillars who have a knowledge and interest in the environment. I am not opposed to anything the Deputy has said about that and the putting forward of their views. In fairness, the Deputy must acknowledge the legislative base and initiatives being brought forward. The major challenge of Kyoto must also be acknowledged. These are issues we must continue to work on but a huge amount has been done.</p>

In Labre Park only one parent ever has completed the FETAC equivalent of the junior certificate, and that was recently.

In regard to the Glen of the Downs project cited by the Taoiseach, is he aware that it has been the subject of long delays, the cost overrun is double the original contract price and the short piece of road covered by the project was subject to 16,000 items of correspondence between the local authority and the contractor—</p>

          <p eId="para_152">In regard to what the Taoiseach said about hospital waiting lists and in view of the fact that there is no significant improvement in them and that the Government is way off course in regard to its health strategy – only half of the new beds have been provided and hundreds of beds are closed – is he going to consider providing funding for the hospitals before the winter, a crucial time when hospitals are under pressure, to alleviate the great suffering that may be caused as a result of Government cutbacks and to ensure that beds are available to those people who desperately need them during the winter months?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_190">I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 21, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">As Deputies will recall, I reported to the House on 21 May last on the arrangements in place in my Department to monitor the implementation of the new agreement Sustaining Progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The inaugural plenary meeting, which I attended together with the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, took place in Dublin Castle on 18 July and included a presentation by the Department of Finance on the medium term economic outlook. I reminded the social partners of the need to maintain our focus on competitiveness, and of the Government's strong commitment to speed up the delivery of critical infrastructure. A detailed progress report on the implementation of Sustaining Progress was presented to the social partners at that meeting. A copy of the report has been laid in the Oireachtas Library. The next plenary meeting is  scheduled to take place in Dublin Castle on 24 October, the agenda for which remains to be finalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">My Department chairs the steering group, which has overall responsibility for the management of the implementation of the programme. The steering group held its fifth meeting on Monday last, 29 September.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">In addition to the plenary meeting, of course, I also meet with representatives of individual social partner organisations on a regular basis. In this context, I addressed the biennial conference of ICTU on 4 July and outlined the Government's proposals to make state-owned lands available for affordable housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">In regard to those community and voluntary organisations which have not ratified Sustaining Progress, Departments have been advised that there may be areas where the expertise of these organisations or their constituent members will be relevant to the policy making and implementation process. These organisations may be invited to participate on particular committees or working groups in the light of their particular expertise. This will, of course, be determined by the nature of the task or issue in question and is primarily a matter for each Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">The interim pay agreement which forms part of Sustaining Progress provides for the continuation, with an enhanced role, of the National Implementation Body to ensure delivery of the industrial relations stability and peace provisions of the new agreement. The body, which is chaired by my Department and represents Government, IBEC, CIF and ICTU, meets as necessary to review ongoing disputes of major national importance. Meetings of the body also provide an opportunity for informal discussion of the broader issues relating to the social partnership process, from the employer and trade union perspectives. The NIB has met on a number of occasions since the ratification of Sustaining Progress in the context of industrial action impending or being taken across a range of employments.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">As I explained in reply to a similar question from the Deputy on 29 January last, the National Economic and Social Development Office, NESDO, comprises the National Economic and Social Council, NESC; the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF; and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, NCPP. Legislation underpinning the establishment of NESDO is currently at Second Stage and when enacted will place the three bodies on a statutory basis as part of the office.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">The primary role of NESDO is to add value to the work of its constituent bodies by creating the conditions under which synergies can be realised, joint projects pursued and the potential for duplication minimised. The office promotes the development of a shared vision for realising these goals and encouraging the constituent bodies to maximise their efforts through collaborative policy development initiatives. In particular, the office performs its role by facilitating and pro moting complementary programmes of research, analysis and discussion by the NESC, NESF and NCPP; providing shared administration and support services for the three constituent bodies; and submitting to Government reports, recommendations or conclusions by a constituent body and arranging for their publication.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">In regard to the National Economic and Social Council, a new council has recently been appointed by Government. The council will continue the work on housing policy begun by the previous council. The council will determine the remainder of its work programme for 2003 and 2004 as soon as possible. This will be done in co-operation with the other bodies in the National Economic and Social Development Office, the NESF and the NCPP.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">Sustaining Progress indicates that the national centre for partnership and performance, which operates under the aegis of my Department, will play an increasing role in supporting the process of extending and deepening partnership and performance in the workplace. I have outlined the work programme of the national centre for partnership and performance in the House on a number of previous occasions and its most recent bulletin, setting out the ongoing activities of the centre in detail, was circulated to all Deputies in June of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">The NCPP is currently preparing for the inaugural session of a forum on the workplace of the future, which will take place in Dublin Castle on 6 and 7 October. The forum will develop a national dialogue on how workplaces in both the public and private sectors can adapt to competitive pressures, improve the delivery of services and respond to the changing needs of employees. The Government has asked the centre to consult and engage widely with employers and employees, managers, unions, labour market and organisational change experts and all those with an interest in shaping the workplace of the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">To assist this process, I launched a consultative paper, prepared by the NCPP, entitled Modernising our Workplaces to Deliver Ireland's Competitive and Social Vision, in Government Buildings in July of this year. The paper, which has been circulated to a wide range of organisations and is freely available on the NCPP website, invites those who wish to influence developments in relation to the workplace of the future to contribute their views, experiences and ideas and to provide the forum with a framework for discussion and responses.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">To provide the forum with the detail necessary to inform these deliberations, the NCPP has also requested the Economic and Social Research Institute to carry out three separate surveys to ascertain the attitudes, experiences and expectations of more than 5,000 employees, all 572 public sector employers and more than 1,600 private sector employers.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_204">That is a very long reply. Will the Taoiseach give me three examples of public service improvements which have been achieved or agreed in return for the benchmarking process to date? I remind the Taoiseach that on 19 July at Dublin Castle he said that in the current economic climate, the payment of benchmarking awards poses a challenge for the credibility of social partnership. Given that the economic climate in which we are operating has deteriorated since then, what has changed that the Government intends to make the awards without any visible evidence of improved efficiency or a better public service for which the taxpayer is paying?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_142">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_205">I have outlined that it was negotiated with the public service unions on benchmarking that part of the agreement would be paid as part of a normal round and that the remaining parts would be paid on the basis of talks and discussions which are ongoing within the bodies and the various unions. There is no doubt that they were large amounts of money. The figure for 2003 is €522 million and it will be €775 million in 2004. In addition, the estimated costs of implementing the general round increases under Sustaining Progress is €538 million in 2004 and over €900 million in 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">In the discussions, which went on for some time, it was made absolutely clear to and was agreed by the social partners that there would have to be real reform in various areas and the process by which that was to take place was also agreed. Performance verification groups have been established in all areas by the various Civil Service Departments and agencies, including the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The groups have independent chairs and equal numbers of management, trade unions and independent members.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">All the public service organisations must prepare action plans detailing the modernisation they will implement in their organisations in return for the payments provided for. In all these areas, questions to Ministers will show the long list of areas which is being discussed. The action plans must be accepted by the performance verification groups as being satisfactory. The groups will then decide, on the basis of the progress reports submitted to them, if the level of progress achieved warrants the payment of the relevant pay increases. It is important to note that payment of the increases provided is not automatic. The agreement provides that the real outputs are delivered before the wage increases are made. That is the way in which the discussions are proceeding.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">In reply to the general question the Deputy asked, the last agreement and this one have seen progress in the area of changing technologies across the public service. I have been involved in the system for some time and, as Minister for  Labour, I remember rows about moving away from typewriters, which seem ridiculous now. However, the staff have now agreed to move forward by accepting technology <i>per se,</i> which is one improvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">Other improvements include longer opening hours in Departments and agencies than previously and there are far more flexible work practices. I am not saying everything is perfect or right, but Ministers have detailed lists of areas which must be discussed before these amounts can be paid. The reports back from my Cabinet colleagues is that these discussions are meaningful and the process is proving to be a worthwhile exercise. However, I cannot say where it will end up until those discussions are finished.</p>

What proportion of the 10,000 houses might be constructed on the three plots of land which were allocated for the purpose?</p>

          <p eId="para_212">I promise Deputy Mitchell I will deal with the carry-over question he reminded me of. I know Labre Park well, although I am not aware of the details of the CE scheme, and I will mention it. There has been a range of educational projects across the Traveller community to assist parents and children which, to the best of my knowledge, included Labre Park. There were extensive arrangements for providing children with education and after school care as well as for assisting the adults. I will pass the CE scheme issue to my colleagues and make them aware of Deputy Mitchell's comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">In reply to Deputy Rabbitte, the Government's response to the housing initiative is being pursued as a matter of urgency. It is a very important part of the programme on a number of fronts.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">On the land issue, there are four sites, one in Kildare, one in Meath and two in Dublin. The title of the land is currently being transferred legally. The local authorities concerned are drawing up plans for the density of houses to be provided in these areas. Most importantly, the Government is working with the social partners to find precise terms under the initiative, including the eligibility criteria as to who will get these houses. It was designed for people who in the normal way would have been expected to buy their own house but because of market forces are not in that position. These discussions are currently taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">I would say to Deputy Rabbitte that within Government Departments and local authorities further land banks are being looked at to try to support further the initiative. I do not think the  present sites will cater for the whole range of housing. Efforts are continuing to try to acquire more land.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">When the Taoiseach refers to further land banks and the promise to provide 10,000 houses under Sustaining Progress, is that to be State land as suggested by the Irish Council for Social Housing at a plenary meeting recently? It suggested that State land should be provided. However, the local authorities are saying that in the next two years they can only envisage the prospect of 400 units of social housing being possible. Apart from his fine words, how will the Taoiseach deliver on the 10,000 houses promised? If this is not delivered, how can he expect other parties to the agreement to keep their side of the bargain as this is a crucial part of the agreement?</p>

Is he aware that one of the organisations in the community and voluntary pillar of the partnership, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, has stated that in the critical areas of social inclusion Sustaining Progress contains no real commitments, no targets, no timetables and no new resources? Finally, is he aware that the same body stated that when it challenged critical aspects of the plan members were clearly invited to walk out the door? How does the Taoiseach respond to this question? Surely this is unacceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_220">In reply to Deputy Ó Caoláin, social and affordable housing programmes this year cost €1.7 billion. I would like to hear a proposal on how to obtain the remainder of the money. That is not small money by any means. There are approximately 13,000 houses included in the proposals, which is a substantial number. The initiatives taking place in local authorities under Part 5 and the proportion of schemes being drawn up by local authorities to provide affordable housing are very good. Affordable housing is expensive but it is still involving an enormous number of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">Some 10,000 houses was the target set by the social partners. The Government indicated it would do all it could to provide as many houses as possible. We have already provided a considerable amount of State land. However, local authorities should also contribute and we are discussing with them how this can be done. There are several other initiatives which are considering capping development land and so on. Sites are being provided now. Discussions on the criteria are ongoing. Titles are being exchanged and we are trying to acquire additional land. An amount  of work is taking place and the more we can do on the supply side the better. It appears that the number provided this year will be approximately 60,000.</p>

It would not make much sense for the Government to introduce legislation now that might be changed after the High Court judgment. We hope to receive that judgment, as we are ready to move on the legislation. We have to take the High Court's deliberations into account. We will be able to move immediately if the judgment is not appealed, but we will have to wait if there is an appeal.

        <heading>Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse: Statements.</heading>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_278">
          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_356">I welcome the opportunity to address the House today on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and related issues. I remind the House that the Government is the first in the history of the State to listen to the victims of abuse, to apologise to them on behalf of the State and to take positive action to redress the wrongs inflicted on them in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">I greatly regret that Ms Justice Laffoy reached the conclusion that she could no longer continue as chairperson of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. I have previously indicated that Ms Justice Laffoy's resignation was a matter of considerable surprise to me and to the Government. I have expressed my thanks for the commitment Ms Justice Laffoy has shown in carrying out her role as chairperson and I am happy to repeat that appreciation in the House today.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse is one element of the Government's strategy for redressing institutional abuse of children. It is a dual structure to meet the differing needs of the victims. The investigation committee carries out detailed inquiries, akin to trials, into allegations of abuse. This is the part of the commission that is currently being reviewed. The commission also has a confidential committee which hears, in total confidence, the accounts of abuse victims who do not wish to have their allegations investigated. It is for the victim of abuse to choose which committee he or she wishes to attend. The confidential committee continues to function and, at this stage, has heard the accounts of more than 700 witnesses, approximately two thirds of all those who applied to that committee. The only element of the Government's initiatives that is currently under review is the investigation committee of the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">When the commission was established in 2000 it was the Government's intention that it carry out its work free of the adversarial environment and legal formality of the courts and that it would be able to deliver its report within two years. That is what was promised to the survivors. As time went on it became increasingly obvious that this could not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">Following the final deadline for receipt of statements in July 2002 the commission indicated  that the total applications to the investigation committee was 1,957. It then became apparent, given the rate of progress at the committee that if all these cases were to be heard individually the commission would not be in a position to deliver a final report for at least a further eight to 11 years. This timeframe was provided to my Department by the commission and was based on the resources it had at that time. A report by the commission in that timeframe would be far too late for many of those for whom it was established.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">Concern about the progress of the commission was shared by survivor groups who urged my Department to take action to ensure that the report of the commission be delivered as soon as possible. They made the point to me and to officials in my Department that some of their members had already been waiting for 30 to 40 years for validation. They also outlined to me the number of people who had died since the Taoiseach had made his apology.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">In addition to the long delay and the consequences of this for survivors of abuse there was also serious concern that publication of the final report would be challenged by alleged abusers claiming they did not have due process in a court of law.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">The likely delays, the doubts about the ability to publish a full report and the real probability that the State would have to pay legal costs in the order of €200 million contributed to the necessity to review the investigation committee. There are those who say cost should not be a concern and that doing justice is beyond petty considerations of money. In my view cost has to be an issue and having regard to it does not prejudice having justice done. What has to be achieved is a process that delivers justice effectively, efficiently and, most particularly, without undue delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">Once I had concerns about the operation of the investigation committee it was my public duty to bring them to the attention of the Government rather than allow the situation to continue unchallenged. The commission is the creation of the Oireachtas following proposals from the Government. It is my duty and that of the Government to return to the Oireachtas when we believe reform is necessary to achieve the objectives of the original legislation. That is what the review of the commission was, and is, about.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">The purpose of the review is to find a way through which the mandate given to the investigation committee under the legislation can be carried out in a more efficient, cost-effective and timely way. As part of that process consideration was given to the issue of the additional powers that could be given to the investigation committee to facilitate its operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The first phase of the review was completed and a report submitted to Government. That report, contrary to what has been stated in the House by a number of people, was accepted by the Government and the recommendations contained in it are currently reflected in draft legis lation being prepared by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. However, following from that review, further amendments are being considered, which are likely to result in further changes to the way in which the investigation committee operates.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">The Government also considers, in light of the Supreme Court judgment in the Meenan case and the current case taken by the Christian Brothers in the High Court, that it is prudent to have regard to those judgments in framing amending legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Consultation with the main survivor groups is continuing. A number of meetings have been held with these groups, the latest of which took place on Thursday, 25 September. The meetings have been extremely constructive and useful to me in considering how best to proceed. There is a strong sense that we share a common objective, ensuring that the investigation committee can achieve its mandate in an effective and timely way. It is my intention that the revised remit of the investigation committee of the commission will be legislated for by spring 2004 and sooner if we have the judgments from the Supreme Court and the High Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The Government has appointed Mr. Seán Ryan SC as chairman designate to the commission. Mr. Ryan comes with a wealth of experience from his practice in law. In addition, he comes with very direct experience of the issues of past child abuse, having chaired the compensation advisory committee. This committee drew up recommendations for financial awards to abuse victims under the residential institutions redress scheme. Mr. Ryan also acted as counsel to the Ferns inquiry. I assure Mr. Ryan and the House that my Department will continue to give every assistance to the commission in carrying out its mandate.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_280" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_371">The Government has requested Mr. Ryan immediately to undertake his own independent review of the operation of the investigation committee. This review is to be completed within a period of eight weeks. Should it identify a requirement for further amendments to the legislation they will be considered by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">Originally, it had been intended that the redress scheme would follow on the completion of the work of the commission. However, it became clear that the lack of a scheme was seriously impeding the work of the commission. The Government moved to establish a redress scheme and the necessary legislation was enacted last year. The redress board was formally established in December and it has received 2,000 applications for redress. To date, it has processed almost 200 of these cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">There is continuing comment about the agreement reached with CORI in respect of its contribution to the redress scheme. It should be made clear that before any agreement was made with  CORI on its contribution to the scheme, the Government had already decided that a redress scheme would be established regardless of any contribution. It was better for the State that congregations make a contribution to the scheme than have them make none at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Some commentators have argued that there should have been an agreement on an even split of the costs of redress. No one can say exactly what proportion of liability should fall on the State and what should fall on the religious congregations. The only way strict legal liability could be determined was by putting every single case through a full court procedure, which is unacceptable from a victim's point of view. There are comparable circumstances in Canada where, based on court decisions in civil abuse cases, the state was held to have the greater liability. Since then, the state has agreed to accept responsibility for up to 70% of the cost of awards. The church authorities have accepted a liability for 30% but that has been capped at a total of Can$25 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">In our case, the State would have to bear a significant amount of liability, bearing in mind the following: in many cases of abuse, the abused children had been taken away from their homes by the State and put into the care of religious and others who abused them; in many cases, State agencies knew or ought to have known that institutions were being run using abusive regimes; some institutions covered by the redress scheme were run by the State and therefore the State was 100% liable for those cases; and in many cases the State turned its back on its responsibility to cherish the children of the nation and left many children in the custody of institutions which did not care for them properly. It is true that in cases of sexual and severe physical abuse, the State would have a reduced amount of legal liability because it had no way of knowing that this kind of abuse was taking place. However, these are the minority of cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">It is noticeable that those criticising the redress scheme and the indemnity agreement have offered no alternative to the course of action followed. I assume this is because the only alternative to the agreement would have required the State and/or the victims to sue the congregations through the courts. This was unacceptable from the victims' points of view for the following reasons. They would have to face traumatic cross-examination by lawyers. It would take many years for the courts to finish hearing the estimated 2,000 to 4,000 cases. Having gone through that trauma, the likelihood is that many of the victims' cases would have failed in the courts because of the lapse of time since the abuse occurred. At all times, the concern for the victims had priority in the Government's considerations. In addition to the concern for the victims, it was pointed out from a legal perspective that because much of the congregations' property is tied up in trusts it could not have been taken away even by the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Furthermore, the only alternative to the agreement was unacceptable because congregations are not like companies and do not have separate legal personality and may not have liability for the illegal acts of members of the congregations. The legal fees would have been enormous. Additionally, some of the congregations which contributed had few or no claims against them while others had very many, and therefore the congregations with many claims might have been bankrupted long before all their victims were compensated. If any portion of liability falls on the State – even if it is only 1% liability – victims are entitled to recover 100% of their damages against the State. In order to recover the difference, the State would have to sue the religious separately, thereby starting another batch of thousands of court cases with no guarantee of success at the end of the process and further huge legal costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The mechanics of negotiating the indemnity agreement consisted of two elements, namely an agreement in principle on the amount of money the religious would contribute and detailed legal discussions on how the agreement would be worded. My predecessor, Deputy Woods, announced the Government's agreement in principle on the amount of the contribution on 30 January 2002. This was to be €128 million, made up of cash and property. He announced that in return for this contribution, the State would indemnify the congregations against court cases by victims. This indemnity covers only those cases which could go to the redress board and is not open-ended as some people have suggested.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">After the Department had instructed the Office of the Attorney General about the agreement in principle, that office went about putting this policy decision into legal effect. The lawyers for the congregations proposed a draft agreement which was not at first acceptable to the State officials. Both sides argued for some months and many changes were made which were favourable to the State, including the following: a breakdown of the components of the €128 million contribution, which was much more favourable to the State at the end of the negotiations; a provision that the State can refuse any property offered by the congregations, which has occurred; if the congregations cannot offer enough suitable property, the remainder is to be made up in cash; a provision that if cases go to court instead of the redress board, the State will be able to direct the religious as to how they conduct their defence; and a provision that if the State wants to settle a case and the religious want to fight it, the religious will lose their indemnity.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">What will the overall cost be? The hype surrounding the redress scheme is similar to that surrounding the Army deafness claims, which eventually cost the State far less than had been predicted by many. We do not believe the overall amount paid by the redress board will exceed the higher end of the original cost estimate of €508  million. The Government based its estimate on the number of people who signalled an interest in attending the committees of the child abuse commission, plus an allowance for those who would not attend the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The Comptroller and Auditor General's report suggests that the number of cases will be greatly in excess of the number that the Government expects. He bases his belief on a complex series of assumptions and predictions but recognises that "any estimate of future liabilities arising out of the redress scheme is made in circumstances of uncertainty". As of now, 2,000 cases have been lodged. Only time will reveal the final outcome, but I am confident the overall amount paid out by the redress board will be closer to the estimate of €508 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">In 1998 the Government embarked on a process to bring healing and closure to those of our citizens who suffered abuse while in institutional care. We have been true to our word and remain steadfastly committed to that cause.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_281">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_383">As legislators, we are the custodians of a country and a people who lived through centuries of violence, war and terror. As custodians, we have a solemn obligation to investigate a vile episode of a generally proud national history, namely, the sadistic terror inflicted on children by their elders, teachers, carers in religious institutions, the respectable pillars of society and by their State-funded, State-appointed betters. In saying that, however, I can speak only for the Fine Gael Party. It is regrettable for those now-adult children and the country that the Government has no similar sense of public or moral duty. The Laffoy crisis has become another crude example of a Government inspired not by any higher calling but by rank expediency. It is a Government whose actions in so many areas of public life reveal it to be in terminal decline, unworthy of public office, shameless, leaderless, directionless and, in light of the Laffoy crisis, quite soulless.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">I want to nail the lie that the Laffoy crisis is about cost as this is absolutely not the case. It beggars belief that a Government which is recklessly and ruinously losing the country billions of euro is seized by an attack of fiscal rectitude on this matter. The Laffoy crisis is not only about money, it is also a crisis of leadership and truth, neither of which can be found on the benches opposite.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">In the handling of the Laffoy case the Taoiseach, who made a proper apology, has, as on so many issues, proved to be a weak chairman and not a chief. He and his Ministers have failed spectacularly to rise to what is a matter of national honour and deep psychological import. Relatively few issues in modern politics take us to that higher and more complex plane. The war in Iraq was one such, when the Government sold the country's soul, and it is doing it again with the Laffoy commission. If the country can afford the Flood, Mahon and Moriarty tribunals it can  surely find a way to give those broken by the State the voice we took from them, the hearing we denied them and the comfort and compassion we refused them. To do less would damage these men and women, perhaps irreparably, and would demean our humanity and our nationhood.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">To judge from the evidence to date, it is impossible for the Taoiseach to be determined on anything. Why does there appear to be some obstruction within the Government parties to the extent of being determined to deny these men and women their day? They are reasonable, heartbroken people with a deeply sensitive personal story to tell. Many, by their own admission, are barely hanging on. For too long they were a silent presence in our world. They were betrayed and they felt betrayed. We owe them, but instead of using money as a means of further State-sponsored violence to them, we need as a nation to give them their say and to ask their forgiveness. Like it or not, as a society, we are all culpable. We are all to some extent guilty. As adults in Cork and Dublin have testified, and will remember from their childhood, even the most idle threat of being sent to the Good Shepherds or Artane was enough to make them good children, not just for the day but for the week. So at some level we knew, yet we did nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The Government, acting in our name, now has a chance to transform these people's experience of the State, to respect the totality of their story, recognise the immensity of their suffering and make reparation for the damage done to them in institutions run, to our deep shame, in the name of the people of this country. If it does, it can redeem the nation for its neglect of these children and its crime against their humanity. It can do so, but to its shame, and ours, it will not. Instead, it appears the Government intends to use the lie of costs to mediate these personal tragedies, this national disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">The Taoiseach says he is sorry. He was right to apologise and to establish a commission of inquiry under the chairmanship of a person of the eminence of Ms Justice Laffoy. He was also right to give the investigation committee of the commission the mandate to carry out a "thorough and comprehensive inquiry". The commission was also to have available to it "the resources and all the legal powers and protections it needs to do this."</p>
          <p eId="para_389">I do not have access to all the papers at the disposal of the Minister for Education and Science, but I had the privilege of being a Minister of State in the Department 20 years ago. I am aware of the internal difficulties in having files of any description brought forward. However, this does not answer the difficulties encountered by a person of the brilliance and technical forensic skills of Ms Justice Laffoy who says she was worn out by statements of contrition by the Department when, over a period of 25 months, she waited in vain for material to be produced she had requested on behalf of the commission. It beggars belief that the Minister did not use his  direction and authority to ensure that the mandate outlined by the Taoiseach and established by this House was implemented, especially given that a number of those abused in the religious institutions referred to have passed on.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The Government said it would provide the necessary resources and facilities and allow the commission to carry out a thorough investigation, yet the person mandated to chair the commission felt obliged to resign because of what appears to be obstruction from within the Department under investigation. That is a terrible story. I do not know if the Minister will be able to address this aspect when he replies to questions raised in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">Ms Justice Laffoy was a bright light in the High Court. She never said she could or would not do the job, nor did she say she was not able to do it. However, she made a series of proposals to the Minister outlining how the job could be finished. The response from the Government was inadequate. It means that a number of quagmires have arisen, including difficulties over the status of information given in confidence during the four years' work of the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">Is the new chairman of the commission to receive the same kind of treatment as Ms Justice Laffoy? If he submits a similar request for facilities to finish the job will the Government treat him in the same way it treated his predecessor? Is there to be an increasing number of statements of contrition but no action, or will the Taoiseach admit the Government got it horribly wrong and commit, this time in good faith, to making the inquiry work once and for all so that justice can be seen to be done for those who were abused and, in a minority of cases, those wrongfully accused of abuse? Their lives have also been consumed by this sorry state of affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">If the Government has trouble staying true to its word on this occasion it should remember an image from the series "States of Fear" that haunts every parent who saw it. It is of a small boy, perhaps five or six years of age, being woken from his sleep by his religious abuser. For most of us it is an image, but for others it is their childhood reality and a life sentence.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">If the Government starts to lose its bottle it should remember that all this happened, if not with the benediction of the State then with at least the State's tacit acceptance that this was how it was. Surely, decades later, it is grossly immoral for the State to deny any of these children the chance to tell their truth, to relate their terrible story and, in some small way, to leave it behind. If the State denies them that right, it proves that we still feel nothing for them, have learned nothing from their experience and changed not one inch in our attitude to State-sponsored terror.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">I understand that the concept of sampling referred to by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is no longer being considered. This is critically important. The Minister's example of a person having 57 allegations of abuse against him or her and it not being necessary to hear more than five  or six of them is not valid. If the tenth or 15th were reported to the Department of Education and Science by someone in whatever year the alleged abuse took place and there was a cover-up or nothing happened, that is another scandal in its own right. If the deep-rooted need of these people is the opportunity to have their say, we must at least give them that.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">Beginning immediately, the State through the Taoiseach and the Government must re-establish its credentials of compassion in the eyes of the abused, something about which they have heard a great deal but have yet to see. The State, through the Taoiseach and the Government, must allow those who knew yet did nothing to make some psychological, emotional reparation to the children they silenced and abandoned for the crime of being orphaned or having a widowed mother who did not live up to the high moral standards demanded by local matrons or concerned parish priests. The State, through the Taoiseach and the Government, must re-establish trust, restore confidence and do all it can to rebuild these shattered lives. The one sure way to do this is to give every one of the abused people their say.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">We hear repeatedly how the public has lost faith in much of what passes for politics and government today. Judging by events this week, it is no wonder. Coming clean on Laffoy gives the Government an unmissable chance to restore politics in the public heart and imagination as something that can change matters for the better and is capable of believing in and doing the right and decent thing. The Government has that chance. The State once condemned these children to their fate. Is it now to deny them their destiny?</p>
          <p eId="para_398">I wish to conclude by referring to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of the central issues involved in the indemnity case to which the Minister referred. The report states that the State, in negotiating this deal with the religious orders and institutions, was on very weak ground on two central issues. The first related to information about the possible liability which would inform any demand for a meaningful contribution by the congregations. The second related to the legal advice and the implications of any indemnity agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">In light of the Minister's response to this series of statements, he needs to answer questions about what evidence exists in his Department as to why his predecessor did not answer a query from the Attorney General on this matter for ten weeks. Surely if that letter was received, acknowledged and to be acted upon, it should not have taken ten weeks for the Minister for Education and Science to respond to the legal adviser to the previous Government. That appears to be either gross incompetence or in keeping with the pattern of obstruction by the Department in supplying information.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">When it was perfectly obvious the number of claims was rising and when initial discussions  were based on 50:50 split on costs and liability, what evidence is available to the Minister as successor to Deputy Woods that the liability should have been capped at €127 million when, by April 2001, there were indications that it would be grossly in excess of that? Is the Minister prepared to go back to the religious institutions and inform them that, between the best estimate of the Department of Education and Science, which is about €700 million, and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which estimates that the liability could be €1 billion, there is a moral obligation on the institutions to revisit this issue which was finalised on the day before the previous Government went out of office?</p>
          <p eId="para_401">The Minister needs to confirm that each person will have his or her say and that when the new chairperson of the commission, Seán Ryan, demands or requests facilities that will enable him to do the job as he sees fit and in a way that parallels how Ms Justice Laffoy previously requested facilities and resources to allow her do the job, the Government will not deny those resources and prevent this sorry and sensitive saga being dealt with conclusively.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">I accept the good faith of the Taoiseach that the State owed all these abused people a deep, heartfelt and genuine apology. I accept that he was genuine in establishing a commission of inquiry and giving it a mandate to conduct a full and thorough review of what happened. However, I fail to understand why, having made these two commitments, the Government failed to provide sufficient resources, facilities and assistance to a brilliant and technically forensic chairperson who had the ability, credentials and integrity to see that the commission would complete its work efficiently and speedily and, as she said herself, in the interests of justice and fairness, to allow those who were abused or accused, sometimes wrongly, to have their say.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_282">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_403">Those of us who spend most of our time in and around this House, whether they be Members, staff or journalists, inevitably acquire a cynical frame of mind. We profess never to be surprised; we have seen it all before. At the most, when a disastrous state of affairs unfolds, we might concede something vague and non-committal such as: "I don't know whether to laugh or to cry."</p>
          <p eId="para_404">As we review the situation in which we, the Minister, Ms Justice Laffoy, her commission, its staff and the thousands of applicants to that body now find ourselves, there is no more appropriate phrase. We simply do not know whether to laugh or to cry. I say that because I suspect that the Government is laughing up its sleeve, but there are hundreds, more likely thousands, of damaged and vulnerable citizens who have been given reason to cry by the events of recent weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Yesterday's instalment was the report from the Comptroller and Auditor General dealing with the residential institutions redress scheme, which confirms that the Government has grossly mis handled this issue. It is clear from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that total liability arising from the scheme could exceed €1 billion, the State failed to keep accurate accounts of the rapidly increasing number of claimants during negotiations and the Office of the Attorney General was excluded from negotiations with the religious congregations during critical periods.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">In addition, the Department of Education and Science appears to have conducted the negotiations with the congregations without seeking to ascertain their level of ability to pay. The Attorney General only sought outside legal opinion on the issue a matter of days before it was agreed by the outgoing Government and, at the last minute, the Government was warned that the €128 million agreed as the congregations' contribution was unlikely to be sufficient. At the 12th hour, the Attorney General told the Government before it agreed the deal that it contained no mechanism for increasing the contribution from the congregations if the number of cases increased greatly.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">The Comptroller and Auditor General's report is the final proof, if it were needed, that the previous Government behaved in a reckless and profligate manner on the issue of the redress deal. The public has a right to know what motivated this rushed and irresponsible arrangement. The former Attorney General confirmed to journalists today that his office was excluded from the negotiations and that he had expressed his unhappiness to the former Minister, Deputy Woods. It is a tragedy that he thought to do no more than that. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, also confirmed that this deal was done on the basis of entirely inadequate documentation. That will no doubt explain the Taoiseach's anxiety earlier this morning to kill Deputy McDowell with kindness. As the unfortunate Lord Mayor of Dublin discovered recently, hell hath no fury like a Progressive Democrat scorned.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">I do not know whether the Minister, Deputy McDowell, wishes to contribute to this debate. He accused me this morning of taking a cheap shot at him, a phenomenon with which he would be entirely unfamiliar. I stated, as does the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, that he had been excluded. He did not even receive a reply for ten weeks and was, it appears, excluded through no fault of his at that stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">The reason he was excluded from that point until the deal was approved on 5 June is more difficult to establish. According to the Comptroller and Auditor General he returned in late May when he brought in an outside senior counsel. In June, as the Comptroller and Auditor General delicately puts it, he advised against the deal, which was, however, approved on 5 June. This means he must have offered his advice between 1 and 5 June, dates which probably included a Sun day. I presume, therefore, that he advised on the matter just as it went to Cabinet.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">I would like the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to explain the reason he described my remarks as a cheap shot. It appears he was satisfied to make his protests in the mildest possible fashion. Either he acquiesced in the decision because he was about to be appointed Minister or was helpless to change it. I accept the latter explanation was probably the case and that the then Minister for Education and Science, the Taoiseach and the Government had decided to proceed with the deal regardless.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">To be fair to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I will put on record what he said this morning. He stated he was not satisfied that the version of the former Minister, Deputy Woods, was correct, that the Attorney General's office was excluded and that the former Minister, Deputy Woods, "unilaterally decided" to take over the negotiations. He then stated he objected after the Cabinet meeting and sought a meeting with the Taoiseach and the then Minister, Deputy Woods. He said he brought to the then Minister's attention his unhappiness with the fact that apparently important decisions were being made without adequate legal input. He concluded by stating that when he wrote to the then Minister seeking details of the deal he received no reply because "no such documentation was apparently in existence at the time". These remarks speak for themselves. If the position of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is that all blame rests with the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, and the Taoiseach, let him come to the House and say so.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">There are a number of questions we must address with regard to the Laffoy commission. I was flummoxed by the Minister stating in the House again that he and the Government were surprised by Ms Justice Laffoy's resignation. In light of the 15 documents released with her letter of resignation, it is beyond belief that he could possibly make such a statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Why did the Government effectively decide to dismantle the Laffoy commission? How did an obsession with legal costs and with the imperative to be seen to do something about them overwhelm all other considerations? Why was the indemnity deal with the congregations, the State's sole source of income for this exercise, so surreptitiously and badly mishandled?</p>
          <p eId="para_414">I welcome the appointment of Mr. Seán Ryan SC and wish him well. He has the competence and integrity to clear up the mess of the Government's making. I advise him, however, to consult Ms Justice Laffoy about the commitment made by the Minister that it is his intention and that of his Department "to continue to give every assistance to the commission". If they continue to do this in the manner they did with Ms Justice Laffoy, Mr. Ryan will have a difficult task.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">On 4, 5, 11 and 12 February, I used Leaders' Questions to raise with the Taoiseach some of the questions that surround the extraordinarily negli gent deal concluded by the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, and the religious congregations on the final day of the previous Government and approved by the Cabinet. This deal will now come back to haunt the taxpayer, since the changes announced by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, following the collapse of the Laffoy commission will drive more abuse victims to the High Court where, under the terms of the Woods deal, the Exchequer will be liable for all costs, including the costs of the religious orders and the alleged abusers. I understand from the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that the number of people in a position to re-open High Court actions exceeds 2,400.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">In another remarkable comment, the Minister stated the "indemnity covers only those cases which could go to the redress board and is not open-ended as some people have suggested". This was the entire basis of the dispute with the former Attorney General McDowell who wrote—</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PadraicMcCormack" as="#Acting_Chairman" eId="spk_283">
          <from>Acting Chairman (Mr. McCormack)</from>
          <p eId="para_417">The Deputy should use the term "Minister".</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_284">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_418">He was the Attorney General. I did not mean any disrespect. As noted on page 86 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the then Attorney General wrote to the then Minister pointing out that they thought the indemnity would extend only to cases which would go before the Residential Institutions Redress Board. The Minister wrote back pointing out that the indemnity would apply to everyone. The sentence in which the current Minister seeks to give the impression that indemnity applies only to cases which "could" go – not "would" go – to the redress board is a sleight of hand. Under the Woods deal we will end up paying the costs incurred by anybody who decides right up to the last minute to go straight to the High Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The information I extracted in the Dáil is confirmed in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. The deed of indemnity was drafted by Arthur Cox Solicitors for the religious congregations, not in the Attorney General's office; its terms were never debated in or approved by the Dáil; the former Minister, Deputy Woods, was unaccompanied at critical negotiating meetings; critical Government decisions were made on the basis of oral reports by former Minister, Deputy Woods; and the Department of Finance had recommended a 50-50 apportionment of liability. Instead, all costs in excess of €128 million, regardless of their nature and contemplated or not, will be borne by the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">As regards the property aspects of the deal with the congregations, on 12 February 2002 the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, gave a briefing in public session to the Joint Committee on Education and Science. This was after the agreement in principle for an  indemnity but before its formal signing. The then Minister informed the committee that:</p>
          <p eId="para_421">On the new package, I have been asked about the property particularly. There is approximately 12% of the property which would be completed in the period since May 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">He was asked by Deputy Shortall what the word "completed" meant, to which he replied: "A transfer was completed."  She pressed him, asking whether he was referring to the legal transfer. This he confirmed, stating: "Yes, the legal transfer was completed." The Chairman, Deputy Michael Kitt, then intervened and asked whether 12% of the property had been transferred since May 1999. In response, the Minister again confirmed his claim, stating: "That is correct, that is all."</p>
          <p eId="para_423">This being Deputy Woods, nothing could be that simple. A few moments later he stated: "It is an agreement in principle which has been completed."  He then listed the properties he said had been the subject of transfer agreements "in principle". We now know that, to date, the State has not accepted any one of the properties listed as previously transferred under this deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">In his evidence to the committee, Deputy Woods was engaging in misleading flimflam. In the past 24 hours he has been embarked on an orgy of flimflam which must leave the Minister for Education and Science blushing because it embarrasses me. The Government should rein in Deputy Woods.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">During his meeting with the Joint Committee on Education and Science on 17 February last year, Deputy Woods stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_426">One should not be trying to make problems where there are none. One should not be trying to imagine that everybody is out to fool everybody else in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">This is unbelievable. One thing is clear, the Deputy took his colleagues in the joint committee for fools and spun them a line which was yesterday confirmed as unreal and unsustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">I go a certain distance with the Minister in one vital respect. He is strong in his acknowledgement of the degree of State responsibility for the collapse of discipline and good order in the residential institutions. However, according to him, the State is principally responsible. He said:</p>
          <p eId="para_429">In terms of responsibility, I see it principally as that of the State because it incarcerated young people, often for flimsy reasons, such as an unfit mother, being born out of wedlock . . . Other reasons for incarceration included absence from school or the theft of an apple from a shop in Letterfrack. Many of those incarcerated were orphans. I am telling the Deputy what the State did and why I believe it has a major responsibility in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">The duty of care and supervision lay with the State. It subcontracted this duty and sought people to care for those citizens on its behalf.  It inspected the care, which is recorded. There are reports and records of serious physical and sexual abuse to which the State did not respond. These reports were often hidden or buried. Correspondence was received at the very highest levels in the Department of Education and Science stressing that serious abuse was occurring. This was denied in writing on advice from officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">There were letters from Daingean reformatory begging for extra funding and stating that children were starving and dressed in rags. The letter in reply stated: "Make do with what you have." Institutions in England received ten times the <i>per capita</i> allowance and were still grossly underfunded. All this evidence and more of which I could give examples is with the Laffoy Commission . . . ”</p>
          <p eId="para_432">It was a shameful era, as Deputy Kenny said, and we all share in the guilt. Since the Minister puts his Department so centrally within the framework of responsibility, is it surprising now to see the Department acting on grounds of collective self-defence to stymie the Laffoy Commission and frustrate its inquiries. We have a giveaway deal with the religious congregations – the "subcontractors" to quote Deputy Woods – on the one hand and a collapse of the work of inquiry and investigation on the other, to ensure no blame or responsibility is allocated to institutions or individuals in either the State or religious sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The Taoiseach, meanwhile, is all over the place. On 8 September last he said:</p>
          <p eId="para_434">I accept Justice Laffoy's criticisms. She has worked on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">It was left to the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to set out the official line on the following day's "Six One News" when he stated: "We have fully responded to her perception of what has happened over the years."  With regard to her allegation that the Government had undermined the work of the commission he said: "That's not a view that the Government agrees with."</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The next day, speaking in Sligo, the Taoiseach accepted:</p>
          <p eId="para_437">There were delays in the fixing of legal fees and delays because we said we wanted to do a second review. I accept those points.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Apparently, however, it was not done on purpose. He said: "What I and the Government do not accept [was] that there was any deliberate attempt . . . .  to frustrate the good work of Justice Laffoy or the operation of her commission."  The so-called rebuttal document of 9 September gives at least four clear examples of non-acceptance of the judge's criticisms. This followed the Taoiseach's statement that he accepted the criticisms. The document states:</p>
          <p eId="para_439">It cannot be accepted that a period of eleven months from a proposal from the Commission that a decision "in principle" be taken as regards a compensation scheme to the publi cation of detailed legislation on the matter was unreasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">Neither is it accepted that this period caused delay for the Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">It is not accepted that adequate resources were not provided to the Commission to enable it to carry out its remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">The Government do not agree with this view [that the commission had been rendered powerless by Government actions and inactions].</p>
          <p eId="para_443">The Government's attempt at rebuttal amounts, in effect, to an attack on the commission and its chairperson. The rebuttal document implies that another reason for the one week turnaround is that "a challenge to the constitutionality of the Act had recently been commenced by the Christian Brothers."  However, this case had commenced on 13 February. The implication in the rebuttal is that the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, only realised between 8 and 15 April that this court case would have ramifications for the heads of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">As to how he inherited such a problem in the first place, the current Minister seems content to place the blame on the parliamentary draftsman. He told "Prime Time" on 4 September:</p>
          <p eId="para_445">When the original discussion took place about this [whether to investigate all claims or just a sample], it was conceived that we would have an inquiry akin to the one which took place in Queensland, which didn't go into individual cases. Now somewhere between that intent and the drafting of the legislation, the legislation clearly stated that individual cases would have to be done, and that is one of the problems that we're faced with. 1,700 cases to be dealt with will take us eight to eleven years.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">This is unbelievable. He said the intent was one thing but somehow a Bill came before the House, sponsored by the former Minister, Deputy Woods, which did the opposite. The Government has now come forward with a plan which will take until 2007 to conclude, whereas it rejected without explanation a proposal to wrap matters up by 2005 because it "wanted to complete it in a shorter time-frame". Despite the publication of its rebuttal of Justice Laffoy's criticisms, the Government cannot act as if these valid criticisms can be ignored. There is no getting away from the fact that the Government engaged in obfuscation and obstruction of the commission to such an extent that it brought about the resignation of its chairperson.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">The Government has come forward with a package of proposals which, even if implemented and completed in a timely fashion, will take at least twice as long to complete as the proposals advocated by the chairperson many months ago. It has not explained why the proposals from Justice Laffoy have been either sidelined or rejected and a new set of proposals which may take four years or more to implement and complete are more valid and effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The Labour Party will hold the Government to account for the incredible mess it has made of the investigation of child abuse. We do not have confidence in the Government to deliver on the commitments outlined in its new proposals given its record of gross incompetence, misleading explanations and collective inability to provide the Laffoy commission with the resources and reassurances it required to carry out its mandate. We accuse the Government of a breach of faith with the victims of child abuse by failing to provide the Laffoy commission with the necessary resources to carry out the work assigned to it by the Oireachtas.</p>

The background to the indemnity deal, the establishment of the Laffoy commission, its resourcing and the redress board is a cesspit of intrigue, mystery and shady deals involving weak and cowardly politicians capitulating to religious organisations who would do anything to keep the floodgates closed and will fight tooth and nail to deny and obscure personal accounts of vicious physical and sexual assault, rape, buggery, psychological and emotional damage, mental torture, experimentation and other unspeakable evils.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">It is a shocking story that will one day be analysed by historians and political commentators who will judge the behaviour of the Government and the modern church in dealing with survivors of abuse from the 1930s to the present day in the same critical terms as those who perpetrated the abuse and the politicians, departmental officials, members of the Garda Síochána, the Judiciary and others who facilitated the abuse or who were grossly negligent in their handling of the many cries for help that came their way and who incarcerated the survivors in those hellholes in the first place. Many of the survivors do not even know their real names. History will judge the Government and the religious unkindly when the truth finally emerges. As a politician, I, and others, have a duty to ensure it emerges quickly, screaming with the cries of the abused. Justice must be done and must be done transparently.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">First, let us get to the bottom of the indemnity deal. It is a deal finalised by a former Minister who had no notes or memos to give to Cabinet on the matter before the last election. That deal gave the religious a bargain way out, but now, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, it will cost the State at least €1 billion. If the church still sold indulgences, this  Government would be guaranteed a red carpet to heaven for its noble sacrifice on behalf of the abusers. The Taoiseach and the Minister were right yesterday and today when they said that the State would be liable for a large share of the costs in court actions taken by survivors, but why was the shoddy, shameful €128 million deal arranged in the first place?</p>
          <p eId="para_454">My colleagues, Deputies Dan Boyle and Trevor Sargent, will be speaking about the matter later and in committee tomorrow, so I will not go into too much here. However, the Government made a grave and fundamental error in signing the deal, since it transpires that a large proportion of the property cannot be sold commercially to raise funds to compensate victims. It also made another grave and fundamental error in its estimate of the true cost of compensating the abused.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">Until proven wrong, I will firmly believe that the Government originally agreed the €128 million because it was running scared of the court route. It knew that the church would, in many cases, successfully tie the Department of Education and Science and other Departments in as co-defendants, creating a potential for compensation far higher than €128 million. I am not sure whether the costs of the court action would be higher in this case after the report relative to the redress and Laffoy costs. However, I have no doubt that the Government's motivation was primarily driven by cost. In doing that deal, the Government let the church off the hook in an effort to cut costs. Now it transpires that they are huge.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I do not believe that cost is the issue now. Getting to the truth and justice are the issues, and the Government must show that. If cost was unimportant, how come the survivors who received a settlement through the Residential Institutions Redress Board cannot go to the courts and face prosecution if they reveal the details of their award? Let us examine the Residential Institutions Redress Board. Admittedly, the Committee on Education and Science had no problem with the weighting initially proposed, but it is clear that the redress board is not working well. The weightings are inadequate and come nowhere near matching the compensation payments of the High Court, as recommended by Seán Ryan in the O'Gorman case, for example. I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify whether the highest payment to date was just over €200,000 for a person who was experimented on. He certainly did not do it in committee. If that is so, what do other victims have to look forward to in purely financial compensation for their suffering? The redress scheme must be reviewed and revamped.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">I now come to the Laffoy commission. The reason this debate is taking place is that Ms Justice Mary Laffoy resigned. The confidential committee has worked out to some extent, and after a year of asking the Minister has finally accepted that those who have received counselling and simply wish to tell their stories will now have the  option of moving from the investigations committee to the confidential committee. For those who still wish actively to seek justice, the investigations committee remains a farce. I concede that it was hounded by the religious, but also by the Government, which Ms Justice Laffoy pointed out had not assisted her in doing her job. She said that she would be able to complete it by July 2005. Her letter was a critical indictment of the Government's obstruction and incompetence in dealing with bringing the truth of what happened to light.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">Along with other representatives, I questioned the Minister at last Monday's committee meeting. His responses regarding Ms Justice Laffoy's criticisms were not convincing, and we let the media and others decide on it. In moving past the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy, the Minister must now show transparency and openness. So far he has done the opposite, showing great contempt for this House in announcing the appointment of Mr. Seán Ryan SC as Ms Justice Laffoy's replacement. His appointment, notwithstanding his credentials, is premature. Any new appointment or independent investigation that he is to carry out should have awaited the interim Laffoy report in November, this Dáil debate and the Minister coming before the Committee on Education and Science.</p>

          <p eId="para_463">He must publish all the documents on the changes that Ms Justice Laffoy proposes in advance and in full public view. He should banish sampling from the agenda. He has stated in meetings with groups representing victims that sampling would not be examined for the time being, but he has not ruled it out. Sampling should never be introduced. Each survivor's experience is as valuable as that of the next, and it is not enough to gather clear sample evidence in this instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">If this mess is not cleared up in a forthright, honest and transparent manner, perhaps other options must be considered, such as the establishment of a forum where survivors can state their experiences under privilege without fear of legal interruption or a return to the courts, with the State openly admitting its liability and working with the victims to countersue the church. One way or another, things cannot go on as they are if we all claim to have the survivors' best interests at heart.</p>

          <p eId="para_465">The resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy from the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse must rank as the most serious breakdown of any inquiry ever established by this Oireachtas. I say that because, like the issue of contaminated blood products, and unlike some other tribunals, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse deals with matters of life and death, the health and well-being of thousands of citizens and a system of deplorable abuse amounting to a catalogue of crimes carried out over decades. That system of abuse claimed the lives of many children. We may never know exactly how many children died of neglect and ill treatment in those institutions. Our first and last concern should be the survivors of abuse and the memory of those who did not survive. Many survivors are so marginalised and damaged from their abuse that they will never be able to avail of the commission or the redress board. We know that many of them ended up homeless on the streets of London and other foreign cities.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Our focus now should be to see that the debacle which has been created is sorted out, that the lessons are learnt, and that we move forward. In her resignation letter to the Government, Ms Justice Laffoy revealed that the commission had "never been properly enabled by the Government to fulfil satisfactorily the functions conferred on it by the Oireachtas". If that charge is true, and I have no reason to doubt it, it means the Government has thwarted the purpose of the Oireachtas in setting up the inquiry. Adequate resources were not provided. The review process initiated by the Minister for Education and Science has caused delay and confusion, and we now have a chaotic situation, with the work of the commission effectively shut down. Ms Justice Laffoy resigned because, she said, the reviews made her position untenable, as it was unclear if the commission's remit would change. Its work had been stalled by the uncertainty created by the reviews. There is no new legislation yet, and it might take until next spring for it to be sorted out, as the Christian Brothers have taken a court challenge against the commission which will go to the Supreme Court next spring. The Government is using that as an excuse for delay. In the meantime, the commission is in limbo. In other words, a complete mess has been created.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">The confusion since the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy has been added to by the floating of ideas by the Minister for Education and Science, such as the hearing of sample cases by the investigation committee, the subsequent withdrawal of that idea and the floating of the proposal to summon alleged abusers to the confidential committee. Most survivors have expressed opposition to those proposals. As I said when I spoke at the survivors' meeting at Liberty Hall last March, this is not a matter of euro and cent but of justice and rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">At that time, I also described the deal done by the Minister, Deputy Woods, with the religious orders as disgraceful. Everything we have learnt  since reinforces that description. In his opening statement this afternoon, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, stated that those who were critical of the Michael Woods deal offered no alternative. We did not have to. The Government itself had the alternative. The Department of Finance recommended a 50:50 approach to liability between the church and the State, yet that recommendation was ignored and the Minister, Deputy Woods, went ahead and concluded one of the most extraordinary agreements ever entered into by any Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">At the meeting of the Committee on Education and Science on Monday, the Minister attempted to separate the issue of the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy and the now totally discredited indemnity deal. However, in justification of the Minister's conduct in this debacle, the Taoiseach and he have cited the cost of the process, something added to hugely by their decision to allow the religious orders off with only a fraction of the liability which they should bear. My colleague, Councillor Larry O'Toole, attended the survivors' meeting in Dublin last Sunday. It was a pity that neither the Minister nor his party was represented at it to hear both the real concerns and the deep anger among survivors. Survivors have challenged the role of the Department of Education and Science, and they want to see real progress and real justice done. That is also our demand as legislators.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_470">When discussing this urgent issue, we should all reflect carefully and be sensitive to the needs of the victims. We must send out a strong message that we will do all in our power as legislators to support them. We must also be able to take tough decisions and put our money where our mouths are. Whingeing about the financial costs should never be an option. The church and the State have to take responsibility and society as a whole has to face up to all its responsibilities. Whether it is €500 million or €1 billion we have to pay up. There can be no debate about the costs. The victims and their needs have to come first.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Those of us who have worked on child abuse cases or who have close friends that were sexually abused know full well the hurt, the horror and the damage done to innocent victims. The church and the State have to face up to that reality. The victims have a right to have their voices heard and this has to be done efficiently and sensitively.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">On 19 May 1999 the Taoiseach gave an apology to the survivors of institutions and reformatory school systems on behalf of the Government and the Irish people. He promised justice and redress. Most of these people are still waiting. That is not acceptable and it is not good enough. People are tired and hurt from all the waiting.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">When dealing with this issue we cannot run away from the role of the wider society. As a young primary school student, I remember young lads from the home up the road from the school  being marched down to the school each day in the same clothes. As young boys we knew who they were and that they were treated differently. They were discriminated against from the day they were born. This was the Ireland of the time where children in care and children of single parents were frowned upon by the wider community. We cannot run away from this fact. Even today, there are some in the wider society who want to go back to those terrible days. Let us listen for the cold words and the negative comments about single parents and mothers and the criticism when financial or housing assistance is given to these families. They whinge about the cost to taxpayers. They should always be challenged. I put down a marker in the sand that we are not going back to those dark old days. We need to look after our citizens and move towards the goal of a just society. They should have the support of all the TDs in this House, regardless of political allegiance.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">I remind the House of the hidden story in this debate – the abuse of children with intellectual disabilities who have suffered, not always at the hands of the clergy. Many were abused and most of them do not realise this nightmare. They also must be represented in this debate and I intend to be their voice. Children with disabilities, particularly girls, were abused and they never got a mention. The sad part is that some of them do not realise the situation because of their intellectual disability. Let us not forget the many survivors who are so hurt and depressed they are not coming forward to this commission. Their story should never be forgotten.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">When speaking about child abuse in the past, we should also remember the 90,000 children who live in poverty today. Among those 90,000, there is a group of 3,000 children who live in violent and dysfunctional families, for whom abuse is a seven-day-week experience. Most have lost their self-esteem and will end up abusing drugs or alcohol or in prison. These children have to be helped and if action is not taken here today we are turning our back on another generation. The present deal is a bad one. It is bad for the victims and the taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">I urge the Government to act soon to ensure all these people are treated in a caring and compassionate way.</p>

      the Government's current position on Iraq.

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_478">The Government wishes to see the restoration of Iraq to the international community under a representative Government. This is in the interest of the entire international community. It is crucial that the Iraqi people are given a sense of ownership over the political reconstruction process. It is essential that agreement is reached on a credible timetable for handing over political responsibility to the Iraqi people. We welcome Colin Powell's announcement of a six-month deadline for an Iraqi constitution as a welcome step in the right direction. We hope that it will lead to a general acceleration of the timetable for transferring sovereignty to the Iraqi people.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">We acknowledge that the ground must be prepared for a successful transfer of sovereignty, especially in terms of re-establishing security and stability. It is clear that there is much work to be done to achieve this. The violence that we have seen in recent weeks is a cause of grave concern. In particular, the recent attacks on the UN are to be condemned unreservedly as shameful acts of terrorism which assist no one, least of all the Iraqi people. These developments highlight the need for the international community to come to an agreement on how to proceed in Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">We continue to look to the Security Council to ensure that the United Nations is seen to maintain its proper role as acting on behalf of the entire international community. This is essential in relation to the UN's ability to contribute to defusing the situation in Iraq and to the UN's future credibility. The Government has consistently advocated a central role for the UN in the reconstruction of Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">Discussions on a draft text for a possible new Security Council resolution are currently under way between members of the council. The initial text that was presented by the US contains a number of useful points, but it needs to go further in providing a central UN role and in giving an impetus to the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty. This very important opportunity must not be missed. A new resolution must be more than a means for supply of troops and funds. It must transform the situation. It must show that occupation is indeed intended to be only temporary and must meet the concerns I have already outlined on a credible timetable and a sense of ownership by the Iraqi people. These conditions must be met if the resolution is to have the necessary impact on the international community and especially on Arab public opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The Government strongly encourages the Security Council in its work to agree on the way forward and we hope that a multinational force will be agreed. The full support of the Arab states, neighbouring countries and the international community as a whole is crucial to achieving these aims.</p>

          <p eId="para_486">The Minister, who has just returned from the United Nations, referred to Colin Powell's hopes for a constitution for Iraq within six months. What are the UN hopes for Iraq and what plans has it put in place? Has the United Nations allowed itself to be subject to the decisions of the US Secretary of State or the US administration? What role is it taking to ensure that a safe, secure and self-governing Iraq is brought about?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_487">In regard to the first part of the Deputy's question, the Taoiseach and I have made it clear that consideration will be given to any invitation to participate in the UN peace-keeping operation established by the Security Council or, as would be the case in Iraq, a multinational force authorised by the Security Council. However, the discussion of the necessary Security Council resolution is still taking place among the members of the Council. It is not clear when, or in what form, it might be adopted. Should the resolution be adopted and authorise a multinational force and should Ireland be invited to participate, the Government's consideration would then embrace a range of political, technical and military factors as to the desirability and feasibility of Irish participation. Any such assessment would also need to take into account the numbers of Irish permanent Defence Forces personnel available for overseas service at that time. In this connection, the Deputy will be aware that the Government will seek Dáil approval for the deployment of a significant number of personnel in the newly established UN mission in Liberia.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">In regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, in discussions I have had with the UN Secretary General, as part of the troika of the European Union, he wants to see the maximum possible assistance being provided by the UN in the right circumstances and to see the right resolution adopted. That discussion is continuing. The Secretary General is liaising with all the members of the Security Council during these discussions. He is also concerned about the safety and security of UN personnel based on what has happened in Iraq. The question of minimum risk to UN personnel is another important consideration for him and his staff. He must also consider whether assistance can take place from within Iraq or from neighbouring states as in the past. How he will be able to organise UN participation, post the Security Council resolution which is at present under discussion, is a matter he is keeping under review.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">The UN is centrally involved, thankfully, in trying to bring forward a resolution which will provide us with a framework and timetable that will see the sovereignty of the Iraqi people restored as soon as possible, consistent with security, political and other requirements.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_494">As the Deputy will be aware, members of the Security Council are currently discussing the possibility of adopting a resolution which would define a role for the United Nations in Iraq's transition to sovereignty and would also authorise the deployment to Iraq of a multinational force. If such a resolution is adopted, it is of course possible that Ireland would be one of the countries invited to participate in this force.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">The Government would, as a general principle, wish that any multinational operation authorised by the Security Council have a clear mandate, attainable goals and adequate staffing and resources. However, the details of any resolution establishing a mandate for a multinational force are a matter for the current members of the Security Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">At this stage, it is too early to comment meaningfully on the nature of or conditions for possible Irish participation in any such force other than to point to the need for its authorisation by the Security Council. Should that condition be  fulfilled and should Ireland be invited to participate in the force, the Government would consider the invitation in the normal manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The members of the current coalition in Iraq and members of the international community in general are well aware that no consideration can be given to the participation of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force in any military operation overseas in the absence of a UN mandate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_303">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_498">It is singularly confusing to refer to a multinational force, approved by the UN, as if it was the same as a UN-initiated peacekeeping operation. This is what the Taoiseach did when he sought to draw comparisons between Irish peacekeeping deployment in East Timor and Eritrea with the suggestion that Irish troops might participate in Iraq. Is the Minister aware of the distinction, in terms of Irish law, the Defence Acts and the Constitution, between a UN-initiated peacekeeping force and his so-called multinational force?</p>
          <p eId="para_499">I listened with care to the Minister's answer to Question No. 104. However, he did not elaborate on his use of the word "sovereignty". How does he see the return of sovereignty to the Iraqi people being accommodated by, for example, the opening of all industries, apart from oil – from education and water through to pharmaceuticals – to foreign multinationals?</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Will the Minister elaborate on whether the Taoiseach and he propose to make an unequivocal statement in regard to the principle of pre-emption? He quoted the Secretary General of the UN, Kofi Annan, who was far more direct in his condemnation of pre-emption as a principle that defies the UN charter. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs were singularly evasive in regard to that issue on every occasion on which it was put to them in this House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_304" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_501">There is no distinction between what the Taoiseach and I have said. The circumstances in which the Defence Forces might participate in Iraq in trying to bring about a transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqi people depends on a number of things. First, it depends upon a Security Council resolution with a clear mandate to that effect, which we do not have at the moment – it is under discussion. Therefore, the question is speculative by definition. However, the general principles which apply are the same for the Defence Forces whether we are in the Congo, East Timor or anywhere else.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">I am well aware, as is the Minister for Defence and the Government, of the provisions of the Defence Acts and, as we have always said, the first requirement is a UN mandate, following which the Government, if invited, will give consideration to it. The Government is not being automatically asked to get involved with something it does not wish to.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">The Deputy will know that the Government has successfully negotiated at European level in  order that the sovereign decision and approval of this Parliament is required for any service overseas in any capacity. Therefore, the distinctions between multinational forces, peacekeeping forces or peace enforcement operations do not matter since they are nebulous in terms of the substance of the argument. A sovereign decision by Government, with the approval of the Oireachtas and a prior UN mandate, are the simple parameters for the participation by our Defence Forces overseas and the same applies in this case as in any other.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">Until such time as we see the terms and contents of a resolution from the Security Council on that matter, we are involved in speculation. There has been no attempt by the Government to create confusion. If I am asked a question which has that conditionality attached to it, I am in a position to give the broad parameters of participation, which are the same, are consistent and apply under law. There is no confusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">In regard to the transfer of sovereignty, of course the purpose that one would expect and require is a transfer of sovereignty in the normal sense of the word, namely, a democratic Government in charge of all aspects of Iraqi life, run by the Iraqi people under a democratically elected administration. That is what we, the UN and Kofi Annan have in mind. We await the Security Council's discussions on the terms of the resolution to confirm how and on what timetable they expect this to be achieved. This, of course, would involve a sovereign decision over all aspects of national life. However, we are at the point of trying to incrementalise the level of participation under the governing council or transitional administration, pending the development of a constitution, elections and the Iraqi people making their own sovereign decision as to what representative government they want.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">In regard to the Deputy's third question, I suggest he read the Official Report. He specifically asked me some months ago if I believed the doctrine of pre-emption was illegal and I said "Yes".</p>

I specifically recall the Deputy asking the question and I had no problem in answering it because the doctrine of pre-emption has no basis in international law. The problem and the reason we were having a debate about it was that the Deputy's characterisation of the military action by the coalition forces is one of a pre-emptive strike—</p>

          <p eId="para_513">The Government's position when Ireland was on the Security Council is in the explanation of the votes. I have not heard any Opposition Member wishing to convey to me that it was a simple position for the Government. We were on the Security Council when Resolution 1441 was agreed in October 2002. Regardless of the arguments which were being conducted as to whether there was sufficient legal basis under existing resolutions, we said that in order to gain the widest possible legitimacy and support from the international community for such action, we believed that the political requirements of the situation would require a further resolution and that it would be for the Security Council to subsequently decide that. That was our position in October, it remained our position and we have consistently put that position. If we had been on the Security Council over the course of the past 12 months, that would have remained our position.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">At certain points, people have sought to create confusion by saying that the provision of overflight and landing facilities constitutes a participation in the war.

          <p eId="para_517">I intend to have an appropriate amount of time for my question. I listened with care to the Minister's answer and I intend to put some questions. Is he not embarrassed that he began by referring to the provision of facilities at Shannon and by constant reference to the existence of weapons of mass destruction, which is proved to be a sinister fabrication, not an error? I put it to him on the day he spoke that what had taken place in relation to Iraq was a pre-emptive strike which was illegal. While we debated the principle of pre-emption, I called it an illegal act. His reply to me on that occasion on the specific issue was that the jury was out, more or less what he has said this afternoon. We differ on the matter. I called it an illegal and pre-emptive act which was destructive of the charter.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">In relation to what the Taoiseach suggested in either his <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Hillary Rodham Clinton or at the UN itself, my question was about conditions that would be attached to Irish  participation. I put it to the Minister that the Defence Act is specific in relation to a UN mandate or UN-initiated actions. Will the Minister tell the House how he will square Irish military participation, even in reconstruction, until he has addressed the original issue of illegality and pre-emption? He should not quote the Defence Act because it does not speak about UN-approved actions. We can differ on the issue. The Minister can take it whatever way he likes but that is not what the text of the Defence Act 1954 or any other legislation supported by the Constitution states.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">We speak about a multinational force. What conditions would be attached to such a force?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_520">Let me answer the Deputy very simply. He can be fully reassured that there will be no question of any participation by Irish Defence Forces in any action internationally which does not have a legal basis in our own country. He can take that as read, as would be the case with any Government, regardless of its political composition. This attempt to say that there is some preparedness on the part of the Government to participate in a multinational force which would not have a proper legal basis in this country is without foundation. What we are simply saying when asked is that the consideration that would be given to that issue would be the very same consideration given to any other invitation or request received from the UN on the basis of a UN Security Council resolution – no more or no less. Instead of everyone running ahead of themselves, people should wait to see whether there will be a UN resolution to that effect.</p>

      <b>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
      if the Government will consider using the Irish EU Presidency programme to put achievement of the millennium development goals at the top of the EU and international agenda as the best means for achieving human security; and if he will consider elevating this to a central plank of the Irish Presidency programme on a par with enlargement and the Lisbon Agenda.
      [21409/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_324">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_531">The declaration adopted at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000 included eight development goals. The goals set specific targets to be achieved by 2015 in areas such as the reduction in the number of people living in extreme poverty, universal primary education, maternal and child mortality and HIV/AIDS.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">The EU, which contributes over 50% of global overseas development assistance, has a major role to play in the achievement of the millennium development goals. By taking the lead and using the millennium development goals as an overarching framework for its development policy with the key target of poverty reduction, the EU can set an example for other international donors. The achievement of the millennium development goals is closely linked to the mobilisation of development finance. In April 2002 there was a follow-up to the millennium summit when the UN held the International Conference on Financing for Development. This conference adopted an agreement, the Monterey consensus, which deals with all sources of development finance, including the mobilisation of domestic savings, trade, debt relief and overseas development assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">As its contribution to the Monterey consensus, the Barcelona European Council adopted eight development commitments covering, <i>inter alia,</i> overseas development assistance, trade and debt relief. The Council agreed that EU member states would collectively increase their ODA to ensure the EU average ODA would rise to 0.39% of gross national income by 2006 from an average of 0.33% of GNI in 2001. It has been estimated that this commitment will result in an additional €20 billion in collective EU ODA between 2002 and 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The EU Commission is closely monitoring the implementation of the Barcelona development commitments, including the ODA commitment. The second progress report on the commitments will be presented to the General Affairs and External Relations Council in April 2004 during  Ireland's EU Presidency. I see this discussion by Ministers at the General Affairs Council as one of the most important development debates at the Council during our Presidency. We will use the discussion by EU Ministers of this progress report to focus EU political and public attention on the central importance of the millennium development goals and their financing.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">We are already discussing the preparation of the progress report with the Commission and have indicated the importance of this issue on our Presidency agenda. I am satisfied that the consideration by the General Affairs Council of the Commission's progress report will be a major opportunity to highlight the central relevance of the millennium development goals to the European Union and to reaffirm the EU's commitment to the goals and their financing.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_325">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_536">Trócaire put it quite effectively when it said that poverty, disease and injustice are the deadliest weapons of mass destruction and the greatest source of daily insecurity for millions of people. Will the Minister agree that the Irish EU Presidency is a golden opportunity to fulfil these millennium goals and to put them at the top of the EU and international agenda by ensuring human and global security? As part of the global social justice agenda, and in keeping with this State's support for a human security approach, having signed up to the EU Barcelona commitments, I ask the Minister to support my proposal to try to bring the EU partners on board to match Ireland's stated commitment to debt cancellation, to prioritise trade justice and to press for a conclusion on the three outstanding Doha development rounds acceptable to the developing world.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Will the Minister agree that the EU should show leadership on official development assistance by returning to ODA budgeting on a multi-annual basis? Ireland should consider guaranteeing an increase from the current 0.41% to approximately 0.48% of GNP for next year's budget. It should ensure there is policy coherence on poverty eradication as a guiding principle for the EU's external action. Will he agree that this country should show leadership by committing to the introduction of legislation establishing a Tobin tax and by campaigning to establish the EU as a Tobin tax zone? How does the Minister intend during Ireland's Presidency to spearhead the campaign to mobilise the EU behind the appeal of the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, for support for radical UN reform?</p>
          <p eId="para_538">In conclusion, will the Minister agree to adopt a global social justice agenda during Ireland's EU Presidency in 2004? I believe if he does so that the Irish public will wholeheartedly endorse it. It would be a source of pride for Ireland if we were to take the lead on this issue.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_326">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_539">I said in my initial reply that this would be a priority for us. With regard to multi lateral attempts to deal with the problems associated with development goals, the failure of the WTO ministerial conference in Cancún to agree a framework for pursuing the Doha development agenda was a significant setback for developing countries. One would like to have seen a successful outcome as a good background against which it could be ensured the objectives were met. Efforts to reduce poverty and to integrate countries into the global economy would be better promoted through a fair and equitable multilateral trade agreement rather than bilateral or regional arrangements. Our efforts must be redoubled to secure an agreement at the WTO that is fair and just to developing and developed countries alike.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">The EU Commission and Ministers continued to reflect on the implications of the failure in the aftermath of the Cancún meeting. Commissioner Lamy reported to the Council early this week and indicated more time would be needed to fully assess the long-term implications. It is also possible that the Presidency will convene a meeting of trade Ministers. The task of the forthcoming Irish Presidency will be influenced by the evolution of EU thinking in the coming weeks and by further developments at the WTO between now and December. We stand ready to work hard with a view to putting the talks back on track.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">The Government's key priority in the development co-operation programme is to ensure maximum effectiveness in Ireland's contribution to reducing global poverty and inequality. The fight against HIV-AIDS in developing countries will receive particular attention within the set of development co-operation priorities for Ireland's EU Presidency. The Government's record on funding the overseas development programme is second to none.</p>

      <b>Mr. G. Mitchell</b>
      asked the

      the Government's current priorities in regard to Northern Ireland.
      [21412/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_329">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_545">The Government's overriding objective is to work towards underpinning peace and political stability in Northern Ireland through the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Our immediate and interlocking priorities are to achieve an early date for  Assembly elections; to encourage the relevant parties to take the necessary steps to ensure the restoration and sustained operation of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland; and to implement all aspects of the Joint Declaration that come within the remit of the two Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">With regard to the first priority, we remain of the view that elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly should take place at the earliest opportunity. The optimum context for such elections is one in which there is reasonable confidence on all sides that a sustainable executive can be formed after the poll. To achieve that context, we are encouraging the parties in Northern Ireland to definitively address the key outstanding issues of confidence, namely, the ending of paramilitary activity and ensuring the full, inclusive and uninterrupted operation of the institutions of the Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">The recent direct engagements between the parties themselves have been encouraging. Whatever reciprocal assurances they can offer each other will obviously have a significant confidence building impact. In addition, it is important to recall that the Agreement was a collective endeavour and that all the pro-Agreement parties have a contribution to make in ensuring the sustainability of its institutional architecture.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">With regard to the implementation of all aspects of the Joint Declaration that fall under the remit of the two Governments, we are continuing to work with the British Government, including through the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, to advance progress on important areas such as policing, security normalisation, criminal justice, equality and human rights. On 2 July both Governments published a statement of commitments under the Joint Declaration which we believe are capable of being delivered in the near term. At the next meeting of the conference, which is scheduled for November, we will assess progress in meeting those targets and review the other more long-term commitments arising from the Joint Declaration.</p>

          <p eId="para_550">Was additional information given to the Government in recent months regarding the disappeared, as IRA and Sinn Féin spokespersons have stated? I have not yet read Gerry Adams's latest volume of propaganda but I look forward to reading the chapter on Mrs. McConville.</p>

          <p eId="para_552">However, I doubt very much I will find it. This mother of nine disappeared and  was shot in the back of the head. Does the Minister agree there are reasonable suspicions the disappeared are being used as pawns in this game in Northern Ireland? Will the Minister fully encourage citizens of the Republic to join the Police Service of Northern Ireland?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_553">With regard to the first series of supplementary questions, the Government's position is that elections should have been held when they were due and they need to be held as a matter of urgency. If they do not take place, that will feed negatively into the wider political situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">I refer to the non-operability of the executive, which has been with us for almost 12 months. According to the default mechanism under the Agreement, the two Governments deal with non-devolved matters under the aegis of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">The Taoiseach has outlined the formal position on the question of the disappeared and I do not wish to add to that. Information is provided in good faith. This concerns the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform directly and not me, but it is my understanding that we have been acting on existing information. Progress has been made on these sensitive and difficult matters for the families concerned. I would not like to characterise the Deputy's comments as reflecting the situation. It is a question of everyone trying to bring closure to these matters for the families and I pay tribute to the work of former Minister, John Wilson, who is doing all he can in his role to resolve these matters to the satisfaction of the families.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">With regard to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, we decided following the Weston Park negotiations that if a sufficient threshold had been reached which meant that policing reform was being implemented on the basis of the Patten report, there could be further implementation on the basis that normal policing could best be guaranteed by the full participation of both communities with the intention that policing should be regarded as a normal career in a normalised situation, as it is here. We recommend the career to anyone who is minded to take it up, whether he or she resides North or South.</p>

          <p eId="para_557">Has the Minister's attention been drawn to weekend press reports, which allege – I have no evidence to support this – that millionaire members of the IRA do not want Sinn Féin to join the policing authority because it will interfere with illegal activities from which they generate their wealth? Are the reports accurate and, if so, what steps will he take to address them?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_558">I do not know whether the reports are accurate. The Government wants to push ahead with policing reform. We want to see the full participation of everyone involved in policing reform, including the institutions and the policing board. The sooner that happens, the better. The  work done by the policing board has been one of the success stories of the Agreement. I commend its members and those who work on local police partnerships as they provide their service, time and effort to bring about a situation where everyone can have confidence in the policing service, which is a fundamental building block of the transformed society we are all trying to achieve through exclusively peaceful means in Northern Ireland. Similar legislation to the Criminal Assets Bureau legislation has been incorporated into law in Northern Ireland. I hope that will deal with criminality as effectively in that jurisdiction as the CAB has dealt with similar criminality here.</p>

      <b>Mr. Gormley</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
      when a new resolution on Iraq is expected before the United Nations Security Council; the elements the Government will want included in such a resolution; if the Government intends to provide troops for a UN peacekeeping force in Iraq; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_336">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_560">I have already informed the House in reply to an earlier question that discussions on a draft text for a possible Security Council resolution are currently under way. The Government is following developments as closely as possible, but it is difficult to say anything more than that negotiations are likely to continue for some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">In my earlier replies, I also outlined the Government's position on the other elements raised by the Deputy.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_562">I thank the Minister for that very short reply. Would he accept that the war which this Government supported has been entirely counterproductive, that it has destabilised the entire country of Iraq, that it has sown the seeds for further terrorism and has resulted in the deaths of many innocent Iraqis? When the Minister observes what has happened, does he have any regrets about supporting this war? Specifically, does the Minister accept that what America is now engaged in is a military exercise or operation because, when the Minister was justifying the use of Shannon, he told me in reply to a parliamentary question that he would allow Shannon to be used only if it was not part of a military exercise or operation. What is going on in Iraq now? Is it a military operation? Is it a military exercise? Can the Minister clarify where he is coming from on that?</p>
          <p eId="para_563">In replying to previous questions the Minister has been quite vague and has performed his usual trick of not telling us where he stands. It seems it is possible for Mr. Chirac or Mr. Schröder to say where they stand but not for the Minister. I am asking where specifically the Minister stands on the question of the transfer of sovereignty.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">Second, where does the Minister stand on the question of who should be in charge of this oper ation? Should it be UN-led or should it be led by the US? These are fundamental questions when it comes to this new resolution.</p>

          <p eId="para_580">I have no problem with straight answers. Despite what the Deputy continually says, landing and overflight facilities do not, in international law, constitute participation in military action. By the same token, France and Germany who supplied the same facilities are not regarded by the Deputy as having participated in a war. How can the Deputy ascribe to this Government a level of participation that he is not prepared to ascribe to anyone else? The illogicality of the Deputy's argument is demonstrated, simply and clearly.</p>

          <p eId="para_583">The Deputy asked what did I mean by sovereignty in relation to Iraq. As I stated from the outset, what we mean is that the Iraqi people will elect a democratic government under their own constitution and operate as a sovereign state in the same way as other countries. Is that clear enough for the Deputy? We have said consistently that the United Nations must play a central role in that transition to a full democratic Iraq. Is that clear enough?

I will cite it again so that the Minister will understand it fully, so that it will be crystal clear. The Minister said that planes would not be allowed to land at Shannon if they were part of a military exercise or operation. I put it to the Minister that what was happening in Iraq was a military operation. It was a military exercise. The Minister seems to be denying that. If he is denying it, he is living in cloud-cuckoo land because what happened in Iraq was a full-scale war in which many people lost their lives. The Minister rattled on about weapons of mass destruction.</p>

          <p eId="para_608">I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 137, 143 and 179 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">I am gravely concerned at the situation of Nobel Prize Winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, in Burma. Deputies will be aware that she has been in custody since her re-arrest earlier in the summer. Deputies will also be aware that I issued a statement on 4 September 2003 in which I called for her release and reiterated our belief that this was essential to the process of national reconciliation in Burma. Reports over the past weekend have stated that Aung San Suu Kyi has been moved into house arrest at her own home. I welcome this as a first step towards her full release.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">The United Nations Secretary General has condemned the continued detention of Aung San Suu Kyi. His Special Representative for Burma, Mr. Razali Ismail, began his latest visit there yesterday. Mr. Razali hopes to meet with the new Burmese Prime Minister, Khin Nyunt, and other Government leaders, and he also expects to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi to ascertain the conditions in which she is being detained. We fully support his mission and maintain regular contact with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">Officials of my Department met with Dr. Sein Win, head of the Burmese Government-in-exile in September, and were briefed by him and his delegation on the current situation in Burma, and on the roadmap the Government-in-exile has produced. This is the latest in a series of meetings my officials continue to have with parties concerned with Burma. In addition to the road map prepared by the Burmese Government in exile, two other plans have been produced, one by the present Burmese Government in August 2003 and another by the Thai Government in July  2003. They are being studied by all interested parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">The EU common position on Burma, which provides for a visa ban on members of the regime and a freeze on their financial assets in the Union, is due for review later this month. Ireland and its EU partners will then discuss the further revisions that may be necessary in light of recent developments in Burma.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">The Council of Ministers decided in April to make an exception to the ban on official visits to allow an EU troika, at political level, to travel to Burma to convey the EU position to all interested parties in that country. Concerns about the level at which the troika would be received after the events of 30 May, as well as worries about the effectiveness of such a mission at that time, led EU partners to decide that the visit would not go ahead. The possibility of a future troika mission has not been ruled out.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">The EU carried out a series of <i>démarches </i>in June and July in the capitals of ASEAN member states and other regional players, such as China, Japan, India and Korea, to urge them to use their influence in Burma to effect the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. The issue of Burma was also discussed at the ASEM Foreign Ministers meeting in Indonesia in July. In their conclusions, the Ministers called on the Government of Burma to release Aung San Suu Kyi immediately and to resume efforts towards national reconciliation and the restoration of democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">In recent discussions with China at official level in New York, the EU troika in which Ireland participated expressed its concern at the downward spiral perceivable in Burma, the deteriorating economic situation there, the political stalemate, human rights violations and the worrying humanitarian situation. The EU also conveyed its disappointment at the consistently negative Burmese reaction to events and the lack of credible commitment to change from the regime there. No progress has been made towards the restoration of democracy in Burma, unfortunately, despite the many efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">I am aware of Amnesty International's report, Myanmar – Justice on Trial, which was published on 30 July this year. I pay tribute to Amnesty International for this very comprehensive survey of the human rights situation in Burma. Ireland will continue to take every opportunity to register its serious concern at the practices of the Burmese regime and, with its EU partners, monitor events in Burma closely.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_622">I share the Deputy's frustration that the flagrant violation of human rights under the Burmese regime, which has been taking place for so long, is continuing with relative impunity. The violations are taking place despite the efforts of the international community, which has used sanctions and all other instruments it can devise to put pressure on the regime to change. Minimal efforts have been made by the regime to react to the need to try to democratise Burma. I clearly accept that such efforts have been very little and very late, without a real commitment to the ultimate objective. The circumstances in Burma are precisely those about which the UN Secretary General was speaking when he said, at the General Assembly last week, that certain problems need to be addressed more effectively by the UN. If we want multilateralism to work, we need a more effective means of operation. It is unacceptable that there is insufficient consensus within the Security Council at present to discuss this issue. It is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">We need to deal with problems such as those in Article 2(5) of the UN Charter. The question of how one devises and creates an effective means of dealing with gross and flagrant violations of human rights in a sovereign state should be revisited. Methods such as economic sanctions, diplomatic <i>démarches</i> and political pressure are sometimes successful, but we need to consider what more needs to be done when one has exhausted all those avenues. What parameters can be devised within international law? The Secretary General has asked an expert group to advise him on these questions because he knows we need to engage in this form of thinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">It is clear that the problems with which we are dealing are not necessarily those upon which the UN Charter was predicated, in the main, in 1945. It was considered that there may be aggression between states, but the gross violation of rights is now found within states. Does the international community have to wait until refugees start to  stream across borders in order to avoid genocide before it can legally take measures to deal with certain situations? The Secretary General is putting these questions to the UN. The United Nations is made up of us – the international community – and the Governments of the international community.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">We have to take up the Secretary General's challenge. Serious philosophical, political and legal issues have to be examined. We have to address the possibility that to hide behind the supremacy of sovereignty, in all circumstances, is to deprive the international community of the option of intervening in a humanitarian way where necessary. I agree that the failure to address effectively issues such as this dwindles the support for multilateral action, which is the only way we can deal with these problems effectively.</p>

          <p eId="para_626">I do not want to get into the sound and fury of the Iraq debate. The problems in Burma represent the other side of the coin, to a certain extent. The UN has been entirely helpless in the sense that nothing other than resolutions and <i>démarches</i> has been achieved in the last 15 years. The people of Burma have groaned under suppression and have been killed by their own people during that time. There has been a huge loss of human rights and economic well-being. Under the UN, which I consider to be helpless, all we can look forward to is a continuation of more of the same for the Burmese people. There seems to be a similar problem in Zimbabwe, where people are being repressed by the dictators who are in charge of them. Can we, as a people, make any contribution to the development of policies that will lead to positive action on the part of the United Nations when dealing with situations of this kind?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_627">As I have explained, these issues need to be addressed in the next 12 months. The Secretary General plans to put some proposals to the international community at the next session of the UN General Assembly. He intends to suggest how we might improve the legal basis for dealing more effectively with these problems, or to devise new ways of doing so. While we should acknowledge our frustration, we have to be careful not to provide a general and widespread licence to deal with matters which may be regarded as arbitrary, depending on the part of the world one is dealing with. It is not easy to get a consensus on these problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">The Deputy asked me to outline the contribution we can make. The EU common position will be revised later this month. Given that the level of trade and economic activity that exists between EU countries and Myanmar is low, the results we want would not necessarily be achieved by imposing further economic sanctions. One has to target those involved in the regime, for example, by impeding their ability to travel or by determining where their finances are going. One needs to decide how one will deal with matters  such as corruption. We have to stand up for the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We should support people such as Aung San Suu Kyi, who is a wonderful woman, and the thousands of nameless people in Burma who are trying to stand up for their rights. The international community should support such people in every way it can.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">Many people thought that apartheid would always be present in South Africa, but circumstances there changed when the will of the people eventually overcame the most repressive regime. There have been many similar examples. While we acknowledge the problems that exist in Burma, we should take inspiration from those places where real change has taken place. We should try to apply our minds to dealing more effectively with the problems in Burma.</p>

I attended the first meeting of ASEM with the then Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, and I am aware that the Asian heads of government and foreign ministers do not like to be lectured on human rights. They do not object to discussing them but they take the view that Europeans should not lecture or hector them. That is not the best way to influence them.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">When will the next meeting of ASEM take place and will the Minister confirm that this item will be on the agenda? If we do not maintain pressure on this issue we will not bring about what happened in South Africa. Apartheid ended in South Africa because the international community would not tolerate it and the regime eventually fell. We must bring about the end of the regime in Burma. The recent Amnesty International report, Burma on Trial, sets out the reasons why that should be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_636">I accept Deputy Mitchell's point regarding varying views about the nature of human rights. For our part, there are inalienable rights that go to the central dignity of every person on earth and which we seek to uphold. Those rights are economic and social as well as political. We do not live in a just world but in a very unequal and unjust world. Our job is constantly to meet and give expression to the values we hold dear and to try to ensure that they have a wider application throughout the world. Our common humanity transcends whatever political or cultural systems under which we live.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">We must continue to engage in dialogue. This is true in the case of China, Russia and countries that have come out of systems or are reforming systems in a way which gives greater credence to the individual as against the State. We must continue with that. The fact that we do not succeed, immediately or over a long period of time, does not mean the intrinsic value and truth of what we have to say must not continue to be articulated. It has been articulated by the oppressed people themselves within their countries. If they can do it under far more difficult circumstances I do not see why we should stop.</p>

          <p eId="para_639">It is deeply disappointing that the unanimous request of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs that a troika from the existing Presidency should visit Burma so as to enable advances to be made during the Irish Presidency, is not likely to be granted.

However, he is raising the questions because he wants to defend multilateralism and to ensure that it continues to be the means by which we collectively solve problems in the world.

          <p eId="para_651">The Government does not have any information on casualty figures other than those readily available in the public domain. These usually vary between 8,000 and 15,000. My officials have been in contact with relevant multilateral organisations on this matter but none of the organisations involved was in a position to give us such figures, as they either did not compile them or could not guarantee their reliability.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_396">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_652">Does the Minister not agree that it is a matter of moral shame for everyone that sufficient attention has not been directed to the loss of life of between 8,000 and 15,000 civilians as a result of this conflict in Iraq? Does the Minister agree that one of the reasons why the estimate varies so widely, between 8,000 and 15,000, is because, as some of the international agencies to which he referred have said, one cannot rely on the counting the bodies that arrive in cemeteries or morgues because people have not been able to transport bodies for burial?</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The loss of the young people from the United States and Britain who are fighting someone else's war is tragic, but it tells us something very significant about ourselves, namely, that such little attention has been paid to civilian casualty. The Minister is now telling the House that one cannot put a figure on the direct civilian casualties. How would he respond to the question of indirect casualties as a result of the failure of electricity, contaminated water, etc.? Some of the critics writing in the papers stated that those of us who opposed this war were wrong to do so because we were wrong about the number of people who died. Not enough people died quickly enough for some of the columnists. We asked what would happen if Baghdad was blanket bombed, as had been threatened. I am thankful that half the population was able to leave the city.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">There is a comprehensive silence in respect of the civilian casualties, direct and indirect, and in respect of the continuing problems associated with the absence of such electricity and clean water as is needed. The doubling of the amount of raw sewage entering the River Tigris from Baghdad is quite scandalous and the Minister should note that this should be receiving as much attention as everything else. Our media might put it to him that he should offer an opinion and maybe he wants to do so. I will offer an opinion: it is quite outrageous that the completely militarised embedded media simply do not consider it worthwhile to write about such loss of life. There is an extraordinarily high level of loss of civilian life.</p>

          <p eId="para_670">On Deputy Gay Mitchell's point, I cannot predict from this distance what action I will have to take during our six month Presidency of the European Union. As he knows, we are in a very fluid situation. There are already discussions taking place at the Security Council. We have not got over the first hurdle yet, which requires a substantial UN resolution that meets the necessary requirements and inspires confidence in the international community that we are progressing in  such a way that the sovereignty of the Iraqi people can be restored as quickly as possible consistent with security and political developments. I ask that whatever discussions are taking place at Security Council level be brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible. I hope a resolution will be reached before the donors' conference in late October so that conference will have some possibility of success and so the much needed reconstruction work, as referred to by Deputy Michael Higgins, can be progressed quickly in a more secure environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">I agree with the Deputy in that I regard the loss of any life as a tragedy. War and military action are tragedies and there is no one here who holds a brief for these. Unfortunately, however, the International Committee of the Red Cross is not in a position to provide more specific figures than those I have been able to provide thus far. It will be difficult and may take a long time to obtain an estimate better than that with which we are dealing. The number of victims of Saddam Hussein's regime will be uncovered in the months and years ahead in the same way. Let us accord to all of those concerned the dignity of knowing that we regret greatly the loss of any life under the regime or as a result of the military action that took place.</p>

The entire nation has failed these people and redress for these victims must become a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">Many of the victims have died and those who are alive had to wait until 1999 to receive an official apology from the nation. The same people are still being denied compensation. All those involved were children when they were first institutionalised. Some were as young as eight years old when they were placed in brutal institutions where they were left uncared for and forgotten by the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">From reading many of the reports it is clear that many of the institutions did their best for these children who had nowhere else to go because the then Governments were glad to wash their hands of their responsibilities regarding them. In some respects, this is mirrored today in the way we treat many others who are vulnerable and disadvantaged in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">What makes me really angry is that many of the religious institutions responsible for the most  brutal treatment of the children in their care are now resorting to hiding behind the legal profession. They are no better in many ways than the people they condemn for hiding behind the legal profession to cover up for crimes and deny victims their justice. This behaviour is blackening the name of the priests, nuns and other religious figures who did their best for the children and cared for them when nobody else did. I do not want my comments to be regarded as an ideological attack on the church or religious institutions, but they must face up to their responsibilities and stop hiding behind legal reasons for not standing up and making their case.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">The issue is becoming bogged down in the question of costs and money. Sadly, this also seems to be the central issue for the Conference of Religious of Ireland. CORI must put pressure on the religious institutions that are stonewalling on the issue because of their concerns about how it will affect their material possessions. The spirit of forgiveness should be a much higher priority for these institutions who, in some respects, over the years demanded and got responsibility for these institutions and the vulnerable children who subsequently became victims. It was easy for many Governments in the past to wash their hands of this issue. We must face up to the significant responsibility involved and stop playing around with the lives of these victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">In my constituency of Wexford, the victims of clerical sex abuse were all denied early justice because of a similar form of stonewalling, including a refusal to release records and hiding behind legal and professional reasons for not doing so. This is now being replicated across the country. It is weakening the faith of people in the church. It is also an injustice and an immoral wrong to the many good people who are still in the church and to those who do great voluntary work with children, be it in the GAA or other voluntary organisations, such as those who look after the elderly. They will all become tainted with suspicions about their motives for participating in such work. The sooner this issue is addressed and properly resolved, both by the religious organisations and the State, the better, before it leaves an indelible mark on the voluntary organisations and the good work done by many other professions and volunteers in society.</p>

          <from>Mr. T. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_684">I do not believe I will again be afforded the opportunity to speak on something of such intimate importance to the many victims of child abuse. I hope this debate will lead the Government and the Opposition to fulfil  three main aspirations, with which the Opposition will empathise. These must be, first, that we ensure that the victims and survivors of abuse are compensated in so far as we can for the sordid atrocities they suffered, second, that the perpetrators are held to account and, third, that we learn from the mistakes of the past because we, as the politicians of today, are the inheritors of that tradition. It is all too easy, in the political and media hype surrounding the retirement of Ms Justice Laffoy, to miss these aspirations and what we are about.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">Somebody said that democracy truly tested should be tested by its ability to deal with the weakest sections of its community. Can anybody in this House imagine a weaker section than those at the centre of this matter? Yet, the diversity of opinion as to how we should address the matter is typical of all political debate and democracies. We are glad we can be diverse.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">Deputy Finian McGrath said money was not important while, over the past few days, Deputy Shortall and others have stressed the importance of money in the agreement between the Government and the religious orders. Money is only important in the expeditious administration of justice. It will come from the Department of Education and Science. The Deputies share with me a concern at the shortage of money to look after many people with disabilities. In view of this, the focus of the money must be to redress the wrongs done to the victims and not towards the payment of unnecessary and exorbitant legal fees. Therein lies the balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">Many people have commented on the merits of the agreement. The Fine Gael Party leader, Deputy Kenny, rightly said we all share some responsibility. The State forcibly removed children, sometimes from distraught parents, and placed these innocents in institutions in the name of education where they were entitled to feel safe. Those administering education on behalf of the State abused them. Surely the State, financially, morally, historically and legally, must play a huge role in accepting its responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">In Canada, where the proportionate liabilities of the state and the religious orders has been tested, the state's liability was put at approximately 70% while that of the religious orders was put at approximately 30%. The Government would have had to establish some scheme to address the injustice done to the victims even if the religious orders refused to partake in arrangements. If the Government was found in the courts to be only 1% liable it could have ended up paying 100% of the damages. That justifies the role which the Government played in arriving at what, in the circumstances, is the best deal possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">I agree with Deputy Finian McGrath that this issue is more concerned with morality than money. Today each Member of this House is on trial, as are all politicians who inherit the history of what happened, the religious orders and Ireland's present and past generations. I was the beneficiary of an education by the Christian Bro thers. Never did so few people do so much damage to so many, including damage to the victims and the huge percentage of those who worked in religious orders to educate people like myself who might otherwise have been denied an education. It is important to bring that sense of balance into the debate when some might wish to pursue an agreement involving a 50:50 share in damages by the State and the religious orders. The vast majority of religious orders contributed handsomely to the development of this State, but they are also on trial.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">However, nobody will be on trial to a greater extent than the Minister for Education and Science. I applaud his courage because it became obvious to him that the commission would not achieve, unless in eight to 11 years, any sense of fair play for the unfortunate victims. The Minister had the courage to review what was happening. I hope the people, the Government and the Opposition will have the courage to achieve an expeditious resolution of this issue. We cannot expect those who are aged and who were abused 50 or 60 years ago to be around for ever. While none of us can predict the future, one does not have to be a great mathematician to consider the implications of what has happened. When one considers that the commission has to date dealt with about 40 cases in two years and 1,700 people await a hearing of their cases, basic mathematics suggests that something needs to be done. The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, must also examine the legal costs because they appear to be exorbitant. He has also met the survivors and, like other Members of the House, shares the concern that justice delayed is justice denied. Consequently, let us not delay it further than we are compelled to by the passage of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">I am certain that future generations will judge us kindly if the Opposition and the Government enter into a contract together to serve the survivors. Let us decide together that the importance of this debate transcends political opportunism and money, even though we must be expeditious in administering justice. That is my plea speaking as an ordinary person who has come in contact with victims. Caithfimid rud a dhéanamh le chéile do na daoine bochta atá gortaithe go dona agus caithfimid bheith cúramach go bhfuilimid ag dul sa treo chéanna chun cabhrú leo in ionad cabhrú linn féin nó cabhrú linn in ainm na polaitíochta.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterPowerFF" eId="spk_419">
          <from>Mr. P. Power</from>
          <p eId="para_692">I thank Deputy Tony Dempsey for sharing his time with me. I am also glad of the opportunity to address the House on this important issue. Many other speakers will address different issues concerning the difficulties that have surrounded the business of the commission to date, the redress scheme, the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy and the recent controversy surrounding the indemnity scheme and document highlighted by the Labour Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">To understand these issues, it is important to examine the context in which the redress scheme  was established. In this regard, the background statement of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which has been quoted many times in the debate and often misquoted or selectively quoted, states:</p>
          <p eId="para_694">Approximately 29,500 people, born since 1930, were committed by the courts to industrial and reformatory schools. In addition, significant numbers, which cannot be accurately quantified by the Department . . .  were committed by parents. Widespread concern was expressed in the [1980s and] 1990s about the extent and effect of child abuse at [these] institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">It has become clear that a substantial number and high proportion of these 29,500 children and young people were physically, sexually and psychologically abused and tortured in these institutions in a most shameful manner. These were dark places during a dark period in the State's history.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">What was the response? It could have been threefold. We could have done nothing – I suspect that some in the House would have preferred if the State had done nothing and placed the onus on the religious institutions to deal with these issues on a case by case basis. I suspect some in the House wanted that to happen and to see the religious bankrupted, shamed and humiliated. Some would say they deserved that. Others suggest that each of the cases should have been dealt with individually. The Fine Gael Party would have experience of this in the blood transfusion controversy and cases being dealt with sometimes in the most shameful and appalling manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">The final option would have been to take up the challenge of this dark period in our history, recognise the hurt and pain caused and take unilateral action without being forced to do so by a court or political controversy. That is what the previous Government did. It unilaterally apologised on its behalf and on behalf of the House and the people to the victims of abuse in these institutions. It also undertook to offer redress and compensate them. Everyone involved, from the Taoiseach to the Minister for Education and others, should be congratulated for this enlightened and courageous approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">It is critical to restate these events because, by making this apology, the Government triggered immediately, automatically and irrevocably a legal liability on the State running into hundreds of millions of euros to compensate these people and provide redress and restitution. I emphasise this point to a large degree because anything that has taken place since that apology and admission of liability by the State is to some degree and arguably to a large degree academic. We can argue whether the apology was merited given the massive liability which accrued to the State immediately upon it being made. That is an honest argument, but whether it was going to be €1  billion, €2 billion or €3 billion, as soon as that apology was made, the State said it would pay 100% of the bill. This point has not been made during the debate and no matter what the involvement of the religious institutions, which I will discuss shortly, that liability was always going to crystallise in some shape or form in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">I am prepared to argue the merits or demerits of whether that was the appropriate course of action, but I appeal to Members, especially those in the Labour Party, not to suggest to us and the people that events since the admission of liability and the negotiations which took place subsequently have given rise to this major liability which the Government assumed from day one. They did not give rise to it, and while many accusations of misleading the House have been made in recent days, that suggestion is the ultimate misleading of the House and deception of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">Arising from this decision, the Government decided to establish the redress board unilaterally and assumed 100% liability. It set out a scheme of arrangement which eventually resulted in the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 and the compensation commission or the Laffoy Commission as it has become known. That was welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General states that by October and November 2000 and before the issue of indemnity arose and negotiations took place with the Conference of Religious in Ireland:</p>
          <p eId="para_702">In response to the Government decision the Conference of Religious of Ireland . . .  indicated their willingness to become involved, in principle, with the Government in setting up and implementing the proposed scheme. In November 2000, the Minister and the religious congregations [entered] into formal discussions on the details of the congregations' participation in [this] scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">A fundamental point must be made that if the Conference of Religious of Ireland did not engage with the Government at this stage and said that the Government had made the admission and was liable, anything that would have happened after that would have been academic and immaterial. To suggest that once it became involved with the Conference of Religious of Ireland, the Government mismanaged negotiations, the Attorney General did not attend certain meetings or negotiations were not conducted properly misses the fundamental point that the Conference of Religious of Ireland had no liability up to that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">As it turned out, they became involved subsequently and negotiations took place on quantum, liability, cost and so forth. Different factors would have been involved in and informed those discussions, such as the standing of the institutions in question and whether they could be sued. For example, if a certain institution was subsequently taken over by another which, in turn, was taken over by another institution, with  whom does one engage and who does one sue and bring before the commission? The issue of delay would have been a major and critical part of these discussions and negotiations. The lack of evidence, which would have been patently obvious as soon as these cases came to court, if the Government had allowed them to, would have been a major obstacle.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">The vicarious liability of the individuals in these institutions is another factor. These are all critically important points which the Labour Party, in particular Deputy Rabbitte, has ignored. It has singularly refused to acknowledge that they were important aspects of the negotiations and factors which would have swung the pendulum in favour of CORI, whose ultimate bargaining position was simple and straightforward in that it did not have to make a contribution. To suggest otherwise is, at best, to misunderstand or reinterpret events and, at worst, to mislead the House and deceive the people. The Labour Party stands accused of that.</p>

          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_710">From the moment Ms Justice Laffoy resigned from the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse on 2 September the Government has been engaged in a mish-mash of bluster and concealment in an attempt to hide its mismanagement of the issue. The victims of child abuse deserve better. It is obvious the Government mishandled the commission from the start and has serious questions to answer. While some of those questions may be answered in full today, I am less than confident that this will occur given that the Government has consistently failed to respond to serious questions with satisfactory answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">Even during the recent, supposedly emergency, session of the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Science, for which I called following the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy and which failed to meet until three weeks later, on Monday last, the Minister for Education and Science ducked and dodged on every key issue. He has been unable to explain the reason Ms Justice Laffoy was forced to write that since the establishment of the commission, it has never been properly enabled by the Government to fulfil satisfactorily the functions conferred on it by the Oireachtas. While one can argue that one disagrees with her position, it does not change the fact that her statement amounts to an adjudication passed on the Government by a person it chose to inquire into this issue, a respected High  Court judge whose independence and integrity has never been called into question, who has no axe to grind and was merely seeking to do the job she was asked to do by the Government and the Oireachtas. This is a damning indictment of a Government which, on the one hand, established a commission to investigate the most dreadful cases of mass abuse ever to occur in the history of the State, while, on the other hand, failing to give the commission the support it needed to perform its functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Ms Justice Laffoy lists the ways in which the Government thwarted the work of her commission: the issue of compensation for the survivors of abuse was not addressed until 2002 despite being raised in July 2000; the issue of the payment of legal costs of persons involved in the process of the investigation committee, also raised in July 2000, was not addressed until 2002; a decision was taken to review the commission's mandate which effectively stalled its work; and the commission's requests for additional resources were handled in a slow and contradictory manner. All these issues were clearly matters for the Government to resolve.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">Ms Justice Laffoy proposed to allow the investigation committee to work in four committees instead of one. While this approach would obviously have incurred greater expense, it would have resulted in a much more expeditious process for the victims of abuse and could possibly have brought the work of the commission to a conclusion by the summer of 2005. I am aware the Minister, beavering away with figures, rejects this contention, basing his calculations on the operation of the commission thus far. He appears to ignore the fact that this time calculation was made by the woman carrying out the investigations, who was the only person with intimate knowledge of the intricacies and workings of the commission and was, therefore, in a position to make the most accurate judgment call on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">On 5 December 2002, Ms Justice Laffoy was informed by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, that the Government agreed in principle to the provision of additional resources. This statement fell far short of an acknowledgement that the resources requested by Ms Justice Laffoy would be made available. There is no point repeating the mantra that the Cabinet took a decision in principle to allocate resources. Principles do not fund commissions and the relevant resources were not made available nor was it intended to make them available. The matter was further qualified when the Minister stated that the commission should proceed with the process of filling new posts in a gradual fashion and, in case there should be any confusion, should only recruit additional staff on a short contract basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The reason given for not sanctioning the recruitment of staff on a more permanent basis was, according to the Government, the review of the remit of the commission announced in  December 2002 and due to be completed in February 2003. The review ran considerably over time, as Ms Justice Laffoy had foreseen when she commented following the announcement of the review that "while the Government decision contemplates a completion of the remit review process by mid-February, its [the Commission's] experience to date does not give it great confidence that this time limit will be met."  How right she was.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">In a statement in which she pointed out there was a real risk the review would take longer than anticipated to conclude its work, and that amending legislation with all its consequent delays would be required if the review recommended that the remit of the commission be altered, Ms Justice Laffoy noted that the investigation committee felt it was now placed in an impossible position, which duly occurred. If the investigation committee were to press ahead with hearing cases and gathering information under the commission's remit as it stood and the remit was later changed, the commission would leave itself open to the charge that it wilfully wasted public money by continuing with an expensive investigation knowing full well that the review was taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">When Ms Justice Laffoy pointed this out to the Department of Education and Science the response was telling. The investigation committee, the Department stated, must continue to discharge its statutory duties and operate within its existing remit. Furthermore, suspending the work of the investigation committee was not, it stated, a legal option. Effectively, Ms Justice Laffoy was not to concern herself with wasting public money. In July, however, she was informed by the Minister that it was manifestly in the public interest that costs did not continue to be incurred in respect of matters that might not be ultimately investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">Which advice was Ms Justice Laffoy supposed to follow? Eventually, having received legal opinion on the matter, she did what she believed to be correct. The opinion of a senior counsel she consulted was clear. In his view there was a strong case to the effect that the committee would be acting <i>ultra vires</i> in making any further discovery or production orders under one statutory remit in the knowledge that the results thereof would be only likely to be used in a significantly different statutory regime. This, he continued, could well be argued to be an improper purpose. Interestingly, this advice was requested by and given to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse as a whole, rather than Ms Justice Laffoy. The new chairman of the commission will also have to take cognisance of this advice. Will he, too, feel impeded in his work until such time as new legislation is in place?</p>
          <p eId="para_719">Perhaps the most damning allegation of all was that made by Ms Justice Laffoy when she stated that long periods of uncertainty had effectively negatived the guarantee of independence in the  performance of the functions conferred on the commission by section 33 of the Act of 2000 and militated against the commission being able to perform its statutory functions as envisaged by the Oireachtas with reasonable expedition. I do not know whether a more serious allegation could be made against a Government. For a judge to say this of a Government is, once again, a damning indictment of its approach to the commission. The Minister failed to show this was not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">While the Minister repudiated Ms Justice Laffoy's assertion, the Taoiseach stated clearly that he accepted what she said. After a few hours together in Sligo, we were treated to a pointed rejection of her criticisms. The Taoiseach agreed with Ms Justice Laffoy and then proceeded to reject what she had said. Which is it? Perhaps he will provide an answer when he comes to the House in a few minutes. Does he agree with the Minister or Ms Justice Laffoy or is this another classic case of his consensus politics based on the approach that both sides of an argument can be right.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">This begs another question. Ms Justice Laffoy is expected to publish an interim report in November. Eventually, once the review has been completed and published by the Minister, legislation to make Mr. Seán Ryan a High Court judge has been published and passed by the Houses, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Bill has been published and passed by the Houses, the reserved judgment into the Christian Brothers' case has been delivered, appealed to the Supreme Court, as the Minister assumes will be the case, and a judgment delivered, 1,700 victims have been contacted to obtain their opinions on the type of inquiry they want and have submitted their responses, only then will Mr. Ryan get to work and start investigating the whole matter in whichever way is eventually agreed, make his judgments and deliver his report. His report will partly include Ms Justice Laffoy's report which the Minister stated may be challenged by alleged abusers. After all this has occurred, will the Government treat the final report in the same fashion as it has treated Ms Justice Laffoy and her criticisms and blatantly reject anything that smacks of criticism of the Taoiseach, the Minister, the Department or the Government? There remains a clear conflict in the Minister's responses on the issue of the first and second reviews, not to speak of the judge's review and the new review being carried out by Mr. Ryan. The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, initiated a review and went to Cabinet with the heads of a Bill, which we have yet to see, on 8 April. One week later, on 15 April, it was announced that a further review was necessary. The Minister said in one interview, after Ms Justice Laffoy published her criticisms but before he had concocted his official response, that the Cabinet wanted a more serious review. Then, however, he published his response and said he had told the Government that a further review was necessary. Which is it? There can only be one  answer, either the Minister told the Cabinet or the Cabinet told him.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">What changed in those seven days? The heads of a Bill were agreed so the Minister's assertion that the issue had not been concluded at Cabinet on 8 April does not stand up. Something changed and the House is entitled to know what it was. Was this item listed on the Cabinet agenda on 15 April and, if so, who requested that it be listed? Was it as a result of the case brought by the Christian Brothers? Unfortunately, thanks to the Government's cowardly amendment of the Freedom of Information Act, we will have to rely on the responses given today for the next ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">We cannot ignore the issues that preceded Ms Justice Laffoy's decision to resign, her repeated criticisms that there was no real engagement by the Department of Education and Science with the commission and "that she was worn out by expressions of contrition by the Department that are not matched by delivery". She said: "It beggars belief that we are where we are today, we are 18 months down the road and the Department is still not dealing directly with a request from the Commission". This is an independent member of the Judiciary, appointed by the Government and the Oireachtas to carry out a commission whose functions were enabled by the Oireachtas, who clearly feels that the Department of Education and Science was not co-operating. These criticisms cannot be brushed aside. They are serious allegations that go to the heart of this issue. Many of the victims, the people who should be paramount in our minds, are extremely unhappy with the Department's handling of the child abuse issue over the decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">The Minister told the committee last Monday that the Department should be credited with the work it has done in this area. In response, I stated that the Department had been in dereliction of its duty for decades. The Minister replied that this remains to be seen. I wonder if the Minister and the Taoiseach discuss these issues. The Taoiseach told the House yesterday:</p>
          <p eId="para_725">In many cases State agencies were aware that institutions were being run under abusive regimes. Some institutions covered by the redress scheme were run by the State. There was 100% liability in many cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">The Taoiseach clearly feels that "in many cases" the issue of State liability is done and dusted. Perhaps he would clarify if "State agencies" covers the Department of Education and Science, given that it was the agency responsible. However, the Minister still claims that this remains to be seen. Can we get clarity on this point? Is the Taoiseach or the Minister correct? The Minister this morning attempted some damage limitation, following the Taoiseach's statement in the House, but it failed. I assume Ms Justice Laffoy's interim report in November will deal with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">Ms Justice Laffoy is effectively claiming that the Department, under the direction of the Minister, did not co-operate with the commission set  up by the Oireachtas. This is an appalling charge against the Minister and his Department. We are all ready to criticise people not co-operating with tribunals but now this criticism is being levelled at a Department of the State. Will the Minister for Education and Science guarantee that Mr. Sean Ryan will not meet the same obstacles from the Department? Has anything been done to ensure this will not happen again? I cannot believe, despite all that has happened, that the Government will still allow the Department of Education and Science to sponsor the new legislation and continue to be the Department which will fund the commission and second staff to the Commission while it is itself being investigated by the commission. Could anything be less appropriate?</p>
          <p eId="para_728">The Minister mentioned compensation. It is important to point out that a large category of victims will not be compensated by the redress board. These victims were abused in day schools. I am thinking particularly of victims of Donal Dunne. They have only two courses of redress. One is to the Laffoy commission to tell their story and have it investigated and the other is to seek compensation through the courts. For this category of people compensation is not the only issue. With regard to the Minister's comments about lawyers, which seems to be the stock answer on this issue, why tackle the lawyers only in relation to this commission? If he wishes to take on the lawyers, and I have no problem with that, he should do so over the Mahon tribunal or the Moriarty tribunal. Why is it only the victims who must pay for this?</p>
          <p eId="para_729">The recent publication of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General reveals conclusively what most of us have suspected for some time, that the Government botched its much hyped deal with the religious organisations. It beggars belief that this Government withheld support from the Laffoy commission and dictated that additional staff be recruited on short-term contracts while, at the same time, it indemnified religious orders at a cost to the taxpayer that could reach €1 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">The Minister stated that the object of the review of the commission was "to address the issue of costs". Contrast this with the Government deal with the religious organisations that exposed the State to potentially enormous liability. Over the last two days we have witnessed what can only be called the second coming of the former Minister, Deputy Woods. After a 16 month silence, he is back with a bang, speaking in the House yesterday and appearing on "Prime Time", the Vincent Browne show and the news. I do not know whether he has finally spoken because he feels his successor and the Taoiseach have failed to defend him adequately or he has been sent out as a final duty to Fianna Fáil to take the heat off the Taoiseach and the current Minister. His contributions have offered little enlightenment. Perhaps we should be grateful that at least he has managed to make the former  Attorney General and current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform finally speak on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">According to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, in February 2001 the Department of Education and Science estimated the upper liability at €254 million. By April, this had increased to €381 million and by June to €508 million. Currently, the Department estimates the liability at €772 million, which is still almost €250 million less than the estimate of the Comptroller and Auditor General. This shows that the estimates for liability were increasing rapidly. Yet it is clear from the report that the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Finance agreed in April 2001, when liability was estimated at €381 million and rising rapidly, to accept a contribution of €127 million from the religious congregations. They knew that this figure bore no relation to the actual liability faced by the State but they agreed it. I do not accept Deputy Peter Power's suggestion that anybody in this House wants to see the religious orders bankrupt. That suggestion is not fair to Members. I have never said that the liability should be divided on a 50:50 basis. It should be divided on an equitable basis and whoever should pay should do so in proportion to their responsibility. That is what Members of the House want to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">The Comptroller and Auditor General stated that "As additional information comes to hand it would be reasonable to expect that the full range of potential costs . . . would be revised."  This was not done. No revision of the lower estimate of the potential cost was made, despite evidence that the number of claimants was rising rapidly.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">It is clear from the correspondence between Ms Justice Laffoy and the Government that the potential cost of the commission was of concern to the Government. This is despite the fact that the commission was established to bring justice to a large number of people who were the victims of horrendous abuse at institutions throughout the country. Nevertheless, the Government felt able to enter into a deal with these congregations, that may well cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions of euro, without any qualms. There is also the matter of the legal advice obtained before signing this agreement. Who would enter into a pact worth €1 million without getting legal advice, not to mention a pact that might cost €1 billion? It is impossible to understand.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">When the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, announced in January 2002 that an agreement in principle had been made with the religious organisations, the Office of the Attorney General sought information on the detailed negotiations, including the extent of the indemnity offered. This information was sought on 31 January and 1 February 2002. Six weeks later the Attorney General wrote again and stated that unless he was supplied with the requested information he could not give legal advice on the deal. One month later, and ten  weeks after the Attorney General's original letter, the Minister finally responded. This was a bizarre situation. A Minister undertook negotiations that might cost the State up to €1 billion and the Attorney General had to ask repeatedly what was happening in those negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">We know from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that the talks were held in virtual secrecy and were attended by the Minister and one official. The Office of the Attorney General was not represented at meetings with the congregations and had no contact with those negotiating on behalf of the State from October 2001 to April 2002, a critical period for the discussions and deal making. The Office of the Attorney General was represented up to October 2001 but when the talks ran into difficulty, legal advice appears to have been suspended. This is highly peculiar action by the Department of Education and Science. Like so much else in this debacle, the review of the commission and the deal with the religious congregations, it beggars belief that this deal, worth so much and indemnifying so many, could come to pass without full legal advice being sought at every step along the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">When the information was finally sent to the Attorney General it was based upon what the Comptroller and Auditor General refers to as a "retrospective memorandum", drawn up after the negotiations as they had not been documented. Surely it is not standard departmental procedure to fail to minute important discussions and meetings, especially as their outcome would be a matter for later Cabinet approval. Yet when the Comptroller and Auditor General sought papers on the negotiations that took place between the Department of Education and the religious congregations, he discovered that no contemporaneous records of those negotiations were available. Did the Attorney General not question that issue at the time? Did the Tánaiste not question it in the Cabinet? The watchdog clearly lost its bite after the election in May of that year. It cannot be acceptable or standard procedure. Either something is seriously amiss in the way the Department undertakes all its sensitive negotiations or in the way it handled the meetings in question. Certainly, something was seriously amiss in the Government response.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">We must move on and get past this sorry mess, but in doing so we must learn from the mistakes made. We must ensure that procedures are put in place to ensure that none of this can happen again. No steps have been taken to that end. The Minister says that he wants the victims to obtain closure. That is not a word I like much, but it serves its purpose here. Much of the responsibility for this, though not all, lies in his hands. Give us closure on the deal done between the Department and the religious orders and on the questions we have raised and will raise today. Give us closure on the Department's responsibility in the handling of this issue for the last 50  years. Let the Minister and the Taoiseach lead now by example.</p>

          <p eId="para_738">I wish to express the Government's gratitude to Mr. Seán Ryan SC for agreeing to accept the position of chairperson of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. He is also conducting an independent review of the working of the commission. Mr. Ryan is currently a senior counsel of the very highest standing, and I am sure he will provide excellent leadership and guidance to the commission in its important work.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">The issue of child abuse in institutions in our society is a scandal of appalling proportions. The more we learn about such sickening activities in certain places, the greater our anger at those who perpetrated abuse and the greater our disappointment at those who allowed it to happen. When those matters were brought to my attention in 1998 by the then Minister for Education and various groups came to me, I agreed that I would not follow the practice of some years and would instead do something about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">Such abuse is not a recent development. The greatest proportion of abuse occurred many decades ago, before the reforms of the 1970s. However, for several reasons, the full extent of abuse in institutions has become apparent only in recent years. One of the reasons for the cloak of secrecy that surrounded the abuse was the failure of successive Governments to face up to the extent to which organs of the State have responsibility. There was a reluctance to admit that, as a State and as a society, we had failed many of the children of the nation by allowing them to be incarcerated in places where they were not cherished and were poorly treated.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">I will detail at length the measures which Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Governments have taken over the past four years to make some amends for the failures of the past. While I do so, I ask the House to bear in mind that while there may have been things that we could have done more efficiently, the totality of our actions has amounted to a comprehensive programme to do right by the victims. Other political parties did nothing at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">On 11 May 1999, I said:</p>
          <p eId="para_743">On behalf of the State and of all citizens of the State, the Government wishes to make a sincere and long overdue apology to the victims of childhood abuse for our collective failure to intervene, to detect their pain, to come to their rescue.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">I have stood by those words, and to the programme of action which accompanied them, for four years and I will continue to stand by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">One major aspect of that action plan involved the establishment of several measures to provide counselling for victims to help them overcome the effects of abuse. I am happy to report that those measures are working very well. The main measure is the National Counselling Service, which is operated through the health boards and  has an annual budget of about €7 million. For survivors resident in the UK, we provide counselling through the immigrant counselling and psychotherapy programme, at a cost of about €750,000 per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">We also recognise that some people will not avail of these State-provided services, either because they do not live in Ireland or Britain or because they are unhappy at the thought of dealing with State agencies. For those people, we pay for private counselling, a service which costs about €200,000 per year. Total Government expenditure on the various counselling activities since 1999 has been €17.5 million. I am proud to say that the Government has fulfilled its promises on the counselling of survivors of abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">One of the main elements of our action plan was the establishment of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. My intention at that time was for the commission to provide both a healing forum for victims to tell their stories and an investigative process which would allow a thorough examination of abuse in institutions. We all know that there was such abuse. The Laffoy commission was to establish the nature, cause and extent of the abuse and identify those responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">The commission was set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis immediately after my apology in May 1999, with Ms Justice Laffoy as its chairperson. During that year it made two reports to the Government, in which it proposed structures, powers and functions for a statutory commission. The Government accepted the proposals and gave effect to them in the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000. Thus, from the very outset, the Government accepted and co-operated with the commission. The same commission members, together with several new members, were re-appointed on a statutory basis one year after the apology in May 2000, shortly after the Act came into force.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">Another area in which the Government acted at the request of the commission was in the establishment of the Residential Institutions Redress Board. On 20 July 2000, Ms Justice Laffoy informed the Department of Education and Science that several solicitors representing victims were advising their clients not to participate in the commission in the absence of a Government commitment on compensation. I point out to Deputy Enright that this was the reason we took it up, since they refused to co-operate with the commission and rejected four attempts to pay them because they sought more. That was the reason we had to take issue with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">Ms Justice Laffoy expressed the concern that it would have serious repercussions for the work of the commission. She said the problem could be overcome by a decision from the Government to establish a compensation scheme. The Government engaged in a process of consultation arising out of that request and approved a compensation scheme in principle in early October 2000. That was followed by approval to draft legislation in  February 2001 and the publication of a Bill in June 2001. The Bill was enacted in April 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">Ms Justice Laffoy believes that the length of time which was taken by the Government in establishing the redress scheme was too long. I accept her criticism that a reasonably long period elapsed between her letter and the passing of the Act. I would have preferred a shorter period, but the legislation established a complex scheme under which hundreds of millions of euro in compensation will be paid out. Such things cannot be done overnight.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">I will now set out the reasons for entering into the so-called indemnity agreement which was announced in January 2002 and eventually signed in June 2002. That is the agreement between the religious congregations and the State, whereby the congregations contributed €127 million in cash and property towards the State's efforts to assist survivors of child abuse. In return, the State gave an indemnity to the orders against the cost of certain possible court cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">It must be understood that, irrespective of any contribution from congregations, the Government was committed to giving compensation to victims of abuse. That was our promise, and we intended to keep it. The redress board was set up for that purpose. If we had not agreed to compensate victims of abuse through that mechanism, each and every court case of abuse, of which there were then about 2,500, would have been fought in the High Court. If we had chosen the court route, it would have been necessary, to get a contribution from the congregations, to bring a claim for financial contribution against the religious orders in every single case. That would have taken years and would not have improved the position of victims. Their compensation payments would have been delayed; their cases would have been left sitting in the court lists in their thousands; legal costs would have piled up. Issues of compensation would have become tangled up in complex legal debates about limitation periods and the responsibility of religious orders for abusers. That would have been a nightmare scenario for victims, the court system and, in my view, the State. To have sat back and let court cases take their ordinary course would have been an abandonment of the victims of abuse. It would have amounted to dishonouring the commitment I had given them on behalf of the last Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">There is a commonly held belief, fostered by those who seek to confuse, that somehow the State was improvident in entering into the indemnity agreement. There are several facts which demonstrate that this argument is without foundation. Concluding the agreement with the religious orders was in the best interest of the State. First, it should be clear that the State had a significant degree of legal and moral liability for much of the abuse which occurred. The legal liability is an issue that could only be precisely determined by dragging every case to the courts,  though we can draw on some international experience. In Canada, where similar issues arose, the state agreed that it was 70% liable for abuse which had occurred. As recently as last February, the 30 Anglican dioceses in Canada agreed a contribution to the Canadian equivalent of the redress board. The contribution of those 30 dioceses is capped at €25 million, and their payment will comprise only 30% of the total in each case.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">On a moral level, we must acknowledge that we abandoned the children of another generation to those institutions and failed miserably to ensure that their interests were protected. It seems to me that everyone agrees with that proposition. However, the logical conclusion is that the State must bear a significant proportion of the responsibility towards victims. We faced up to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">In entering into the indemnity agreement, the State was conscious of the fact that many victims could, for an array of technical legal reasons, lose cases brought against religious orders. That would be an appalling scenario. To arrange for the religious orders to make payments to the State, totalling €127 million, was a sensible way to get a contribution in a timely fashion without expensive and risky litigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">I will now set out a number of legal problems that could have prevented victims from successfully suing religious orders. First, religious orders would have been entitled to rely upon the Statute of Limitations. At a minimum this would have been a major legal issue in each and every claim brought by victims of abuse. Indeed, where that defence was successfully made each victim of abuse, whose claim was statute barred, would have failed in his or her case. I recall all the efforts made in this House pleading with me to remove the Statute of Limitations. Had I left it the other way round that would not have been removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">Second, there were significant legal doubts over the responsibility of the current membership of religious orders for the wrongful actions of a brother, sister or priest that occurred many decades prior to a claim being made. The offending priest or brother may even have been long dead before all of the current membership of a religious order joined that order. In those circumstances there were significant uncertainties as to whether the current members of the religious order would have a legal responsibility for that abuse. Third, in addition, there was also a problem as to whether a member of a religious order was an employee of that religious order. Again, legal uncertainty and doubt existed.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">In Canada it had been held that religious orders were so responsible but in other countries, around the common law world, members of religious orders are not employees. Therefore, one basis for attributing liability to the current membership of a religious order would be absent.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">If the religious orders succeeded on any one of the above grounds the victims of abuse would  have failed in their claims. The only case remaining would be as against the State but we would have spent a fortune in terms of legal costs in getting to that point, which I reckon would have been about five years' time.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">These are not the only problems that existed. A major question would have arisen with regard to the assets of religious orders. Assets held by religious orders, on foot of charitable trusts, would have to be used for those trusts. Those assets cannot simply be seized. The idea that there were vast tracts of land that could be obtained by victims or the State is simply a nonsense. The courts could have gone through a process of hearing thousands of cases and encountered significant problems in enforcing judgments against religious orders and identifying what assets were available to pay these judgments.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">Furthermore, under the Civil Liability Acts, where a victim obtains a judgment for a monetary sum, the total amount of that judgment would have to have been paid by the State. This is because it is a fundamental principle of our code that where several people are responsible for committing a wrong, the victim can recover the whole of the loss against any of the wrongdoers. If one is even 1% responsible, in law, one can be forced to pay all the damages. One must then sue the person responsible for 99% of the wrong in order to collect a contribution from them. In the circumstances of child abuse, the State would have ended up paying all of the awards. Even if all of these legal uncertainties and complications could have been solved, with a wave of the magician's wand, a bigger issue arose.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">Was it the wish of the State that all of the religious orders would essentially be made bankrupt? Was it the intention of the State that the organised life of religious orders would come to an end? No matter which way one proceeded the choice was not a simple one. I believe the Government made its decision in the best interest of the victims and that it was the right decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">I have no apology to make to those members of the rainbow coalition who abdicated their responsibility towards victims. They chose to ignore their pleas and now seek to assume the role of champions of these victims. It is nothing more than rank hypocrisy. Members of the rainbow coalition – who are still in this House – should apologise to victims for their failure to help them when they sought that help or to even bother to meet them.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">On the topic of the cost of the redress scheme, we should bring a little reality to the debate. We cannot know exactly how many will come before the redress board or exactly how much it will cost, but we can make a fair estimate. About 2,500 people had litigation pending against the State when the board was set up. While it is likely that a number of additional claims over and above that figure will come before the redress board, the Government does not believe the total number will greatly exceed our original estimate of 2,000 to 4,000 cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">By the end of last week, about 2,000 people had applied for compensation from the redress board. While the time period for submitting a claim has not yet expired, I do not think there are a multitude of applicants out there who have not yet applied. The sooner people apply, the sooner they can collect their right and proper compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">The average amount of the awards is substantially less than we had budgeted for. Of the 160 cases in which payments have been made, the average award is about €80,000. It is reasonable to assume the majority of applications in the most serious cases will be made early on. That was certainly our experience of the Army deafness cases. Thus the average awards will probably fall over the next few years. In my opinion the cost of the scheme is likely to be within original estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">I wish to return to the particular issues relating to the Laffoy commission. As I said earlier, two distinct functions were envisaged by the commission which I proposed in May 1999. It would provide both a healing forum and an investigative process. Ms Justice Laffoy, in the report of the commission on its own proposed structures, suggested that these two functions be exercised by two separate committees of the commission. This proposal was adopted by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">The confidential committee was established to provide an environment where victims could recount their experiences without the trauma of legal procedures and cross-examination. That committee went on to receive applications from about 1,200 victims. About half of these have already been heard and the work of the confidential committee is proceeding satisfactorily. I thank the committee for its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">The investigation committee was established to investigate and report on abuse in a more formal way. It was empowered to make public findings of abuse and to allocate responsibility for it. Therefore, despite the fact that the hearings are in private, the findings of the investigation committee have the capacity to impact very severely on the reputations of the members of religious orders who are accused of abuse, as well as those in positions of authority over institutions where abuse occurred. This in turn means those people are entitled to the full range of rights under the law, particularly the right to legal representation. For every allegation investigated by the investigation committee, there may well be large legal teams not just for the victim and the alleged abuser, but for managers of institutions, religious congregations and the State. Thus the number of legal representations could be massive. The cost of such a system is enormous and there is a significant risk that the State will pay for much of this legal representation. We need to address the issue of legal costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">I was surprised at the number who chose to go before the investigation committee of the Laffoy commission, as opposed to its confidential committee. At 1,730, the number of complainants  before the commission is enormous. That, by October 2002, the investigation committee had heard only 40 of these cases made it clear to us that some significant reform was needed. Even if far greater resources were allocated to the commission, the slow pace of each case would have meant that the process dragged on for years, which would be of no benefit to anyone but the lawyers.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">My concerns about this are compounded by the following. As currently structured there could be over 10,000 separate legal appearances before the investigation committee, between lawyers for victims, alleged abusers, religious orders, institution managers and Departments. This degree of legal feeding frenzy was never our intention at the inception of the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">By November 2002, the commission estimated that, with the resources then available to it, its work would not be completed for another eight to 11 years. This work could cost up to €200 million in legal fees alone. For that reason, on 3 December 2002, the Government decided to examine the procedures of the commission. There was no plan to change the core mandate of the investigation committee – it would still investigate and then report on the causes, nature, extent and circumstances of abuse in institutions and those responsible for it. What would change was how it went about carrying out that investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">The commission was very helpfully involved with that review. The review group met the commission as a whole twice and with counsel for the commission on further occasions. The commission submitted two documents for the review group's consideration. Most, though not all, of the commission's proposals were accepted.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">The Attorney General submitted a completed review document on 26 February 2003. It was approved by the Government and drafting of the legislation was initiated. Subsequently, two factors combined to prevent the Government from completing the review process and led to the process entering a second phase in April 2003. One factor was the concern of the Minister for Education and Science as to whether some of the substantive proposals in the review would best achieve the objectives of the investigation committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">The other reason for the review process not being completed was the possibility that far more significant changes to the remit of the investigation committee might be required. I mentioned this on the Order of Business this morning. This possibility was created when the Irish Christian Brothers launched a judicial challenge to the entire investigation committee's method of operation. An essential claim made by the brothers is that the long period of time which has elapsed since the abuse took place, combined with the fact that some of those accused of abuse have died, make it inherently unfair for abuse to be investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">This case began as the review document was being finalised in mid-February 2003. Its implications for the commission could be quite significant. We will know its precise consequences – and thus what other statutory reforms are required – only after the decision of the court is made. If the Christian Brothers are even partially successful then further assessment of the work of the investigation committee will be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">It seemed logical to wait for the result of this case before concluding the second phase of the review. It was clear in April 2003 that the case would receive an expedited hearing by the High Court and a trial date of 13 May 2003 was obtained. The hearings concluded on 22 May. The Government then believed that a judgment would be handed down before the summer recess, though that has not transpired to be the case. It is still the Government's position that it would be preferable to have that decision before concluding the review and thereby the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">The possible impact of this case on the commission was highlighted in the decision of the Supreme Court in the Meenan case at the end of July, which related to the vaccine trials element of the commission's work. The court made references to the issues surrounding lapse of time and the treatment of elderly witnesses which may have repercussions in the Christian Brothers' case.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The commission was informed about this second phase of the review which was still ongoing when Ms Justice Laffoy resigned. What additional recommendations might have arisen from that review, had it been concluded, can only be speculated upon in light of the decision of the Government to ask the proposed new chairperson of the commission to conduct his own independent review of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">The resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy on 2 September came as a complete surprise to the Government. It is true that she had previously expressed her dissatisfaction with the reaction of the Department to various requests she had made and unhappiness at different times prior to the commencement of the review. However, the Government believed that all major points of contention, such as the discovery of documents and the issue of legal costs, had been resolved. We were not made aware that issues raised in connection with the review were of such a nature as to result in Ms Justice Laffoy's decision to resign.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">We were particularly sorry that Ms Justice Laffoy never expressed to the Minister the view that she would have to resign because of the second phase of the review, its prolongation and its consequences for the commission. As is now known, she had met the Minister several times during the second phase.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">There is no value to victims or to our wider community in dwelling on the unfortunate circumstances of Ms Justice Laffoy's imminent departure. The challenge now is to move the process forward. It was thus with great pleasure that  the Government announced Mr. Seán Ryan as the proposed new chairperson of the commission. He is also conducting a new review that is independent of the Department of Education and Science. This is the review that will be considered by the Government in due course. I look forward to a report from him and I can assure the House that his recommendations will be considered and acted on very promptly indeed.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">On behalf of the Government, I thank Ms Justice Laffoy for her dedication and hard work. She is an outstanding judge of the High Court whose departure from the commission is regretted by all. I also wish Mr. Ryan every success in his own work. I assure the victims of abuse that this Government will continue to do its best to help them achieve the greatest degree of peace of mind possible in all circumstances. As the only Taoiseach ever to face up to the issue of child abuse, this is an assurance that I can honestly give.</p>

        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_426">
          <from>Mr. O'Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_785">The most important issue as far as Fine Gael is concerned is the question of those people who have been abused. The trauma they were put through by that abuse, when they were young and in the care of the State and those religious orders which were supposed to be looking after them, is awful and exceptional. That this commission, which was appointed by the Oireachtas to inquire into the matter, has been stopped in its tracks after two years is unacceptable and reprehensible.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">I attended a packed meeting organised by SOCA in Liberty Hall last Sunday. There I listened to a succession of speakers who had suffered abuse at the hands of the State and the religious orders and I asked myself where is their voice, who is listening to them and what are we doing about resolving the issue. What is the Government doing about it and why has the Laffoy commission stopped? Why was there no problem in limiting the indemnity to €127 million while the costs to which the State would then be exposed could go up to €1,000 million? Where is the truth and reality in this situation?</p>
          <p eId="para_787">We all owe an apology to those who have suffered on account of this situation having dragged on for so long. The Taoiseach attacked the Opposition for not doing certain things. Nobody should make such an attack, and certainly not the Taoiseach. When we examine the interim reports of the Laffoy commission we can test what they actually said against what the Taoiseach said here today. I quote specifically from the Taoiseach's speech concerning the indemnity agreement:</p>
          <p eId="para_788">What must be understood is that irrespective of any contribution from congregations, this Government was committed to giving compensation to victims of abuse. That was our promise and we intend to keep it.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">Let us examine the Taoiseach's words in the light of the first interim report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse of May 2001, where Ms  Justice Laffoy and her commission comment on the reason for the delays in the section entitled Obstacles to Progress of the Commission's Work:</p>
          <p eId="para_790">While not the only factor which has impeded the work of the Investigation Committee, delay in responding to the Commission's requests that a viable scheme for payment of legal expenses be made has been the most significant obstacle. In the Commission's view, the delay was unnecessary and potentially damaging to the credibility and independence of the Commission. At last, almost a year after the establishment of the Commission, the obstacle has been partially removed to the extent that a scheme providing for the costs of legal representation has been provided and that a further scheme will be provided for the second phase.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">In regard to the effect of the delay the commission states: "The delay in making a scheme for the payment of legal expenses . . .  has impacted adversely on the progress of the work of the Investigation Committee."  Who was responsible for this delay? It was the Government. The report goes on to say that 32% of the complainants "were not prepared to submit statements . . .  because of the absence of such a scheme". In light of what the Taoiseach says, the report shows up the hollowness and emptiness at the heart of the Government's mishandling of this situation. It states:</p>
          <p eId="para_792">Throughout the period from September, 2000 to April, 2001 the Commission's primary concern has been the potential adverse effect on persons affected by the work of the Investigation Committee of the delay in bringing individual allegations . . .  to hearing. . . .  the impact of delay on its ability to fulfill its statutory functions and the increase in the duration of its work with consequential increases in the cost of the Commission to the State. The Commission's concerns were repeatedly conveyed to the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">The Taoiseach says the Government was committed to giving compensation. The Laffoy commission report says of the compensation scheme as follows:</p>
          <p eId="para_794">The views of the Commission were not sought on the issue of a compensation scheme in the period between . . .  July, 2000 and the announcement of the Government decision on 3 October, 2000. The Government decision did not envisage the Commission's having a role in advising on the modalities of a compensation scheme, as had been suggested in the Commission's letter of 26 July, 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">The report goes on:</p>
          <p eId="para_796">It is the Commission's understanding that the Government decisions have effectively rendered redundant any recommendations in relation to the modalities of a compensation scheme, which the Commission might have  made in an interim report at the end of the first phase of the work of the Investigation Committee, at any rate, in relation to residential institutions. The Commission regrets the lost opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">The report continues further:</p>
          <p eId="para_798">The ultimate success of its work will depend on the volume of evidence which it collects, which, in turn, will depend on the willingness of persons who have suffered childhood abuse in institutions, including non-residential institutions and foster care, to come forward and testify as to the abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">For the first year of the commission's operation it was not able to deal effectively with the issue of compensation. The Taoiseach's words are absolutely hollow and empty.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">Let me deal again with the issue of costs. The reason the Minister said he decided to intervene in the workings of the Laffoy commission was that the work, if it was to go on the way it was being done, would cost €200 million. The cost of the indemnity would be over €1,000 million. How can the issue of costs of €200 million be significant in the commitment that the Government was aware it would have to spend to sort out the whole situation? This Government must be condemned for its mishandling of this situation. Financial considerations should not be the prime motivation in what is happening with the Laffoy commission. However, significantly, some aspects of the money is all the Minister for Education and Science thought about.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">Anyone can visit the website of the Laffoy commission as I did. The commission was staffed by more than 30 professional people, including Ms Justice Laffoy and expert advisers. Its reports are consistent and it is clear, if one reads the reports and recognises their attempt to get to grips with this issue and bring it to fruition as quickly and as finally as possible, that those people were making every effort in the most sincere and practical way to assist the people who suffered abuse. For the Government to stop this commission in its tracks does not stand up to any argument. The costs of the Mahon tribunal, formerly the Flood tribunal, are now well in excess of €200 million and it is estimated that it may continue for 15 years. By comparison, the Laffoy Commission's second interim report stated that it expected to bring finality to this situation by 2005 at the earliest.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">Last December, everyone agreed a review was needed and Ms Justice Laffoy agreed to continue with her work. However, the review never came to fruition. At that point, the Minister for Education and Science intervened by stating that he would change the basis of the commission. I do not understand why the Government, which set up a review last December, is now tasking someone else to do that work in eight weeks. How can the eminent senior counsel, who has been appointed to head the new commission, complete  his task in eight weeks when a Government review could not be completed in nine months?</p>
          <p eId="para_803">Many serious questions remain unanswered by the Government. As I said at the outset, the most serious and hurtful part of this is that those who suffered most at the hands of these institutions have been waiting longest. Listening to the stories last Sunday, one could not but be struck by the terrible impact the abuse has had on people's lives. We listened to people whose friends, a number of whom tragically committed suicide, were in institutions with them. We listened to discussions about families that have broken up and heard stories from victims' peers about the awful way they were treated night after night. Many are still haunted by their memories. A gentleman in his late 60s could still remember children screaming as they were abused in the institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">These people have suffered long enough, particularly from the Government's tardiness in successfully providing the Laffoy Commission with the resources it needed and wanted. They are deeply unhappy and upset. I agree with Deputy Enright that we must move the process on. However, the Government must accept culpability for the way in which it has mishandled the situation. We must listen to the victims' voices, which are strong and clear. One lady asked me to mention the fact that she was abused and later placed in a psychiatric hospital. She has suffered severe trauma and her entire life has been shattered as a result of her experiences. She has been receiving counselling for some 13 years and still bears the marks of the tragedy on a daily and hourly basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">The message to the Government is clear – it must ensure that resources that are requested are provided and that the justice which has been denied, because it has taken so long to reach this stage, will be expeditiously resolved. This issue is bigger than any Government, Taoiseach or party.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_807">This is the biggest shame and scandal that has ever been exposed. It is worse than any political or planning corruption or the abuses inflicted by politicians on the State. The abuse of very young children in the care of the State and the religious orders is reprehensible and evil. It is an evil which will forever mark the souls of the people concerned and is absolutely unforgivable. We should come together and resolve this issue once and for all. The Government must accept the blame and criticism it rightly deserves.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">The Taoiseach gave the last paragraph of his speech over to Ms Justice Laffoy, whereas he should have devoted the entire script to her because the professional work she and the commission carried out was committed in every possible way to deal with this issue effectively in as just a manner as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">The point has been made by some Government Deputies that the resources of the religious  orders are finite. Of course that is the case and there is also a legal issue in that context. However, there is also a moral responsibility on the religious orders to come forward at this stage. Within the leadership of the religious orders there are committed and supportive people who reject what has happened. I appeal to them to come forward, hand in hand with the State, to resolve this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">One of the criticisms levelled is that many religious orders sought to exercise their constitutional rights to the courts. It is now time for the religious orders to put aside the legalities and totally and absolutely accept the blame that lies on their shoulders and purge themselves of this awful, evil past for which a minority of their numbers are responsible. They should move with the State to deal with this issue as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">The point was made on Sunday that many of the people who suffered this abuse are quite elderly and may die before they receive financial compensation. Financial compensation is not driving these people; they are driven by the trauma they have experienced and its effects on their lives, hearts and minds. It is fantastic that people who have suffered such abuse have come to play a full part in our society and community. We must put all of this aside as quickly as possible and resolve the issue in the manner sought by the representatives of those who have been abused. That is the kernel of the issue – forget the legalities and address this matter now.</p>

          <p eId="para_814">I wish to address comments which have been made about the Residential Institutions Redress Board by Labour Party Members, particularly Deputy Rabbitte, in the House. He highlighted the fact that the deed of indemnity agreed between the Government and certain religious orders was finally signed on 5 June 2002. I am on the record of the House as promising that we would do everything we could to bring that legislation into being before the change of Government and we did so. However, the full package was agreed in principle by the Government on 30 January 2002. That included the indemnity, the cash and property transfers and the total figure of €128 million. The final agreement was to be prepared, including the indemnity and the list of properties, for the approval of the Government and the signatures of the Ministers for Finance and Education and Science, and was ready for 5 June.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">The second point made was that the agreement was drafted by solicitors for the religious orders and not in the Office of the Attorney General. This, of course, is not true, a fact of which Deputy Rabbitte is aware. The Attorney General was actively involved at every relevant stage of the  preparation of the indemnity. The Government decided on the policy and the Office of the Attorney General dealt with the indemnity.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">The Minister for Education and Science replied to a parliamentary question on the issue from Deputy Costello on 27 February 2003. There is a reply by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to Deputy Richard Bruton on 25 February. On 27 February there is a reply to Deputy O'Sullivan from the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey. Each reply sets out the facts, as requested, in relation to these matters. On 25 February, Deputy Burton received a reply from the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. I quote from the second page of the reply as follows:</p>
          <p eId="para_817">An official from my Department [the Department of Finance] attended a meeting with representatives of the Department of Education and Science and religious congregations in mid-March 2002 to advance matters. This was followed by meetings between officials from the Department of Education and Science and the Office of the Attorney General and representatives of the religious congregations on the detailed provisions of the indemnity scheme. Officials from my Department were not in attendance at those meetings. However, my Department was kept informed of developments generally and met officials from the Department of Education and Science and the Office of the Attorney General in mid-May with a view to concluding matters at official level so that the agreement could be formally submitted to Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">These meetings took place.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">The next question raised was that the agreement was neither debated in nor approved by this House. As far back as 22 November 2000 I issued, as Minister for Education and Science, a press release which stated as follows, "Religious congregations agree in principle to participate in child abuse compensation scheme". This was followed by numerous statements in and outside the Dáil on progress achieved. On 30 January 2002 the Government agreed the package of €128 million, including indemnity, cash and land transfers, the final details to be prepared for approval by Government and signature of the Ministers for Finance and Education and Science. This agreement was made public.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">On 12 February 2002, the Joint Committee on Education and Science discussed in public session the contribution of the 18 religious orders represented by CORI. The attendance included me, as Minister for Education and Science, the officials and 15 committee members, including the Labour Party spokesperson, Deputy Shortall, the Fine Gael spokespersons, former Deputy Creed and Deputy Kenny. Members of the House asked for a special session and were given it on 12 February 2002.</p>

          <from>Dr. Woods</from>
          <p eId="para_822">The Deputy will get a copy in the Library. The joint committee stated as follows:</p>
          <p eId="para_823">The religious congregations have stated that they will also continue their co-operation with State and voluntary bodies in relation to property transfers for services to people in need. The Government, for its part, will indemnify the congregations directly concerned against claims arising from past child abuse, which are covered by the Residential Institutions Redress Bill. The precise form and full extent of that indemnity will be a matter for further detailed discussions between the group of officials and representatives of the congregations.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">On 20 February 2002 the Report and Final Stages were taken in the Dáil. The Government set out the package and provisions for the indemnity, including the estimate of up to €5 million. The Report and Final Stages were discussed, the question was put and agreed to by all parties, including the Labour Party. Deputies Creed and Shortall thanked the officials and the Minister for the work done on this complex Bill. Both regretted that day pupils were not included, which was outside the brief of this particular legislation. On 8 March 2002, the CORI compensation package was outlined, discussed and approved in the Seanad. It is available for anyone who wishes to see it. The Residential Institutions Redress Bill was enacted by the Oireachtas in April.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">The next question was that the Minister for Education and Science was unaccompanied at critical negotiation meetings by Government law officers. On 2 July 2003 a senior finance official appearing before the Committee on Finance and the Public Service explained the full package, the Department of Finance's involvement at every appropriate stage and that of the Attorney General's office.</p>

          <from>Dr. Woods</from>
          <p eId="para_830">In relation to the final agreement by the Minister for Education and Science, they said that we would have accepted a cap of €128 million for the indemnity had it been on offer the previous October. At the meeting of 16 October 2001, which was the final meeting of the officials group, there was a feeling at the meeting and at official level that no further progress could be made and that the issue would have to go to min isterial level before it was likely that any further progress could be made. It was then my duty as Minister to make one final effort to get the agreement back on track. With the Accounting Officer and Secretary General of my Department, I met the principal negotiators and succeeded in achieving the target which we know very well.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">If this had not been achieved the Government was proceeding without the involvement and any contribution from the religious orders. The legislation was being finalised in the Dáil and Seanad and Members needed to know if the talks had borne fruit. Otherwise the State would pay all the awards. The State accepted its moral and social responsibility for past abuse and its damaging effects on the victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">These are the facts. They demonstrate clearly that at all times the House was kept informed of developments with the religious orders concerned. Deputies and Senators who wanted to know about the particulars of the scheme being established did know and discussed the package openly both in committee and in the main Chambers. Indeed, it should be noted that those among the Labour Party benches who are currently most critical of the scheme were among those involved. Why then is the Opposition seeking to score petty points over such a sensitive issue, one in which they have constantly reminded the Government that the victims should be our paramount concern? It appears the attacks are made in an attempt to embed the notion in the public consciousness that the Government is reckless with taxpayers' money. There is a deep contradiction in this criticism in that it is impossible to assert on the one hand that the victim should come first and on the other call on the Government to avoid expenditure on redressing the injury suffered by those victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">Finally and more importantly, when the Taoiseach made his apology in 1999 to those who suffered in institutions in the past, he acknowledged the moral responsibility that lay at the State's door for the horrendous acts perpetrated in these institutions. It logically followed from this apology that the State would have to make recompense, which it is rightly doing at present. Thus, all this current conflict over the issue can only be seen as an attempt to score points for political gain.</p>

          <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_834">I am thankful for this opportunity to speak on what is effectively one of the great nightmares that has haunted modern Ireland. The improvements achieved in recent years are haunted by the horrible memory of what occurred in these institutions. This happened under the direct authorisation of the then Government, and successive Governments. It is important to note that virtually everyone in Ireland is implicated in what happened in these homes. That is the bald truth of the issue we are debating. The Irish people, for whatever reason, were unable to provide the proper social welfare supports that the State now lavishly gives to its  citizens. At a particular period in its history it entrusted vulnerable and disadvantaged people to the care of religious institutions where in some instances they were systematically abused.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">I have rarely been moved to tears during my political work. This has happened on a handful of occasions when I heard the single-minded, honest stories of victims of abuse. Most of them are not seeking compensation for the wrongs done to them. The main reason I was moved to tears was many of them showed huge levels of Christian forgiveness for the perpetrators of the abuse. It is sad that is the case but the quality of these people is such that they are prepared to move on and forgive the abusers.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">Others want to tell their stories and want compensation. That is why the Taoiseach acknowledged the State's guilt for the first time in our history a number of years ago. Members of the rainbow Government had every opportunity to acknowledge the State's guilt in this matter but they chose not to respond in the same manner as the Taoiseach to the abuse victims.</p>

I am sick of lectures from the Labour Party about sensitivity in regard to this matter. The party was in the rainbow Government that addressed a sensitive issue surrounding the late Brigid McCole. Little sensitivity was shown by that Government. It engaged in a harsh, unreasoning, relentless legal pursuit of a dying woman. Labour Party members fully participated in the Government that made that decision and they are lecturing the Taoiseach, the Fianna Fáil Party and the coalition Government on caring and sensitivity in regard to abuse victims.</p>

          <p eId="para_841">That is utterly hypocritical. The Government has shown sensitivity and concern on this issue for the first time in our history in an upfront manner. It has accepted the State's responsibility for the abuses that occurred and apologised forthrightly. It did not make a mealy mouthed apology or adopt a mealy mouthed legal approach in pursuit of the victims to minimise the payments. That is what happened to Brigid McCole. That should be contrasted with the approach of the Taoiseach and the Government. They put up their hands, acknowledged the State's wrongdoing and immediately moved to establish a system of compensation that was non-adversarial and that allowed people to receive compensation in a non-threatening, non-aggressive and non-confrontational manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">The Government has adopted a lacklustre approach in terms of the speed it is dealing with the issue because it does not want the system of compensation to become yet another excuse for our many lawyers to enrich themselves again. I agree with Deputy O'Dowd's comment regarding this issue. It is more important than the political and financial abuses that have been exposed by the Flood, Moriarty and McCracken tribunals, which have involved people inside and outside the House who threw money around to achieve particular results, because it involves the abuse of innocents who were abandoned by the State. It is time people acknowledged the hypocrisy of the Irish people in allowing this to happen and looking the other way. It is as bad as what happened to the Jewish community in Germany under Hitler's rule. People looked the other way in Ireland and refused to accept what the State was doing. They preferred to get on with their lives and ignored the victims of abuse because they were in institutions and could be forgotten.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">The Government has committed itself forcefully to addressing the issue. Whether it is effective is a moot point, as the Opposition claims. However, I object to the theory expounded by Deputy Rabbitte. It is not new for the Deputy to expound big conspiracy theories. I am driven to the conclusion that Deputy Joe Higgins is at the same stage Deputy Rabbitte was ten years ago. Deputy Joe Higgins also expounds big conspiracy theories but he has ended up in jail. Deputy Rabbitte has decided to move on from his big conspiracy theory but every now and then he feels he must launder it through the House. Many years ago I sat in the Press Gallery when he made totally unfounded allegations about a senior prelate, which he claimed would rock the foundations of the State. They did not because they were not true. He listened to gossip and rumour around the House, abused Dáil privilege and transmuted it into a monstrous allegation against somebody who was innocent of the allegations.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">He made a similar cosy claim yesterday regarding the indemnity deal concluded between the previous Government and the Church authorities. The Deputy would like us to believe the Government did a cosy deal by helping the Church to minimise its exposure in this matter. The State is facing the biggest—</p>

          <p eId="para_849">I am not suggesting anything about the Comptroller and Auditor General. I am making assertions about the Labour Party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, who is an expert in insinuation and conspiracy theory nonsense which he constantly relates to the House, without regard to the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">The State was faced with stark choices in terms of the indemnity deal. A system of trusts is used by the Church to safeguard the money donated to it and it could have avoided responsibility, financial or otherwise, in regard to this matter. It could have gone to the courts, dragged the victims through a legal process, made their lives hell and ensured they received no compensation ultimately. Instead, a system has been established through which redress will be made in terms of compensation with prejudice and the legal proof normally required in court. That is appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">The problem with the indemnity deal is the State accepted full liability. The State realised a contribution of €128 million by the religious orders and an acceptance of responsibility. They were under no obligation to make the payment and, if the religious orders were commercial organisations, they would not have made the payment in a month of Sundays. They have made the payment following a deal negotiated with great difficulty.</p>

          <p eId="para_856">It is best to leave lawyers and accountants out of commercial and other negotiations until the end when they can tie up the issues that arise. It is appropriate that lawyers should not be involved in cases of abuse so that they do not complicate issues that could be resolved through direct negotiation.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">The Government has done the right thing. It is embarrassing that Ms Justice Laffoy resigned but she did the victims of abuse no favours by doing so. If I were her, I would have stuck in there and fought the case. I am disappointed she chose to resign. I would not mind if she resigned from a tribunal at Dublin Castle but, because of the seriousness of what is involved in the commission, she was wrong to do so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_454">
          <from>Ms O'Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_858">I wish to share time with Deputy Burton. I would like to get the debate back on track as I want to establish the direction in which the investigation into child abuse is going. I hope the Minister will respond in this regard later because we owe it to the victims of  abuse to lead the debate towards what will happen next.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">It is more than four years since the Taoiseach's apology was made on behalf of the people. The events which led to the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy and the debacle of the indemnity deal with the religious institutions and the redress board reflects an abject failure on the part of the Government to follow up on that apology with any meaningful action for the vast majority of victims of abuse. That is where our focus needs to be today. We need to find some way in which they can have a meaningful experience and some restitution within a reasonable timeframe. That is what has broken down and gone off the rails as a result of the way in which Ms Justice Laffoy was treated by the Government and as a result of the debacle with regard to the residential institutions and the indemnity deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">I hope I will have the opportunity to focus on that issue and on exactly what the Minister intends to do from now on. I must first take the time to address some of the accusations made by the Government side against my party and, in particular, Deputy Peter Power's suggestion that the Labour Party is suggesting that money should not be spent to make restitution. That is not what we are saying. The Labour Party fully supports the payment of due compensation to anybody who has suffered abuse in the past in institutions at the hands of the State or religious institutions. I want that on the record. What we are objecting to is the way in which the deal was negotiated which put undue onus on the State with regard to the relative balance of responsibility between the State and religious institutions. That point has also been raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General. In effect, it appears that only one eighth of the cost will fall on the religious institutions. That is way below the percentages quoted for Canada, for example, and way below the percentages originally intended when the Government went into negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">In its discussions with the religious institutions it never updated the costs that would arise with regard to the redress board. Nor did it table in the question of costs in cases that went to court, given that what was agreed in the indemnity was not only costs in relation to the redress board but also subsequent costs with regard to court cases that might be taken within the remit of the redress board. The indemnity is therefore open-ended to the extent that the State will be responsible for costs in cases where people choose to go to the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">Those are the issues in respect of which the Labour Party has been trying to get answers over quite a period of time since Deputies Rabbitte and Shortall first raised these issues. It is disingenuous and dishonest to suggest that the motivation of the Labour Party is other than it is. It is also disingenuous and dishonest to suggest, as the former Minister, Deputy Woods, has just done, that the spokespersons for the Opposition were aware of the detail of the indemnity at the time  he suggested they were. They were not aware of those details until Deputies Shortall and Creed specifically looked for them after the whole process was completed when the Government had, in effect, agreed on a contribution of €128 million. The Opposition was not aware, when those issues were discussed at the committee, of the precise details of the indemnity agreement, particularly the fact that it indemnified the religious institutions against any cases that might be taken subsequent to the redress board. It is not true to say that Opposition spokespersons were aware of the details of the deal at that time. It is important to put that on the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">The Taoiseach said there was no value to victims or to the wider community in dwelling on the unfortunate circumstances of Ms Justice Laffoy's imminent departure. Unfortunately, we have to dwell on the reasons Ms Justice Laffoy tendered her resignation as chairperson of the commission. If we do not we will not learn any lessons from it and we will not find out what the commission can do under the chairmanship of Mr. Seán Ryan SC when he takes over the mantle of Ms Justice Laffoy. Clearly Ms Justice Laffoy resigned because she was not getting the support and the resources she needed. If Mr. Ryan does not get the resources and support he needs, neither will he be able to carry out the remit, which was the original remit of the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">Ms Justice Laffoy made it quite clear in her letter of resignation from the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse that her action was the result of Government inaction in response to her repeated requests for co-operation, resources and a more effective structural model of operation to carry out her remit in a timely fashion. Despite more than three hours of questioning at the education committee, there has been no satisfactory answer from Government as to why her specific proposals to speed up the investigation commission's work were ignored, why the Minister's first review was not published and acted upon and why Ms Justice Laffoy was driven to resign by a further long-fingering of the review.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">It is interesting that one of the things the Minister admitted was that there were delays with regard to discovery of documents. He specifically referred to Goldenbridge and other institutions. Ms Justice Laffoy's contention that there were delays was admitted by the Minister for Education and Science. He did not tell us, however, why he was not publishing the first review. He did not tell us why there was a delay in implementing the proposals Ms Justice Laffoy made. It is important to quote what Ms Justice Laffoy said in her letter of resignation:</p>
          <p eId="para_866">This prolongation of the duration of the Government review is merely the latest in a series of events which have, since the inception of the statutory Commission over three years ago, impeded the completion by the Commission of its statutory mandate as set out in the Act of 2000 in a timely fashion. A range of factors over which the Commission has had no  control have together produced a real and pervasive sense of powerlessness. In retrospect, it appears to me that since its establishment, the Commission has never been properly enabled by the Government to fulfil satisfactorily the functions conferred on it by the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">What I want to ask – this is in the interests of the people to whom many have referred and on whose interests we should be focused – is what exactly does the Minister propose to do differently to speed up the working of the commission? Is he going to do what Ms Justice Laffoy suggested and provide the personnel to set up four parallel divisions so that cases can be dealt with simultaneously? This is a practical proposal by Ms Justice Laffoy that could and should have been implemented when she first suggested it, and it is quite a long time now since she suggested this. If it had been done at the time, and if the resources had been given, the work would have been speeded up considerably.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">Another question that must be asked is whether the Minister will take action to reduce the adversarial approach of the religious congregations. He again said that this was one of the major reasons the work of the commission could not be speeded up. Surely some legal advice was given to the Government when that Bill was being drafted. The legal advisers must have examined the question of the legal right of people to defend their name. There must surely have been some advice and some pre-emptive knowledge that this was likely to happen. Will the Government publish the advice that was given initially with regard to the setting up of the commission?</p>
          <p eId="para_869">It may be appropriate to note what was said about the commission when the Minister for Education and Science announced it on the same day as the Taoiseach made his apology more than four years ago. He said that the commission will be specifically mandated to carry out a thorough and comprehensive inquiry into allegations and establish responsibility at the level of the individual abuser, the institution and management and regulatory authorities, and that the committee will have available to it the resources and all the legal powers and protection it needs to do this. Obviously it was known exactly what was intended in setting up the commission, and these problems could have been pre-empted and the resources given to the commission to deal with these issues. It seems extremely naive to think that this will happen now because of a simple appeal to the church's sense of moral duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">If we are expecting the religious congregations to adopt a less adversarial approach, how can we expect it to happen simply by asking when it has not happened all along? It could have been done much more effectively in the context of the discussions about the disastrous indemnity deal. The extent of claims and the adversarial approach which is being adopted by the congregations had become apparent before the infamous deal was signed. Not only was the final deal hopelessly lopsided against the State in terms of the percentage  of the projected eventual cost it was taking on, it also represented a missed opportunity to achieve the non-adversarial atmosphere that was promised to victims in both the commission and the redress board. We need to ask the Minister to outline his exact proposals to reduce the adversarial nature of the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, told the joint committee that he is considering writing to more than 1,700 individuals who have indicated their intention to go before the investigation committee, to ask them whether they still want to do so. I accept that some of the survivors' groups have suggested that this be done. Given that over four years have passed since the Taoiseach's apology and the announcement of the establishment of the commission, however, I cannot help concluding that the Government is hoping that people are frustrated by the fact that further time is to be lost as a result of Ms Justice Laffoy's resignation, which resulted from the Government's failure to respond to her concerns. It may be that the Government hopes that some people will give up on the process and that the work of the commission will be speeded up as a result. It is a gross failure and a further abuse of those who suffered such harm in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">It will be extraordinarily difficult for most victims of abuse to face their traumatic past again. The length of time this process is taking is extending that pain even further. It is probably true that many people will decide that they cannot take the pain and will forego their right to attend the investigation committee. If that is the case, the process will be hastened but the original purpose of the commission will have been failed. The State will have failed to deliver on its promises to survivors of abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">Before I share the rest of my time with my colleague, Deputy Burton, I wish to state that the Minister needs to give answers regarding sampling. He said that he was parking the notion of sampling, but he did not say that he intends to abandon it. The Minister needs to clarify this matter.</p>

          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_874">When I returned to the Dáil last year, I was struck by a difference between it and the previous Dáil of which I had been a Member. The number of millionaires in the House, particularly on the Fianna Fáil benches, had increased noticeably. As somebody who was not brought up in particularly advantageous circumstances, I am acutely aware that many of the stories of what happened in residential institutions must seem absolutely unbelievable to many Members of the House who are hearing them now. I do not blame such people for having a sense of disbelief when they hear that such things happened, that they happened over such a long period of time and that they happened in so many different institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">I would like to discuss a matter of historical record. Deputy Conor Lenihan and other Fianna  Fáil Members engaged in some buffoonery earlier when discussing this serious subject. The biggest historical change in this area was introduced two former Labour Party leaders, Brendan Corish and Frank Cluskey, both of whom are now dead. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will remember that the coalition Government of the 1970s introduced a benefit payment for those who were known as "unmarried mothers". This measure brought an end to the practice whereby young women had to hand over their children to "the cruelty man" or people from various agencies that sought to take children from their parents. The benefit scheme, along with publication of the Kennedy report, marked the beginning of the end.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">We should also stress the importance of the decision of the former Fine Gael Minister, John Boland, to prohibit corporal punishment in our schools. Such measures contributed to a sea change in Irish society, including the end of some of the horrific practices which have been mentioned. It should also be pointed out that many people in Fianna Fáil, including Charlie Haughey, took many initiatives which empowered poor people from an income point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">The abuse we are discussing was about poverty, above all else. The main crime committed by the children who were incarcerated and the parents from whom they were taken was the crime of being poor.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">The second factor which should be cited relates to the most surprising element of today's debate. I have welcomed the Taoiseach's laudable apology to victims on many occasions, as I feel it was genuine. That apology has been accompanied today, however, by an attempt to shift retrospectively any responsibility from the religious orders. It seems that an attempt is being made to create a culture of impunity regarding many thousands of crimes that were perpetrated against Irish children. Several Fianna Fáil Members have mentioned the appalling vista, to quote the former master of the rolls in the UK, that some religious orders might be bankrupted. Those who lived in residential institutions, including the victims of abuse, are looking to this Parliament not just for money. Not all of the lawyers who are representing victims and those who lived in institutions are ambulance chasers who are looking for money. Many of them are doing a very good job for those they represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">We have encountered the Government's second significant motive again and again today. I do not know whether the attempts to protect the Catholic Church and certain religious congregations in particular can be attributed to an excessive religious zeal on the part of certain Members on the Government side, present and past. My honest view is that if it is the case, such people have a misplaced desire to protect religious congregations.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">I would like to make a few more points in the time that is available to me. The Minister made many references to his belief that the redress  scheme is working well. I do not think that is necessarily the case, however, based on what I heard at a meeting I attended at Liberty Hall on Sunday. I do not accept the assertion that the redress scheme is working well for everybody. As it is cloaked in secrecy, we have not yet received a report about its operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned that when civil servants from the Department of Finance attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service earlier in the summer, they made it absolutely clear that the former Minister, Deputy Woods, went AWOL for several months while he attempted to do a deal on his own. The final deal was structured at that stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">I would like the Government parties to consider the fact that it now seems that when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, was Attorney General, he was kept out of the picture and away from the deal. If this was not the case, he must have been entirely negligent by not pursuing properly, in his capacity as Attorney General, the State's correct interest, as set out by the Taoiseach in his apology, in trying to find some sort of restitution and justice for those who lived in the institutions. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the independent Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. I reject the implicit criticism of that office on the part of Deputy Conor Lenihan, in particular, during his buffoon speech about this issue. The Deputy's contribution was a deeply regrettable one.</p>

          <p eId="para_884">Many of those who lived in residential institutions that were run by religious orders had put that part of their lives to one side, for better or for worse. The fact that the Government issued an apology and established a scheme made many people come forward. Such people may have decided to speak to their families, friends or children about their experiences. The tragic aspect of what has happened is that many such people, having brought an extremely difficult period in their lives back to the surface, have been left high and dry with a deeper sense of frustration and injustice. I have spoken to many people who have gone to the various committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">Today's debate exposed an excessive and misplaced religious zeal on the part of some Members to protect the religious orders so that they do not have to face up to their responsibilities. In that context, I welcome Archbishop Martin's comments at his inauguration. The archbishop did the church in Ireland a considerable service by saying that the legal road was not the right road to follow. I applaud him for his comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">I would like the Taoiseach to reconsider the damage done to the people who came forward in good faith to look for some sense of justice out of this process, many of whom have been left  worse off. They made a series of requests. For instance, SOCA has been sidelined by the structures the Department of Education and Science has created. They asked, for instance, for the question of interim payments to be considered. In the context of all the damage done to very brave people who suffered at the hands of religious institutions, the Government ought to think again</p>

          <p eId="para_887">Members of the House, especially new Members, may not be aware that the Administration of which Deputy Burton was a member was approached by the survivor groups and asked to deal with this issue when it was in office. Not alone did that Government decline to help but it declined to meet the persons who were looking for justice. The display of moral indignation we have had to listen to on this issue is entirely at odds with the Opposition parties' record in office.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">The constant insinuation, which we heard this afternoon and which plays to a particular part of the electoral market, that the current Administration is involved in a transaction with religious authorities or groups behind the scenes, is without foundation. The Government will act in the public interest in this matter and in the interest of the victims of the terrible wrongdoing that went on in these institutions over many decades. The Taoiseach was the first senior office holder in the country to come forward and unequivocally acknowledge that wrongdoing a number of years ago when – and I say this, in fairness, to the members of the rainbow Administration – the matter was brought to light by our public broadcasting service.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">Deputy Rabbitte raised a serious issue this morning. He said that the difficulties of the investigation committee of the Laffoy commission would drive more abuse victims to the High Court. That is not correct.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_893">It is not possible to institute proceedings in the High Court for the purposes of having an investigation. Proceedings are instituted in the High Court for the purposes of claiming damages, seeking declarations of legal right or restraining persons from carrying out particular actions. One cannot invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court to have an investigation. One can invoke it to claim damages and when one does so the High Court adjudicates on that. The Government put the redress board in position to ensure that the survivors of these terrible abuses  would have a far more expeditious remedy available to them which would not expose them to the publicity, confrontation and expense of the High Court. Throughout this controversy the provision of the redress board has not been an issue. There is no connection between Ms Justice Laffoy's resignation and the redress board. For Deputy Rabbitte to muddy the waters by suggesting that the difficulties of the investigation committee would drive abuse victims to the High Court is incorrect. I am not saying he is misleading the House but he is incorrect and he is saying the wrong thing to those who have to cope with terrible difficulties as a result of the treatment they received in these institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">Survivors of child abuse can go directly to the Residential Institutions Redress Board. They do not need to go to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse before taking such a course. They can appeal awards from the redress board to the courts or invoke directly the jurisdiction of the courts. In fact, a substantial number have gone to the redress board.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">The previous Government addressed these issues and put the needs of victims at the centre of its response. I accept that it is difficult to get every detail right. The Taoiseach faced up to our collective failures in the past, apologised for those failures and set about redressing the wrong. The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the redress board were set up and a counselling service was provided through the health boards. We did not walk away or ignore this issue. We must help the victims of this abuse in every possible way through counselling and through the provision of the existing compensation scheme but not through barrister fattening exercises. The Government is trying to do its duty by the public interest and ensure that the taxpayer is protected, not at the expense of the victims but of those who seek to tell stories on their behalf. The Government is entitled to do that and that is how the Government has approached this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">There has been understandable controversy stemming from the arrangement the Government made with the religious orders. The Government decided to institute a redress scheme regardless of the involvement of the religious orders and congregations. It is important that this point is taken into account when one looks at the indemnity arrangement. The Government decided to pay up in any event because these schools were subject to State inspection.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">In a Canadian authority, which has already been referred to in this debate and which deals with a similar circumstance obtaining in Canada, the state accepted a 75% liability and not a 50% liability. The Department of Finance, whose documentation has been referred to in the course of the debate, would have liked the State to have obtained a 50% indemnity from the religious congregations. I would also have liked that. However, it would have been very difficult for the State to have obtained that indemnity because  the State was dealing with a legal party over which it had no control. It was dealing, not with a single legal party but with a number. These institutions were not managed by one religious order. It is easy for some Deputies to use expressions such as "the church". When one translates it into its legal manifestations and personalities, the church is a very wide range of personalities. Trustees of different dioceses and religious orders, some of whom did not manage these schools, have contributed to this fund. When one considers the legal personalities involved in the indemnity arrangement and the precise liability position the State was heading into, it is not surprising that the State decided, for its own sake, to take what money could be got out of these religious bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">I agree with Deputy Burton that the recent statement by the Archbishop of Dublin that religious institutions should not stand on their legal rights is an admirable sentiment but that sentiment must be translated into practicality in any negotiation in which the State is involved. In the context of these negotiations the predominant sentiment of the legal advisers of the various congregations in the Conference of Religious of Ireland was to look for the best deal for their clients.</p>

          <p eId="para_903">Nothing was agreed until everything was agreed by the Government. The State put the redress board in position and agreed to pay 100%. The State was then left to negotiate with a multiplicity of religious congregations and organisations, some of which might not have had the assets to meet the judgments, were they executed against them. I am not pleading a fear of bankrupting a religious order as an objection. I am making the point that some of the religious orders would not have had the assets to satisfy the judgments or to satisfy a judgment which the State would have obtained against an order by way of indemnity in proceedings which could have been exceptionally protracted and costly. Given the finding in the Canadian case, were the State to have insisted that the survivors should proceed against it and the religious authorities in open court with considerable legal representation, there is absolutely no guarantee that the State would not have ended up paying the costs  of the church's lawyers as well as the damages of the victims.</p>

          <p eId="para_907">As a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Science, I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate. This issue began with the very important and sincere apology made by the Taoiseach on Tuesday, 11 May 1999. He apologised to the victims of child abuse and indicated that the law would be changed to allow for the extension of the statutory limitations for compensation cases in this area. In April 2000, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act became law. In July 2000, Ms Justice Laffoy informed the Department of Education and Science that a number of solicitors representing clients alleging abuse were advising those clients not to participate in the commission in the absence of a Government commitment on compensation. In October 2000, the Minister for Education and Science announced that the Government had agreed in principle to establish a special compensation scheme and that compensation would be paid on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis. In February 2001, the Minister for Education and Science announced that the Government had agreed to his proposal for a compensation scheme, and in May 2001 the Laffoy commission published its first interim report. In June 2001, the Minister for Education and Science presented the Residential Institutions Redress Bill to the Dáil. In August 2001, the Minister for Education and Science appointed a committee pursuant to sections 14 and 15 of the Residential Institutions Redress Bill 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">I wanted to list these dates because if one examines the period commencing in May 1999, one will note that there has been much activity in respect of this matter on the part of the Government, the Laffoy Commission and the Residential Institutions Redress Board under Judge Sean O'Leary.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">Our primary concerns must be that victims receive counselling and compensation where appropriate, that they tell their story to the investigative committee and that, when the Commission of Inquiry into Child Abuse report is published, the public is made aware of what took place. It is entitled to know and wants to know what took place.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">I honestly believe that the Labour Party has whipped this issue into an almighty row on the basis of very little.</p>

          <from>Mr. Mulcahy</from>
          <p eId="para_912">I cannot understand the arguments or attempted logic of the Labour Party regarding the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. It has made much of the agreement on indemnity between the Government and CORI, yet it fails to mention in any of its contributions that before any agreement was made with CORI on its contribution to the scheme, the Government had already decided that a redress scheme would be established regardless of the contribution by any other party.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">There must be a severe shortage of lawyers in the Labour Party because it-it sees to fail to realise that, under the civil liability Acts, if any liability falls on the State, even if it amounts to only 1%, the victims are entitled to recover the full 100% of their damages against the State. Against this background, it makes for sound economic sense and management to set up a statutory compensation scheme, thereby obviating the need for thousands of separate legal actions before the High Court with the resulting expense to the State and further trauma and difficulties for the victims. Perhaps the Labour Party should take this into account before it stirs this matter up further.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">The Labour Party is making a song and dance about financial competence and fiscal responsibility. Does it find it acceptable – I do not believe the public does – that, as the commission of inquiry was constituted, it would have taken eight years, if not 11, before a final report was available?</p>

          <p eId="para_917">Is the Labour Party aware that with such delays the State would be liable to pay legal costs perhaps in the region of €200 million? Moreover, is it aware that the victims' support groups have warmly welcomed the appointment of the new interim chairman, Mr. Sean Ryan, SC?</p>

          <p eId="para_921">I am not surprised by the offensive attitude of the last speaker. She seemed to imply that Fianna Fáil and the Government were somehow trying to let the religious institutions off the hook and cover up for them. The only people who need to cover up their lack of activity are those who were members of the rainbow Government from 1994 to 1997 and who did diddly-squat about this issue. I am informed that Deputy John Bruton promised, through his private secretary, to offer a full counselling and therapeutic service through the health boards, but nothing happened. I am also informed that the then Minister with responsibility for children was also approached by victims and victims' groups but that nothing was done as a result. I do not see why the Government should be criticised for putting in place a scheme of compensation and investigation that the vast majority of victims and victims' groups warmly supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">Furthermore, I want to get rid of some of the crocodile tears of the Opposition. On Thursday, 6 February 2003, three representatives from the Department of Education and Science, Mr. Boland, Mr. Kennedy and Ms Grogan, came before the Joint Committee on Education and Science and discussed all the details of the redress scheme and the various levels of compensation etc. Was there one word of criticism of that compensation scheme from any of the Opposition members attending the meeting? Did Deputy O'Sullivan criticise the scheme? No.</p>

          <p eId="para_933">There is a clear difference between the Government led by Deputy Bertie Ahern and the previous rainbow Government. The latter sat on its hands with regard to this issue whereas we have taken the bull by the horns. It is not an easy issue to deal with. This is a complex issue, which must deal with judicial evidence covering the past 20, 30 40 and even 50 years. It is an issue in which any civilised person would seek to ensure that the victims are not put through the High Court, which would only increase their stress.</p>

          <p eId="para_940">I congratulate Mr. Seán Ryan, SC, for accepting the appointment of new chairman of the commission. I wish him well and every success in his work. I agree with the Taoiseach that his leadership and commitment to the commission will be vital. It is ironic that the Taoiseach should refer to the need for leadership in the context of this debate. He claimed credit for launching the initiative, which must be acknowledged. However, he must also provide the stewardship and leadership to see it to its conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, entered an agreement with the religious orders which exposed the taxpayers to unlimited liability. There was an absence of stewardship and leadership at that time. The Attorney General either chose not to be part of the arrangement or was kept from being party to it. That matter has still to be explained, as has the lack of any written minutes on the specifics of the  meetings held. For the Taoiseach to accept that amounts to a default in his responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">Following the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy, the Taoiseach should have recognised the crisis of confidence and taken on board her criticism that she did not get full co-operation from the Department of Education and Science. However, he left the matter in the hands of the Minister, thereby perpetrating the conflict of interest which has been at the heart of the difficulties experienced by Ms Justice Laffoy. The problems continue unresolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">I ask the Taoiseach to provide some leadership on this matter rather than acting under the delusion that the Government co-operated with the commission. It is clear from Ms Justice Laffoy that this was not the case. The Taoiseach also said that her only criticism was that a reasonably long period of time elapsed between her letter and the passing of the Act. That was not the case. Ms Justice Laffoy made many criticisms, mainly directed against the Department of Education and Science, which is still in charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">It is clear that the Government has not taken seriously the fall-out from the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy. We are, unfortunately, destined to debate again problems that are avoidable. This should be avoided for the sake of the victims, who have been through enough pain.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_945">The primary focus in this debate must be on the victims of abuse and the failure by the Government to adequately resource the commission to inquire into the abuse. The Government has been accused by Ms Justice Laffoy of never having enabled the commission to operate properly since its inception. It stymied the work of the commission, which caused delays and created a sense of powerlessness that made its work inoperable.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">The learned judge resigned and the Government's spokespersons expressed surprise. How is it supposed the victims felt? Were they surprised? Did they feel let down, again, by the State? Did they expect more? These children were made to work like agricultural slaves in the fields. They were half starved, humiliated, tortured and physically and sexually abused. My colleague, Deputy Conor Lenihan, said he was moved to tears at the revelations. One would want to be made of stone not to be moved to tears when listening to the victims' stories. Many were released uneducated and emotionally shut down into a society that looked on them as somewhat tainted, certainly different. Huge numbers emigrated and many turned to drink, drugs and crime. Many are still imprisoned in institutions while many more are regretting opening their emotional scars. They are dealing with them with various degrees of success.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">The purpose of the commission was to look into the State's complicity in this abuse. We will never know if Ms Justice Laffoy would have uncovered that the State or the health boards, the Garda Síochána, the Department of Education  and the religious orders knew about it. We will also never know if the abusers, when discovered, were given new jobs where they abused other children. The apology to the victims by the Taoiseach on behalf of the State was correct, but the collapse of the Laffoy commission has undermined that ground breaking statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_497">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_948">The Laffoy commission was established in haste in the wake of widespread public anger following the television documentary, "States of Fear", and in apparently better economic circumstances when there was no mention of cutbacks. In May of that year, the Taoiseach issued an apparently fulsome apology to the victims in which he stated: "A new comprehensive approach is required to deal with the effects of previous abuse, to detect the children caught in frightful isolation and to put the proper structures in place." The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, described the commission in unequivocal terms as being entirely independent in performing its functions, a point provided for in the legislation. He said that neither the Government nor anybody else would be in a position to influence its procedures or the outcome of the inquiries. Were these weasel words or did they express a determined commitment to secure justice for the victims? Experience suggests the former.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">Subsequent events, culminating in the enforced resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy, indicate that the original commitment to inquire into all aspects of child abuse was entered into with a distinct lack of enthusiasm. Ms Justice Laffoy also complained about the lack of extra resources as far back as June 2002. Such a lack of enthusiasm to ascertain the truth has reduced the Laffoy commission to a state of impotence and has seriously undermined the basis on which it was established. It is incumbent on the Government to permit the commission to proceed unfettered by State interference.</p>

          <p eId="para_950">Yesterday in the Dáil, speaking on the issue of child abuse, the Taoiseach stated: "We abandoned the children of another generation in these institutions." However, I could not help thinking that this is what is happening today. The resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy and her letter of resignation is a serious indictment of the continuing abandonment of those we had already abandoned a generation ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">I am not familiar with the day-to-day workings of the Laffoy commission but I am fully prepared to accept the bona fides of Ms Justice Laffoy and, as such, am fully prepared to accept the statements she made in her letter of resignation. Deputy O'Sullivan has quoted from her letter and I will cite one sentence which states: "In retrospect, it seems to me that since its establishment, the commission has never been properly enabled by the Government to fulfil satisfactorily the functions conferred on it by the Oireachtas." That sentence says it all. I say to the Taoiseach  that not only have we as a society abandoned another generation, we are continuing in that abandonment.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">I agree with Deputy Mulcahy when he said this was not a straightforward issue that can be easily resolved. However, there is an onus, responsibility and obligation on the Government to deal with it speedily, compassionately and equitably. According to Ms Justice Laffoy, the Government has failed to discharge that responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">Some time ago, the Taoiseach issued an apology on behalf of the State to all the victims. At the time it was seen as a seismic shift in attitude, but surely it places a huge onus on the Government to follow up fine words with decisive action. However, last December, the Government decided on a review which was supposed to report by February, but this did not happen. A second review has been promised since last July. Extra resources were promised to the commission but they could not be put in place because the first review was not completed.</p>

          <p eId="para_957">While I am aware that the Minister was not responsible for the Department of Education and Science at the time to which these questions relate, he should nonetheless be in a position to answer them. What was the reason for the delay in responding to the request for information by the Attorney General? Given the importance of the issue, why were these discussions held at the closing stages of the negotiations without legal advice being given by him? We know the information the Attorney General requested was not supplied for ten weeks. Did he attend the oral presentation at Cabinet made by the then Minister for Education and Science? If so, were concerns highlighted by the Attorney General at that stage?</p>
          <p eId="para_958">In June the Attorney General said the contribution by the religious congregations might be regarded as insufficient. As this amount had been decided long ago by two Ministers, does the Minister think legal advice should have been sought on the matter and that concerns should have been raised earlier?</p>
          <p eId="para_959">Everyone has spoken about the figures, including the Taoiseach and the Minister who appears to be content that the highest estimate of the liability will remain at €508 million. In June 2002 the  Attorney General noted that the number of cases could double to 5,200. The Minister bases his €508 million figure on 4,000 cases. If it increases to 5,200, it is arguable that a much higher figure will be involved. Will the Minister clarify this?</p>
          <p eId="para_960">Deputy Mulcahy, who appears to speak with great authority, often as if he speaks on behalf of the Minister, said any civilised person would choose not to put the victims through the High Court. In light of that, does the Minister intend to put a scheme of redress in place for victims abused in day schools? Such people are being forced to go to the High Court at present because no other form of redress is open to them. Their needs are not being met in the same way.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">What has the Government done not just since May 1999 but especially since then in terms of changing the structures in place? If I want to apply tomorrow for a position as a teacher, what checks will be carried out to determine my suitability to work in that capacity? Likewise if I want to become a caretaker in a school, what checks will be carried out to ensure I do not have a history of criminal convictions or was not reported previously?

          <p eId="para_967">The scheme we are discussing, or allegedly discussing, does not cover abuse in day schools, nor has it ever. There were requests for it to be extended to cover it. The issue of abuse in day schools is fundamentally different from that in institutions. Children who attend day schools are in the care of their parents. It would not be wise and certainly would not serve the victims of institutional abuse well to widen the remit of either the commission or the  redress board to accommodate abuse in day schools. There are no plans to do that and the Deputy knows that from previous discussions.</p>

          <p eId="para_969">Regarding the calculation of the figure of €508 million to which I referred, Deputy Enright made the point that it was based on 4,000 to 4,500 claims, which is the case. It was also based on an estimate at the time of how much the average claim might be. The figure used at the time was higher than the average that has transpired from the redress board. On that basis, I do not see any need to revise it.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">For the record and to ensure someone does not say in six months' time that I categorically guaranteed it would not exceed this figure, the figures worked on during the negotiations and that the Comptroller and Auditor General used are guesstimates, estimates, assumptions and presumptions. We will not know the final figure until the redress board pays the final cheque. If either figure of €508 million or €1 billion happens to be incorrect, so be it. At present, they are estimates and guesstimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">Regarding the delay in responding to the Attorney General's letter, the then Minister for Education and Science needed to decide on two key policy issues at the time: the cases that would be covered by the indemnity and the period for which the indemnity would apply. These were policy issues for the Government and they were considered from 31 January, after the indemnity was agreed to in principle by the Government, to 13 April, when the then Minister replied to the Attorney General. Everyone in the House knows that the Attorney General gives legal advice, not policy advice, to Ministers. The policy was being decided during that period and that is why the then Minister did not communicate with the Attorney General. Having checked this, because it was raised often during the debate, it is not true to say that there was no contact between the Department of Education and Science and the Office of the Attorney General during the period. There was substantial contact, as I understand it, at official level during that time.</p>

          <p eId="para_974">Will the Minister allow publication of information on the workings of the redress board? This is important. How does he propose to reduce the adversarial nature of the commission? This is an important question for victims. The Minister indicated to the committee on Monday that his primary intention in making changes was to reduce the adversarial nature of the process. Will he inform the House exactly how he proposes to do this? Will the Minister inform the House what he meant when he stated that sampling was parked? Has it been dropped or could it be reconsidered in the future?</p>
          <p eId="para_975">As regards the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, stated today that Members of the Opposition were given information on the details of the indemnity agreement, notably in February 2002. The Comptroller and Auditor General's report states that from October 2001 to April 2002 the Attorney General's office had no involvement in the negotiations and eventually received clarification on 13 April 2002. Was Deputy Woods correct when he stated he gave the Opposition details of the indemnity agreement before passing it on to the Attorney General to address its legal aspects? There appears to be a contradiction in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">The then spokesperson for the Labour Party, Deputy Shortall, stated she did not see the indemnity agreement until June 2002. What is the exact position? Was the indemnity agreed in detail by January 2002? If it was agreed by that date, why was the Attorney General not involved before that point and, if not, how could the Opposition have received detailed information about it? This point needs to be clarified.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">Why was no audit of the assets of the religious institutions carried out when the judgment on the amount of money they should contribute was being made? Does the Minister agree with the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that the cap of €127 million on the congregations' contribution, agreed by the State in November 2001, represented 50% of the lowest estimated cost? If he agrees, why was the figure not increased in line with the later estimates of costs which arose from the revised estimates of the number of people who would go before the board and the size of the sums likely to be awarded? Will the Minister explain the reason the figure agreed in November 2001 on the basis of the estimate was retained after it transpired that it would be much lower than the actual cost?</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_978">In answer to the last question, the decisions on the level of the cap and the amount of money it was possible to obtain from the congregations – the latter decision was taken around the same time, perhaps a little earlier, than the former – had already been made when the estimated increases in costs were noted. It was for this reason that the figure was not increased. At one stage a decision was taken to  limit the amount of money we would receive from the congregations to €128 million and, therefore, there was no point in introducing new calculations, increasing the agreed figure or following up to find out how many people would make claims. Nevertheless, estimates of the number of victims were provided throughout the process, right up to the point at which the Government decision was made. The first estimate of the number of expected claims was around 2,000, a figure which, to my recollection, had risen to between 4,000 and 4,500 by the time the final decision was made.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">No audit of church property was carried out as it would not have served much purpose. If one follows the sequence of the negotiations, which is laid out well in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, it is clear that while the church was willing to make a contribution, it maintained, at all times, a fairly rigid idea of how much this would be. The reason the discussions broke down in October was that the church was offering about £54 million of the £108 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_981">The Deputy should ask her questions in turn and I will answer them in turn. I listened to the contribution of the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, in which he comprehensively addressed the number of occasions on which the general thrust of the indemnity was discussed in the House. Although the indemnity agreement was signed on 5 June, its principles were clear through press releases and the various discussions in the House from 30 January onwards. I have no reason to disagree with the Deputy's outline of events, as he was the person involved and knew who was present in the Chamber or the Joint Committee on Education and Science on the relevant occasions. Given that he addressed the issue in great detail in the House, I will not waste Members' time by revisiting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">On the question of sampling, I stated clearly, when questioned on the issue in the committee, that it has been parked. The various victims' groups have come forward with an idea which they have asked us to convey to the investigation committee, namely, that it write to everyone who has requested a hearing before the investigation committee outlining the various available options open to them. In addition, they asked that an alternative to the investigation be considered, namely, a confidential committee type hearing in which the victims would be able to confront their alleged abusers. They have requested that the commission provide for these measures and issue a statement to the effect that going before the investigation committee would no longer be a precondition for gaining access to the redress board.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">The victims groups are of the opinion – as I stated previously, I do not disagree with them on this issue – that these measures would considerably reduce the number of people who would feel the need to go before the investigation committee. If this proves to be the case, the question of sampling may not arise. I cannot and will not, however, tie the hands of the commission on the question of how it will approach this question. Once the current exercise has been completed, I will convey the request on behalf of the victims and it will be a matter for the commission to decide whether to adopt the approach I have outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">I was asked about how I proposed to address the adversarial approach being adopted by certain respondents in the investigation committee. During the first phase of the review, a number of proposals were made, some of them by the commission, to try to diminish the adversarial nature of the investigation committee. One of the suggestions in the Bill aimed at reducing the need for lengthy and adversarial oral hearings is to give the commission the power to require sworn statements. This would require changes in the law of evidence in the context of the commission. Another proposal would allow documents admitted as evidence to stand <i>prima facie</i> and remove the requirement to hold further oral hearings on them. Provision is also made for a procedure by which the cost burden would be shifted on to people who are deemed by the commission to be conducting themselves unreasonably. These three approaches should moderate the adversarial nature of the process. In deference to a request from the survivors' groups, I have agreed to meet CORI to talk about the approach it is adopting and to try to arrange a meeting between the survivors' groups and CORI to see if we can discuss and, perhaps, advance matters and reduce the adversarial nature of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">I am surprised Deputy Burton would repeat in the House, on the basis of what she has been told by some people, that the redress board does not appear to be working well. The board should be allowed to get on with its business. It is working well. People are going to it, they are being heard and decisions are being made. If people are not satisfied with the level of awards granted, that is entirely understandable. If they believe they are not being well looked after, although the awards are based on High Court levels, they have the remedy of applying to the courts. They can state their case, put their evidence to the courts and let the courts decide the awards. It is wrong of Deputy Burton to come to the House and criticise Justice Sean O'Leary, particularly when, from the other side of her mouth, she criticises me for sitting down to talk with Ms Justice Laffoy.</p>

The redress board also has a good website which contains a great deal of information. If people consulted that website, they might be better informed.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">The redress board has received 2,000 applications to date and has made awards in 200 cases. The average award to date is just under €81,000. The board is receiving an average of 50 applications per week. The awards have varied from €12,000 to €250,000 and they are being made in line with the recommendations of the Ryan report. They are equivalent to the level of awards made by the High Court. It is not fair, therefore, to criticise the board on that basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_991">Does the Minister believe that Ms Justice Laffoy's resignation was inevitable given that when she made a request in June 2002 for additional resources she did not receive an adequate response? She pointed this out in the damning indictment contained in her letter. It points to gross incompetence on the part of the Government. This debate would not be taking place but for that resignation.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">Deputy O'Sullivan pre-empted me with her question about the audit. I had intended to ask the Minister if he believed an audit of the institutions' properties and resources would be a good idea. Does he believe such an audit would be a good idea now, given that it would clarify the exact amount these institutions have in trust or in hard cash and show whether the €128 million deal was a good one in that context? It would certainly be a good idea in the interests of transparency.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">The legal representative for the congregations attended the second meeting between the then Minister, Deputy Woods, and the Secretary General on 7 January 2002. Why did a legal representative of the Government not attend, given that this is clearly an unfair weighting in a meeting between the State and the religious institutions? Does this not again demonstrate incompetence?</p>
          <p eId="para_994">My next question relates to privilege. Will the Minister be able to establish a commission or an investigative committee which will allow the survivors to put their stories on record without being legally prevented from doing so by the religious institutions? It would be a similar situation to that which applies in Dáil Éireann. Is there a power to set up such a body without a referendum? Can it be done under existing law and would it be welcome?</p>
          <p eId="para_995">Deputy Burton asked pertinent questions about the redress board. Does the Minister agree that the average payment is between €80,000 and €90,000 at present, that this average has been reached because a number of higher awards have been made but that the general mean payment is in the region of €10,000 to €25,000? While the  committee on education and science might have adopted a wait and see approach to the redress board last spring, the board is now seen to be not working well. What people were expecting and what they are getting are not the same. They can go to the courts if they reject a redress board award but they cannot accept the money now and go to the courts later. That is an injustice.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">How does the Minister believe that sampling, an option he has not ruled out, will serve to ensure that the truth of every victim's experience will be revealed and that justice will be seen to be done in every case? Why will he not rule out sampling if he views this issue in terms of bringing the truth to light rather than in terms of minimising the overall cost? I have many other questions but other Members wish to speak so I will conclude with that.</p>

It certainly would not have done so with me, and in fairness to other members of the Opposition, it did not find favour with them either. Today's proposal is the same thing. It is essentially to set up some investigation or mechanism whereby we can ignore people's constitutional rights. That is just not possible because we have a Constitution. Sometimes it can be extremely inconvenient. All of us in this House would like to be in a position to ignore the rights of people who we know, or feel very strongly, were abusers. However, in some respects unfortunately, the Constitution does not work that way. It believes that everyone should be treated equally and has a right to defend his or her good name.

The Minister, Deputy McDowell, said today that while it is a binding deal, that does not mean that it cannot be renegotiated. While the extent of liability has risen far beyond €127 million, so too has the value of the indemnity. Does that not provide grounds for going back to the religious institutions and saying that there is a moral responsibility for something else to come in its place?</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">Fourth, the Minister, Deputy McDowell, belongs to a party that would have pulled out of office on such an issue 18 months ago. We were informed by him today that he was excluded as Attorney General from meetings between October 2001 and January 2002. Yet at the meeting on 30 January 2002, which the Taoiseach confirmed was attended by all Ministers, including the Minister for Education and Science, the deal was agreed. Part of that deal was the indemnity. Was the advice of the Attorney General sought at that meeting and, if so, was it overruled? It is absolute hypocrisy if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform says that he did not give his advice because he was excluded when he should have done so if he felt that the deal was in the taxpayers' interest.</p>

Ms Justice Laffoy mentioned five points in her letter. Did the Minister ever express concern about the delay of which she speaks in it? Does he accept that it led to a sense of powerlessness in the commission? There was a delay in providing staff and  resources. Did Ms Justice Laffoy ever get the extra resources which she sought? I know that they were agreed in principle, but did she ever get them? Did the Minister's Department fully enable the Laffoy Commission? Ms Justice Laffoy said that, from the start, she had never been fully enabled.</p>

The Department, through its inspectorate and in other ways, was responsible for supervision and so on, but there was a failure on the part of the Department and the State generally. Of course I am concerned about that, as is the Government. That is the reason we have put in place the commission and we have done various things – I will not waste the time of the House going over them again – regarding the victims of child abuse. We were the first Government that did that, and we will continue to do so to bring matters to a satisfactory conclusion and closure, particularly for the victims.</p>

I will be meeting CORI and will raise the issue with it. However, as things stand, I have no power to break the agreement that has been reached. Regarding the Attorney General's advice to the Government, Members will understand that Cabinet confidentiality is involved. However, the Government decision on the principle of the indemnity was made on 30 January 2002 as outlined. The formal Government decision by way of memorandum and decision was finally made on 5 June when all advices were available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">On the issue of the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy, I would not accept the description that it  was an unmitigated disaster. It is regrettable that she resigned.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_1028">In my contribution I intend to concentrate on two issues, the issue of equity, and the need to secure modernisation and flexibility in the public service with particular emphasis on the local government sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">The fundamental principle governing public service pay policy must be that public service workers are entitled to be paid a fair reward for their work relative to people in the private sector who are doing similar work. People must not be treated differently or less favourably because they work for the State. It is not and never was the intention  in the benchmarking process that the public sector would lead the private sector in matters of reward. The public service benchmarking body was established to secure equity between employees in the public and private sectors and in effect this was being done on a catch up basis. This was recognised as eminently fair and reasonable at the time. What has happened since is that the payments arising from the report of the benchmarking body are falling to be made in more difficult economic circumstances. The Fine Gael motion therefore is grossly opportunistic and if acted on would be inequitable to all those public servants who submitted their case for adjudication by the benchmarking body.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">The history of pay determination in the public service was one based on comparators with the private sector. However, the reality was that there were a small number of grades where a comparison was made and the majority of grades had their pay determined by means of long established and rigid relativities with these few grades. This relativity approach was not what was envisaged in a direct comparator pay determination system and created ongoing problems in the determination of public service pay. In this context the Government, other public service employers, the private sector and trade unions recognised in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that the traditional approach to pay determination in the public service based on analogues and relativities gave rise to serious difficulties. They, therefore, committed themselves to a more modern and flexible benchmarking approach which would encourage and reward higher productivity and flexibility in the public sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">The benchmarking exercise was a serious and thorough one. The benchmarking body collected evidence and information in respect of almost 140 public service grades; examined almost 4,000 individual jobs and interviewed almost 350 public servants. They also collected data from private sector employments in respect of almost 3,600 jobs covering over 46,000 employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">The body considered a wide variety of issues such as public service recruitment and retention, equity between public service and private sector employees, the impact of pay on national competitiveness, the over-riding need for modernisation and change in the public service consistent with commitments in the PPF, the value of public service pensions relative to those in the private sector, and differences in conditions and benefits such as security of tenure and benefit in kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">From a pay determination basis, the major effect on the remuneration of the benchmarked grades has been the severing of all previous pay links and establishing new absolute levels of pay for each of those grades. I am satisified that benchmarking is a better system of pay determi nation for public service workers. It meets all the criteria in relation to equity and fairness which were missing under the old arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">In its report the body recognised that the flexibility and modernisation apparent in the private sector was not always replicated in the public sector. It also strongly recommended that implementation of the pay awards should be made conditional upon agreement on relevant modernisation and change issues at the appropriate local bargaining level. In the local government sector, real commitments have been given that will strengthen the process of quality public service delivery. Among the commitments given is the introduction of an agreed code of practice for maintenance of essential services during industrial unrest. This is an important development as the local government sector provides crucial services such as water and waste water facilities and the fire service. The commitment to extended opening hours for offices and other public facilities is also important where longer opening hours for facilities such as motor tax offices, libraries and public offices generally will improve the quality of public service delivered. A further commitment will allow for a cross sectoral review of issues relevant to recruitment at clerical-administrative level, including the introduction of recruitment of administrative staff to local authorities at graduate level. These commitments are tangible examples of the type of modernisation and flexibility required, evidence of which will be needed to secure the benchmarking payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">An appropriate verification process has been established to ensure that benchmarking agreements are implemented. The latest social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, provides for the establishment of performance verification groups in the key sectors of the public service as recommended by the benchmarking body.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">Each phase of the pay agreement together with the increases recommended by the benchmarking body is conditional on the performance verification process. Under this process each sectoral performance verification group has an equal number of management, trade union and independent members. The independent members have relevant expertise and include, where appropriate, representatives of the customers of the sector. The chair of the local government performance verification group has emphasised to management and unions the importance of tangible and measurable progress being achieved in advance of each agreed payment date as specified in Sustaining Progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">This is the key element of the entire process. For too long we have had agreements which were not subject to specific verification and which were open to criticism against either side for less than full delivery of commitments. Payment is now conditional on the performance verification pro cess. Payments will not be made where commitments entered into have not been carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">In line with other sectors, action plans have been drawn up which detail the specific actions the local government sector will undertake to achieve each of the modernisation commitments agreed. Copies of the local government sector's action plan are in the Oireachtas Library. Commitments in the action plan will be verified by the performance verification groups before payment is made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">I turn to the question of funding for local authorities in respect of benchmarking. It is a matter for each local authority to determine its current expenditure levels for any year in the context of its annual budgetary process. Such expenditure is funded from a variety of sources including specific State grants, commercial rates, rents, fees and charges for services and general purpose grants from the local government fund. The issue of benchmarking as with all other current expenditure demands must be dealt with by local authorities in the context of this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">The amount of funding made available to local authorities through the general purpose grants from the local government fund has grown to record levels in recent years. In 2003 a total of €626 million was allocated for such grants. To give an example of how the fund has grown, this amount represented an increase of 6.4% over the 2002 allocation and, to put it into perspective, is some 85% higher than the corresponding allocation for 1997. I intend that allocations from the local government fund to local authorities will, as far as possible, take into account both the costs facing authorities and the ability of authorities to meet such costs from local sources. The amount available for grants from the local government fund for 2004 has yet to be determined. However, I will notify authorities of their individual allocations as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">The key challenge for the public sector generally, including the local government sector, is to demonstrate clearly that the benchmarking process is providing real benefits to the tax paying public who are meeting the cost. I will continue to press with managers and local elected members the necessity for real improvements in local government services in terms of efficiency, flexibility and access to be clearly seen on the ground.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCallananFF" eId="spk_545">
          <from>Mr. Callanan</from>
          <p eId="para_1042">It is strange that any party should ask the Government to break the agreement on benchmarking reached only last January with the social partners. This will probably put an end to the social partnership process which has served the country well since the late 1980s. Social partnership and industrial peace have helped to bring the country to where it is today. Benchmarking was decided by an independent body, chaired by a High Court judge, which took  submissions from all sides and decided on a rate of pay which was fair to employees of the public sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">Does Fine Gael feel that our nurses, who work so hard treating higher numbers of patients than ever before, should not be paid the increases agreed under benchmarking? Does it feel that our teachers should not be paid benchmarking awards although we have the best educated workforce in the world? Should the Garda and civil servants, who are doing a fine job, not be paid the benchmarking awards? Is this what Fine Gael wants? I compliment the Government on keeping all agreements made under benchmarking and for making payments, as agreed, to all workers in the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">Now that benchmarking is agreed and every worker is on a proper level of pay, there is a case for doing away with percentage increases. In future, if the cost of living rises by €5 per week, everybody should get a €5 increase. Under a system of percentage increases, if there is an increase of 5%, the person on a €10,000 salary gets €500 of an increase while the person on €100,000 gets €5,000. This widens the gap and makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. I ask the Minister and those involved to look at this issue. To continue granting percentage increases after benchmarking is implemented is morally wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">I compliment the Minister for Finance on his stance and commitment to paying benchmarking awards to all our public sector workers as agreed. The best way forward is for Government and the public sector to work together in a strike-free environment to make the country a better place in which to live.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_546">
          <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_1046">The social partnership agreements dating back to the 1980s have made a considerable contribution to the financial and economic well-being of the country. However, in recent times one could be forgiven for concluding that they had done enormous damage and were single handedly responsible for all kinds of economic ills, real and imagined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">The current partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, has at its heart clear modernisation provisions for the public sector. Nobody, particularly in public life, could deny the great need for a fundamental examination of this aspect of the performance of the public sector back over a number of years and particularly facing into the future. The benchmarking process which has emerged under the current agreement embraces a full commitment to further development and accelerated implementation of frameworks in each sector of the public service. It will also play an important role in fostering stable industrial relations. Nobody can deny the importance of that nor can anybody underestimate the benefits which have flowed from the relatively stable  industrial environment here over the past 20 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">As Deputy Callanan said, one of the effects of this motion would be to have the Government break an agreement which was only entered into in January. That would be a serious matter and would, inevitably, have the consequence of spelling the end of the social partnership process. It has become fashionable to deride this model but until such time as we have adequate alternatives we should cling dearly to it. It has served us well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">It is important to realise that the pay rises were recommended by an independent, highly qualified body which was chaired by a High Court judge. There has been some criticism because some of the material used by the body in reaching its conclusions was not published. Anybody who has taken the trouble to have even a cursory look at what was involved must realise that the information which was not published could not be published because it was given on the basis that it would remain confidential. It must remain so because of where it came from in the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">There is also a failure to acknowledge that strict conditions are attached to payments of the benchmarking awards. More importantly, as the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, said, there is a verification process with an overseeing body. This body has quite a difficult job to do but it is an integral part of the agreement and will make the agreement worthwhile and significant. The verification process will constitute a modernisation of the partnership process which will <i>de facto</i> remove some of the deficiencies claimed in regard to it by its detractors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">The benchmarking body was set up in 2000 mainly to address the ongoing disruptive disputes in the public service area. At the time there had been quite serious difficulties in regard to nurses, the Garda and one of the teacher unions. Anybody who has looked carefully at industrial relations here would have said that this was inevitable since we had such a complicated system of relativities. This system inevitably led to leap-frogging and claims for catch-up pay rises. Many people would say that the real surprise was not that there were difficulties but that there were not even more. The system of relativities which had grown up was a recipe for disaster and it placed enormous pressure on the social partnership model. It also had a consequent negative impact on the delivery of services to the public. There were numerous calls for a better system from all interests and most commentators.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">Benchmarking was the agreed system which emerged from the 1998-2000 negotiations. As part of the benchmarking initiatives, the unions agreed that the old relativities would be history. This is one of the most important elements of  benchmarking and at least as important as the verification process. The job of measuring wages in the public service by comparison with the private sector was undertaken in a professional independent manner over the two year period from the year 2000. I do not believe any politician can reasonably suggest we should revert to the practices of the bad old days. Inevitably, the result would be that public services would be disrupted and the pay increases negotiated for thousands of public servants, including health service employees, local authority workers, gardaí, teachers and civil servants, would not be paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">Some commentators and interest groups like to bash the public service. Some do so for ideological reasons while others do so to advance their own financial interests. Political leaders must be willing and able to recognise the agenda of these powerful interests and must have the courage to support the work of the independent body which emerged with the agreement of all sides from this process. The body was chaired by a High Court judge and reached its recommendations in a professional and independent manner. Unfortunately, the Fine Gael proposal comes from the same school of economic management as the Eircom shareholder promise and the taxi compensation proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">The verification process has been outlined in considerable detail by the Minister. There is a considerable job involved which will require co-operation from participants on all sides and which would benefit from the support of political parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">Finally, I will make a comment on the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector, which for 30 years or so has been charged with making recommendations in regard to the pay of Oireachtas Members. This body would not be popular with some elements of the media. Judging by the comments one would hear from some Members and people outside, there is a view that Oireachtas Members should be paid by butter vouchers and similar pieces of paper, whether negotiable or otherwise. It is not in our interest to allow ourselves go down that road.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_1056">The best line of the night has gone to Deputy Killeen and I will not try to compete with it. Once again in Private Members' time our colleagues opposite are engaging in predictable public relations point-scoring. The only difference on this occasion is that the entire public service is at the receiving end. I grew up with the simple view that a deal made is a deal done and I hope that the business before us is not an exercise in talking about breaking partnerships or agreements or abandoning low grade workers in the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">I have mentioned on a number of occasions that I come to the Dáil from Tallaght every single day. Each day I meet public servants who work  in Tallaght Hospital, South Dublin County Council, the various health boards, Jobstown and Millbrook Lawns health centres and the social welfare office in the Square, all of whom do tremendous jobs and are worthy of our support. Did many of the Members opposite read the action plans from the various Departments in regard to benchmarking before bringing this motion before the House and engaging in their public relations exercise? Each report is 30 pages long on average. As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committees on Social and Family Affairs and Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, I have read the respective Departments' plans and noted a number of actions and performance commitments which will improve the level of service and efficiency within Departments. To deliver on both, the management and staff in many Departments will have to take steps forward together that were considered impossible before these action plans were drafted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">As the verification groups set up by this process are now taking initial update reports from the Secretaries General of the various Departments, their first report will show the benefits of the agreement. I remind Members opposite that opportunism at the expense of trust is a dangerous card for anyone to play and the people will not thank the Members of this House if we attempt to undo commitments, whether on income tax rates or wage increases for the public sector. Instead, Opposition Members should use their membership of the many Oireachtas committees to engage Departments, put forward our constituents' expectations and ensure the responsibilities of the public sector are met.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">Benchmarking was initiated as a result of the drain on the public service and the inability to recruit employees into the public sector in the wild days of the late 1990s. It was meant to act as a one-off rebalance of earnings between the private and public sectors. Instead of accepting the offer when the State coffers could afford it, the unions bickered over the rates offered, the deal was delayed, times changed and it was rolled over into Sustaining Progress as a productivity package. As it has reached that point, the workers should be left to assist in the modernisation process and be judged on its results.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">I do not support the motion before us tonight and urge the Members opposite to use this time in a constructive way by proposing to question the action plans and debate the verification groups' reports at committee level. I read somewhere that a man or woman once said that the train has left the station and is speeding down the track, but it is our duty to keep it on track rather than destabilise it. I look forward to backing public sector workers in Tallaght, Dublin South-West, Dublin city and county and throughout the rest of the country. I propose to do just that at  8.30 p.m. when I vote with the Government and oppose this motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_1067">I read recently that an OECD survey rated Irish workers as the third most productive in the world. It is reasonable to assume that our workers in the public service are equally productive since they come from the same planet, environment and background. Another statistic in the same survey listed Ireland as having an unemployment rate of less than 5%, which economists regard as full employment, since anything below 6% is regarded as such. This is another healthy economic indicator.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">These indicators and others, such as that of Ireland having the lowest tax wedge in Europe, have not been achieved because of any unilateral performance by IBEC, employees or any one player. Rather, all the main players have been brought together, mainly through social partnership. As a former teacher, I believe that the work of public servants has too often been unrecognised and I am glad the benchmarking body has recognised that public servants play an important role in economic growth and have contributed equally to recent healthy economic performance when compared to other players.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">All our economic progress has been based on social partnership and the most recent agreement, Sustaining Progress, recognises that significant progress has been made in modernising the public service. Those of us who have worked in the public service at different levels agree that such modernisation was needed. A cornerstone of Sustaining Progress is a commitment to achieving a healthy industrial relations envir onment, ongoing flexibility and commitment to change, improved performance and accountability, revised recruitment arrangements and a continued partnership approach. The achievement of any one of these aims would be tremendous. I have no doubt but that benchmarking action plans will include the achievement of all the above and other measurements of advancement and modernisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">Let us look at benchmarking as an opportunity to buy industrial peace and recognise the value of the public service and, above all, use it as an opportunity to modernise our public service. The Government is a huge employer with 300,000 employees and it is also the watchdog of the taxpayers' money. Therefore, it is incumbent on the Government to get value for money. That will be achieved through the performance verification groups. For the first time in a realistic way, public service performance will be measurable. To renege on a freely entered-into agreement would be an unprecedented breach of good faith and would spell the end of social partnership since employees would never again trust the Government. Therefore, it is inconceivable that we would consider it at this time.</p>

I have often heard him vilified by Opposition Members as a friend and promoter of the rich. However, it now appears he is the promoter of fair play for public servants. His global approach has typified his sense of fair play in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">The performance verification groups will be the measure of the benchmarking awards. The groups will verify, analyse and scrutinise areas such as customer service. This might well be a chance for consumers who will be guaranteed a level of customer service commensurate with what we are entitled to. There must be efficient use of resources, better regulation, stable industrial relations, performance management systems, modernisation and flexibility, new technology in Government, strengthening recruitment practices, improving promotion systems, partnership and equality. Anything that enhances equality in a democracy must be admired rather than avoided.</p>

          <p eId="para_1076">While Sinn Féin totally disagrees with the Fine Gael motion, it welcomes  the opportunity it offers to speak on the need for a new alignment in Irish politics. There is a myth that all of us on this side of the House are united against the Government. Sinn Féin has never subscribed to that. We make our judgment based on the policy and record of the parties both in and out of Government. Fine Gael is clearly going back to its ultra-conservative roots. This motion is in line with Fine Gael's calls for the wholesale privatisation of public services and the selling off of State assets. Regrettably, it is taking its rightful place, and the right in Irish politics, alongside the Progressive Democrats and the leadership of Fianna Fáil today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">This motion indicates that real opposition to the Government's right wing policies is not led by the conservative views in Fine Gael, the so-called leading party in opposition. The potential, therefore, for real and effective opposition clearly resides in the parties of the broad left and the alternatives expressed in this House. These include Sinn Féin, the Labour Party, the Green Party and the progressive Independent Deputies. Together they outnumber the Fine Gael Deputies and led the opposition to Irish Government collusion in the invasion of Iraq earlier this year. They have a strong common line between them. They have also strongly opposed Government cutbacks and the right wing thinking behind them. I want to repeat a call I made last week for closer co-operation between the broad left in this and future Dáil terms. This motion clearly demonstrates how important that is.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">This is an extraordinary motion. It calls on the Government to renege on an agreement made with tens of thousands of Irish workers in the public service. If the Government were to adopt this approach it would be tearing up the Sustaining Progress agreement reached with the trades unions and employers earlier this year. Workers would quite rightly be up in arms at such an attack on their living standards. It must be remembered that the pay increases in the agreement, and in its predecessors, were in many instances quite modest, particularly for already low paid workers. Despite all the hostile propaganda about the public service, many people still receive pay which is low in comparison to similar jobs in the private sector. Now Fine Gael wants to deny these workers the hard won gains they have belatedly made after all the years of economic upturn.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">I agree that we need better services from all who work in the public sector, including TDs – perhaps especially TDs. We need value for money and we need to stamp out the kind of woeful organisation, bad decision making and mismanagement highlighted in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. Real improvement in public services will be based on a strategic decision by Government that the State must lead the way to a fairer economy and a fairer society.  Instead we have the total reliance on the market to address housing needs, the favouritism towards the private health business and the health sector and the creeping privatisation of public transport to which all these parties adhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">Sustaining Progress and its predecessor agreements have been rightly criticised for focusing on pay above all else. The reality is that the process of so-called social partnership has delivered on pay for some sectors of the workforce but it has been a failure in terms of bringing about real social inclusion and real improvement in vital public services such as health, education and housing. This motion will make a bad deal and a bad situation much worse and I strongly urge its absolute rejection.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_1081">The report of the review body on benchmarking was one of the more interesting publications released in recent years. In some respects it could almost be classified as a thriller, not of the "who done it" variety but of the "how done it" variety, because the worthy people of the review group produced comparisons with jobs in the private sector that were not identified and were not justified in terms of how the comparisons were made. It is deeply flawed as a process and questions could be asked as to how the decisions were arrived at.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">Its entrenchment in the Sustaining Progress document means it is an agreement that must be honoured and cannot be reneged on. In questioning benchmarking, there should be a recognition that benchmarking was the result of an attempt to bring about fairness within public sector pay. The vast majority of public sector workers earn below the average industrial wage and a mechanism had to be devised to bring these wages up to speed. Unfortunately, many of the mechanisms used in successive wage agreements and national partnership agreements have always concentrated on percentage rises. This meant that whatever those at the bottom of the scale were getting, those at the top were getting proportionately more because their income was already higher. If an argument can be made on benchmarking, those few in the public service who are already achieving prominent salaries – I include many in this House – would need to justify it by way of a number of mechanisms which we certainly have been unable to identify. While this matter has been referred to by other Members and the media in recent times, I cannot understand why those of us in the public sector who get paid a commensurate wage should be involved in a process from which we benefit most and to which we do not contribute in a significant way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General indicates a need for some relationship between either performance related pay or a degree of responsibility for decisions made by highly paid people who take risks with the public  purse. However, for the vast majority of public sector workers who have been badly paid and need to have their wages brought up to speed, there can be no argument that this type of broad brushstroke approach cannot be accepted. I understand why Fine Gael feels the need to take this approach. Its members feel they are returning to their roots but some roots should be left to wither and die. The roots that produced the Ernest Blythe budget of one shilling off the pension, the 1981 budget of the tax on children's shoes, shoes being worn by women, should be left behind. There are better vines that can prosper and still give the impression that it is possible to be more prudent with the public finances than this Government has been.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">The Government knows how to spend public money. It spends vast amounts but the return on that expenditure is poor. The debate on public spending should cover issues such as the cuts the Government introduced this year and those which are likely to be introduced in a more stringent form next year. If the Government and Fine Gael have taken solace from the recent MRBI poll which indicated the public would much prefer cuts in public services to increases in taxes and more borrowing, they should follow that advice and outline which public services should be cut. They should identify the cuts in the health service, education and social welfare and see the public's reaction. The opinion poll highlights that if a silly question is asked, a silly answer will be provided. People will not say they want to pay more taxes but they will want better public services. The Government should learn from its current lack of popularity that it has failed to provide adequate infrastructure for public services. This is a commentary on mismanagement by a Government that is not prepared to deliver services to the standards expected by the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">This debate needs to cover another issue. Public expenditure needs to be controlled and public money needs to be expended properly. The Government wants to change the agenda by providing less money for vital services. The benchmarking commitment should be honoured to make sure low and poorly paid public sector workers are given proper recognition.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1086">I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I have major concerns about the motion and I will fight any attempt to suspend payments to thousands of public sector workers. I do not accept the tone of the motion as I have witnessed at first hand the massive changes taking place in our public services. Public servants deserve every cent of the proposed increase and, given the increased cost of living generally, they are only catching up. We all support reform of our public services and increased efficiency but punishing workers is not the way to deal with this issue. I resent the new  anti-public service mentality in society, which I call the "Ryanair syndrome".</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">I remind Members of the primary school teachers who train teams after school, look after the choir, work with children with disabilities and give grinds in Irish outside regular hours; the cleaning department workers who clean our streets in the middle of the night and often work anti-social hours; and the nurse in the firing line of an accident and emergency department on a Saturday night. Those are examples of productivity and top quality public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">I refer to the teaching profession. Teachers deserve every cent they have been awarded under benchmarking based on my experience as a primary school teacher in the inner city for more than 20 years. I support their interests in the debate because it is in the interest of the wider community and that is why I oppose the motion. The first phase of benchmarking, backdated to 1 December 2001, was paid to teachers on 5 June 2003. The INTO pressed for early payment of the benchmarking award and primary teachers were the first major group in the public service to receive it. The allowance for supervision duties was paid to most teachers on 14 August 2003. This is against a 100 year background of teachers working through lunch breaks and supervising children, and was well deserved. On 1 January 2004 the next phase of benchmarking, 6.5%, and the first payment under the new national agreement, 3%, are due to be paid. Does Fine Gael want to suspend these payments? This needs to be clarified, given the anger among thousands of public sector workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">I strongly support the position of my union, the INTO, which rejects recent attacks on the benchmarking award. The motion is ill-judged and ill-informed. A leading Opposition party is taking the IBEC line on this issue. Right of centre economic policies never work and it is up to all Opposition Members to say this and stand up for our public servants. The recent OECD report demonstrated that Irish teachers are performing well in spite of inadequate funding, large classes and a lack of support for the 90,000 pupils living in poverty. However, the Government now wants to hammer children with disabilities by removing their special needs assistants. These issues should be debated and not the threat of suspension of a wage deal agreed by all the social partners. I had major reservations about the agreement, as Senator O'Toole, who is present, will confirm. However, negotiators reached an agreement and the vast majority of trade union members supported it. I have concerns about the exclusion of the poor but there was a ballot and public servants accepted the deal. We cannot tear up this agreement and refuse to pay workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">These are the realities of the benchmarking debate. Let us make sure we look after our public  servants while ensuring quality public services. I urge the House to reject the motion.</p>

          <from>Ms Harkin</from>
          <p eId="para_1091">Yesterday, the Comptroller and Auditor General published his annual report, which outlined the financial implications of a number of different schemes and the workings of Departments. However, neither the House, the Department of Finance nor, more than likely, the Comptroller and Auditor General will ever be able to examine the rationale behind the benchmarking recommendations because the information is not available. During the last session, we witnessed the gutting and emasculation of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and we moved to a position where freedom of information was no longer seen as an integral part of the business of Government but rather as a nuisance and something to be barely tolerated. As a consequence, some Government business is no longer open to public scrutiny and we are presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i> We were not presented with the rationale underpinning the decision reached on the benchmarking award. This is an important issue in its own right, aside from the rights or wrongs of benchmarking, but the lack of transparency and accountability in this process must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">While I do not agree the payment of benchmarking awards should be suspended, the recommendations of the public service benchmarking body should be strictly adhered to, particularly where the body recommends that the payment of the awards, apart from the first 25%, be made conditional on relevant modernisation and change issues at the appropriate local bargaining level. The body asserts its firm expectation that outputs will be delivered and if they are, then benchmarking will deliver value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">It is important to broaden the debate. While money and availability of resources are at its core, the maintenance of industrial peace and the importance of sustaining the partnership process, as expressed in the new national agreement, are also critical. Employees are not only units receiving a salary and they should not be viewed merely as a cost to the Exchequer. They are partners in ensuring a better delivery of services to the public. If the benchmarking process delivers that outcome, it will have been a success.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">If the Government were to suspend the payment of the benchmarking awards, it would break its agreement with the social partners and that would lead to unnecessary and damaging industrial unrest. It would devalue, if not preclude, further agreements between the Government and the social partners. That would be a serious outcome, which should not be contemplated. Benchmarking came about because salaries in the public sector had fallen behind the private sector. One of its objectives was to close that gap and this issue is important to public sector workers. If  such workers were to see the increases promised under benchmarking disappear in front of their eyes, there would be a great deal of anger. While I fully appreciate the financial imperatives behind the motion, I do not consider that public sector workers should bear the burden alone because that is untenable. We are facing a tight fiscal regime and savings will have to be found. A good place to start is with some of the recommendations in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which details serious overruns, massive overspending and huge waste of public money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">There has been much talk about benchmarking for politicians. We too must be subjected to that regime. However, to some extent benchmarking is already built into our work. When we stand for election we are, to some extent at least, benchmarked.</p>

          <p eId="para_1098">In recent years the taxpayer has increasingly become the victim of a rip-off culture where individuals pay through the nose for basic goods and services, where value for money is not part of how the Government does things and where the waste of public moneys is endemic. This waste cuts across all sectors, public and private, and all Departments. The report issued yesterday demonstrates how the Government has squandered money in recent years. I will give three examples. The State is exposed to a possible liability of €1 billion in a deal with the religious congregations conducted behind closed doors and without adequate advice. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform acquired five buildings and sites at a cost of €19 million which subsequently it could not use. One third of fines imposed by the courts on tax dodgers have never been collected. These random examples clearly show that value for money is not a priority for the Government. This is why we must look seriously at all expenditure to see if it meets real and transparent value-for-money criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">Benchmarking offered the Government a golden opportunity to bring about clear and quantifiable improvement in public services and efficiencies in the public sector. This opportunity was missed and we are now facing the huge benchmarking bill without the necessary and quantifiable improvements. The Government has linked the benchmarking process to the achievement of industrial peace in the public service. However, this peace has been the objective of all previous pay and partnership agreements. The Government seems now to be suggesting that this time peace in the public service has to be paid for  twice, once through the 7% increase across the board and a second time through benchmarking.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">One of the stated objectives of the benchmarking body was the need to ensure equity between employees in the public service and the private sector. However, the absence of a performance-related pay element in the awards creates an obvious inequity between both sectors. Additionally, the absence of performance-related pay creates an inequity within the public sector where the increases are awarded to every individual in the relevant grade, regardless of individual performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">We have seen the publication of some benchmarking action plans within the public service. Broadly speaking, these action plans have clarified only the definition of vagueness and make the benchmarking increases unjustifiable based on the outputs suggested. Many of the plans simply list job descriptions without a focus on improvements in efficiency or in service. There are also specific examples of where commitments in earlier wage agreements are now included as part of the justification for the payment of benchmarking.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">For example, the commitment to hold half of all parent-teacher meetings outside school hours to facilitate parents has not been implemented as expected. Five pages of Sustaining Progress (Social Partnership Agreement) 2003-2005 are devoted to the modernisation of the education sector. Many of these recommendations are not excessive but here, as in earlier agreements, are proposals concerning the holding of parent-teacher meetings. A commitment was given to hold parent-teacher meetings half within, half outside normal school hours, and this is agreed. I have heard that this is not being delivered in the spirit expected. Holding meetings half within and half outside normal school hours must mean, in any reasonable reading of the agreement, that every second parent-teacher meeting will take place at night. It is apparent that an arrangement of this type could facilitate working parents who are not always available to meet teachers during the day and would be of great assistance to many thousands of parents around the country who have work commitments during school hours. However, I have already heard of cases where teachers have plans to introduce this arrangement in a way which will not mean holding meetings at night and will result in little or no reduction in the inconvenience suffered by parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">Take, for example the situation in a primary school that usually closes at 3 p.m. I have heard of one case where parent-teacher meetings are being held between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. This is within the letter of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, but any meeting held at 4 p.m. is of no great advantage to parents. I do not accept that this is within the spirit of the agreement. I spoke to one teacher during the week at  12 p.m. I asked him how he could answer his mobile telephone. He told me he had a day off in lieu for holding parent-teacher meetings outside school hours. I do not believe that is in the spirit of the agreement either.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">Deputy Finian McGrath, who has left the Chamber, has expressed major reservations about this agreement. However, to express major reservations and want nothing done is total hypocrisy. He and others have strongly criticised the deal the Government negotiated with the religious orders and have advocated that the Government renegotiate it and do a better job of it. Why do they not want to do a better job on this? That question clearly has to be answered.</p>

          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_1105">I support this motion that Dáil Éireann resolve that the payment of the remaining phase of the benchmarking be suspended pending implementation of a serious reform package which will lead to improvements in the quality of services delivered to the public, consonant with the extra costs involved. It is important that we debate this matter and I am glad it is being debated in the Chamber because this is the place to debate it. I am glad people are saying that the public service is important. It is not only important, it is vital to the future success of our economy and our society. It is right that members of the public service are adequately paid for the work they do. It is also right that we know what is going on, that the verification procedures are clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">Last night the Minister for Finance spoke about the action plans on his Department's website. I examined them today and it seems that many of the issues involved in the action plans relate to work in progress. On the website there is reference to historical improvements that have been put in place. There are also certain aspirations. However, the aspirations for the future are woolly. It appears that a circular was sent around to various Departments which were asked to submit their plans to the Department of Finance, and they did that. However, much of the language is difficult to understand. I would like the Minister to outline in clear English what is being delivered in every area. I do not want to see convoluted legal language, I want to see sentences that are easily understood. If that is put on the website or published, that would be fair to people who probably deserve the benchmarking payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">Many commentators inside and outside the country have alluded to the fact that we live in different times than we did two, three or even six years ago when this Government took over from the rainbow coalition. The economy was in good order then. After six years of this coalition's rule, it is no longer in good order. We are now experiencing high inflation, high wages and very high  costs. People cannot afford housing and child care. They cannot travel from place to place. The question for everybody in society is whether we can afford to pay ourselves high wages. We did that in the past and ended up in an economic mess. This useful debate is urging caution. It is saying, "let us have clarity and let the public see what it is getting for its money."</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">In regard to parent-teacher meetings, when I first began teaching these were held at night on a voluntary basis and teachers were not paid in respect of them. That changed and meetings began to be held during the day. As a teacher of almost 20 years' standing, I found it extraordinarily disruptive to have to break or miss classes during the day to meet parents, and parents found it difficult to leave their place of employment. I welcome the change whereby teachers will hold such meetings at night and be paid for doing so. I would like to see all parent-teacher meetings scheduled outside class times and at times that suit both teachers and parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">An article by Mr. Seán O'Reagáin of the European Commission states:</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">Benchmarking is a tool for improving performance by learning from best practice and understanding the processes by which they are achieved. . . .  Application of benchmarking involves four basic steps:</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">1. Firstly, understand in detail your own processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">2. Next analyse the processes of others.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">3. Then compare your own performance with that of others analysed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">4. Finally, implement the steps necessary to close the performance gap.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">That is important because it applies in particular to Members of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">We need to benchmark how we do our work in this House. I do not refer to increasing the number of sitting hours, but to improving the quality of the work we do. When the Government decided that the Dáil should sit on Fridays before the summer recess, the Friday sittings involved many days of Second Stage speeches. Ministers were falling asleep as Members on this side struggled to come up with material to read into the record. It was absolutely pointless. Today's sitting included many hours of statements on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and about 40 minutes of questions. Less than half of the time that is needed is provided for Question Time. With great respect, I guess that the Ceann Comhairle would like reform of the way we do our business in this House. I respectfully suggest that he hinted at this on more than one occasion when he said that Members should examine the way they do their business and change it if they are unhappy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">I agree that we should benchmark our work to that of other Parliaments. If we change the way we do business in this House, perhaps we will be in a position to accept our benchmarking awards. I am interested in how one can compare oneself with others doing the same kind of work. Other Parliaments do not have the long breaks we have in this House and conduct themselves in a far more lively manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_1118">Having heard or read the speeches of Members from other parties, I am somewhat confused. It is strange that all speakers seem to have made the same point that is being made by Fine Gael. Most Deputies have sought a way out at the end of their speeches by saying that they favour the payment of the benchmarking awards. Deputy Ó Caoláin spoke of shortcomings in the health and education sectors, but my party put down this motion to highlight such issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">Deputy Boyle spoke of Fine Gael's return to its roots. If I was asked to mention the one thing that distinguishes Fine Gael from other political parties, I would say that we do the right thing. People have asked why we have proposed this motion. I congratulate my party leader, Deputy Kenny, and our finance spokesman, Deputy Richard Bruton, for pushing out the boat on this issue. We have brought forward this motion because it is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do because we have no evidence of what the process of benchmarking entails. I am no wiser having read the Minister for Finance's speech than I was before I read it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">I have listened to a certain hypocrisy on this side of the House in recent months as regards the Government's secret deal with the religious orders. Members on this side claimed that it would cost about €300 million, then €500 million and now €1 billion. Most of the parties that have contributed to this debate support the benchmarking deal, which was also done in secret and which will cost €1.1 or €1.2 billion each year. When compared to the deal with the religious orders, this deal seems like the third secret of Fatima, whatever that may be. It may be the third secret of Fatima as we cannot find out its details.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">Deputy Harkin said that she does not understand the benchmarking agreement, as it is not transparent. She is willing to support the benchmarking process, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">It needs to be pointed out that we do not have enough money for the benchmarking deal. I could spend all night outlining a litany of things that we will not be able to afford as a result of the payment of the benchmarking award, but I will not bore people by doing so. Certain shortcomings would remain even if we did not pay the benchmarking moneys. Regardless of the fact that they have indicated that they do not support this motion, I believe that most Members of the  House, deep down, do not believe in the stance they are taking. I refer to Members on the Government side and of other parties on the Opposition side.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">I am glad Deputy Ó Caoláin distinguished Fine Gael from other Opposition parties. The Minister for Finance has stated that benchmarking could have come at a better time. Before he became Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy built his reputation on his financial prudence, but his actions ever since have been anything but financially prudent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">Benchmarking originated during the boom times. Public servants felt that they were not being paid enough at a time when the cost of living was increasing. The Government did not do anything to address the cost of living issues, however. Rather than addressing the price of houses, the Government pursued a policy, after the second Bacon report, that drove housing investors out of the country. Billions of euro that was spent in the south of Spain and France at that time was lost to this country. Rental incomes went through the roof and there was a hugely negative impact on the construction industry at a time when it was cranking up to provide houses that would have gone a long way to solving our supply and demand issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">One of the arguments used in support of benchmarking is that many people were leaving the public service to take up jobs in the private sector at the time to which I refer. Things have changed, however, and the employment opportunities that existed in the private sector are no longer there. We have to examine the phenomenon of public sector workers leaving their jobs to take up positions in the private sector, where they use the contacts they had built up in the public service to the advantage of their new employers, for example when lobbying. A former director of services with a local authority or a former departmental official, for example, may use his or her contacts when employed in the private sector. We have to consider prohibiting people from taking up a job in the private sector that could compromise the previous position they held.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">I strongly believe that people have not yet digested the detail of the benchmarking scheme, but they will over time. Senator O'Toole compared the benchmarking system to an ATM, but he never mentioned who will put the money into the machine. About 7% of people work in the public service and it is the other 93% who are filling the ATM. When they realise that they are putting money in for public servants to take out at the other end, they will digest the detail of the benchmarking scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">The Minister for Finance mentioned that the benchmarking body is independent and distinguished, and I do not doubt that is the case. No reference has been made, however, to the fact  that one of the most distinguished members of the body resigned before the final report was published. I do not know why he resigned, but if I can make a presumption, I imagine that he resigned because he did not agree with the process or with the body's findings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">Some 21,000 public servants were recruited in the year preceding the general election. I have heard the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, speak about the fact that the number of staff employed by the Department of Agriculture and Food increased from 4,500 to 5,000 at a time when farm numbers were decreasing. I know that a former colleague of the Minister of State in the ICMSA has raised the issue in recent times. It is strange that the number of people employed in the public service is increasing as the number of people working in the agriculture sector is decreasing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government spoke about local government. I discussed the forthcoming Estimates today with the county manager in a nearby local authority, which is not in a city. He told me he will need €5 million in the Estimates to be able to afford the pay increases that will result from benchmarking. The sad thing is that Deputies in Sinn Féin, the Green Party, the Labour Party and what Deputy Finian McGrath referred to as the "progressive socialists"– I did not know that such an animal existed – will be the very people who will not support the Estimates when they are produced. They will speak about the public being screwed to pay for certain services. It will be Fine Gael members, generally speaking, who will do the right thing once more by working within the system and supporting the process. Time will tell.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">Performance verification groups will receive a great deal of scrutiny if the benchmarking scheme goes ahead. I do not know how they will be judged, but I am concerned. I spoke to many public servants who work in the health and education sectors in the weeks before my party discussed this policy and I was surprised that many of those to whom I spoke favoured the withholding of benchmarking payments as they were conscious of their impact on front-line services. The verification groups are in such a panic to justify their systems in many cases that they have pointed out that teachers have been there for 100 years. Surely one would have perfected the art of delivering a service after 100 years. Some of the work practices that may be introduced may hinder the delivery of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, spoke about putting payments to good use. One of the weaknesses in Fine Gael's policy of not making benchmarking payments is evident when one examines the other areas in which the money can be spent. It appears from the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that giving money to the Government is the equivalent of giving money to  a drunken sailor going into Claude's amusements in Salthill. The only difficulty I have with my party's policy is that the Government might waste the money that would be saved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">I re-emphasise the reason Fine Gael brought forward this motion, which I commend to the House. We did it because it is the right thing to do. No one questions the difficult job done by public servants and we appreciate the service they deliver. However, this is the wrong thing to do and it is the wrong time.</p>

          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_1141">The benchmarking process was set up in 2000 under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. At that time we had come through a number of disputes. The causes of the disputes were not just the rising pay rates in the private sector but also the old system of pay determination in the public service. Under this old system pay increases were often based on pay relativities between different public service groups. This new system grew out of a problem that was always at the heart of the matter – how does one decide  pay levels in the public service? How, for example, does one decide the level of pay for a teacher or a soldier when the private sector comparators are not obvious? Consequently, over many years a system of pay relativities grew up. This system meant that groups were linked to other public service groups, sometimes where there was no work relationship. There was also leapfrogging of pay claims with groups trying to pull ahead of other groups, which in turn claimed for catch-up increases. This sometimes led to irrational pay increases where there was no linkage to the private sector and negotiating any changes in work practices was tortuous.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">It was crystal clear to all who looked at the issue that this system could not and should not continue to determine the pay of public servants. Therefore a new and better way had to be found to resolve this problem. Following on from the initiative in 1998 the Government and the unions agreed that benchmarking could be such a way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">The body was set up under a High Court judge in 2000 and reported in 2002. It looked at a wide selection of jobs in the private and public sectors and compared pay rates, taking account of the differences between the two sectors. The average increase across the public sector was 8.9%. In the negotiations on the national agreement, Sustaining Progress, it was agreed that the payment would be phased in over a number of years, so lessening the impact on any one budget. In addition, payment was made conditional on the achievement of certain conditions. These conditions were industrial peace and meeting modernisation targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">Some commentators have suggested that the conditions are not transparent or that they are not beneficial to the public. However, the first condition – industrial peace – is transparent. If there is industrial action it will be clearly seen and would, on the face of it, be in breach of the agreement. It also benefits the public since, as we all know, disruptions to hospital or school services impact on the users of the service and the community generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">In previous national agreements we had provisions on industrial peace. However, these had only a limited effect in preventing industrial action. The provisions in Sustaining Progress are more categorical, the commitment by the public service unions on this issue are clear-cut and the machinery to ensure compliance is straightforward and simple. In terms of modernisation and flexibility, objectives are set out, both in the agreement and in the action plans that are required to be drawn up in each sector. These range from specific requirements to more general commitments by the unions to co-operate with ongoing change and give flexibility.</p>

          <p eId="para_1147">These are not empty words. They are practical actions and they are written down. The general commitment to ongoing change will enable managers in the public service to improve services, either through technology or otherwise. This should lead to improvements in services to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">To ensure that the commitments are adhered to, a verification process has been set up. This requires that performance verification groups be set up in each main sector. These PVGs will represent employers and unions but will have a strong independent representation and an independent chair. They will continuously oversee the attainment of the commitments entered into by the unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">The system will give value for money and improve public services. Benchmarking allows for a better approach to public pay determination.

        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_578">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_1150">Fine Gael's demand for the renegotiation of the benchmarking agreement has a number of origins. Benchmarking was a deplorable deal. The €1.1 billion cost will not be matched by any commensurate improvement in services. There will not be any value return to the taxpayer for the money involved. Ministers have not addressed this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">The Minister of State knows better than most that the economy is now under serious pressure. We have seen a serious deficit emerge in the public finances and we know the resources are not there to meet a dead weight deal such as this. The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, knows this because he has been involved in the framing of the budget booklets that show the figures for next year. Neither he nor his colleague, the Minister for Finance, has addressed the question of how this deal is to be paid for.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">In the present environment, the pay out of this deal will have two effects. First, it will inflict further pain on those who depend exlusively on public services to provide for them. Second, we will see an accelerated pattern of stealth taxes, service charge increases and so on. The Government will tax everything that moves in order to recoup this money. Public servants, as well as everyone else, will find this money filtered out of their pockets in all sorts of new charges before they even see it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">Sinn Féin Deputies, ostrich-like, chanted their old slogans about the right wing being anti-public service and wanting to bust the social partnership. That is not what Fine Gael is about. We are concerned with addressing serious issues about the nature of this deal, the way it was put together, how we are going to cope with the outfall and who is to pay for it.  These are the issues that should be debated and not the cant we have heard in the predigested Government scripts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">Benchmarking was to end historical relativities. This is almost the only line of the Minister of State's script with which I agree. That was only the starting point of benchmarking. The critical principles as to how benchmarking was going to be different were staked out. None of the Government speakers has addressed these in any way. The first of these critical changes was that co-operation with change and modernisation is not a basis for any pay increase. This is written in black and white in the terms of reference of the benchmarking agreement. Listening to Ministers one hears nothing but talk of change and modernisation being offered as justification for these increases. Maybe I should repeat this for slow learners. Change and modernisation and co-operation with them were not to be the basis of pay increases under benchmarking.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155">The extra payments were to be based on hard evidence. Deputy Harkin was right when she spoke about lack of transparency. Hard evidence was to be produced of recruitment difficulties experienced in the public service and of gaps in pay and performance requirements between the public and private sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156">Three quarters of the award was to be conditional on real outputs that achieved delivery of improved public services as a result of a reform agenda. That was a radical departure. It was a process with very real potential and, as Deputy Stanton has said, it was about striving to achieve best practice and rewarding those involved in that achievement. It was to be extremely exciting and a great opportunity for the State to radically reform its public services. However, the Government completely blew this opportunity. The hard evidence which was supposed to be the basis of the awards was buried, shredded and never released. No taxpayer who will pay for the process will have seen a shred of evidence to support it. We are told about how independent the benchmarking group was, but the independent economist whose job it was to vet the way in which the evidence was used resigned. He did so precisely because he realised it was not being used in the way it was expected to be used when the benchmarking process was set up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">The second thing that happened was that the Government completely reneged on its responsibility to put in place a serious reform agenda that would make benchmarking worthwhile. There was no effort to advocate reform. Anyone who examines the action plans will note that not a single group involved in any of the negotiations was pushed beyond any of its established positions. The Government pulled back in respect of its responsibility and did not rock the boat. We are now paying for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">The Government totally capitulated on the principle that co-operation with change and modernisation would be the justification for pay awards. Instead of honouring the principle, it agreed to a hollow list of minor changes dressed up as the so-called action plans, which Deputy Stanton has admirably described as full of pious hopes and offering objectives for every existing activity but involving no serious change or commitment that things would be different in the delivery of health and education services such that we would see value for money. Value for money was to be the hallmark of the benchmarking process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159">Every Minister has come into the House to state why the €1.1 billion payment is justified. It is not for the new public services for which we had hoped. The Ministers refer to industrial peace clauses knowing that these have featured in every single agreement under social partnership. We did not need to pay for the process twice. Everything that has been cited by Ministers – one can examine the record – is about timid moves towards promotion on merit, co-operating with new technology and pushing ahead with modernisation programmes. These are precisely the matters for which we were not to see payments made under the terms of reference. Breaking away from these was to be the distinctive element of what benchmarking was to be about.</p>
          <p eId="para_1160">The greatest laugh of all was to see the Minister for Education and Science herald in the House that parent-teacher meetings would be held half within and half without normal school hours. He did not advert to the very simple fact that this commitment was made not in the PPF or Sustaining Progress but in the PCW. This latter commitment is in the first of the agreements but still has not been delivered upon. The Minister offered the commitment as a reason benchmarking should be paid. Has one ever seen anything so threadbare? I do not know how he can stand over it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161">Not one Minister has sought to demonstrate any tangible public service improvement that would be delivered through the process, nor has any Minister put any value on what would be on the other side of the balance sheet. We know the €1.1 billion will be paid out. Not one Minister identified the new services that we would see or stated what they would be worth. They did not do so because they know they cannot do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162">It galls me to hear Ministers hanging tough outside the House stating that they will end the endemic overtime in our prison system. These Ministers did not put that on the table when benchmarking and reform of the public service was to be negotiated and payments were to be made. There was not a word from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that he would put it on the table and make it conditional. Now we see Ministers scurrying for reform when they have no  money in the kitty, having blown the great opportunity that benchmarking offered them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163">Who will carry the cost? This is the question that no Member on the Government benches addressed. We know that the €1.1 billion will not be matched by commensurate savings. Therefore, it will have to be found. The Minister for Finance has already published in his Budget Statement for 2003 the position in 2004. The Minister of State knows that we will have an opening Exchequer deficit of €3.5 billion. That is before the Minister will make any provision for phase II of benchmarking and therefore we are already dealing with a deficit figure of approximately €4 billion. He and his Department admits that we are half a billion euro off in terms of tax, bringing the deficit that has to be closed up to €4.5 billion. I would have expected a Minister for Finance faced with paying out part of this amount to state how he would handle the emerging deficit. I would have expected him to say, "Here is a serious problem facing an economy that is struggling to compete and in which families are finding it harder and harder to make ends meet as they face an explosion in the cost of living across a range of services."  However, there was not a single word about how the Minister proposes to close the deficit he says he will have.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164">These are not just arcane subjects of interest only to economists and students of public finance. They are critical because they will determine the job security of ordinary workers. If the Government reverts again to stealth taxation to close the deficit, as undoubtedly it will, it will undermine the competitiveness of jobs and put families to the pin of their collars to survive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1165">Last year 90% of the extra resources the Minister had available to spend on budget day were used to fund public pay after one excludes social welfare payments. This left only 10% for non-pay elements. What happened? The bureaucracy pre-empted all the money and therefore there were cuts in home help services and respite services, grants for the disabled were abandoned and beds were closed while people continued to be paid. There was an inability to deliver services because of the way the budget was put together. Next year, we will see that in spades.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166">Next year, according to the Minister's estimates, he will have €1.6 billion extra to spend. Assuming that he will allocate €0.5 billion for social welfare increases – it is not generous but the same as last year – he will be left with €1.1 billion to meet all the pay and non-pay elements. The pay round to which he is committed amounts to €0.54 billion and the benchmarking commitment amounts to €0.55, totalling €1.1 billion. The whole amount available for spending on new services next year is now committed to these public service pay increases. There is not a brass farthing available to fund services, open new beds, hire new home help staff, offer more respite care or  top-up grants for people with disabilities who need to adapt their homes. Not a Member who will enter the Chamber to oppose this motion has addressed this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1167">The same cycle will repeat itself. The Minister, who blew €5 billion on a reckless election binge, will make the most vulnerable pay for the pay deals in his next budget. It is a national imperative that we seek to renegotiate the agreements. Members have entered the House and said that Fine Gael is reneging on its commitments – even the Minister of State used this term. We are not, but we are seeking to renegotiate, just as the trade union movement renegotiated its deal and reached a new agreement when inflation was higher than it had expected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168">We must renegotiate because the Government has failed the people by failing to have any serious reform agenda that would allow our public servants achieve, deliver and earn the pay they rightly deserve. To say this is some sort of assault on social partnership, as many have said, is wrong. It should be a feature of social partnership that one has the capacity to renegotiate when circumstances change. My party will not genuflect before the holy grail of social partnership and pretend that it is beyond question. Social partnership is an organic body like any other. It has faults and it is our duty to question it when it exhibits them. It is also our duty to question it if it sells short those who depend on social services, if it tries to shroud in secrecy deals that should be transparent, if it satisfies itself with reform at the pace of the slowest, if it sides with producers when the needs of consumers are clamouring to be met and if it concentrates on getting resources from the taxpayers and paying no heed to the return.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169">Social partnership will only continue to be a robust element of the Irish economic and social scene if it avoids being sucked into a false consensus and if it refuses to bury its head in the sand on these issues. The Government has been quick to shelter from strong political accountability by hiding behind the coat-tails of social partnership, but this Dáil must be the forum where genuine conflicts about how competing resources and interests are to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170">For us to question the benchmarking deal and the return being made on it is not to undermine social partnership, it may challenge it, but social partnership will only be worthwhile if it can face challenges and emerge with a deal that better serves the people, delivers better services and makes public service a more rewarding and ambitious place to be, where people go for a dynamic public sector where they can achieve the professional expertise for which they were trained. That is our vision.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Community Employment Schemes.</heading>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_581">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_1177">It is good to see the overwhelming vote in favour of retaining the benchmarking agreement. It would have been a disgrace to have done otherwise. I hope the message goes out to IBEC, which was reported in newspapers yesterday as stating that it wanted an end to the benchmarking process and non-payment by the Government and also 10,000 jobs cut in the public sector this year. I hope IBEC got the message on benchmarking and that a similar message goes out to it regarding its request for a cut of 10,000 jobs in the public sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178">My Adjournment matter relates to an issue that is causing fear among the most vulnerable communities where people have poor employment opportunities, there is endemic disadvantage and, in general, the Celtic tiger passed people by. The community employment scheme was established in the mid-1980s by Deputy Quinn, who at the time was Minister for Labour as it was known, to provide part-time work for those who needed to re-enter the workplace and were in long-term unemployment. It was especially valuable for women and single parents to re-enter the workforce and to allow work to be done in the community that would not otherwise be done. In the mid-1990s, Deputy Rabbitte introduced the jobs initiative which was aimed at people over the age of 35 who had been unemployed for four to five years and whose prospects of employment were slim. The purpose was to provide them with employment and some dignity while allowing valuable work to be done in the community that would not otherwise be done. Since then an enormous amount of valuable work has been done in areas with high crime levels and unemployment and poor child care in terms of after school, meals on wheels and senior citizens services and various forms of community maintenance and so forth were required. All these services provided an improved quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179">Since 1998, however, a period of just five years, the number of people in community employment has decreased by half, from 40,000 to 20,000. The schemes have been devastated by this rapid reduction in numbers, which has caused significant trauma and hardship to individuals and considerable damage to the services they were providing. A whole range of services throughout the State could go under if another savage series of cutbacks proceeds. It appears the first tranche of the latest cutbacks is due to begin on 17 October, as letters to that effect have emanated from FÁS. Some 5,000 jobs are at stake in the community employment scheme and the job initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180">In my area of the north inner city, which is in the Taoiseach's constituency, jobs and services are under threat in all the disadvantaged communities – most of the communities in the area – whether in the community employment schemes or the job initiative. I would list all the schemes if we had time. They include the Sean McDermott Street senior citizens' day care centre, the after care service in Liberty House, East Wall meals on wheel's and day care centre, the markets area residents' organisations and a plethora of other schemes funded through the programmes. The Capuchin day centre in Bow Street, which provides 400 meals daily, is threatened with a 60% loss in staff from 17 October onwards, which would mean the Capuchins would no longer be able to provide a service they have provided for a century.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181">It would be a shame if we lost the current part-time and full-time employment opportunities available through the community employment and job initiative programmes, not only in terms of the job opportunities for the people affected but also in terms of the services they provide. Will the Minister offer us some hope that this is not the approach he proposes to take and that he will at least preserve the current level of services and employment?</p>

        <speech by="#FrankFahey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_582">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1182">In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure the community employment programme, participation levels have reduced over time. At the end of 1999 there were 36,579 participants in the programme. The average participation rate during 2003 is expected to be in the region of 22,500 with a projected year-end participation rate of 20,000. The number of community employment projects has reduced from 2,274 in 1999 to 1,503 projects currently. In many cases projects have amalgamated into new entities allowing the activity to continue on a smaller scale. This amounts to a reduction of around 5,000 places phased in over the year. These reductions reflect a strategic shift in policy in favour of training and other more appropriate supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183">The job initiative programme will have an average participation rate in the region of 2,466 during 2003 and a year-end participation rate of 2,200. Overall, there will be a reduction of 325 places on a phased basis in the course of this year. Participants exiting job initiative may avail of the high supports process designed to provide a flexible response for persons experiencing barriers in progressing from unemployment to employment in the open labour market and the FÁS local employment services with a view to securing further training or employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184">Community employment projects are prioritised based on the services provided. Drugs task force activity and child care service provision are ring-fenced from any reductions and projects in RAPID areas are given priority. The ring-fencing of places recognises the importance of the programme for some areas of service provision. All health service related community employment projects, including the provision of services for persons with disabilities, have been ring-fenced from reductions since March 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">Certain sponsor organisations have indicated they are experiencing difficulty in replacing participants who have completed their normal term on the community employment programme due to the lack of suitable applicants coming forward for the programme. In this regard, FÁS has confirmed it will give every support and assistance to such projects in recruiting suitable participants for the positions in question, thus ensuring ongoing service provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">The community employment and job initiative programmes are currently under review. An overall appraisal of active labour market programmes is being carried out under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market chaired by my Department. In addition, a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of community employment, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. FÁS is also completing an internal review of the community employment and job initiative programmes, which is well advanced and should be finalised shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187">Current progression rates to employment did not generate confidence in the effectiveness of the current community employment programme as an active labour market programme and a review was called for. To illustrate my point, in 2002 up to 69% of persons engaged in specific skills training with FÁS progressed to employment, whereas the corresponding figure for community employment participants was 32%. The outcome of the current review process, which is now nearing completion, will inform any decisions to be taken on the future funding and structure of the community employment and job initiative programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">I accept Deputy Costello's point that the community employment programme provides some very good services. The difficulty until now has been that services have expanded on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. The policy was to implement the community employment programme as an active labour market programme. One of the new initiatives I will introduce will recognise the good services the programme has provided and place it on a much more structured footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">We must also take into account that progression levels from the programme have been inadequate and improve its training element to ensure progression. We must also recognise that certain people on the community employment programme or currently unemployed are not capable of progression. We must try to find a niche for such people, a task which will form part of the new policy. I am confident that when we shortly roll out our new policy we will have a much enhanced community employment programme and will provide for the good services around the country, to which the Deputy referred, and for communities right across the spectrum which is currently not the case. We must also ensure that community employment remains an active labour market programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190">The difficulty with the job initiative is that it has only 2,200 participants and will cost €45 million this year. While I agree it has provided good employment and services, it is a narrow scheme confined to a small number of areas. I want to open it up by providing a better scheme in many more areas. It is for this reason that the job initiative is under review.</p>

        <heading>School Accommodation.</heading>
        <speech by="#MichaelMoynihan" eId="spk_583">
          <from>Mr. M. Moynihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1191">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the issue of the provision of temporary accommodation for St. Brendan's national school, Hollymount, Rathmore, just inside the Cork border. The application for temporary accommodation has been with the Department for some time and has progressed along its normal lines of communication. The board of management of the school has applied for planning permission to erect temporary accommodation and has been in ongoing contact with the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192">Hollymount national school is an excellent school with a proud tradition. Settled at the foot of Caherbarna Mountain, it is probably one of the most rural schools in my constituency and has a long tradition of learning. It is vital that the Government provides the basic infrastructure to meet the needs of rural national schools, which are of crucial importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193">Conditions in the school are currently very cramped, with students confined to small areas and ancillary teaching activities taking place in corridors and other areas not conducive to proper education. Temporary accommodation is probably not the best option. What is needed is full refurbishment. However, in view of current financial circumstances, temporary accommodation must be provided at Hollymount. I urge the Minister and the Department, when concluding the Estimates for the 2004 budget, to ensure that priority is given to the provision of temporary accommodation at Hollymount national school.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194">Hollymount has a long tradition of learning. There have been many debates throughout the country about rural areas. One of the good things rural areas enjoy is a great education system. However, due to depopulation the numbers at the schools are falling. St. Brendan's is an excellent school and the number of pupils is increasing, which is the reason the application for temporary accommodation is before the Department of Education and Science. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the school is on the list in 2004 for the provision of that accommodation. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</p>

        <speech by="#TimOMalleyPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_584">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_1195">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, to outline to the House the position regarding St. Brendan's national school, Rathmore.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196">St. Brendan's national school, which is co-educational, is situated three miles from Rathmore. There are plans for the construction of a new, central school for Rathmore. However, St. Brendan's will not be involved in this proposed central school. Pupil numbers in the school have been fluctuating in recent years, showing an overall slight decline from 41 in 1993 to 34 in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197">The board of management has made an application to the Department of Education and Science for major refurbishment/improvement works at the school. The proposed project has been assessed in the planning section of the Department of Education and Science and is currently awaiting the appointment of a design team to commence architectural planning. In the interim, the board of management applied for the provision of temporary accommodation at the school. However, due to budgetary constraints the Department of Education and Science was not in a position to approve of the school's proposal in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198">The 2003 building programme at primary and post-primary levels amounts to €342.9 million – four times the amount allocated in 1997. The programme will deliver over 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary levels. In addition, over 400 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme and, of course, all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works. Budgetary provisions for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on all projects, including the applications to address the short-term and permanent accommodation needs of St. Brendan's national school, that could not be included in this year's programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199">The management authorities at St. Brendan's national school should continue to use funds from the devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety matters.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" eId="spk_585">
          <from>Mr. Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_1200">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. This is an important issue for the people of Enniscorthy and County Wexford. St. John's Hospital is a 155 bed geriatric hospital. It is well run and the staff work extremely hard in bad conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201">The hospital was built in 1842 as a workhouse so the Minister will appreciate how dilapidated it has become, particularly in recent years. Approximately 150 staff, including nurses and care assistants, work in the building. There are seven wards which vary in size from 16 bed wards to a 26 bed ward. The beds are almost on top of each other. It is a scandal to see hospital beds so close together. It makes it hard for the staff to work with the patients and it does not give long-term patients any degree of privacy. I invite the Minister of State to Wexford to visit St. John's Hospital. He will be one of many Ministers to visit. There is also a day care centre at the hospital which is used by between 30 and 35 patients each day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202">The new hospital was due to go to tender earlier this year and the sod was due to be turned in September or October. A state-of-the-art kitchen was promised, as were 64 beds and a new administration unit. A new hospital building was first promised in 1986. The Ceann Comhairle is one of the former Ministers who visited the hospital. I do not blame him, however, because he was only the messenger boy who was sent down to keep the people of Enniscorthy happy. He will be surprised to discover that many Ministers have followed in his footsteps, including the former Minister of State, Dr. Tom Moffatt, and the current Minister, Deputy Martin. Even the Taoiseach visited the hospital before the general election. He made another promise but this promise, like many other promises he made, was left on the long waiting list like the patients or was broken.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203">I urge the Minister to outline exactly what the position is with regard to St. John's Hospital. People in Enniscorthy are extremely worried about this. Will the new hospital be built? If it is due to be built, when will tenders be invited and when will the first sod be turned? What is the proposed completion date of the hospital?</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">I compliment the staff and management of St. John's Hospital. They are working in substandard conditions. There are narrow corridors and limited space between beds. They have to lift patients everywhere, including up and down the stairs because there is only one lift in the hospital. One could not swing a cat in the kitchen and all the cooking is done on the campus. It is unbelievable. The work and dedication of the staff in St. John's Hospital are incredible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">The Minister must clearly state the exact position with regard to this hospital. I hope he does not have bad news because I am seeking good news. The new hospital was promised in 1986 but 17 years later it is no closer to being built.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TimOMalleyPD" eId="spk_586">
          <from>Mr. T. O'Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_1206">I am pleased to have this opportunity to update the House on the progress of developments at St John's Hospital, Enniscorthy, County Wexford.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207">A total of €2.54 billion was announced at the commencement of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 by this Government for investment in our health services. The purpose of the plan is to create an infrastructure that will bring significant and tangible advances in delivering a more patient centred and accessible service. It is intended to shift the balance of capital investment towards the non-acute hospital sector so that NDP funding is equalised between the acute hospital sector and the non-acute hospital sector by the end of 2006. This will ensure a balanced development of modern infrastructure across the range of the new health and personal social services to be founded under the national health strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1208">In the case of services for older people, it is proposed to provide greatly improved physical environments for patient care to ensure a high quality and client centred service. The health boards were advised in 2000 that funding would be made available for the capital development of services for older people over the period of the national development plan. A broad range of facilities will be provided, replaced or upgraded during the period of the plan. Plans have been drawn up to develop assessment and rehabilitation facilities, ambulatory care facilities, community hospitals, community nursing units, convalescent and respite beds and day care centres for older people, including services for the elderly mentally infirm.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209">The provision of health services in County Wexford is the responsibility of the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance. It is a matter for the board to prioritise developments in line with the funding to be made available under the national development plan. I have been informed by the South Eastern Health Board that the need for a new community hospital to replace the existing facilities for older people at St John's Hospital was identified as a priority development by it. The board subsequently included the project in its proposals for funding to develop services for older people under the national development plan. Individual projects are subject to the normal approval process for funding, technical and other requirements governing the approval of capital projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210">A project team was established by the South Eastern Health Board to oversee the development of the new hospital. A planning brief was completed and a design team appointed to prepare the plans and specifications. The first phase of the development will include the provision of two 32-bed long-stay wards for older people, new catering and ancillary facilities and some administration accommodation. The project is now at pre-tender stage. The South Eastern Health Board has recently requested expressions of interest from a number of main contractors and main sub-contractors for the development of the first phase of the project. Those will be considered in the context of ongoing discussions between the board and my Department on progressing individual projects under the national development plan.</p>

          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_1211">I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue on behalf of my constituents and to protest at the continuing downgrading of services at Louth County Hospital. Since the Dundalk catchment area is one of the fastest-growing urban centres in the country, health services in it should be expanded. The increasing numbers of people living in Dundalk and the north Louth area generally, like all citizens of this State, deserve the best possible health care services. Access to health care is a fundamental human right, as outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Government has a responsibility to deliver those services and the Minister is obliged to ensure their delivery. Yet the actions of the Government and its agents, the North-Eastern Health Board, have left the people of the Dundalk catchment area without any proper health care services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">Cutbacks, which have been made for purely financial reasons, deny people the essential health services to which they are entitled. Louth County Hospital once had an excellent paediatric unit, a fine maternity unit and a first-class gynaecology unit, all of which are now closed. It appears that the accident and emergency unit is to face the same grim future. Now all minor and major road traffic accidents are sent to the already overcrowded accident and emergency unit at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. There are major concerns for the future of accident and emergency services at the Louth hospital because of the failure to appoint a consultant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213">Does the Minister think it acceptable that trauma cases now have to travel an extra half hour to Drogheda? He must realise that the extra time involved significantly increases the risk in life-and-death situations. Can he stand by that? Can he explain to me the status of the accident and emergency unit at Louth County Hospital? Can he confirm if it is true that, from January 2003, the unit will close at 5 p.m. on weekdays and over the entire weekend? If that is the case, it will not be viable to have anaesthetists on call, meaning that the hospital's surgical unit will not survive. It is scandalous that services for women and children at Louth County Hospital were the first to be cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214">The absence of adequate maternity services is reprehensible since maternity and major gynaecological services transferred to Drogheda, I have continually been approached by expectant mothers who are both annoyed and frightened by the prospect of travelling so far when they go into labour. At the back of their minds, no doubt, is the tragic case of a young Monaghan mother whose baby died <i>en route</i> to hospital in a similar situation where a community had been deprived of maternity services. The people of Dundalk were promised a midwife-led unit. In June I inquired of the Minister when that unit would be functional and what capacity it would have. I was informed that the building identified for future use as a midwife-led unit would require some modification and extension, that a suitable scheme would be prepared for consideration and that the work should be completed in 2004 – this is the critical point – subject to funding being made available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215">Will the Minister for Health and Children assure me that that funding has been made available? We simply cannot wait any longer. I was further told that only two beds would be made available to the midwife-led unit from the existing bed compliment at the hospital. That last sentence demonstrates the misleading nature of the whole midwife-led scheme. From the outset, it was planned that there would be only two beds and that they would come from the existing bed compliment. That is madness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216">The situation is critical. A whole community is being deprived of essential services. The Minister must intervene immediately and there must be no more passing the buck to consultants and health boards. There must be no further downgrading of Louth County Hospital. All essential services must be restored to the hospital without delay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TimOMalleyPD" eId="spk_588">
          <from>Mr. T. O'Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_1217">On behalf of my colleague, Deputy Martin, I welcome the opportunity to clarify the position regarding Louth County Hospital, Dundalk. The Deputy will appreciate that responsibility for the provision of services at Louth County Hospital rests in the first instance with the North Eastern Health Board. My Department has been advised by the board that there are no plans to downgrade Louth County Hospital and that the hospital is guaranteed an active role in the delivery of acute hospital services within the Louth-Meath hospital group. The health board is also committed to maintaining surgical services and a 24-hour accident and emergency service at the hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218">The September 2001 report of the maternity services review group commissioned by the North Eastern Health Board, known as the Kinder report, recommends that safety and evidence-based care for mother and baby must remain the foundation of an effective maternity service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219">The Comhairle na nOspidéal review of maternity and related services in the North Eastern Health Board area recommends that there be regular and frequent consultant input into Louth County Hospital by the consultant obstetric and gynaecological staff and the paediatric staff based at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, and that the hospital should continue to provide out-patient maternity, gynaecology and paediatric clinics. The board is continuing to provide those services at the hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">The board acknowledges that there have been difficulties in securing training recognition for surgical junior doctors at the hospital from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. The board had discussions with the college in an effort to resolve those issues and has been successful in securing four fully registered non-consultant hospital doctors for the 12-month period commencing in January 2003. Accordingly, accreditation from the RCSI has not been required for general surgery for the current year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">As the surgical unit at Louth County Hospital is part of the joint department of surgery with Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, the Royal College of Surgeons will be invited to inspect both hospitals and it is envisaged that approval will be forthcoming for both basic surgical training and higher surgical training posts from 1 July 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222">Currently, the permanent filling of two consultant posts in surgery at Louth County Hospital has been approved by my Department and by Comhairle na nOspidéal, and they are now with the Local Appointments Commission for processing. The board expects that those joint appointments will significantly enhance surgical services in the Louth-Meath hospital group, as well as meeting the revised standards and regulations which have been stipulated by the RCSI concerning training of non-consultant hospital doctors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223">To date, responsibility for the accident and emergency department in Louth County Hospital has rested with the consultant surgeons and physicians at the hospital. The Department issued financial clearance to the board on 23 December 2002 for the filling of three new consultant posts in emergency medicine in the region. Two of those posts are in the Louth-Meath hospital group, to be based in Drogheda, one of which will have a sessional commitment to Dundalk, and the second post will have a similar commitment to Our Lady's Hospital, Navan. Those appointments are in line with the Comhairle na nOspidéal 2002 report of the committee on accident and emergency services and its recommendations on how hospital emergency services should be delivered and organised in the north-eastern region.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224">Pending the filling of those posts in a permanent capacity, the board has appointed temporary consultants to them. The permanent posts have already been approved by my Department and by Comhairle na nOspidéal, and those are also currently with the Local Appointments Commission for processing. It is hoped these appointments will assist in securing accreditation for 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225">In 2002, Louth County Hospital received funding for the provision of an additional 14 beds under the national bed capacity initiative. My Department is advised by the board that these beds were commissioned in December 2002. A new post of consultant physician with a special interest in endocrinology received financial clearance from my Department in 2002. A temporary appointment has been made to this post pending permanent recruitment. This additional bed capacity will allow the hospital to significantly increase activity levels for its public patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226">A project team under the national development plan has been established at each hospital in the region, including Louth County Hospital. The initial responsibility of the project team is to identify service requirements and to prepare a planning brief for the preparation of an outline development control plan in respect of the hospital site. The preparation of these briefs is now at an advanced stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227">The combination of additional investment and capacity at the hospital represents tangible evidence of the commitment by this Government to the continuing development of services to the people in the catchment area served by Louth County Hospital and the Louth-Meath hospital group as a whole.</p>

          <p eId="para_1232">The Government based its approach to this issue on Security Council resolutions going back to 1991, in which the Security Council stated that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Ireland, and every member of the UN, is bound to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council. The Government did not rely on foreign intelligence sources. As late as November 2002, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1441, which recognised the threat posed to international peace and security by Iraq's non-compliance with Council resolutions and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and long range missiles. At the time when Security Council Resolution 1441 was adopted, the Security Council was acting in the belief that Iraq did possess weapons of mass destruction. This belief was very widely shared in the international community. The General Affairs Council of the EU at its meeting of 18-19 November 2002 could not have been more clear in stating its belief that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. This was despite the fact that there was disagreement among many member states about how to deal with the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1233">In his report of 6 March to the Security Council, Dr. Blix, head of UNMOVIC, the arms inspection team mandated to investigate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said that many questions relating to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction remained unanswered. Whether or not these weapons still existed at the time, Iraq was in material breach of its disarmament obligations through its failure to co-operate fully with the arms inspectors in carrying out their mandate of verifying that Iraq no longer held weapons of mass destruction.</p>

          <p eId="para_1235">The House will recall that on a number of occasions this year, I have set out the Government's position with regard to the Falun Gong organisation. Members will recall that Falun Gong was banned by the Chinese authorities in July 1999; the Chinese Government continues to regard it as an "evil cult".</p>
          <p eId="para_1236">However, the Government takes concerns about human rights in China, including those of Falun Gong members, seriously. Human rights, including the treatment of practitioners of Falun Gong, are an integral part of our ongoing relationship with China. I raised these matters directly with the Chinese authorities during my official visit to Beijing, in January 2002. In February 2003, my colleague Deputy Kitt, Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development and human rights, reviewed these issues with concerned NGOs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237">Last week, in the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York, I represented Ireland in the EU troika meeting with Foreign Minister Li of China. During our meeting we held substantive discussions which included a full exchange of views on human rights issues. Both China and the EU reaffirmed their commitment to the EU-China human rights dialogue, the framework established in 1996 within which the EU discusses key human rights concerns, including individual cases, with the Chinese authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1238">At the same time, Foreign Minister Li stressed the importance of mutual respect and emphasised that while China is open to international co-operation in the human rights area, such co-operation should be based on consent, rather than imposition, and he went on to emphasise that China is ready to learn from the EU experience. Foreign Minister Li outlined the progress that has been made in China with respect to human rights. He informed us that his government has recently hosted a symposium on human rights protection for prisoners, with a view to making preparations for the adoption of national guidelines. He also recalled that China has recently submitted its first report under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and noted that the Chinese authorities have set up a task group to accelerate the procedure for the ratification and enforcement of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It is the Government's position that China must be given the support and assistance it needs, to ensure that this progress continues on the protection and promotion of human rights in China.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239">During the most recent session of the EU-China human rights dialogue, which took place in Athens in March 2003, the EU conveyed our particular concerns in relation to the position of followers of Falun Gong in China. At the subsequent March session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, CHR, in Geneva, the EU urged China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation generally, and, more specifically, with respect to freedoms of expression, religion and belief, which have a particular impact on practitioners of Falun Gong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240">Our embassy in Beijing continues to convey our concerns regarding followers of Falun Gong to the Chinese Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and my Department will continue to monitor the human rights situation in China. Through continued dialogue and engagement, we will encourage and assist the Chinese as they work towards accepting international human rights norms.</p>

          <p eId="para_1242">Promoting the EU-Africa dialogue will be one of the Government's main priorities in the common Foreign and Security Policy area during our forthcoming Presidency. A productive dialogue with the African Union since its formal establishment in July 2002 has already been initiated and was manifest at the meeting of respective EU and African Union ministerial troikas which took place in Maputo last July and where Ireland was represented by my colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Kitt. The Maputo meeting provided an opportunity for the Minister of State and the other members of the EU troika to reaffirm the EU's strong commitment to EU-Africa partnership and its willingness to co-operate with the African Union, especially in the implementation of NEPAD, new partnership for Africa's development. A further ministerial troika meeting with the African Union is scheduled to take place in Rome in November at which Ireland will also be represented. The Deputy will be aware that the political situation in Zimbabwe and the question of possible attendance by representatives of the Mugabe government precluded the holding of the EU-African Union summit originally scheduled for Lisbon last April and following on the initial EU-Africa summit in Cairo in April 2000. The intention however would be for the Lisbon summit to take place as soon as circumstances allow and this was reaffirmed by myself and my colleagues on the General Affairs and External Relations Council in July when we agreed to continue examining "the progress achieved in the framework of the Cairo process with a view to holding the Lisbon summit at the earliest possible date". The possibility therefore cannot be excluded that this second EU-Africa Summit may well take place during our forthcoming EU Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">In addition to ministerial contacts with the African Union, EU Ambassadors in Addis Abada have also been requested to initiate a dialogue with the African Union Secretariat based in that city in order to discuss issues of mutual concern such as peace and security in Africa, human rights/good governance and how to improve African capacity for peace-keeping and conflict resolution. Such contacts will be pursued actively by our Embassy in Addis Ababa during the forthcoming Irish Presidency.</p>

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1256">I propose to take Questions Nos. 114, 120, 128, 133, 144, 151, 167, 170, 174, 182, 199 and 239 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">The Intergovernmental Conference, which will consider the draft text brought forward by the European Convention, will formally begin its work on Saturday. The Presidency has made clear its strong wish to see the Intergovernmental Conference conclude its work as quickly as possible and is aiming to reach overall agreement in December. This is undoubtedly an ambitious timetable. The Government has made clear its full support for the Presidency approach but has said that, should it not prove possible to conclude the work of the Intergovernmental Conference before the end of the year, we will be pleased to take it forward during the Irish Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">The European Council meeting at Thessaloniki in June agreed that work on the draft constitutional treaty, which will be signed after new member states join on 1 May, should be finished as soon as possible and in time for it to become known to citizens ahead of the European Parliament elections in June. Once agreement is reached, it will be for each member state to ratify the new treaty according to its constitutional requirements. While no timeframe has been fixed for this process, it usually takes about two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">The Government believes that the overwhelming bulk of the convention text should stand. The convention did excellent work in simplifying and clarifying the Union's basic legal texts. As a result, citizens should find the new treaty considerably more accessible. It has also brought greater clarity to the question of competence – who does what and at what level. There are, however, aspects of the convention's draft which require further work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">We wish to see unanimity continue to apply in those areas of taxation for which the Union has competence. The Government is strongly supportive of greater co-operation within the Union in combating serious and cross-border crime. Drawing on the valuable report prepared by the working group chaired by Deputy John Bruton, the convention did important work in this area. However, we need to ensure that Ireland's distinctive legal tradition is fully safeguarded under any new arrangements. We will be pursuing this matter at the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261">In the area of defence, we need to ensure not only that the different positions and approaches of member states are fully protected, but also that arrangements are such as to ensure that the Union can act coherently and effectively as a force for good in the world. This is an area to which the Intergovernmental Conference will return. The Government will ensure that Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality is maintained. Bunreacht na hÉireann clearly provides that Ireland cannot become involved in an EU common defence without a referendum. That protection will remain in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262">The convention's recommendations on institutional matters struck a reasonable overall balance. There are, however, aspects of the arrangements which need to be fleshed out further. In this regard, the Intergovernmental Conference will consider arrangements for the Commission; arrangements for the Presidency of the Council of Ministers; and the role of the new Union Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263">On the question of the new Foreign Minister, it is important that the Union's external actions – from trade, to development co-operation to foreign policy – be as effective and coherent as possible. The Union needs to be able to speak externally with a single authoritative voice. I therefore welcome the creation of the post, which draws together the work of the External Relations Commissioner and the Council's CFSP High Representative. The convention's proposal does not alter the balance between the Union and the member states and will be fully consistent with the conduct of Ireland's external relations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1264">On the Charter of Fundamental Rights, excellent work was done at the convention. The Government is satisfied that greater legal certainty and clarity as to its scope and application have been achieved. We will consider the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference as an overall package. However, significant and very positive progress has been made in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1265">We have made our positions across the range of issues clear to partners in various meetings and contacts. The recent meeting of 20 small and medium sized partners which I attended in New York was an opportunity to share thinking, particularly in relation to institutional matters where a considerable degree of common ground exists. Naturally, other member states – including France, Germany and the UK – are also engaged in contacts with each other and with us. While these meetings are important and valuable, real negotiations will take place in the Intergovernmental Conference where decisions will fall to be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_1266">In keeping with the practice of successive Governments, the Government does not intend to publish a White Paper ahead of the Intergovernmental Conference. However, my Department will shortly bring forward a short explanatory guide setting out the main aspects of the convention's draft and explaining the issues involved. This will be circulated to all Deputies and will, I hope, help to foster debate both inside this House and elsewhere.</p>

          <p eId="para_1268">Much progress continues to be made in bringing about acceptable policing structures in Northern Ireland. The work of the Policing Board, the district policing partnerships, the Ombudsman, the Oversight Commissioner and Chief Constable Orde among others has ensured that the new beginning envisaged by the Patten report is being made a reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1269">The extent of this progress is evident in the latest report of the Policing Oversight Commissioner, Mr. Tom Constantine. In his eighth report, published earlier this month, he indicates that "excellent progress" is being made in the implementation of the Patten report's recommendations. He particularly commends progress in areas such as the implementation of the policing in the community strategy, the development of the human rights plan, the new code of ethics, as well as continuing success in the recruitment of police officers and civilians.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270">The Garda Síochána (Police Co-operation) Act 2003, which was enacted on 24 June last, together with the corresponding British legislation, the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2003, provides for secondments and personnel exchanges between An Garda Siochána and the PSNI and is another important step in the implementation of the Patten report's recommendations on North/South co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1271">I note however that the Oversight Commissioner also draws attention to a number of areas where further progress still needs to be made. In particular, he warns against the "cherry-picking" of Patten's recommendations in areas such as the training programmes and facilities, the further reform of special branch and the normalisation of police stations. At the most recent meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 18 September I again raised our concerns with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland about the rate of progress on these key issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1272">The policing board has successfully tackled a range of complex and sensitive issues and in doing so has maintained the momentum behind the policing project, a project vital to the long-term peace and stability of Northern Ireland. I particularly commend the work of the SDLP as representatives of the Nationalist community on the board. They have done an outstanding job for their community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">It is of course the members of the district policing partnerships who now find themselves under threat. We must respect the decision of those who have resigned as much as we commend those who stand against the bully-boy tactics of those who seek to harass and intimidate. This House will wholeheartedly join me in this sentiment. The DPPs are an essential part of the new beginning in policing promised in the Agreement and serve a vital function on behalf of local communities. They have the full support of the Government and the British Government and deserve the full support of the whole community. It is entirely unacceptable and utterly reprehensible that these people should suffer from intimidation or harassment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">When I met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in Dublin on 18 September, I raised the issue of personal security of members of the DPPs. We agreed that it is absolutely vital that all members of the DPPs are assured of their personal safety, and that all necessary steps are taken to achieve this. The matter is being continually monitored by officials of my Department and is the subject of regular discussions within the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat.</p>
          <p eId="para_1275">Fully implementing the Agreement means completing the policing project. The heart of the Patten recommendations is the creation of community policing. What is needed now is for all sections of the community to actively support the new policing structures and once again I call on everybody, including Sinn Féin and others, to consider joining the district policing partnerships and the policing board as soon as possible. It is only in this context that we can achieve a police service that is representative of the community, that is supported by the community, and that is held accountable by all sections of the community.</p>

          <p eId="para_1277">The situation in Cyprus is a matter of the greatest importance for the EU and has been considered at successive meetings of the European Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_1278">The Copenhagen European Council in December 2002 confirmed that Cyprus will be admitted to the European Union on 1 May 2004, along with nine other countries. It reiterated the strong preference for the accession of a unified Cyprus but agreed that in the absence of a comprehensive settlement, the application of the Union's laws and regulations to the northern part of the island will be suspended. The Brussels European Council, in March 2003 reaffirmed the Copenhagen decisions and regretted that the efforts of the UN Secretary General to find a comprehensive settlement had failed. The Council urged all parties concerned to spare no effort towards a just, viable and functional settlement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1279">Reviewing developments in June, the Thessaloniki European Council agreed that the accession of Cyprus is creating favourable conditions for the two communities on the island to reach a comprehensive settlement and recalled the EU's willingness to accommodate the terms of a settlement in line with the principles on which the Union is founded. The Council urged all parties concerned, particularly Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership, to strongly support the UN Secretary General's efforts and called for an early resumption of the talks on the basis of his proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">Since the failure of the UN-sponsored negotiations in March, measures have been taken to ease restrictions on contacts and communications between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. These have shown that peaceful co-operation is possible and that the two communities could live together in a united Cyprus. While these measures are welcome, it is the clear view of the European Union that they do not provide a substitute for negotiations on the basis of Secretary General Annan's proposals. I continue to believe that a comprehensive settlement can be achieved if all parties commit themselves to the resumption of negotiations. Difficult compromises will be required by political leaders on all sides if the Greek and Turkish Cypriots are to become citizens of the European Union together on 1 May 2004. Ireland is ready to assist in whatever way it can during our Presidency next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_1289">The report of the Ireland Aid review committee which was endorsed by the Government last year recommended that: "Efforts should be made to ensure that the positions taken by Ireland in international negotiations on, say, agriculture, trade, the environment or fiscal matters are congruent with what the country is attempting with its development aid programme".</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">The Government's preparations for the WTO Ministerial meeting at Cancún involved close co-operation between the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Agriculture and Food. The drafting of national policy papers and the preparation of national statements took full account of the development dimension of the trade talks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">In Cancún, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who is responsible for development co-operation and human rights, was one of the three Ministers who represented the Government. This was the first occasion in which an Irish Minister with responsibility for the development portfolio had participated in a WTO ministerial. Minister Kitt's presence at Cancún highlighted the importance we attach to international trade as a means of achieving our development objectives of reducing poverty and inequality. The Government's aims at Cancún were to protect and promote Ireland's interests, including our agricultural interests, through further trade liberalisation and to advance the development dimension of the Doha Trade Round.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292">The Ministers at Cancún worked in a co-ordinated and coherent manner to achieve an outcome which would be just and equitable for developing and developed countries alike. Regrettably, the talks failed and a significant opportunity to make progress has been lost.</p>

We will continue to work towards this end over the coming weeks and months. In this context, we recognise the importance of achieving maximum coherence between our trade and development policies.

      [21089/03]

        </question>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_598">
          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1297">The Government greatly welcomes the comprehensive peace agreement signed by the Liberian parties on 19 August. The agreement provides for an end to the civil war and sets out a road-map towards the holding of national elections in 2005. It also provides for a transitional government to take office on 14 October and serve until a new government is installed following the elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">The agreement, which gives the people of Liberia the first real hope of peace in many years, was the culmination of a number of important factors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">Regional pressure exerted by members of ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States, resulted in agreement by the Liberian parties on a ceasefire agreement and on facilitating vital humanitarian aid. The Security Council, in response to an urgent request from Secretary General Annan, agreed on 1 August to authorise the deployment of a multinational force to Liberia, comprised of troops from members of ECOWAS troops with US logistical assistance. It was envisaged that this force would shortly be replaced by a UN peacekeeping mission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">ECOWAS activity, with the support of the United States, also secured the departure into exile in Nigeria of President Charles Taylor on 8 August. This was a vital development. For a number of years, the Taylor regime sponsored the notoriously violent Revolutionary United Front rebel movement in Sierra Leone. As a member of the Security Council in 2001-02, Ireland was a strong supporter of the very effective UN peacekeeping operation in Sierra Leone and the targeted UN sanctions which restricted President Taylor's capacity to finance such rebel activity. In Liberia itself, the Taylor presidency was characterised by large-scale human rights abuse and the rampant exploitation of the country's natural resources for private gain.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">On 19 September, in Resolution 1509, the UN Security Council established a UN peacekeeping operation for Liberia, UNMIL, consisting of up to 15,000 military personnel. Under the resolution, UNMIL is mandated, among other things, to observe and monitor the comprehensive ceasefire agreement; to protect, within its capabilities, civilians under imminent threat of violence; to support the provision of humanitarian assistance; to help promote human rights; and to support generally the implementation of the peace process. A particularly important element of UNMILs mandate is to assist in the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration into society of the members of armed groups, a great many of whom are minors and indeed children. The provision of education and vocational training will be a vital part of this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302">From the outset of the planning of this mission, the United Nations secretariat, at its most senior levels, has expressed to the Government a strong interest in Ireland's participation. This reflects the esteem in which Ireland's Permanent Defence Force is held for its peacekeeping skills and experience. Intensive consultations took place with the UN secretariat on the nature of an Irish contribution, should a decision be made to participate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303">The Government is of the view that the deployment of UNMIL is critically important in supporting the implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement and for the political and economic recovery of Liberia. Furthermore, it will contribute to the consolidation of peace and security in the region. Liberia has been the source of much of the conflict that has taken place in what has been, in recent years, a most violent and troubled part of West Africa. The deployment of UNMIL throughout Liberia will therefore complement the effectiveness of the UN and international peacekeeping missions that already exist in neighbouring Sierra Leone and Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304">Participation in a peacekeeping mission in Liberia is also in accordance with the approach taken by Ireland on African issues during its Security Council tenure, when it worked hard to strengthen the engagement of the United Nations with so-called "failed states" and in conflict prevention and peace-building in Africa.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">Accordingly, the Government has decided to seek the approval of the Dáil for the participation in this mission of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force. The Deputy will be aware that the Taoiseach stated at the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday, 25 September, that the Government would seek the agreement of the Dáil for the deployment of a sizeable contingent of Irish military personnel to the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL).</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">The proposed Irish contingent could comprise a motorised infantry battalion of some 430 personnel, including the deployment of a small number of personnel at force headquarters in Monrovia. My colleague the Minister for Defence will, this month, submit a motion to the Dáil seeking approval for this contribution. The Government will continue to work to sustain the support of the international community for peace-building, and economic and social development, in Liberia and neighbouring countries, so that the benefits conferred by the deployment of UNMIL are sustained.</p>

          <p eId="para_1311">When Ireland takes over the Presidency of the European Union on 1 January, 2004, we will have the privilege to preside over the conclusion of the current enlargement process which will see ten new members join the Union on 1 May 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312">During the Presidency, Ireland will chair meetings in Brussels, Luxembourg and throughout Ireland. During this time, Ireland will be responsible for directing the work of the EU and, with the European Commission, for representing the EU in its relations with third countries. We will therefore be at centre stage, both in Europe and in the wider international arena.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">The Government is very conscious of the unique opportunity which the Presidency offers to showcase the positive and dynamic aspects of Ireland, in particular in the economic, trade and tourism areas. The Government also believes that the Presidency offers an invaluable opportunity for Irish business to promote what is best about Ireland. In keeping with its partnership approach, and to encourage wider ownership and participation in the Presidency, the Cabinet Committee on European Affairs has approved the principle of seeking sponsorship. Any sponsorship arrangement will also help to reduce the substantial costs of hosting the Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314">Sponsorship has been a feature of previous presidencies, most recently those of Denmark, Greece, Italy and, on a smaller scale, for Ireland's last Presidency in 1996. We have modelled our approach on that applied by the Danish Presidency by inviting offers of sponsorship for the Presidency from Irish companies. All sponsorship will be in the form of goods and services – no cash sponsorship will be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">The Cabinet committee is of the view that there are a number of high cost categories that are compatible with a sponsorship arrangement, such as transportation, catering costs, provision of IT/telecommunications equipment and gifts. Such arrangements have been adopted by previous presidencies. In this context, my Department contacted the various umbrella groups for business in Ireland, such as the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, the Irish Hotel Federation and the Society of the Irish Motor Industry to outline the sponsorship possibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">We are encouraged by the number of companies which have expressed interest in sponsorship, and negotiations with these parties are ongoing. No contractual commitments have been entered into at this time. Prior to entering into a contract, all offers for sponsorship will be presented to the interdepartmental Presidency planning group, which will decide on the appropriate sponsorship arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317">Where a sponsorship agreement is reached with an organisation for the entire Presidency, that organisation will be entitled to have its logo displayed on the Presidency website. On the basis of recent experience, Presidency websites have received a significant number of hits in the period immediately prior to and during the six months of the Presidency – the Danish Presidency website recorded a total of 1.3 million visitors averaging 8,000 per day, with 30,000 hits received on one day alone during the European Council meeting in December 2002. In addition, the organisation may also use the Presidency logo in its marketing for a period of one year from 1 January 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318">Sponsors of the entire Presidency and sponsors for individual meetings may have their logo reproduced on material published for Presidency meetings and may also display marketing material at particular meeting venues as appropriate.</p>

          <p eId="para_1324">The structure of the EU-US relationship is based on a wide range of consultation mechanisms that have developed over a number of years to foster co-operation across the full spectrum of political and economic issues. These contacts were formalised in the 1990 transatlantic declaration, which provides for the operational structure of the relationship, covering contact at Head of State and Government level down to senior level group meetings. This relationship was further strengthened in 1995 with agreement on the new transatlantic agenda which established a framework for enhanced co-operation between the EU and the US in foreign policy, trade and economic issues, and justice and home affairs as well a range of measures to foster closer links across the Atlantic.</p>
          <p eId="para_1325">The Government attaches considerable importance to the EU's relationship with the US and, during our Presidency, is committed to further developing co-operation between the EU and US on a broad range of issues. An EU-US summit is likely to take place in Ireland during our Presidency and we are working closely with the US side to establish dates. During our Presidency EU-US political dialogue will also take place at foreign ministerial and senior official level. While it is too early to indicate in detail the topics for discussion during the summit, it would be our expectation that issues relating to foreign policy, economic and trade relations and other areas for co-operation will arise for consideration. A strong and close EU-US relationship is important for the growth and prosperity of both sides as well as providing a foundation for international peace and security. I look forward to working closely with the US to develop this important relationship during our Presidency.</p>

          <p eId="para_1327">There is no proposal within the European Union for a permanent EU seat on the United Nations Security Council. From time to time, the issue arises in a number of fora, most recently during the deliberations of the Convention on the Future of Europe. However, this idea did not command sufficient support among members of the convention to be included in the draft constitutional treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328">The draft constitutional treaty does, however, propose the widening of the responsibility of EU member states who are members of the Security Council to "ensure the defence of the position and interests of the Union" to include both non-permanent and permanent members of the Security Council. The current treaty refers only to the permanent members in this regard. The Government supports such a pragmatic approach to defending the European Union's positions and interests at the Security Council and, indeed, in the UN more generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1329">In 2001-2002, Ireland was the only European Union member state serving as an elected member of the Security Council. Throughout its term on the Council, Ireland consistently articulated EU positions in the Security Council and took considerable care to ensure that EU partners were fully informed on Security Council issues. In this regard, Ireland initiated the system of structured regular comprehensive briefing of EU partners by EU Security Council members at the United Nations. The Government is gratified that Ireland's approach of active engagement in, and promotion of, European Union positions has been maintained by the EU member states currently serving on the Security Council. In addition, non-members of the Security Council frequently have an opportunity to express their views on issues before the Council in open debates. On such occasions, the Presidency usually speaks on behalf of the European Union.</p>

          <p eId="para_1333">I am pleased to report that the woman in question was successful in her appeal against a sentence under Sharia law of death by stoning for adultery. On 25 September the Sharia Court of Appeal in the northern Nigerian state of Katsina returned with its verdict, which was to reject the charge of adultery against the woman. This outcome is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334">This case has attracted enormous international attention due to the inhumane nature of the punishment. Ireland and the EU have played an active part in highlighting public concern about the conviction and in reminding the Nigerian authorities of its obligations under international human rights law. Through the Embassy of Ireland in Abuja and the Nigerian Embassy in Dublin, the Government has expressed its very deep concern at this case and cases like it. As recently as July, President of the Commission Romano Prodi wrote to President Obasanjo about extreme Sharia law punishments in Nigeria. This case has also been monitored on a regular basis by officials from my Department at the EU Africa Working Group in Brussels.</p>

          <p eId="para_1336">The situation in the western Balkans is reviewed each month by the General Affairs and External Relations Council. The EU has taken the lead role in working with the countries of the region to consolidate peace and stability and promote economic development and respect for human rights and the rule of law. The EU-Western Balkans Summit in Thessaloniki on 21 June 2003 confirmed that the future of the region lies in eventual integration into European structures, on the basis of the fulfilment of clear and objective political and economic criteria by the Governments of the individual countries concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337">At the most recent meeting of the Council in Brussels on 29-30 September, we reviewed developments in relation to Kosovo and the situation in Serbia and Montenegro. Discussion on Kosovo took place in the context of the recent appointment of a new Special Representative of the UN Secretary General and head of UNMIK, Mr. Harri Holkeri. Mr. Holkeri is well known to us in Ireland for his role as one of the co-chairmen of the multi-party talks leading to the Good Friday Agreement. His appointment has given new impetus to plans for a direct dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina on practical issues of mutual concern, which was agreed in principle at the Thessaloniki summit. The Council expressed its support for plans to begin the dialogue by mid-October.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338">The Council also considered recent developments in Serbia and Montenegro and welcomed the exchange of public apologies between Presidents Marovic of Serbia and Montenegro and President Mesic of Croatia for the evils committed during the conflict following the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. The public apologies were made during the first visit to Belgrade by a President of Croatia and are a hopeful development for the improvement of co-operation between the countries of the western Balkans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339">The Council stressed the importance of full implementation of the internal market and trade action plan on the harmonisation of the economies of Serbia and Montenegro, which was approved by the state union Parliament in August and has enabled the Commission to begin a feasibility study on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340">In my contacts with the Governments of the region, I have assured them that relations with the western Balkans will remain an important foreign policy priority for the EU during Ireland's Presidency in 2004.

      <b>Mr. Allen</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
      the consideration which has been given by the GAERC of the EU on nuclear safety in former Soviet states and in the Indian sub-continent.
      [21130/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_605">
          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1343">As nuclear safety in Europe is one of the European Union's primary concerns, the EU decided to take a prominent role in international efforts to help ensure the safety of nuclear materials in the former Soviet states. Therefore the EU has a number of projects focused on promoting nuclear safety which require the mandate of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC. The Union's approach to nuclear safety is manifested chiefly through the priorities of its common strategies on Russia and Ukraine, the Phare – Programme of Community aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe – and Tacis – Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States nuclear safety programmes; clauses in its partnership and co-operation agreements and EU environmental initiatives. The member states have charged the European Commission with the responsibility of developing and managing the programmes and agreements in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344">Nuclear safety in the Russian Federation is a particular priority for the EU. As part of the Union's common strategy on Russia, a joint action was adopted on 17 December 1999 to assist the Russian Federation in its disarmament and non-proliferation efforts related to weapons of mass destruction, WMD. In the nuclear field, the joint action includes a project concerning the disposition of ex-weapons plutonium. At the GAERC in July 2003, the EU agreed to extend the period of application of the common strategy for a further year until 24 June 2004. The common strategy on Ukraine also includes co-operation in the field of nuclear safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345">The Russian Federation signed the multilateral nuclear environmental programme, MNEPR, with the EC and EURATOM on 21 May 2003. The MNEPR agreement establishes a coherent and comprehensive multilateral legal framework for nuclear-related projects carried out by western countries in northwest Russia. The purpose of the MNEPR is to facilitate co-operation regarding, <i>inter alia,</i> the safety of spent nuclear fuel, the management of nuclear waste and the decommissioning of nuclear submarines and icebreakers in the Russian Federation. North-west Russia contains the largest repository of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste in the world. Nuclear safety is therefore a major element of the northern dimension environmental partnership, NDEP, developed during the course of 2001 in response to calls from the Russian Federation and the international community for a concerted effort to address environmental problems in the region, including the Baltic Sea area. The GAERC in December 2002 noted the annual progress report by the Commission on the implementation of the northern dimension. This report restated the EU's support for the promotion of nuclear safety in Russia.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">The EU also continues to include nuclear safety as a key element of its strategy of promoting energy and environmental reform in the former Soviet states through the Phare and Tacis programmes and through EURATOM loans. The Tacis programme provides grant-financed technical assistance to promote nuclear safety in 12 countries of eastern Europe and central Asia – Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan – while the Phare programme covers Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which will join the EU next year, and for whom nuclear power still remains an important part of their energy infrastructure. The current Tacis programme stresses the promotion of an effective nuclear safety culture, the decommissioning of spent fuel and nuclear waste and implementing initiatives to close Chernobyl. The three acceding states are assisted as part of their pre-EU accession packages. Lithuania, for instance, was given funding by the EU to assist in the closure of certain units of its Ignalina nuclear power plant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1347">Although member states make contributions to the International Atomic Energy Agency's technical co-operation fund, the EU has no role in developing or managing nuclear safety programmes or initiatives in the Indian sub-continent.</p>

          <p eId="para_1350">I propose taking Questions Nos. 130 and 191 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351">On 9 April 2003 I made a statement to the House concerning the situation in Afghanistan. Since then, the progress towards re-establishing a democratic civil government in Afghanistan has continued. The Afghanistan Transitional Authority, established in June 2002, will be replaced by an elected government in accordance with the provisions of the Bonn agreement. These elections are due to take place in June 2004. An electoral commission has been established and the UN mission in Afghanistan has started to organise the electoral process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352">A constitutional commission was inaugurated on 26 April 2003 and drafted a new constitution for the country. Public consultations on the draft constitution followed. However, the holding of a constitutional <i>loya jirga </i>to debate the constitution has been postponed until mid-December, amid reports that many major constitutional questions have not yet been settled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353">Progress has also been made on the creation of a national police force and reform of the national army, the first battalions of which have begun military operations, along with coalition forces. The principal challenge facing the Afghanistan Transitional Authority is that of security, particularly in the centre and south of the country where attacks on coalition forces and government troops, as well as NGO personnel, have increased in recent weeks, mainly by resurgent Taliban elements. The illicit production and trafficking of drugs in Afghanistan also remains a serious obstacle to the country's stability and reconstruction. The Transitional Authority's writ largely does not run beyond Kabul and warlords, often in the capacity of regional governors, still exercise great control.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354">On 11 August 2003, the leadership of the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, with which Irish personnel continue to serve in Kabul, was transferred smoothly from Germany and the Netherlands to NATO. As will be recalled, ISAF operates in Afghanistan under authority conferred by the United Nations Security Council in its Resolution 1386. The NATO leadership of ISAF is currently exploring the feasibility of an expansion of ISAF's mandate beyond the immediate Kabul region. Any such expansion would be dependent on a further Resolution of the UN Security Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355">The Government remains committed to the full implementation of the Bonn agreement and the construction of a peaceful, democratic society in Afghanistan. At the International Conference on Afghanistan in January 2002, Ireland pledged €12 million over a three-year period for reconstruction programmes. Almost €9.4 million, just over 78% of this pledge, has been delivered or approved for delivery within 20 months of the conference. Ireland is therefore one of the leading international donors to Afghanistan on a <i>per capita</i> basis. Ireland is also committed to supporting the electoral process in 2004, and is giving consideration to funding it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356">Together with our EU partners, Ireland remains committed to and will continue to support the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Afghanistan to help ensure that, with the assistance of the international community, it may emerge as a stable and peaceful democracy.</p>

          <p eId="para_1358">The Government is of the view that threats to international peace and security should be dealt with through the United Nations and in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1359">Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter contains a general prohibition on the use of force, subject to two exceptions, both set out in Chapter VII of the charter. These are self-defence, Article 51, and collective enforcement action authorised by the Security Council in response to threats to or breaches of international peace and security or acts of aggression, Article 42.</p>
          <p eId="para_1360">Article 51 of the charter recognises the right of states to take action in pursuit of individual or collective self-defence, if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations. The charter requires states taking such action to notify the Security Council immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361">It is widely accepted that the right to self-defence encompasses an entitlement to take limited and proportionate action where necessary to counter the threat of imminent attack. In any case, it is clear from the charter that the right to act in self-defence is recognised only until such time as the Security Council has itself taken measures necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362">Ireland does not accept that such an entitlement to limited and proportionate action should be interpreted as a general license to endorse the concept of the pre-emptive strike.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363">The Taoiseach addressed this issue in his statement to the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September, when he stated that the Irish Government would be concerned at the widespread acceptance of a doctrine of pre-emptive strike. He underlined Ireland's view that conflict would be more effectively prevented through a range of diplomatic, economic and humanitarian actions. He called for more attention to be paid to addressing the root causes of conflict, and to the early identification of potential conflicts. Where conflict had become a possibility, the international community should act more aggressively to head it off. He stressed that any conflict that threatened international peace and security was the UN's legitimate business and should be dealt with by the Security Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_1364">The Government is in agreement with the views expressed in the UN General Assembly by UN Secretary General Annan on 23 September when he stated that the assertion that states had the right and obligation to use force pre-emptively represented a fundamental challenge to the principles on which, however imperfectly, world peace and stability have rested since the foundation of the UN. At the same time, according to the Secretary General, it was also necessary to face up squarely to the concerns that made some states feel uniquely vulnerable and drove them to take unilateral action, and to show that these concerns could and would be addressed through collective action.</p>
          <p eId="para_1365">At no stage has this Government propounded a view at variance with international law. Regarding Iraq, in our explanation of vote when Resolution 1441 was adopted, we stated that regardless of the legal arguments as to whether Iraq's continued defiance of existing UN resolutions already gave sufficient grounds for military action to be taken, we felt that for reasons of according the widest possible political legitimacy for any such action, a further decision by the Security Council should be taken on that matter. It is also clear that under international law, the provision of landing facilities or the use of airspace does not constitute a participation by us in a war.</p>

          <p eId="para_1367">I am aware of the recent Amnesty International report on the handling of allegations of police ill-treatment and torture in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The report notes that many of the incidents of concern occurred during the violent conflict which was brought to an end by the Ohrid framework agreement, brokered by the European Union in August 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_1368">A key element of the Ohrid framework agreement is the development of an effective, multiethnic police force which meets international standards. Improved policing is also a requirement for the development of closer relations with the EU, in the framework of the stabilisation and association process. Considerable progress has been made since August 2001, not least through the recruitment and training of police officers from non-majority ethnic communities, through the introduction of community policing, and through the elaboration of a strategy for organisational reform of the police force. Last year, Ireland seconded five Garda trainers to the OSCE mission to assist in the elaboration of the training programme for the new multiethnic police force.</p>
          <p eId="para_1369">In July this year, President Boris Trajkovski invited the European Union to take on an advisory role in policing in Macedonia. The General Affairs and External Relations Council decided at its meeting on 29-30 September to establish an EU police mission, initially for a period of 12 months from December 2003. The overall aims for the mission, which will be unarmed, include the facilitating of the Ohrid agreement, contributing to fair and multiethnic policing and helping to build a stable and secure environment in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. EU police experts will monitor, mentor and advise the country's police.</p>
          <p eId="para_1370">I hope that these developments will assist the Macedonian authorities in the achievement of European standards of all aspects of policing.</p>

I urged the view that the roadmap was the solution supported by the entire international community and said that the President's full support for the roadmap, for Mahmoud Abbas and his Government, and for the reform process was essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_1379">I also met Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas who outlined his efforts to achieve a ceasefire. He was confident that the roadmap could be implemented progressively.</p>
          <p eId="para_1380">The following day I visited Jordan, where I had a number of meetings on Irish-Jordanian issues, including with the Minister for Planning, Bassem Awadallah, who briefed me on the state of the economy and Jordan's plans for reform. I discussed regional issues with Foreign Minister Marwan al – Muashir. In Syria I had a very valuable meeting with President Bashir Assad which lasted an hour and a half and was followed by lunch with Foreign Minister Sharaa. My final stop was in Lebanon where I met President Emile Lahoud and separately with Foreign Minister Jan Obeid.</p>
          <p eId="para_1381">My evaluation was that we met with a very positive response from all our interlocutors. All were willing to play their part in advancing the peace process. While there was much scepticism about Israeli intentions and American staying power, everyone recognised that there was a prospect of success and was prepared to make an effort to achieve agreement. There was also general recognition that violence could do nothing to advance the Palestinian cause.</p>
          <p eId="para_1382">Everyone was highly appreciative of the role of the European Union and looked to the Union to provide the necessary balance. They also looked to the quartet to play a major role, while recognising that the American role would be central. All our interlocutors praised the European Union decision not to isolate or undermine President Arafat, whose support would be needed to win acceptance for any deal which might emerge. They insisted that any other policy was seriously mistaken.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383">My discussion of the issues on the ground with most of the major players was both useful and worthwhile and gave me additional insights into the immensely complex issues with which we shall have to be more closely involved during our Presidency. In all the countries I visited, I encountered a genuine desire for peace which I hope can be built on in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1384">There have been significant developments in the Middle East since the end of June. Very few of them have been positive. Nevertheless, I believe that progress is possible. The roadmap contains all the elements which must form part of any comprehensive settlement.</p>

          <p eId="para_1386">It is the practice of the Department of Foreign Affairs that its officials will, from time to time meet with individuals representing opposition groups abroad. Such meetings may offer a more complete picture of the situation in other countries and can assist the Department in advising the Minister on policy towards these countries. In deciding on whether to proceed with such meetings, the Department takes into account the background both of the opposition group and of the representative seeking the meeting. It clearly would not be appropriate for officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs to meet, for example, with persons who advocate or support terrorist activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1387">With regard to Algeria, it should be noted that officials of the Department have in the past met with representatives of the Islamic Salvation Front. The Department will continue to be open to various possibilities for improving its knowledge base on the situation in Algeria.</p>
          <p eId="para_1388">As the Deputy is aware, there have been a number of reports relating to Dr. Dhina which gave rise to concern about his background. The Department of Foreign Affairs is still seeking clarification of the issues which arose. It did not prove possible to obtain this clarification during Dr. Dhina's brief visit to Ireland, and accordingly the Department was not in a position to accede to Dr. Dhina's request for a meeting at that time.</p>

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1390">The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, had a meeting on 26 August with a Ugandan delegation headed by Mr. James Wapakhabulo, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Uganda, and Mr. Sam Kutesa, Minister of State for Investment of Uganda, who had travelled to Ireland in response to the public expression in the previous week of concerns about Ugandan involvement in the Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC. In wide ranging talks there were exchanges on issues in the Great Lakes region, on the DRC itself, on the peace process in the DRC, the EU and UN peacekeeping missions, the instability in the Ituri region of the DRC and on the partnership with donor countries, including Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1391">As set out in a communiqué issued following the meeting, the Minister of State outlined in clear terms the Government's concerns arising from the Ugandan involvement in the DRC, concerns which had been emphasised in recent media coverage of human rights abuses in the Ituri region.</p>
          <p eId="para_1392">In response, Ministers Wapakhabulo and Kutesa emphasised Uganda's commitment to complete disengagement from the DRC against a background of an enduring peace process and a secure border and confirmed the withdrawal of all Ugandan troops. They reiterated that Uganda will continue to support and promote the peace process in the DRC and will use its influence with all parties to positive effect. They gave assurances that Uganda will continue to give the fullest co-operation and support to the EU and UN peacekeeping operations in the DRC and also gave assurances that, in line with the commitments given by the Ugandan Government on the publication of the report of the Porter judicial commission of inquiry into allegations into illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth in the DRC, and as required by law, Uganda will bring to account those implicated in the abuse of human rights and the illegal exploitation of the DRC's resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1393">The Ugandan Government has been made fully aware of the concerns we have arising from allegations of Ugandan involvement in human rights abuses and the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the DRC and they have been left in no doubt about the seriousness with which we view those allegations. The assurances the Minister of State received have served to indicate that the Ugandan Government is treating those allegations with due seriousness, that it is actively following up on the findings of the Porter commission, and that it is determined to respond in an appropriate manner and bring to account any of its nationals implicated in such abuses. As already mentioned, all Ugandan troops have been withdrawn from the DRC and the Ugandan authorities have been extending full co-operation to the EU and UN peacekeeping operation in the DRC. In addition, the peace process in the DRC has made significant headway, with a transitional government now in place and in the process of establishing its authority, and all reports indicate that the situation there has considerably improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1394">In his exchange with the delegation, the Minister of State raised the Government's concerns about corruption and human rights shortcomings in Uganda and was informed that the Ugandan Government is vigorously pursuing these issues and has introduced measures to deal with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1395">We will of course continue to monitor the situation in the DRC carefully to ensure that the assurances we have received are given full effect.</p>

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1401">I propose to take Questions Nos. 138, 149, 185 and 237 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1402">A key objective in relation to our EU Presidency is, as before, to run an efficient and impartial Presidency. The first half of 2004 undoubtedly presents very particular challenges, and our preparations, including in relation to our programme, will reflect this. Ireland will be the first Presidency to preside over the new enlarged Union of 25 states when the new member states formally accede to the Union on 1 May 2004. How we, as holders of the Presidency, handle this transition and ensure that the Council continues to function effectively, while pursuing the successful integration of the new members, will be an important focus for our Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1403">While the Presidency programme will be finalised in December, following the last European Council of the Italian Presidency, four main areas of activity have been identified at this stage as likely to be at the core of the Union's activities during our Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1404">The first of these is enlargement in relation to which, in addition to the integration of the new member states, work will also be ongoing in relation to the accession applications of Romania and Bulgaria, and also of Turkey.</p>
          <p eId="para_1405">The Lisbon agenda of economic, social and environmental renewal of the Union has been identified by us as a second key Presidency task and will be the focus for the Spring European Council. We will be seeking to revitalise the process and give it greater dynamism as it approaches its crucial mid-term point.</p>
          <p eId="para_1406">A third priority to feature prominently will be justice and home affairs issues as work to complete the area of freedom, security and justice, in line with the Amsterdam treaty and Tampere conclusions continues with a view to meeting the deadline of 1 May 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1407">The EU's external agenda which we will be required to manage is extensive and challenging and clearly represents a fourth priority. Key areas that we envisage focusing on in particular include EU-UN relations, the transatlantic relationship, the Middle East peace process and EU-Africa relations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1408">A possible fifth priority area of work relates to institutional reform where it remains unclear whether and, if so, to what extent the Intergovernmental Conference to agree a new constitutional treaty will run into our Presidency. While the Italian Presidency has made it clear that it is determined to conclude the Intergovernmental Conference, which begins in Rome on 4 October with a special meeting of Heads of State and Government, it remains a possibility that final agreement will not be reached in December. If so, Ireland will be asked to take the Intergovernmental Conference forward and this will represent a major Presidency priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1409">Turning more specifically to the agenda of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, on EU-UN relations, we will work to contribute to effective multilateralism through a reinvigorated UN. We would particularly like to build on recent progress in the area of EU-UN co-operation in conflict prevention and crisis management.</p>
          <p eId="para_1410">The transatlantic relationship is a pivotal element of a stable and prosperous international climate. As holder of the Presidency, Ireland is committed to further developing co-operation between the EU and the US on a broad range of issues, including in the foreign policy arena and as regards economic and trade relations. We expect to host an EU-US summit in Ireland and are working closely with the US side to establish dates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1411">The Middle East peace process will undoubtedly be a key area of focus for the first half of next year. I believe that the roadmap remains the best hope of a peaceful settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The parties must act in accordance with their commitments under it and work to give effect to its provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1412">We also plan to devote considerable attention to Africa and to EU-Africa relations. The ongoing situations in Liberia and in the Great Lakes region will continue to be focal points as will the situation in Zimbabwe. I will also be looking at ways of revitalising the EU-Africa dialogue and focusing on building a more effective and comprehensive EU approach to conflict prevention and resolution in Africa.</p>
          <p eId="para_1413">Development issues will also be given a high priority during our Presidency. In line with the Government's key priority for Ireland's development co-operation programme we will work to ensure maximum effectiveness of the EU's contribution to reducing global poverty and inequality. The fight against HIV-AIDS in developing countries will receive particular attention within the set of development co-operation priorities for Ireland's EU Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1414">Other issues that will be prominent on the Council's external agenda include relations with Russia, wider Europe and the western Balkans and the issues of human rights and disarmament and non-proliferation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1415">I was delighted to provide detailed briefing on Ireland's Presidency priorities to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs on 9 September and the Government will continue to keep the Oireachtas fully informed as our Presidency preparations and priorities evolve.</p>

      <b>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
      the steps which have been taken to condemn the very high incidence of violence against journalists in the Ukraine, and the low clear-up rate for such crimes, having regard in particular to the gruesome murder and beheading of Georgyi Gongadze in 2000, where evidence exists implicating senior political and official figures in the Government of the Ukraine; and the response to approaches made in this regard, either bilaterally or through the European Union.
      [21060/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_613">
          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1418">The date 16 September marked the third anniversary of the disappearance and murder of Georgyi Gongadze. I am concerned that in the three years since his murder a number of other journalists, including Ihor Alexandrov, a well known investigative journalist, have met violent deaths in Ukraine and others have been attacked. I utterly condemn these attacks and murders. I remain deeply concerned that the murders of both Georgyi Gongadze and Ihor Alexandrov remain unsolved, with no substantial progress made in either case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1419">On 1 July 2003 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe published – in Annex III to document No. 9852 entitled "Honouring of Obligations and Commitments by Ukraine"– comments by the Ukrainian authorities on the course of their investigation into the death of Mr. Gongadze. They note that after the appointment in July 2002 of a new prosecutor general, Mr. Piskun, a new investigation team was created. They say they have provided representatives of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly with comprehensive information related to the course of the investigation and that their work is being carried out in a completely unbiased way. The bulk of the work has now been transferred to those in charge of the search for the culprits. With this in mind, investigative judges have passed appropriate mandates to the authorities in charge of the search.</p>
          <p eId="para_1420">I take this opportunity to express once again my concern at the lack of progress with the investigation into Mr. Gongadze's death. As a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Deputy is aware that the Parliamentary Assembly has proposed, in recommendation 1583, that an independent commission of inquiry, which would include international investigators, should be established. As I have stated in the House on a number of occasions, Ireland supports this proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1421">The Presidency, on behalf of the member states of the European Union, has also issued a number of declarations calling for a full and transparent inquiry. The most recent of these, issued on 16 September to mark the third anniversary of the death of Mr. Gongadze, expressed its concern at the lack of progress in the investigation into the circumstances of Mr. Gongadze's death as well as its concern that journalists in Ukraine may be either restricted in their activities or intimidated from collecting information. The declaration also noted that progress in strengthening relations between the EU and Ukraine depends on the Government of Ukraine acting in conformity with European values and standards. The rule of law, independence of justice, freedom of the media and protection of journalists are central to these values and standards. I am glad that the Presidency will have a further opportunity to discuss these issues, including the problematic media situation, with the Ukrainian authorities at the EU-Ukraine Summit which takes place in Yalta on 7 October.</p>
          <p eId="para_1422">I am aware that the Council of Europe remains in close contact with Ukraine on the state of investigation into the case, and I welcome the visit by the prosecutor general of Ukraine, Mr. Piskun, and the chief investigator into the Gongadze case, Mr. Chubin, to Strasbourg on 26 and 27 September to discuss the case with Mr. Otto Schneider, President of the Parliamentary Assembly and with the co-rapporteurs of the Parliamentary Assembly Monitoring Committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1423">As I noted in the House on 7 May last, the Government has availed of every opportunity to raise the Gongadze case with the Ukrainian authorities, including at foreign minister level. Officials from my Department have raised the case on a number of occasions, including earlier this month. I know that the case is a matter of concern to all in this House. We will endeavour to keep the issue to the forefront in our discussions with the Ukrainian authorities over the coming months.</p>

          <p eId="para_1426">Ireland's network of overseas missions is kept under continuous review. As the Deputy will appreciate, however, constraints on the resources that can be made available for opening new missions require that any expansion of our diplomatic network must be incremental and be based on a thorough assessment of the costs and benefits involved. At present, there are no plans to change the status of our diplomatic relations with Croatia.</p>

        </question>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_615">
          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1429">The overall situation in the Great Lakes region continues to see improvement and offers some encouragement that peaceful resolutions of the conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of Burundi can and will be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1430">Progress continues to be made towards the establishment of peace and stability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC, with the new transitional government led by President Kabila having taken office in July and so far operating satisfactorily in bringing together the different Congolese parties to the 2 April peace accord. At the same time, the situation in the eastern part of the DRC, and particularly in the Ituri region and North and South Kivu, continues to give cause for concern, notwithstanding the successful completion of the EU-led Operation Artemis and the deployment earlier this month of a substantially increased United Nations Mission in the DRC, MONUC, which now operates under a Chapter VII mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1431">Ireland, along with our EU partners, will continue to encourage the transitional government in Kinshasa to consolidate its authority throughout the territory of the DRC and to hasten the process of creating an integrated national army and police force. Specifically, as regards the envisaged integrated police force, the EU is currently exploring how it might lead concrete support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1432">There is equally an onus on the DRC's neighbours to support the peace process in that country and to work actively to consolidate the gains already made. The Government will not hesitate to reiterate this point in any bilateral contacts with the countries of the Great Lakes region, as occurred when the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, met the Ugandan Foreign Minister, Mr. James Wapakhabulo, in Dublin this past August.</p>
          <p eId="para_1433">The Government, along with its EU partners, is continuing to monitor closely the situation in Burundi where the level of progress achieved in implementing and building upon the Arusha Accord has been less than might have been wished. Of particular concern is the continuation of the campaign of violence by the Hutu-dominated FNL armed group and the failure of the regional heads of state summit in Dar-es-Salaam on 15 September to resolve the outstanding issues between the transitional government in Bujumbura, led by President Ndayizeye, and the CNDD-FDD group, also Hutu-dominated, which has observed a cease-fire since last December. The Government encourages the continuation of negotiations to extend the Arusha Accord to encompass those groups which are not yet party to its terms. We also remain supportive of the efforts of the various special envoys in the region, including the EU's special representative, Mr. Aldo Ajello. We acknowledge and commend the valuable role being played by the African Union and South Africa in mounting the AU peace mission in Burundi. That mission continues to monitor the imperfectly observed ceasefire as well as the process of demobilisation and disarmament.</p>
          <p eId="para_1434">The consolidation of peace in the Great Lakes region and the mobilisation of international support for the process of reconstruction and development in the region will continue to be a priority for Ireland during our EU Presidency, in the same manner that the situation in the region was a major priority during our membership of the UN Security Council in 2001-02. In particular, we will continue to reiterate the EU's support for the holding of an international conference on peace, security, democracy and development in the Great Lakes under the auspices of the United Nations and the African Union and will seek to ensure that the EU makes an effective contribution to the outcome of such a conference.</p>
          <p eId="para_1435">Ireland will also continue to support the provision of practical assistance from the European Union to assist with implementation of the agreements arising from the inter-Congolese dialogue, including support for the holding of elections and the integration of national police and army forces in the DRC. We will also continue to voice strong support for initiatives aimed at ending the culture of impunity generally in the region and bringing to account all those responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity and acts of genocide.</p>

          <p eId="para_1439">I refer the Deputy to Question No. 428 on Tuesday, 30 September 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1440">Progress continues to be made towards the establishment of peace and stability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC. In July, the new transitional government comprising representatives of the Government of President Kabila and of the main Congolese armed groups met for the first time and in August, the interim parliament was officially inaugurated. I welcome the meeting on 25 September between the DRC, Burundi, Uganda and Rwanda in the presence of UN Secretary General Annan in which the countries agreed to refrain from interference in each other's affairs and to prevent arms shipments to warring groups in the eastern area of the DRC.</p>
          <p eId="para_1441">In June, Operation Artemis deployed to the eastern town of Bunia to stabilise the situation there as at the time it was spiralling downwards with serious consequences for the civilian population. This EU-led operation, the first to undertake implementation of the Petersberg Tasks outside Europe, was deployed at the request of the United Nations Secretary General and on foot of UN Security Council Resolution 1484. In September, the EU-led emergency multinational force, Operation Artemis, handed over control of Bunia to a strengthened United Nations mission in the DRC, MONUC, having fulfilled its mandate of restoring stability to the town. Ireland contributed five army officers to Operation Artemis and a proportionate share of the costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1442">At the same time, the situation in the Ituri region and the North and South Kivu continues to be a source of concern. It is imperative that the newly formed transitional government establish its presence throughout the country and, in particular, in this north-eastern region of the DRC. To this end, I welcome the decision by the transitional government to send 3,000 police officers to the Ituri region. I also welcome the release of European Development Funds totalling €205 million to support the transitional government in institution building, constitutional reform and the strengthening of the rule of law as well as funding for health services and debt relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_1443">In July, the General Affairs and External Relations Council reiterated its determination to deploy all its instruments in support of the political process under way in the DRC. To this end, the EU is committed to providing support for the work of the Ituri interim administration and the Ituri pacification commission, support for the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration process and the launch of a local reconciliation process. The Council also asked High Representative Solana and the Commission to consider, <i>inter alia,</i> support for the police force in Kinshasa and support for the electoral process. The Council issued a reminder that perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide cannot go unpunished and urged all parties to refrain from any act contrary to the cease-fires agreement, in particular in the eastern part of the Congo.</p>
          <p eId="para_1444">On 28 July, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1493 which provides MONUC with a stronger, peace enforcement mandate and a substantially increased force level of 10,800 personnel. This demonstrates a strong commitment by the international community to resolve the crisis in the DRC. I welcome the strengthened mandate of MONUC, which will greatly contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in the Ituri region and will provide greater protection to ordinary citizens there.</p>
          <p eId="para_1445">My Department continues to avail itself of bilateral meetings with regional and pan-African parties to stress Ireland's support for the peace process in the DRC and to encourage others to fully support the transitional institutions in that country. In August, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, met Ugandan Foreign Minister Mr. James Wapakhabulo and his colleague, Investment Minister, Mr. Sam Kutesa, to discuss the situation in the DRC. Mr. Wapakhabulo emphasised the Government of Uganda's support for the peace process in the DRC and its commitment to a complete disengagement from that country. The Foreign Minister pledged that Uganda would use its influence with all parties to positive effect and would bring to account those implicated in human rights abuses and illegal exploitation of mineral wealth in the DRC. Discussions have also taken place between my Department and the Rwandan High Commission in London at which my officials stressed the importance of Rwanda's full commitment to the peace process in the DRC as a linchpin of lasting peace in the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_1446">The Government has provided substantial humanitarian assistance in response to the enormous suffering caused by conflict and natural disasters in DRC. Development Co-operation Ireland, the official development assistance programme of the Government, has delivered almost €5 million in emergency humanitarian aid for the people of the DRC since 2000. Much of this humanitarian aid was provided to assist the estimated 350,000 people affected by the volcanic eruptions in Goma at the beginning of 2002. Funding was provided to Irish humanitarian NGOs such as Concern, GOAL, Trócaire as well to the Red Cross and UN agencies for the provision of food, clean water and medical supplies. In addition, under DCI's multi-annual programme scheme, an estimated €1.1 million is being provided to Concern for a three year development assistance programme in the sectors of health and livelihood security.</p>
          <p eId="para_1447">Together with our EU partners, Ireland will continue to ensure that the situation in the DRC is a priority issue in our relations with Africa and will remain so during our forthcoming Presidency of the European Union.</p>

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1450">I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 172 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1451">In his address to the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September, the Taoiseach called on member states to take action to enhance the effectiveness and the legitimacy of the United Nations. The Taoiseach pointed out that to be effective, the UN required the support of all its members, who must respect its decisions, and if necessary act to ensure that they are respected. To be fully legitimate, it must be seen to work in the interests of the entire international community. He called on the member states to use the United Nations to harness their collective resources in the interests of all mankind, rather than in defence of narrow national interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_1452">The Taoiseach strongly supported the call made by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, in his own address to the General Assembly on 23 September, when he spoke of the need for a hard look to be taken at fundamental policy issues and at the structural changes that may be needed in the UN. He said that the UN and its member states must not shy away from questions about the adequacy and the effectiveness of the rules and instruments at their disposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1453">The Secretary General said that the Security Council must regain the confidence of states and of world public opinion by demonstrating its ability to deal effectively with the most difficult issues and by becoming more broadly representative of the international community as a whole, as well as of the geopolitical realities of today. He also stated that the General Assembly needed reform to ensure that important issues were not, as he put it, crowded out by repetitive and sterile debates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1454">The Taoiseach and his fellow heads of Government committed themselves to a reform of the United Nations three years ago in the millennium declaration. The General Assembly in 2002 adopted a comprehensive resolution on strengthening the UN system, and some progress has been made in implementing it. One area of undoubted progress has been the major reforms undertaken in UN peacekeeping operations. In view of Ireland's long standing status as a contributor of troops for UN peacekeeping missions, the Government greatly welcomed these reforms, which include consultation with troop contributors ahead of the framing of mandates for UN peacekeeping operations. The Secretary General has also made substantial progress in bringing about much needed reform in the areas under his own competence, particularly in the management and structure of the secretariat.</p>
          <p eId="para_1455">Fundamental institutional questions, however, remain to be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1456">To give an impetus to the process of reform, the Secretary General has expressed his intention to establish a high level panel to recommend ways of strengthening the United Nations, through reform of its institutions and processes. By the next General Assembly, the member states should have before it a set of proposals drawn up by this high level panel and the Government greatly welcomes this. This does not absolve the member states from continuing to seek agreement among themselves on reform of the General Assembly and the Security Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_1457">The effort to revitalise the General Assembly to date has largely focused on the streamlining of its agenda and its procedures, to promote a more efficient and less repetitive approach to its work. Progress in this area has been slow and incremental, and requires persistence, particularly on the part of the President of the General Assembly, whose difficult task it is to secure the agreement of the member states for change. I have assured the incoming President that, like his predecessors, he will have Ireland's full support in his efforts. During Ireland's Presidency of the European Union, we will work to marshal the support of the EU and its member states for the reform process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1458">The question of reform of the structure and composition of the Security Council is a matter for the broad membership of the UN, represented in the General Assembly. It remains an exceptionally difficult issue. There is widespread acknowledgement that the Council's composition is unrepresentative. Ireland and like minded partners have proposed an increase in both the permanent and the elected membership to create an enlarged Security Council of between 20 and 25 members. We have also proposed that the permanent members accept a limitation of the veto whereby they would exercise it only when the question in hand was one of vital national importance, taking into account also the interests of the United Nations as a whole. At the same time, any new permanent members of the Council would commit themselves not to exercise the veto.</p>
          <p eId="para_1459">Unfortunately, the political will that would allow agreement to be reached has been lacking. As the Taoiseach said in his statement, the member states baulked from taking the hard decisions. Clearly a new impetus is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1460">With the best will in the world, structural reform of the Security Council will take time, and the issues that the Council has to deal with are usually immediate ones of peace and security. The difficulties facing the reform agenda do not absolve the members of the Security Council from reaching agreement as quickly as possible on issues of the day. It was our experience as Council members that the Security Council could, and did, act very effectively to address issues of peace and security when it acted as a united body.</p>

          <p eId="para_1462">The Government's national programme of assistance to developing countries comprises two elements. The major component is my Department's Vote for international co-operation, €374 million in 2003, while elements of official development assistance, ODA, expected to total some €80 million in 2003, are administered by other Departments. Total spending on ODA, therefore, is expected to reach some €450 million in 2003, the highest ever in the history of the programme. Current indications are that this will equate to 0.41% of GNP.</p>
          <p eId="para_1463">The level of funding required to reach the 0.7% objective will depend on patterns of economic growth and levels of GNP. As regards the projected level of expenditure for 2004, this will be decided later this year in the context of the annual Estimates negotiations.</p>

      <b>Mr. Naughten</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
      the steps he has taken to instigate a review of the UN's conduct in relation to the Act of Free Choice in West Papua in 1968-69.

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_619">
          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1465">On a number of occasions this year, I have set out the Government's position with reference to the situation in Papua. As I have stated previously, the question of a review of the UN's conduct in relation to the Act of Free Choice in Papua, would require the support of UN member states. Inquiries made at my request by our permanent representative to the UN confirm that at present, there is no significant support for such an initiative. There is, moreover, concern that such an approach might prejudice ongoing efforts to initiate a meaningful dialogue with the Government in Jakarta, and would not contribute to the amelioration of the current situation of the Papuan people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1466">At the April meeting of the EU External Relations Council, Ireland, together with our EU colleagues, adopted revised Council conclusions on Indonesia. These conclusions emphasised the importance of actively promoting peaceful solutions to the internal conflicts in Indonesia, including that of Papua. I met the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr. Wirajuda, at the EU-ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting at Brussels, in January 2003, and raised issues of particular concern, including the situation in Papua. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, also met Mr. Wirajuda at the ASEM foreign ministers' meeting, which Minister Wirajuda hosted, in July 2003, and reiterated these concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_1467">Officials of my Department also raised these concerns when they met with their Indonesian counterparts at the ASEM senior officials meeting held in Jakarta on 12 and 13 May 2003 and again at the senior officials meeting on 21 and 22 July 2003, which preceded the ASEM foreign ministers' meeting. Officials of my Department also meet regularly with representatives of the West Papua Action Group. Most recently, on 12 September 2003, they met Mr. Aloysius Renwarin, director of ELSHAM, and were briefed by him on the situation in Papua.</p>
          <p eId="para_1468">The Government continues to monitor the situation closely, and will continue to encourage the authorities in Indonesia to act with full regard to the interests of the people of Papua. In this regard, I welcome the decision in August of the Indonesian government to suspend the implementation of the presidential decree dividing Papua into three provinces.</p>
          <p eId="para_1469">Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue to support the development of a strengthened and candid dialogue and partnership between the EU and Indonesia. The Government sees this as the most effective framework at this time for addressing our serious concerns about the situation in Papua.</p>

          <p eId="para_1475">The Good Friday Agreement provided that consideration be given to the establishment of an independent consultative forum appointed by the two administrations, North and South, and representative of civil society on the island.</p>
          <p eId="para_1476">At the fourth plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, which took place in Armagh on 28 June 2002, an outline structure for the forum was agreed by the council. This involves a twice yearly conference, alternating between North and South and comprising representatives of civil society on the island. The planning and organisation of the first conference would be undertaken by a steering committee drawn from the Northern Ireland Civic Forum and the social partners in the South. The steering committee would also invite representatives from a range of relevant organisations, North and South, to participate in the conferences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1477">The valuable contribution of the social partners to North-South partnership through a range of agreed actions and objectives is recognised by the Government. Under the new social partnership agreement, the social partners will continue to make this contribution, including through participation in the Independent North-South Consultative Forum, when established.</p>
          <p eId="para_1478">Some progress had been made on implementing the North-South Ministerial Council decision to establish the forum prior to the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly on 15 October 2002. However, with suspension, further progress was not possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1479">The two Governments remain committed to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and, as envisaged in the Joint Declaration published on 1 May, it is our intention that the consultative forum will be established as soon as possible once the institutions are restored.</p>

At its meeting on 14 April, the General Affairs and External Relations Council asked the Commission to prepare a formal opinion on the application, as required under Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union. It is likely that the opinion will be issued at some point in the first half of 2004, during Ireland's EU Presidency. The Government has welcomed the Croatian application and, as holder of the Presidency, Ireland is ready to facilitate consideration of the Commission opinion by the Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_1482">Croatia's application will be assessed in the context of the Copenhagen political criteria for candidate states and in the framework of progress in the implementation of commitments under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement concluded with the EU in 2001.

          <p eId="para_1489">Ireland has consistently advocated a central role for the United Nations in the reconstruction of Iraq. We believe that the support of the United Nations is essential to efforts to help the Iraqi people to recover from their dire suffering over many years and to regain their sovereignty as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1490">The Security Council is currently engaged in discussion on the way ahead. Ireland believes that the members of the Council must assume their responsibilities and reach agreement on a resolution that reflects the interests of the people of Iraq and that can enjoy the support of Iraq's regional neighbours and the wider international community. In this regard, the deployment of a multinational force to Iraq with the authorisation of the Security Council is clearly of critical importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1491">At this stage, it is too early to comment meaningfully on the nature of, or conditions for, possible Irish participation in any such force, other than to point to the need for its authorisation by the Security Council. Should that condition be fulfilled and should Ireland be invited to participate in the force, the Government would consider the invitation in the normal manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_1499">The Department of Foreign Affairs has approval from the Department of Finance for a total of 140 additional temporary Presidency-related posts at headquarters and abroad. Some 70 of the temporary posts are based in the political division and the European Union division of this Department. These divisions are tasked with ensuring that the EU's internal and external agendas are managed successfully during Ireland's Presidency.

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1508">I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 and 232 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1509">The overarching goal of the official aid programme is to reduce poverty in developing countries. This is in line with international commitments and best practice, including the millennium development goals and their focus on the basic social sectors such as primary education and basic health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1510">The purpose of providing development assistance is not to alleviate the symptoms of underdevelopment but rather to contribute to the solution of the underlying causes of poverty. The focus therefore is on economic growth as well as on the distribution and consumption of resources. There is equal recognition of the importance of good governance, inclusive political processes and human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1511">The policy priorities for the Government's official development programme are largely determined by our commitment to work, along with other donors and partners, towards the achievement of the millennium development goals, a series of key development targets agreed at a number of international summit meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1512">The targets call for sustained measurable progress on a range of fronts by 2015. These include a halving of the proportion of people living in extreme poverty; the achievement of universal primary education; the elimination of gender disparity at all levels of education provision; a reduction by two thirds in under five mortality rates; a reduction by three quarters in maternal mortality; halting and reversing the spread of HIV-AIDS as well as measures to ensure environmental sustainability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1513">The bilateral programme will continue to constitute the centrepiece of the Development Co-operation Ireland programme. The focus of the bilateral programme, which amounts to some €254 million this year, is on six least developed programme countries in sub-Saharan Africa and on East Timor, which was added as the seventh programme country in March 2003. The thrust of the programme in these countries is on basic needs – rural development, education, health and democracy and good governance. Most support is delivered in the form of integrated programmes at regional or local level, selected in consultation with partner governments. Development Co-operation Ireland will also continue to work with governments and other donors on general budget support and sectoral investment programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1514">The provision of emergency humanitarian assistance will continue to receive priority attention so that we can remain in a position to react immediately in response to major humanitarian emergencies wherever they occur. Support to date in 2003 has focused in particular on Iraq. We will continue to strengthen and deepen our support for the work of non-governmental organisations. The establishment of the multi-annual partnership scheme will place funding for five larger NGOs on a multi-annual, programmatic basis and this represents a major strengthening of our co-operation with the civil society sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1515">Our support to multilateral aid agencies has been increasing in line with the increase in our overall aid budget. We will continue to concentrate our aid on a smaller number of agencies selected on the basis of objective criteria which will ensure that these are the agencies with the closest fit to our objectives. These criteria include focus on poverty, management strength and commitment to reform. Preparations for Ireland's Presidency of the EU, which takes place in the first half of 2004, will be a major priority. In addition, our Presidency will involve a key co-ordination role for Ireland at a number of major international development conferences due to take place next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1516">The Government recognises that HIV-AIDS is a major public health and development challenge in poorer countries which are recipients of development assistance and that advances in poverty reduction in these situations cannot be made in the absence of an urgent and sustained response to HIV-AIDS. This year we expect to provide more than €50 million for HIV-AIDS activities across the various elements of the programme. In addition to increasing levels of funding, Ireland will advocate a more urgent and mainstreamed EU response to the issue in the context of our forthcoming EU Presidency. We will also host an international conference on HIV-AIDS during the Presidency which will bring together ministers from the EU, eastern Europe and central Asia to discuss the fight against HIV-AIDS.</p>
          <p eId="para_1517">On the corruption issue, the Deputy will appreciate that it is itself a development issue. Corruption erodes core democratic values and undermines the credibility of public institutions. Combating corruption is, therefore, an essential element of an effective poverty reduction strategy. As part of our policy to promote good governance in the programme countries, we work to empower both governments and poor people to deal with issues relating to corruption.</p>
          <p eId="para_1518">Ensuring that the aid we provide reaches those for whom it is intended is of fundamental importance to the Development Co-operation Ireland Programme. Our systems and procedures of oversight and accountability are designed with this in mind and are constantly under review.</p>

          <p eId="para_1521">Fr. O'Toole was tragically killed with two companions in Uganda in March 2002 following an incident at an unofficial military road block. Two members of the Ugandan Army were quickly convicted of his murder by field court martial and executed. At that time, the Government presented a <i>démarche</i> to the Ugandan authorities expressing concern both about the circumstances of the killings and the nature of the judicial process that followed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1522">In response to our representations, the Ugandan Government established a five person board of inquiry comprising senior members of the Ugandan Army to investigate the circumstances of the killing and the judicial process. The board heard testimony from all witnesses and others relevant to the inquiry, including the <i>chargé d'affaires</i> of our embassy in Kampala.</p>
          <p eId="para_1523">A key concern on the part of the Government has been the suspicion of complicity in the murders by the Ugandan Army, arising from an incident two weeks prior to the killings in which Fr. O'Toole had been assaulted by a soldier. Our representative in Uganda made clear in his testimony to the board that the suspicion of complicity arising from this incident had to be addressed. He also expressed concern at the all-military composition of the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1524">The board of inquiry reported its findings in May and we received a copy of the report which we passed on to the O'Toole family and to the Mill Hill Fathers. The board stated that it did not "find any evidence indicating complicity of the army in the murder of Fr. O'Toole", and that the murder resulted from a criminal act by two soldiers acting on their own. It concluded, in other words, that the murders were the result of a robbery attempt which went horribly wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1525">My Department has since examined the report in detail, while taking into consideration that our embassy's own inquiries and contacts have not brought to light any firm evidence of a conspiracy or cover up and that the period since the murders has not seen any new evidence emerge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1526">The Mill Hill Missionaries in Uganda issued a statement on 28 May expressing their basic acceptance of the findings of the board of inquiry while making some critical observations on both the procedure and content of the inquiry. They also stated that, should any further evidence come to light justifying another inquiry, they would then request another broader based inquiry. I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Mill Hill Missionaries and support their right to have the matter examined should any new evidence come to light which might cast doubt on the original findings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1527">On a visit to Uganda in June last the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, informed the authorities that, in line with the position taken by the Mill Hill Missionaries, we have accepted the findings of the board of inquiry subject to the caveat that the investigation should be reopened in the event of new evidence coming to light.</p>
          <p eId="para_1528">The family is aware that we have accepted the findings of the board of inquiry with the caveat that the investigation should be reopened in the event of any new evidence coming to light. I would like to reaffirm my sincerest condolences to Fr. Declan's family and his order. Fr. Declan stands in a great tradition of Irish missionaries who have devoted themselves at great personal sacrifice to the needs of the most disadvantaged people in Africa and elsewhere. His noble and devoted work on behalf of the poorest and most marginalised in Uganda will not be forgotten.</p>

          <p eId="para_1534">The Amnesty International publication entitled, Ireland and the Arms Trade – Decoding the Deals, raises a number of issues relating to the export control system in Ireland. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which operates the export control system, asked Forfás in July 2002 to review Ireland's export licence system with a view to recommending how best we can modernise and strengthen export controls to ensure full compliance with Ireland's international obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1535">Phase one of this independent review – the definition of the work that is needed to be carried out – has already been completed by the consultants who have been commissioned by Forfás to carry out the review and is available on the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment's website. Phase two, now under way, will have a wide consultation process and will afford all interested parties the opportunity to give views about ways of improving the current system. I would welcome as wide a range of participation and views as possible from the public and from interested organisations in this process. I am confident that the issues raised by Amnesty International in its report will be considered by the independent consultants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1536">As part of the licensing procedure, my Department is consulted by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on each individual application for a licence to export military goods. My Department is committed to making Ireland's export controls system as effective as possible and takes great care to ensure that each export control licence application received is considered in terms of whether it meets with the criteria, including respect for human rights, contained in the EU Code of Conduct for Arms Exports (1998). Council Regulation No. 1334 of 2000, as amended, provides the legal basis for the control of exports of dual-use items and technology. Dual-use goods are defined as goods which could be used for both civilian and military purposes. The regulation sets out the list of dual-use goods that are subject to export control and is updated regularly to take account of EU member states' obligations as participants in various non-proliferation regimes. It is within this legislative framework that Ireland meets its international obligations to control dual-use items.</p>

We will continue to impress upon this Government the importance of implementing these necessary reforms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1544">The Government believes that the human rights dialogue between the EU and Algeria will be enhanced by the EU-Algeria Association Agreement under the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. In particular, Article 2 of the agreement states that respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, will guide the internal and international policies of the parties and will constitute an essential element of the agreement. The agreement also commits Algeria to develop the rule of law and democracy, including the upholding of fundamental freedoms. Ireland expects to see these commitments implemented fully in practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1545">Ireland and its EU partners have, at international fora such as the UN Commission on Human Rights, urged the Government of Algeria to take concrete measures to improve the human rights situation in the country. We also urged it to respond positively to the requests for visits by the UN special rapporteur on torture and the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions. Ireland attaches particular importance to human rights issues in our bilateral relations with Algeria. We have urged the Algerian authorities to establish independent mechanisms for the investigation of human rights violations and to bring those responsible to justice.</p>

          <p eId="para_1550">The human rights situation in China has long been one of concern to Ireland and our EU partners and is likely to remain so during our Presidency of the EU in the first half of 2004. On 18 March 2003, the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, discussed human rights in China within the perspective of preparations for the 59th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. While welcoming certain positive developments, the GAERC urged China to ratify the international covenant on civil and political rights and the optional protocol to the convention against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and to co-operate with international human rights mechanisms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1551">The GAERC also expressed its continuing concern in relation to the lack of sufficient or adequate respect for human rights in China, including the extensive use of the death penalty, the continuation of the "strike-hard" campaign, the widespread use of torture and arbitrary detention and called on China to abolish these practices. The Council also expressed its concern about the repression of freedom of expression, religion and association, about the ongoing violations of human rights of pro-democracy activists, proponents of free trade unions and followers of underground Christian churches and the Falun Gong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1552">The GAERC also expressed its concern about the deprivation of religious and cultural rights in Tibet. In regard to Xinjiang, the Council stressed that the fight against terrorism should be pursued with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The GAERC reaffirmed that the human rights dialogue with China is one of the EU's channels to improve the situation in areas of concern. The GAERC noted that this dialogue is an acceptable option only if enough progress is achieved and reflected on the ground. The GAERC determined that the EU will continue to evaluate the results of the dialogue at regular intervals, to determine how far its expectations have been met. The EU will also continue to express publicly its concerns about human rights in China and to raise them in meetings with China at all levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1553">I fully expect that the human rights situation in China will be addressed by the EU foreign ministers during Ireland's Presidency. For our part, the Government uses every opportunity to further the issue of human rights. During his meeting with Premier Zhu Rhongji in September 2001, the Taoiseach discussed human rights both in a private meeting and in the plenary meeting of the delegations. In the course of my visit to China in January 2002, I also had discussions with Premier Zhu and Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan on a range of human rights issues and concerns. We will continue our engagement in dialogue with the Chinese authorities to express our concerns regarding human rights.</p>

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1558">The declaration which was adopted at the UN millennium summit in 2000 included eight development goals. The goals set specific targets to be achieved by 2015 in areas such as the reduction in the number of people living in extreme poverty, universal primary education, maternal and child mortality and HIV/AIDS. The UN General Assembly subsequently requested the Secretary General to report annually on progress towards the goals and to prepare a comprehensive progress report in 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_1559">The most recent such progress report was published on 2 September 2003. The 2003 UN Development Programme's human development report, which was launched by the Taoiseach in Dublin in July 2003, also examined progress towards the millennium development goals. On current trends, it seems likely that globally most of the goals will be achieved by 2015. Progress towards the goals is, however, being achieved largely on the basis of continuing economic growth and poverty reduction in China and India where large numbers of poor people continue to be lifted out of extreme poverty. In sub-Saharan Africa, however, many countries are falling behind and are not expected to meet the goals unless economic growth increases significantly. The UNDP has estimated that, at the current pace, sub-Saharan Africa would not reach the goals for poverty until 2147 and for child mortality until 2165.</p>
          <p eId="para_1560">The eighth goal calls for a global partnership for development and relates to increased overseas development assistance, more debt relief and increased trade opportunities. Since the millennium summit, developed countries have made commitments to provide an additional $16 billion in ODA by 2006. The World Bank and the IMF's heavily indebted poor countries initiative is providing increased debt relief to 26 countries, but is still not delivering a definitive exit from the debt treadmill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1561">In trade, the EU's everything but arms initiative has opened the EU market, duty and quota free, to all products, except armaments, from the 48 least developed countries, with transition periods for rice, sugar and bananas. Many of the LDCs do not, however, have the domestic production capacity to take advantage of these new trade opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1562">The Doha WTO ministerial meeting in November 2001 adopted a declaration launching the Doha development round of global trade negotiations. The declaration provided that "needs and interests" of developing countries would be placed "at the heart of the Work Programme adopted in this Declaration."  The work programme covered issues such as trade in agriculture, services, market access for non-agricultural products and the trade related aspects of intellectual property rights. It also made commitments to provide long-term funding for the provision of WTO technical assistance to developing countries. WTO members subsequently established the WTO Doha development agenda global trust fund which will provide Sw. Fr. 24 million in technical assistance in 2003. Ireland has contributed €340,000 to this trust fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_1563">The failure of the WTO ministerial meeting in Cancún to agree on a framework for carrying forward the Doha round is a significant setback for developing countries. Their efforts to reduce poverty and to integrate into the global economy would be better promoted through a fair and equitable multilateral trade agreement rather than bilateral or regional arrangements. I believe that we must redouble our efforts to secure an agreement at the WTO that offers fair market access and, at the same time, allows all of us preserve the essence of our rural culture and environment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1568">The December 2002 European Council reaffirmed that Turkey is a candidate country destined to join the European Union on the basis of the political criteria which apply to all candidate countries. It gave the commitment that if the European Council meeting in December 2004 decides that Turkey has fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria, the EU will open accession negotiations without delay. These political criteria, laid down by the Copenhagen European Council in 1993, stipulate that a candidate country must achieve stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1569">I have welcomed the progress made by Turkey in the adoption of widespread human rights reforms in 2002 and to date in 2003. A central element in the assessment to be made by the European Council in December 2004 will be the effective implementation at all levels of these legislative reforms. The EU continues to work closely with Turkey through the revised accession partnership adopted by the Council in April 2003. This sets out the priorities Turkey should pursue towards fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria, with the support of substantially increased pre-accession financial assistance. The Thessaloniki European Council in June welcomed the commitment of the Government of Turkey to carrying forward the reform process while stating that significant further efforts are required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1570">Two thousand and four will be a crucial year for Turkey's relationship with the European Union. I hope that it will prove possible to achieve two objectives of great significance for Turkey and for Europe in general – the accession to the EU of a united Cyprus on 1 May 2004 and agreement at the European Council in December 2004 on the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey. Ireland will play its part during our EU Presidency in working with all parties towards the creation of the conditions for the achievement of these objectives.</p>

          <p eId="para_1572">As the Deputy may be aware, the treatment of persons in detention is regulated by two well established branches of international law – human rights law and international humanitarian law. In the case of those detained on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence, the relevant rules are provided by international human rights instruments, chief among which is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or ICCPR. Among the rights recognised by the ICCPR are that of an arrested person to be informed of the charges against him or her at the time of the arrest, and the right to a fair trial before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1573">In the case of persons detained as prisoners of war, the provisions of international humanitarian law, in particular the Third Geneva Convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war of 12 August 1949, must additionally be applied. The convention gives a detailed list of the rights enjoyed by prisoners of war, including the right to give only basic information to his or her captors, and the right to pursue religious, intellectual and physical activities while in captivity. Importantly, should a detaining power wish to try a prisoner of war for any criminal activity, such a trial must be held by an independent and impartial court and the prisoner must have the opportunity to present his or her defence with the assistance of a qualified advocate or counsel.</p>
          <p eId="para_1574">It has been claimed that persons detained in the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba can be regarded as falling into a third category of detainee – that of "unlawful combatants," who, while not being entitled to prisoner of war status, are being provided with selected prisoner of war privileges. I have previously expressed to the House the Government's concern that the detainees in Guantanamo Bay be treated in accordance with the provisions of international human rights and humanitarian law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1575">The United States authorities are well aware of the Government's position, which has been conveyed to them on a number of occasions. These concerns were conveyed most recently to the US Embassy in Dublin by my Department last week. There is no doubt that the United States is very conscious of the level and nature of international concern about the treatment and status of the prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay. In all contacts with the US authorities on the issue we have been assured that they are keenly aware of their obligations under international humanitarian law, and that they will live up to these obligations. The Government recognises the danger posed by terrorist networks such as al-Qaeda. However, in confronting those who abuse and violate all forms of human rights, it is essential that the highest standards be maintained at all times.</p>

          <p eId="para_1578">I visited Rome on 28 July for an EU ministerial troika meeting with Albania. The EU troika was led by Foreign Minister Frattini of Italy and included Ireland as the next Presidency. The European Commission was also represented. The Albanian delegation was led by Prime Minister Fatos Nano and included the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Integration, Ms Ermelinda Meksi, and the then acting Foreign Minister, Mr. Marko Bello.</p>
          <p eId="para_1579">The troika meeting was part of the continuing high level political dialogue between the EU and Albania. It covered the progress in the negotiations for an EU-Albania stabilisation and association agreement, which opened in February 2003. We discussed the Albanian Government's efforts to implement wide ranging political and economic reforms in the context of the outcome of the EU-western Balkans summit held in Thessaloniki on 21 June. The summit agreed a shared agenda for the development of relations between the EU and the countries of the region. It clarified the commitment of the EU to the long-term future of the region and the obligations on the individual democratic governments if they are to meet the objective of eventual membership of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_1580">In our discussions, Ireland took the lead on the issue of Albania's relations with its neighbours in the western Balkans region, including the positive role which Albania is playing in helping to reduce continuing political tensions, particularly the situation in Kosovo. I assured Prime Minister Nano that the EU would continue to work closely with all the countries in the region to overcome the legacy of conflict, to promote economic development and to build democracy and respect for human rights and the rule of law. I had the opportunity in a meeting in New York last week to review progress in relations with Albania with President Alfred Moisiu. I assured President Moisiu that the development of relations with the countries of the western Balkans would remain an important foreign policy priority for the EU during Ireland's Presidency in 2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_1582">The authoritative statements of Government policy on this matter were provided to Dáil Éireann by the Taoiseach and by myself on 20 March 2003. This followed a Government decision, taken the previous day, to continue the provision of overflight and landing facilities to the US military during the conflict in Iraq. The Taoiseach's statement and my own statement clarified the reasoning behind the decision to Dáil Éireann. Neither statement indicated to the Dáil that the existence of weapons of mass destruction was the basis for the Government's decision in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1583">As clearly stated by the Taoiseach on 20 March, the Government, in reaching its decision, took into account "the present circumstances, the principles that underline our foreign policy, our international relations and our broader national interests". The Taoiseach also made clear that the long standing nature of the arrangements with the US was a decisive factor. Ireland has been making overflight and landing facilities available to the US for over 50 years, a period which covered many crises and military confrontations. Landings or overflight facilities have never been withdrawn at any stage during that period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1584">My own statement reiterated the many factors underpinning the Government's decision. I referred to Ireland's deep and long enduring ties with the US and noted that to withdraw overflight and landing facilities at that time would have been a major departure from an established policy position. The decision to maintain existing arrangements was taken after lengthy reflection on the part of the Government and was subsequently endorsed by Dáil Éireann. I am satisfied that it was the right decision in the circumstances.</p>

      <b>Mr. Neville</b>
      asked the

      if he has considered the Dóchas report seeking the prioritising of human security during Ireland's EU Presidency.
      [21118/03]

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_641">
          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1587">My Department enjoys a close relationship with Dóchas, the umbrella body for nongovernmental development organisations in Ireland. Dóchas has established an EU Presidency working group which is co-ordinating the priorities of the NGO community for the Presidency. As part of our preparations for Ireland's forthcoming Presidency of the EU, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has had a number of meetings with Dóchas representatives to discuss our priorities on the EU development agenda. I wish to acknowledge the constructive contribution of Dóchas in these discussions. We will continue to consult with Dóchas both before and during the Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1588">The Dóchas report which the Deputy refers to calls upon the Government to prioritise human security during Ireland's EU Presidency. Specifically, Dóchas has highlighted human rights, trade, aid, participation and HIV/AIDS as dimensions of human security requiring EU action. Ireland is an active member of the human security network, a group of developed and developing countries dedicated to the promotion of the concept of human security in international relations. The elements that make up the concept of human security – the promotion of human rights, the advancement of human safety and the protection of human lives – are among the guiding principles of Irish foreign policy. The most recent meeting of the network which Ireland attended took place during the UN General Assembly in New York last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_1589">We are, therefore, sympathetic and receptive to many of the human security related suggestions made in the Dóchas report. On HIV/AIDS, for example, we will convene a high level international ministerial meeting in February 2004 on the issue of HIV/AIDS in Europe and Central Asia. The conference will examine how the 53 countries concerned can work together in the fight against the disease in our region. In the area of conflict prevention the Irish EU Presidency, in co-operation with the European Centre for Conflict Prevention, will hold a major conference in Dublin to examine the contribution of NGOs and civil society in this area. This conference will bring NGOs from across Europe to Dublin. It will be an important contribution to a global conference on NGOs and conflict prevention which the UN will convene in 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_1590">On trade issues, Ireland, together with our EU partners and the European Commission, will stress the importance of a successful and balanced outcome to the Doha round of trade negotiations. Our Presidency will have to take account of the failure of the WTO ministerial meeting at Cancún, and of developments at the WTO between now and December 2003. We will work to maintain an open and constructive dialogue with all of the stakeholders in the WTO negotiations with a view to putting the talks back on track.</p>
          <p eId="para_1591">In June 2001 the General Affairs and External Relations Council affirmed its commitment to "mainstreaming" human rights and democratisation objectives into all aspects of the EU's internal and external policies. In this way, the EU seeks to contribute to the promotion of the international trend towards integrating the promotion of human rights, democracy and the rule of law into development co-operation, trade policies as well as the promotion of peace and security. Ireland will speak on behalf of the EU at the UN Commission on Human Rights which will hold its annual session in Geneva in April 2004. This will be a major opportunity to promote the EU's views and policies on human rights in a key international forum. The human security issues identified by Dóchas will, therefore, be an integral part of many of our EU Presidency activities. My Department looks forward to continued close co-operation with Dóchas in dealing with the key issues of human security on the EU's agenda.</p>

The previous regulation expired on 31 December 2002, having been in force since 1997. The purpose of both the previous regulation and its replacement is to allow the Commission to continue to support programmes in developing countries in the area of reproductive and sexual health and rights. The Commission's role in relation to development co-operation is laid down in Articles 177 to 181 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1594">The previous and current regulations form an important part of the EU's development policy. In particular, the legislation addresses the specific United Nations millennium development goal relating to maternal health, which calls for the reduction of maternal mortality by three quarters over the period 1990 to 2015. Throughout the developing world, and particularly in the poorest countries, hundreds of thousands of women continue to die in childbirth because health systems cannot afford proper medical care and appropriate services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1595">The current regulation, like the previous 1997 to 2002 instrument, is based on the programme of action agreed by consensus at the Cairo international conference on population and development in 1994 and the Cairo + 5 follow-up conference of 1999. Ireland's position in the Council negotiations, on both the current regulation and its predecessor, was that they must be in strict conformity with the Cairo programme of action, which provides that abortion is not to be promoted as a family planning method and that regulations regarding abortion are solely for individual countries to decide. The Government is satisfied that the current regulation meets this requirement and that it represents a substantial contribution by the European Union towards implementation of the millennium development goals, to which the international community is committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1596">Ireland also supports the work of the United Nations Population Fund, which is the largest internationally funded source of population assistance to developing countries, and has been making voluntary contributions to the fund since 1993. The fund helps countries improve reproductive health and family planning services on the basis of individual choice and to formulate population policies that support sustainable development and poverty eradication. UNFPA is wholly funded by voluntary contributions. All of its programmes of assistance throughout the world are based on the principles of freedom of choice and informed consent. Its guiding policy, as laid down by its governing council in 1985, stipulates that UNFPA is not to provide assistance for abortions, abortion services and abortion-related equipment and supplies as a method of family planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_1597">Ireland maintains very regular bilateral contact with the fund in order to be in a position to closely monitor and evaluate its performance. We also served on the board of UNFPA from 1997 to 2000, when we were able to participate directly in detailed donor discussions on the fund's programmes and policies. From all of this contact and interaction we are satisfied that the fund strictly adheres to its mandate.</p>

          <p eId="para_1599">The Government is adamantly opposed to the use of the death penalty and accordingly seeks its universal abolition. We believe that its abolition contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights. The Deputy will be aware of the efforts we have made in conjunction with our EU partners and in accordance with the common EU guidelines on the issue of the death penalty to seek its universal abolition. The EU has pressed for abolition and has also issued <i>démarches </i>on the use of the death penalty in many countries, including the United States. The EU also raised the issue in its human rights troika meetings with the US.</p>
          <p eId="para_1600">The EU guidelines adopted in 1998 set out clearly the common EU position on the use of the death penalty. These guidelines now form the basis for Ireland's concerted interventions, along with other EU member states, in death penalty issues. The Government is of the view that an EU intervention on this issue carries significantly greater force than individual bilateral interventions. In the recent past, <i>démarches </i>have been made in the US, according to the EU guidelines, at both federal and state level on behalf of a number of individuals. The guidelines state that, where the death penalty still exists, the EU will continue to press for its use to be progressively restricted and for moratoria to be introduced. In addition to interventions on the use of the death penalty in principle, it has also been agreed that, where the facts of individual cases suggest a violation of basic minimum standards under international law, the Union will consider making a specific intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1601">At the 59th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights the EU tabled a resolution on the death penalty. The resolution was adopted by a wider margin than previously. The resolution called upon all states to abolish the death penalty or impose a moratorium on its use, and urged those states which retain the death penalty to comply with the minimum standards established by the UN's economic, social and cultural council in 1984. The resolution attracted a record number of co-sponsors (75).</p>

          <p eId="para_1603">The EU Commission adopted a paper entitled Wider Europe-New Neighbourhood: A Framework for Relations with our Eastern and Southern Neighbours on 11 March 2003. It was considered at the General Affairs and External Relations Council at its meetings in March, April and June 2003. In June, the Council adopted conclusions on the main elements of the wider Europe policy framework which were endorsed by the European Council at Thessaloniki in the same month.</p>
          <p eId="para_1604">The initiative is designed to strengthen the framework of the Union's relations with neighbouring countries which do not currently have the prospect of membership of the EU. The idea is to develop a "ring of friends" with whom the EU enjoys close, peaceful and co-operative relations. In return for concrete progress and the effective implementation of political, economic and institutional reforms reflecting shared values, the initiative offers the Governments of those countries the prospect of closer economic integration with the EU. The geographical scope of the initiative includes all the countries on the external land and sea borders of the enlarged union. These are Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus and the countries of the southern Mediterranean – Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestinian Authority, Syria and Tunisia.</p>
          <p eId="para_1605">The Council has decided that, at a later stage, it will examine whether the southern Caucasus countries could also be covered within these policies. Countries to be included in the initiative will be closely evaluated by the European Union for compliance with human rights and political commitments. In the GAERC conclusions of June, the Council invited the Commission to present proposals – in the form of "action plans"– for all the countries included in the initiative commencing <i>inter alia</i> with Ukraine, Moldova and the southern Mediterranean partners with association agreements. Work is now under way in the Commission to frame these proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1606">Ireland strongly supports the wider Europe initiative. The policy framework offers a good basis for positive comprehensive relations between the enlarged Union and its new neighbours. We believe that the approach is a good one particularly given expectations in the bordering states and in the acceding countries arising from the enlargement of the Union in May 2004. We recognise the potential of the wider Europe framework to reinforce the EU-Russia strategic partnership and will work to ensure that our approach to the wider Europe policy serves to enhance this important relationship as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_1608">The Government continues with keen interest to monitor developments on the Korean peninsula, which has the potential to affect seriously international peace and security. Ireland, together with our EU partners, is committed to the pursuit of peace and stability in northeast Asia. I welcome the six-party talks, attended by North Korea, China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the US, that took place in Beijing from 27 to 29 August 2003. We commend the Government of China for having taken the initiative in this connection. Ireland, along with our EU partners, strongly hopes that North Korea will continue on this path of international engagement and multilateral dialogue. I would encourage the Pyongyang government to take concrete steps to move towards a peaceful solution, and to fulfil their international nuclear non-proliferation obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1609">The EU has discussed this issue with interested parties, including the US, and at ASEM. The situation in North Korea was the subject of in-depth discussions between the EU and the US, at the summit meeting which took place in Washington on 25 June 2003, under the Greek Presidency. President Bush outlined the US position and welcomed the stance taken by the EU. More recently, on 18 July 2003, Ireland took part in the political directors' troika meeting with the US, during which both sides agreed on the need to pursue a multilateral solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1610">At the ASEM Foreign Ministers' meeting in Indonesia on 23 to 24 July 2003, at which Ireland was represented by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, there was a most useful discussion on North Korea. The EU and Asian ministers adopted a statement urging North Korea to resume its co-operation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, to reverse its decision to withdraw from the non-proliferation treaty and to abandon its nuclear weapons programme in a verifiable manner. The Ministers expressed their conviction that the peaceful resolution of this issue through dialogue and negotiation would contribute to regional, and international, peace and stability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1611">On 25 September 2003, in the margins of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, I represented Ireland in the EU foreign ministers' troika, which discussed North Korea with Chinese Foreign Minister Li. Official level contacts, with both the Chinese and Japanese foreign ministries, also took place in September 2003. Both countries have emphasised their commitment to the current six way talks process and to the peaceful settlement of the current crisis. For our part, we reiterated the EU's strong support for the current diplomatic efforts. The EU would also be ready to consider enhanced co-operation with North Korea if the present difficult situation could be resolved in a satisfactory manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_1614">Relations between the EU and Zimbabwe are defined in the context of the Cotonou agreement signed by the EU and Africa, Caribbean and Pacific states. As such, the normalisation of relations between the EU and Zimbabwe is subject to the respect of the commitments of the Cotonou agreement by Zimbabwe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1615">The EU has identified a number of benchmarks for the Government of Zimbabwe to meet which could lead to a normalisation of relations with the EU. These benchmarks include short-term measures such as an end to political intimidation and violence, the restoration of democratic values and respect for human rights, and freedom of the mass media, the removal of all obstacles currently impeding the provision of humanitarian and food assistance by international NGOs and a review of the land reform process with full UNDP participation. Medium term measures to be undertaken by the Government of Zimbabwe include introducing a number of proposals to parliament to redress current restrictions on freedom of expression and association.</p>
          <p eId="para_1616">Details of these benchmarks have been provided to the Southern Africa Development Community, the premier regional organisation in southern Africa. In doing so, the EU hopes to generate a greater understanding in southern Africa of the principles behind the EU's decision to impose sanctions on the government of Zimbabwe and to refute inaccurate statements by the government of Zimbabwe on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1617">The EU has also sought to address urgently misconceptions expressed in the final communiqué of the SADC summit held in Dar es Salaam in August, in which SADC expressed regret at the impact of international sanctions on ordinary Zimbabweans and on the region as a whole. At a troika meeting of EU and SADC senior officials in Dar es Salaam in September, the EU stressed that the sanctions, which are not economic in nature, were imposed on the government of Zimbabwe with the expressed intent that they would not penalise ordinary Zimbabwean citizens. The EU also provided to SADC details of humanitarian assistance to the region which included €295 million in humanitarian assistance to Zimbabwe in 2002-03. The SADC troika responded positively to the information provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_1618">The continued failure of the government of Zimbabwe to make progress in the benchmarks will dictate the relationship between the EU and Zimbabwe for the foreseeable future. The EU continues to monitor closely the situation in Zimbabwe. Most recently, on 18 September the EU issued a declaration condemning the closure of Zimbabwe's only independent daily newspaper as a serious attack on freedom of information.</p>

          <p eId="para_1620">In the past few weeks I have met a number of the pro-Agreement parties, including the UUP, the SDLP, Sinn Féin and the Alliance. In addition, my officials have been in recent contact with the PUP and the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition and we hope to meet these parties at political level in the very near future. In all of these contacts, the Government has stressed the need for early elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly. The two Governments and the pro-Agreement parties are working to create the conditions for elections to take place in an atmosphere that will allow the earliest possible restoration of the devolved institutions. Such a positive atmosphere would require the key outstanding issues of confidence to be satisfactorily addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1621">As the Taoiseach has stated, this means that the republican movement must make it clear to all concerned that paramilitary activity is at an end for good. At the same time, Unionists must reassure Nationalists that they are fully committed to all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and that they will participate in a full and sustained way. There is a relatively short period of time available to achieve these objectives and we are determined to intensify work in the coming weeks. I will continue to meet and maintain contact with all the parties in the days and weeks ahead. However, in the final analysis, the prospects for success are dependent on the willingness and ability of the relevant parties to take the steps that are required to give each other the mutual confidence that is necessary to move the process forward. It is important to remember that the Good Friday Agreement was a collective endeavour and all of the pro-Agreement parties have, therefore, an important contribution to make in ensuring its sustainability.</p>

          <p eId="para_1624">I am aware of reports that Dr. Pham Hong Son was arrested on 27 March 2002 and charged with "collecting and dispatching news and documents from a foreign country to be used against the Socialist State of Vietnam," after he had translated an article from the US embassy website titled, "What is Democracy?," and distributed it to friends and senior Vietnamese officials. I understand from these reports that Dr. Pham Hong Son, a national of Vietnam, was sentenced, after a half-day closed trial, on 18 June 2003, to 13 years' imprisonment and three years of house arrest on espionage charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_1625">The Government takes concerns about human rights in Vietnam seriously. While there is now a greater degree of freedom of information in Vietnam than there was a decade ago, there are still restrictions, and the Vietnamese government still insists on maintaining control over the dissemination of information. There have also been worrying reports of a crackdown on ethnic minorities, and on religious and political dissidents. The Vietnamese government also still implements the death penalty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1626">On 15 May 2002, the EU and Vietnam adopted a new co-operation strategy. While its primary aim is to assist in the reduction of poverty, it also deals with cross cutting concerns, including the promotion of human rights. Indeed, article one of the strategy reads that "respect for human rights and democratic principles is the basis for the co-operation between the parties and for the provisions of this agreement, and it constitutes an essential element of the agreement". Therefore, the EU heads of mission in Hanoi regularly raise human rights concerns in their contacts with the Vietnamese authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1627">I met with the Vietnamese Foreign Minister, Mr. Nguyen Dy Nien, when both of us attended the EU-ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting at Brussels on 27 and 28 January 2003. I used this occasion to discuss our bilateral relations and to raise issues of concern. I will take any further opportunities to emphasise the Government's concern about the human rights situation in Vietnam and the importance we attach to the elimination of religious discrimination, and the promotion of freedom of speech. In this regard, I will be very happy to raise the case mentioned by the Deputy. In addition, our ambassador at Kuala Lumpur, who is accredited to Vietnam, will also raise our concerns, including this specific case, at the next available opportunity.</p>

I was accompanied at the meeting by the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, while the Secretary of State was accompanied by NIO Ministers Jane Kennedy and John Spellar.</p>
          <p eId="para_1632">This was the sixth meeting of the conference since December 1999 when it first met at plenary level in London when the conference was co-chaired by the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair. The conference has taken on an added importance since the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland were suspended in October 2002. Its five meetings over the last year have provided valuable opportunities for both Governments to review the overall process of implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1633">At its most recent meeting on 18 September, the conference reviewed political developments, the prospects for holding elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly and the context for the successful restoration of the devolved institutions. The conference agreed on the need to ensure an end to all paramilitary activity and on the need for confidence in the commitment of all parties to the full implementation of the Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1634">The conference also reviewed the current security situation. It deplored the recent campaign of intimidation directed against members of the district policing partnerships.

I availed of the opportunity of the conference to restate the Government's concerns concerning the handling of the cases of British soldiers Fisher and Wright. The conference also discussed criminal justice matters, recent developments in the area of human rights and the forthcoming submission of the Cory reports into allegations of collusion. Finally, the conference reviewed the continuing implementation of the joint declaration of the 1 May and agreed to discuss this matter in greater detail at its next meeting, which is scheduled to take place in November 2003. I have arranged for the conference communiqué to be forwarded to the Dáil Library.</p>

The Israeli security cabinet's decision to expel President Arafat poses a serious threat to the Middle East peace process. President Arafat is the elected leader of the Palestinian people and should therefore play a central role in negotiations that would lead to a comprehensive settlement of the conflict. Any attempts by the Israelis to forcibly remove President Arafat would lead to a major upsurge in violence. Ireland also voted in favour of a United Nations General Assembly resolution, on 19 September, which demanded that Israel cease any threat to remove President Arafat.</p>
          <p eId="para_1637">This concern was further reiterated in the Taoiseach's address to the UN General Assembly on 25 September when he told the world leaders assembled in New York that "threats to expel or assassinate [President Arafat] are deeply misguided and dangerous and can only further delay efforts to achieve a settlement". Similar messages have been conveyed to the Israeli government by the European Union, by the United States and by regional powers.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1645">The fifth WTO Trade Ministerial Conference in Cancun earlier this month failed to reach agreement on a framework for the continuation of negotiations under the Doha Development Agenda. As such, this is a serious setback for the DDA. Ireland shares the generally felt disappointment at the outcome of the conference.</p>
          <p eId="para_1646">The Cancun conference did not fail for lack of effort on the part of the European Community. The EU for its part was among the most persistent advocates for a successful conference and negotiated in good faith at Cancun. The EU also, among WTO partners, provided significant inputs to the WTO in the lead-in to Cancun. During this period EU member states agreed the substantial reforms in agriculture under the medium term review proposals in June.</p>
          <p eId="para_1647">The Cancun conference concluded with a ministerial declaration that instructed officials to continue work on the outstanding issues and to convene a meeting in Geneva on 15 December, "to take the action necessary to enable us to move towards a successful and timely conclusion to the negotiations".</p>
          <p eId="para_1648">EU member states, the EU Council and Commission are now undertaking detailed assessments of the outcome of the Cancun ministerial conference. It is too early to assess the medium term implications and the setback for the DDA, or to reach any firm conclusions about the position of the European Community regarding the round or the next steps to be taken. A process of internal reflection and consultation among member states and within and between the EU Commission and Council is now beginning. The outcome of these reflections will have an important part to play in shaping and deciding on WTO priorities for the Irish Presidency.</p>

          <p eId="para_1651">The raised level of activity in the building industry in recent years has led to increased demand for the board's services which has, in turn, put pressure on its resources. The National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, of which the Irish Agrément Board is part, is working to match resources to the certification requirements of the building supply industry, and I am confident that these steps will soon lead to an improvement in the current situation.</p>

In this regard, an overall appraisal of active labour market programmes is being carried out under the aegis of the Standing Committee on the Labour Market, which is chaired by my Department. In addition, a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services.

          <p eId="para_1737">I presume the regulations referred to by the Deputy concern the movement controls on sheep and goats introduced during the foot and mouth crisis of 2001. These have been superseded on a transitional basis by a decision of the European Commission which came into effect on 1 July 2003 and which will be made permanent by a new Council Directive (260/2003) effective from 1 July 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1738">The new EU rules provide, <i>inter alia,</i> that sheep being exported to other member states for breeding or fattening are required to have been continuously resident on the holding of origin for at least 30 days prior to export, or since birth if the animals are younger than 30 days old – the residency provision – and that they come from holdings into which sheep or goats have not been introduced during the 21 days prior to dispatch – the standstill provision. These rules do not apply currently to sheep exported to Northern Ireland for slaughter for which a derogation has been obtained from the EU Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1739">These rules are designed to minimise the risk of transmission of animal diseases arising from trade in sheep across the European Union. Equivalent rules were initially introduced during the foot and mouth disease crisis of 2001, in which sheep movements played such a significant part in the spread of the disease. The EU Commission decision, which is currently applicable, and the Council directive, which will come into effect on 1 July 2004, will make the controls a permanent feature of intra Community trade in sheep.</p>
          <p eId="para_1740">The difficulty in relation to the provision of veterinary certification at marts arises because of the need to ensure that all sheep present in the mart comply with the export status requirements. A further difficulty is that of providing sufficient and auditable guarantees as to the compliance of sheep with, in particular, residency and standstill rules. I have asked my officials to examine ways in which the relevant requirements can be applied in a manner which can facilitate trade with Northern Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_1754">Tax relief for the film industry was first introduced in 1984 under the business expansion scheme and has continued in various forms for the past 19 years. This makes it one of the longest running sector specific tax reliefs in the economy and has seen an Exchequer contribution in terms of tax foregone of the order of some €265 million in the last ten years alone. It should be noted that this relief has continued over time against a backdrop of the widening of the tax base and the reduction of rates generally. In budget 2003, I referred to the generally accepted principle that such reliefs narrow the tax base and that a widened tax base is the price that must be paid to retain the current low tax rates. Consequently, all tax reliefs must be subject to ongoing review. In that context I announced in the budget that a number of these reliefs across a range of sectors including film relief would not be extended beyond 31 December 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1755">The tax relief for investment in films was never open-ended as regards duration. Its aim was to develop an Irish film industry and was never intended as an annual subsidy. Consequently it has only applied for specific periods since its inception.</p>
          <p eId="para_1756">In contrast, the exemption for stallion stud fees which was introduced in 1969 never had a termination date. It was one of the few tax incentives or reliefs which the Commission on Taxation in its report of 1984 on the role of incentives did not recommend for abolition. An estimated 25,000 people are now employed in the wider bloodstock sector. Much of this employment is in rural areas where employment is badly needed. In the Finance Act 2003 I provided for the return of information of profits and losses from the activities relating to this incentive as well as from woodlands and greyhound stud fees. When this information is available it will allow for the costs and benefits of these reliefs to be reviewed. However, as things stand, the position with regard to the 31 December 2004 termination date for the film relief remains unchanged.</p>

          <p eId="para_1768">Ireland currently provides two military observers to the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, MONUC. In June, Operation Artemis deployed to the eastern town of Bunia to stabilise the situation there as at the time it was spiralling downwards with serious consequences for the civilian population. This EU led operation, the first to undertake implementation of Petersburg tasks outside Europe, was deployed at the request of the United Nations Secretary General and on foot of UN Security Council Resolution 1484. In September, the EU led emergency multinational force, Operation Artemis, handed over control of Bunia to a strengthened United Nations mission in the DRC (MONUC) having fulfilled its mandate of restoring stability to the town. Ireland contributed five army officers to Operation Artemis and a proportionate share of the costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1769">Ireland is a strong supporter, both nationally and in concert with our EU partners, of the political process in the DRC. As a member of the Security Council in 2001-02, Ireland worked actively towards the establishment of MONUC, and sought to ensure that it was provided with an adequate mandate and mission strength to tackle its substantial and varied tasks. The Government welcome the recent strengthening of MONUC's mandate to make it better able to carry out its tasks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1770">As regards the level of Ireland's participation in the mission, this will remain under review. As with any peacekeeping mission, the Government would assess an invitation to participate in the light of a range of political and technical factors. Any such assessment would need to take into account the numbers of permanent Defence Force personnel available for overseas service at that time. In this context, the Deputy will be aware that the Government – following a request from the office of UN Secretary General Annan – has decided to seek Dáil approval for participation by a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force in the United Nations mission in Liberia.</p>

          <p eId="para_1772">The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is run by an authoritarian government which maintains tight and effective control on information concerning conditions in the country and continues to refuse access to independent human rights monitors. For this reason, it is difficult for foreign governments and human rights organisations to assess accurately the exact state of conditions in the DPRK. However, I am very concerned by the weight of reporting that suggests ongoing repression of fundamental freedoms. These include reports of a low level of respect for religious freedom, in spite of a guarantee of freedom of religious belief in the DPRKs constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1773">An EU Troika visited the DPRK in June 2002, to convey that the EU expected concrete improvements to be made in relation to human rights. The Troika also stressed that the positive development of relations between the EU and the DPRK was subject to action by the DPRK, with regard to respect for human rights, engagement with the international community and improvements in working conditions for aid organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1774">In the absence of any such progress on human rights and in view of heightened concerns since October 2002 regarding the political and humanitarian situation in that country, the EU tabled a resolution on the DPRK at this year's Commission on Human Rights. The EU Resolution was adopted by a large majority of CHR member states on 16 April 2003. The resolution expressed deep concern about reports of systemic, widespread and grave violations of human rights in the DPRK, including restrictions on the freedoms of thought, conscience, religion, opinion and expression. The resolution also reaffirmed that it is the responsibility of the DPRK Government to ensure for its people full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1775">At the present time, despite continued efforts, our EU partners based in Pyongyang have reported that it is difficult to engage with the DPRK authorities to discuss the issue of human rights while the nuclear issue continues to dominate the DPRK political agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_1776">Ireland, along with our EU partners, follows closely the evolution of human rights in the DPRK. In addition, as part of its commitment to address emergencies, the Government is monitoring humanitarian developments in the DPRK. Development Co-operation Ireland is actively responding to these humanitarian needs, both bilaterally and through our support for the UN system. On 30 September 2003, my colleague Deputy Kitt, Minister of State for Overseas Development and Human Rights, approved a bilateral humanitarian assistance package of €150,000 to provide emergency food needs, clean water and sanitation to some of the most vulnerable citizens of the DPRK.</p>
          <p eId="para_1777">On 26 September, I met DPRK Vice-Minister Choe Suhan, at his request, in the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York. Mr. Choe Suhan raised with me the establishment of diplomatic relations between Ireland and the DPRK, including in the context of our forthcoming Presidency. I explained that this matter was under consideration, and underlined the importance we attached to positive moves by the DPRK, especially in regard to the nuclear issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_1781">The Government is deeply conscious of the enormity of the challenges facing African nations as they seek to build the foundations of economic and social development, often in a climate of war and food insecurity. To break the cycle of famine and conflict in Africa, the Government's priority is to address the underlying structural problems affecting poverty and stability. Development Cooperation Ireland, the official aid programme of the government, has strong development partnerships with six countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Through these partnerships, Development Co-operation Ireland fully engages with governments, communities, donors as well as EU and UN agencies, on the basis of poverty reduction strategy plans, PRSPs. The PRSPs provide a framework for the prioritisation of our African partners resources and policies with the objective of reducing poverty. Our development programmes contain a strong governance element throughout to assist in the building of democratic structures, the rule of law and a culture of respect for human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1782">This comprehensive and African owned approach by donors, governments and civil societies, stands the best chance of reversing the downward spiral of economic and social indicators in sub-Saharan Africa, reducing conflict and facilitating real and positive change in the lives of millions of Africans. Development Co-operation Ireland is expected to deliver over €140 million in such assistance to Africa in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1783">In addition to this long-term approach, we also respond in the short term to save lives in the most effective way possible, through direct assistance <i>via</i> the UN system and international agencies as well as non-governmental organisations. To date, this year the Government has intervened to provide lifesaving humanitarian and recovery assistance amounting to over €14 million in 18 countries throughout Africa. These interventions were designed to reduce the effects of natural and man-made disasters on some of the most vulnerable populations in Africa with a particular emphasis on women and children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1784">Moreover, we will continue to work with our donor partners, including the EU and the UN, to ensure maximum co-ordination and coherence in the international response to humanitarian crises across Africa.</p>

          <p eId="para_1786">As the world enters the third decade of the HIV-AIDS epidemic, the evidence of its impact is undeniable. Statistics published by UNAIDS indicate that in 2002 over 42 million people were living with the virus. By far the worst affected region, sub-Saharan Africa is now home to 29.4 million people living with HIV-AIDS. Approximately 3.5 million new infections occurred there in 2002 while the epidemic claimed the lives of an estimated 2.4 million Africans in the past year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1787">In this context, Ireland has prioritised HIV-AIDS in its overseas development co-operation programme. We were one of the first donors to develop a HIV-AIDS strategy and we have worked to ensure that the issue is high on the agenda of the EU and of the UN's funds and programmes. Since 2001 Ireland's financial allocations to the fight against AIDS have increased ten-fold with a budget allocation of €40 million in 2003. These resources are directed at HIV-AIDS activities at global, regional, national and community levels and are implemented through international and regional organisations and in programme countries. The latter include six highly infected countries in Southern and Eastern Africa.</p>
          <p eId="para_1788">In his address to the 2003 UN General Assembly high level meeting on HIV-AIDS on 23 September last, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, announced that Ireland is making HIV-AIDS a key priority during our Presidency of the European Union in the first half of 2004. A number of high level meetings and conferences will be held on this issue including, <i>inter alia,</i> the role of parliamentarians in the fight against HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, the issue of HIV in the context of humanitarian crises, the status of research and development into preventive technologies including a HIV vaccine and the growing pandemic in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Baltics. These meetings and conferences will provide a forum for high level policy dialogue on HIV-AIDS and reinforce political commitment within the EU member states to combat the spread of HIV and alleviate its impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_1789">Ireland has advocated a strong response to HIV-AIDS through financial support and representation on the executive boards of UN agencies such as UNDP and UNICEF. In addition, Ireland provides funding to the joint United Nations programme on HIV-AIDS – UNAIDS. UNAIDS is the main advocate for global action on the epidemic. It brings together the efforts and resources of eight UN system organisations to help the world prevent new HIV infections, care for those already infected, and mitigate the impact of the epidemic. Ireland currently holds a seat on the programme co-ordinating board of UNAIDS and uses its membership of this body to contribute to the strategic priorities of the organisation and to monitor the implementation of its programmes. In particular, we have a strategic interest in the expanded UN response at country level in Africa and encourage a more co-ordinated response of UNAIDS and its co-sponsors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1790">Ireland is also a member of the board of the global fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria. Although not a UN body, the fund was established following strong leadership by the UN Secretary General, and has led to an increase in the overall resources available to fight these diseases. UN bodies are also members of the board. Ireland uses its membership of the board to input into strategic policy orientation and uses its work at country level to feed into policy dialogue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1791">Ireland remains committed to combating the global HIV-AIDS pandemic and is working at global, regional and national levels to advocate for sustained political commitment, allocation of adequate resources and a co-ordinated response at country level to defeat the spread of HIV-AIDS and mitigate its impact.</p>

          <p eId="para_1794">Members of the Security Council are currently discussing the possibility of adopting a resolution which would define a role for the United Nations in Iraq's transition to sovereignty and would also authorise the deployment to Iraq of a multinational force. Ireland wishes to see the restoration of Iraq to the international community under a representative government. This is in the interest of the entire international community. We would look to the Security Council to ensure that the United Nations is seen to maintain its proper role as acting on behalf of the entire international community. This is essential in relation both to the UN's ability to contribute to defusing the situation in Iraq and to the UN's future credibility. Ireland has consistently advocated a central role for the UN in the reconstruction of Iraq. The Security Council deserves Ireland's full support and that of the entire international community in its efforts to achieve those objectives. Ireland strongly encourages the Security Council in its work to agree on the way forward and we hope that a multinational force will be agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1795">If such a resolution is adopted, it is, of course, possible that Ireland would be one of the countries invited to participate in this force. At this stage, it is too early to comment meaningfully on the nature of, or conditions for, possible Irish participation in any such force, other than to point to the need for its authorisation by the Security Council. Should that condition be fulfilled and should Ireland be invited to participate in the force, the Government would consider the invitation in the normal manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_1798">Human rights have been a priority of successive Irish Governments and continue to form a central part of Ireland's foreign policy. Through our active participation in multilateral organisations such as the European Union, United Nations and the Council of Europe, Ireland voices its concerns regarding the abuse of human rights with a view to bringing to bear international pressure on those responsible for the violation of human rights. Ireland fully supports the prioritisation of human rights at EU level and EU action to mainstream human rights on the political agenda. It is my belief that an EU response to human rights issues often constitutes a stronger, and therefore more effective, means of responding to violations and threats to human rights. During our Presidency of the European Union, Ireland will seek to develop further EU policy on human rights and to take action on issues which have traditionally been a priority for the EU, such as the elimination of torture and the death penalty. In addition, during our Presidency of the European Union next year Ireland will seek to highlight the role of and threats to human rights defenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_1799">At international level Ireland will continue to raise these issues, through our participation in, and co-operation with, the United Nations. The UN General Assembly and the UN Commission on Human Rights are the major fora for the discussion of human rights matters at the international level. Ireland is a committed member of the UN Commission on Human Rights. We will continue to work, with our EU partners, to ensure that the Commission address in an impartial and effective way the items on its agenda, including the various thematic issues and country situations which come before it. In addition we will seek to strengthen and enhance the role of the EU at the Commission. With its Presidency of the EU, Ireland will have the responsibility of speaking and negotiating on behalf of the Union at the next session of the Commission in March-April 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1800">As I have previously stated, participation in international organisations will continue to be the principal mechanism through which this Government will deal with violations of human rights and seek to further their protection.</p>

      asked the

      the number of locations at which Ireland currently has an embassy and where it is intended to open embassies in the near future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_1803">Ireland currently has a network of 68 missions abroad – 49 embassies, five multilateral missions and 14 consulates general and other offices. A list of these missions is supplied for the Deputy's information. The spread of resident Irish missions abroad is reviewed by the Government on an ongoing basis, with decisions to open new missions being based on a thorough assessment of the costs and benefits involved. In 2001, the Government decided to open new embassies in a number of EU candidate countries on a phased basis, subject to the availability of the necessary resources. New embassies have since been established in Estonia, Slovenia, Slovakia and Cyprus and also in Brazil. In recent weeks, offices also opened in Sofia, Bulgaria and Bucharest, Romania, to ensure the most effective management of our Presidency in these two countries. The opening of additional missions will be kept under ongoing review, including in the context of the availability of resources.</p>

          <p eId="para_1877">There are currently 345 members of the Permanent Defence Forces on overseas duty in UN peacekeeping operations or in multinational forces authorised by the United Nations Security Council. Of these, 61 are serving in eight UN missions in Côte dIvoire, Western Sahara, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Lebanon, Kosovo, Timor Leste and the Middle East, while 284 are serving in multinational forces authorised by the Security Council, in Kosovo (KFOR), Bosnia and Herzegovina (SFOR) and in Afghanistan (ISAF).</p>

Any such assessment would also need to take into account the numbers of Permanent Defence Force personnel available for overseas service at that time.</p>

          <p eId="para_1881">The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court entered into force on 1 July 2002. To date, 92 states have ratified or acceded to the Statute. An additional 52 states have signed the Statute, although two of these – Israel and the United States of America – have notified the UN Secretary General of their intention not to proceed to ratification.</p>
          <p eId="para_1882">Since its entry into force, the Assembly of States Parties established by Article 112 of the Statute has met on four occasions. In February 2003 the Assembly elected the 18 judges of the Court, including Judge Maureen Harding Clark, who was nominated by Ireland. In April, the Court's Prosecutor and members of its budget and finance committee were elected and in September the Assembly elected the court's deputy prosecutor and members of the board of directors of the trust fund for the benefit of victims. The Assembly has also adopted the Elements of Crime and the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the Court and engaged in other tasks entrusted to it by the statute. Ireland is, and will continue to be, an active participant in the Assembly's sessions with a view to ensuring that it fulfils the functions entrusted to it by the Court's Statute.</p>
          <p eId="para_1883">Since its establishment, the court, which is based in The Hague, has recruited its staff and commenced work on judicial and prosecutorial questions. The judges have established themselves into pre-trial, trial and appeals chambers and are preparing for the commencement of the first cases to be dealt with by the court. Amongst other tasks, the judges are currently engaged in drafting the court's regulations, which will deal with issues such as its composition and administration, proceedings before the court, victims and reparations, the role of defence counsel and detention of suspects and convicted persons. It is hoped that these regulations will be finalised by the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1884">An information and evidence unit has been established within the Office of the Prosecutor to receive information on crimes within the jurisdiction of the court, namely genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. By July 2003, 499 communications alleging violations of the Statute had been received from individuals or groups from 66 countries. Of the communications received, some 70% have been deemed inadmissible by the Prosecutor for a variety of reasons; the remainder are being examined on an ongoing basis. The Prosecutor has announced that he is closely following the urgent situation in Ituri, Democratic Republic of Congo, reports from which raise serious concerns that crimes falling within the jurisdiction of the court have been committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1885">Full details of the work of the court are contained in the first annual report of the court to the Assembly of States Parties and in the addresses made by the President of the Court, Judge Phillipe Kirsch, and the Prosecutor, Mr. Luis Moreno-Ocampo, to the Assembly. Copies of these documents are available on the Court's web-site: <i>http://www.icc-cpi.int/php/news/latest.php</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_1886">As the Deputy will be aware, the United States of America has stated its opposition to the exercise by the court of jurisdiction over US nationals and thus has decided not to ratify the court's statute. The statute provides that the court's jurisdiction is, in general, limited to acts committed after its entry into force in the territory of or by nationals of states parties. In addition, the Security Council of the United Nations adopted resolution 1422 (2002) on United Nations Peacekeeping on 12 July 2002. Paragraph 1 of that Resolution requested "consistent with the provisions of Article 16 of the Rome Statute, that the ICC, if a case arises involving current or former officials or personnel from a contributing State not a party to the Rome Statute over acts or omissions relating to a United Nations established or authorised operation, shall for a twelve month period starting 1 July 2002 not commence or proceed with investigation or prosecution of any such case, unless the Security Council decides otherwise". This resolution was renewed for a further 12 month period commencing on 1 July 2003 by Security Council Resolution 1487 (2003) of 12 June 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1887">Article 98(2) of the court's statute provides that it may not proceed with a request to a state party for surrender to it of a suspect which would require the requested state to act inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a sending state is required to surrender a person of that state to the court, unless it can first obtain the co-operation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.</p>
          <p eId="para_1888">One country, the United States, has approached the Government about entering into a bilateral non-surrender agreement in relation to the court and a similar approach was made to our EU partners. Following a detailed examination of the text of the proposed US agreement, the Council of the European Union on 30 September 2002 concluded that entering into such an agreement, as drafted, would be inconsistent with the obligations of states parties to the Statute of the International Criminal Court under the statute. The Council also adopted guiding principles concerning non-surrender agreements emphasising that any agreement would have to be consistent with the statute and in particular emphasising the need to avoid impunity for perpetrators of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1889">In common with our EU partners, the Government is committed to the effective functioning of the International Criminal Court and to preserve the integrity of the Rome Statute. In this regard, it supports efforts to ensure the widest possible ratification and implementation of the statute and the dissemination of the guiding principles. Along with our EU partners, the Government is also committed to developing a broader dialogue between the Union and the United States on all matters relating to the International Criminal Court, including future relations between the United States and the court. During Ireland's forthcoming Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the first half of 2004, the Government will have the opportunity to lead the Union's efforts to pursue these important goals.</p>

          <p eId="para_1903">The social partnership agreement 2003-2005, Sustaining Progress, provided for modernisation of the education sector. As part of the modernisation process, arrangements with regard to standardised mid-term breaks and holiday periods at Christmas and Easter were agreed following discussions at the teachers conciliation council which involves union and management interests. My Department notified the agreed arrangements to school authorities last May.</p>
          <p eId="para_1904">The whole thrust of the modernisation process in the education sector is to minimise the disruption to the education of primary and post-primary pupils and to ensure as far as possible that students' entitlement to the prescribed minimum number of teaching days, 183 full school days in the case of primary schools and 167 full school days in the case of post-primary schools, is guaranteed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1905">My key concern, and I believe it is what is expected of me as Minister, is to secure the integrity of the school year. This does not necessarily rule out half-day closures but it does require that they happen within a context or framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_1906">Once schools adhere to the agreed standardisation, they have local flexibility in determining how they make up the required number of teaching days. My Department does not centrally determine whether or not a school opts to have a day or half-day closure for any particular event once the overall number of teaching days is delivered by the school over the course of the year. This approach aims to strike a balance between allowing schools some local discretion while at the same time ensuring that pupils get their full entitlement to education. It is of course essential that there be the greatest possible consultation with parents and that sufficient notice is given in relation to any school closure.</p>

ADM administers the RAPID programme on behalf of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, which has overall responsibility for implementation of the programme. Since staff in the individual divisions of my Department deal with RAPID as it arises in their programme areas, a specific allocation of staff whose principal duty is engagement with RAPID communities is not therefore necessary.</p>

          <p eId="para_5482">Officials of my Department, including the chief medical officer, have met representatives of the Irish ME Trust, both this year and last year. The Department's chief medical officer has pointed out the limitations on the health care system's ability to provide a full range of services to those who are already diagnosed with CFS/ME. These limitations are the same as for those who suffer from other chronic diseases. The allocation of resources needs to be based on priority health needs and on evidence as to what interventions are seen to be most effective in combating these conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_5483">The health system and particularly acute services are under pressure due to demand for emergency services and elective services. Within this context, there are limitations on the capacity of the health care system to respond to demands for increased or additional services. It is, therefore, difficult in the current circumstances to identify funding to establish specialised units for CFS/ME sufferers.</p>
          <p eId="para_5484">My Department will continue to keep the issue of providing services to CFS/ME sufferers under review, taking account, in particular, of the experience of initiatives in other countries.</p>

      <b>Mr. Crawford</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Health and Children</b>
      if there is an agreement between our Government and that of the UK regarding the rights of citizens born before 1922 who spent their working life in Northern Ireland but now live south of the Border; if they are entitled to residential care free of charge in either Northern Ireland/UK or here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_5486">The Deputy is enquiring about entitlement to residential care of citizens born before 1922. In this country, entitlement to health services, including residential care, is based on residency and means. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility, defined as category 1, i.e. medical card holders, or limited eligibility, defined as category 2, for health services. Health boards normally regard a person as "ordinarily resident" in Ireland if he or she satisfies the health board that it is his or her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year. I understand that a similar position pertains in the UK in that, in the first instance, a person needs to be resident in order to be eligible for services.</p>
          <p eId="para_5487">Charges in respect of long-stay or extended residential care in health board institutions can be made under two sets of regulations. They can be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months. The regulations provide that a charge is made at a rate not exceeding the person's income. Medical card holders and persons with dependants are exempt from these charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_5488">Charges may also be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1965 where the patient receives "shelter and maintenance" rather than treatment. These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes, including medical card holders and persons with dependants.</p>
          <p eId="para_5489">In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</p>

      if, in the context of measures to combat the sale and promotion of tobacco products, he is proposing to ban the sale and advertising of non-tobacco products that bear the name, design, logo or image of a tobacco product or have any link with a tobacco product; if so when such a ban will be introduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_5491">The Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill 2003, which amends certain sections of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002, provides for a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising. The definitions of advertising include every form of recommendation of the product to the public and any form of commercial communication with the aim of promoting a tobacco product. The 2002 Act provided for the prohibition on the sale of non-tobacco products using logos or emblems associated with tobacco products, which is usually referred to as brand stretching. The 2003 Bill, which was published on 19 August, will amend the 2002 Act to, <i>inter alia,</i> give effect to Directive 2003/03/EC, which prohibits the advertising of tobacco products. The directive does not include a prohibition on brand stretching, though it had originally been proposed to do so, and this development is reflected in the amending Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_5492">The issue of brand stretching will be kept under review and should further measures be necessary to strengthen public health policy in this area, I will consider bringing forward appropriate proposals.</p>

          <p eId="para_5498">Mental health does not stand in isolation; it is equally important as physical health to the overall well being of a person. Poor mental health has a significant impact on a person's quality of life and their contribution to society. It is becoming increasingly clear that there is a need to address mental health as an integral part of improving overall health and well being.</p>
          <p eId="para_5499">Mental health promotion is a very broad concept as it emphasises the promotion of the psychological health and well being of individuals, families and communities. This concept fits with the rationale for health promotion, which acknowledges that lifestyles are a key determinant of health. Lifestyles are themselves influenced by the individual's social, economic, cultural, physical and ethical environment as well as by the information and skills which an individual possesses in relation to his or her own health.</p>
          <p eId="para_5500">While the health sector has a critical role to play in promoting positive mental health, other sectors such as schools, the youth sector, the workplace and the community also have an important contribution to make. Mental health promotion brings a particular focus on improving quality of life, creating supportive community structures, combating discrimination and stigma, and enhancing protective factors for mental health. In fact, almost all health promotion topics have a mental health promotion dimension. For this reason it is impossible to isolate a particular annual figure spent on mental health promotion. However, it can be assumed that a significant percentage of the health promotion budget of my Department impacts on mental health.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_732">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_5502">The Children Act 2001, introduces a wide range of innovative measures that will provide a statutory framework for the future development of the juvenile justice system in accordance with modern thinking and best international practice. The Act also amends the Child Care Act 1991 by providing for the detention in special care units of non-offending children with challenging behaviour, establishes the Special Residential Services Board to ensure the efficient and co-ordinated delivery of services to young children in detention, and re-enacts and updates provisions in the Children Act 1908 protecting children from abuse by persons who have the custody, charge or care of them. The Deputy will appreciate that the Children Act is very complex and comprehensive legislation and, for those reasons, provisions under the Act are being implemented on a phased basis, as was envisaged at the time of enactment.</p>
          <p eId="para_5503">Responsibility for implementing the Children Act 2001 lies with three Departments, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science in respect of juvenile offending, and Health and Children in respect of children who are non-offending but out of control. The National Children's Office is co-ordinating the cross-departmental aspects of the implementation of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_5504">The first commencement order under the Act in respect of the Department for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was signed by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 23 April 2002. The position in relation to further commencement is as set out below.</p>
          <p eId="para_5505">The Minister for Health and Children has responsibility for Parts 2, 3 and 11 of the Act. Work is at an advanced stage with a view to introducing these parts later this year. These parts provide a statutory scheme for non-offending children in need of special care or protection to be placed in special care units, in appropriate circumstances as a last resort. Such placements will be on foot of a special care order made by the District Court and for as short a period of time as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_5506">The Minister for Education and Science has responsibility for Part 10 of the Act, which provides for the establishment of children detention schools to replace the existing reformatory and industrial schools. These provisions cannot be commenced until separate detention facilities are provided for 16 and 17 year old girls. A key consideration in commencing the Children Act is the identification of the appropriate number of residential places required under the new arrangements. An independent international expert in residential care was commissioned to review the residential requirements for children detention schools so as to ensure that there are sufficient and appropriate places into the future. The expert report has been referred to the various interests and the views of the Special Residential Services Board have been sought.</p>
          <p eId="para_5507">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility for the remaining parts to be commenced. It is an underlying concept of the Children Act to expand the options a court will have at its disposal when deciding on how to deal with a young offender. These options are an essential feature of the Act, as they will allow effect to be given to the principle that detention for young offenders will be a last resort. Thus, the Act envisages committals to custody of young offenders being availed of only in situations where other diversions and community-based options have been resorted to and have failed.</p>
          <p eId="para_5508">The successful implementation of the community-based options in the Act will require a very significant input from the probation and welfare service. In this context, the probation and welfare service, as part of its planning for implementation of the Children Act 2001, engaged trainers from the Department of Child, Youth and Family in New Zealand for the intensive training of all senior probation and welfare officers as facilitators for family conferences to be convened and managed in accordance with the requirements of the Act as well as providing day seminars for all probation and welfare officers. The service will provide ongoing training through its staff development unit as required.</p>
          <p eId="para_5509">Nine additional probation and welfare officers took up duty in September 2003 and a response to other offers of appointment is awaited. It is the intention that, subject to an adequate number of staff being recruited from this competition and a new competition, which is under way at present, and to the availability of adequate resources for therapeutic or other interventions required, community sanctions provided for in the Act will commence to be implemented in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_5510">Under the Children Act, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be obliged to provide separate detention facilities for 16 and 17 year old boys and girls who are committed to custody by the courts either on remand or under sentence. The provision of appropriate custodial facilities is a priority for the Irish Prison Service. The primary objective of these detention centres will be to provide a secure but supportive environment in which young offenders can develop the personal and social skills necessary to avoid future offending.</p>
          <p eId="para_5511">In line with this, a new facility for male juveniles in this age group will open at St. Patrick's Institution in the near future. This unit, which was designed by a multi-disciplinary team, will include a custom-designed facility for the delivery of education, recreation, medical and therapeutic services. The longer-term provision of a dedicated facility on a greenfield site for 110 juveniles – 90 male and 20 female – is also being considered. Having considered a report by the Commissioners of Public Works and the recommendations made and having conferred with the director general of the Irish Prison Service, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform decided some time ago that the proposed development of such a facility at Newlands Villa, Naas Road, Clondalkin, Dublin 22, would not now proceed. The identification of another site for the proposed juvenile detention facility is now being pursued in consultation with the director general of the Irish Prison Service and the Office of Public Works.</p>

I have contacted the agency about the Luas works on Davitt Road and it has informed me that traffic management arrangements on Davitt Road, making it a one-way system, were introduced to facilitate the first phase of Luas works which focused on the diversion of utilities and the setting back of boundary walls. Notices were published in the national papers and distributed locally at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_5612">Following the completion of the first phase of works and given that the second and final phase, focusing on the laying of track, was to commence imminently it was decided to retain the traffic management measures which were already in place.

          <p eId="para_5617">The information requested by the Deputy is as follows.</p>
          <p eId="para_5618">My Department has two directives outstanding which it has yet to transpose. These directives are:</p>
          <p eId="para_5619">Directive 98/5/EC to facilitate practice of the profession of lawyer on a permanent basis in a member state other than that in which the qualification was obtained; and Directive 2000/43/EC implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin.</p>
          <p eId="para_5620">The position in regard to Directive 98/5/EC is that the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 2002 gave statutory backing to certain aspects of the Directive. That Act also provides for regulations to make provision for the remaining elements. A number of outstanding points need to be pursued with the professional bodies. It is hoped that these issues can be resolved shortly and the necessary regulations can be made in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_5621">Primary legislation will be required to amend the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000 for the purpose of giving effect to the Directive 2000/43/EC. The Government has approved the drafting of an equality Bill, on a priority basis for this purpose and the Bill is listed on the Government's legislation programme with a view to publication in the current session. The Bill will also give effect to Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation and Directive 76/207/EEC on the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards to employment, vocational training, promotion and working conditions which are due for transposition in December 2003 and 2005 respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_5622">The transposition of EU directives forms part of the normal work of my Department and the staffing requirements to deal with this work will be met from within existing resources.</p>

The package of measures under negotiation does not refer to any proposal for privatised prisons. The present focus of the proposals is to ensure continued capacity of publicly managed prisons to deliver an efficient and effective service. The existing cost structure of the prison service is unsustainable, and in the absence of agreement the Government will decide urgently on measures to significantly reduce costs. I very much hope that agreement can be reached very soon, and that the necessary progress can be made on the basis of consensus.</p>

      asked the

      the steps that have been taken to address the root causes of crime; and the steps taken to reduce the number of people in Irish prisons.
      [21379/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_742">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_5632">It is my responsibility as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the responsibility of my Department, to maintain and enhance community security and equality through the development of a range of policies and high quality services which underpin, <i>inter alia,</i> an effective and balanced approach to crime. That balanced approach, in addition to providing the resources and legislative provisions required to enable the Garda Síochána to tackle crime in an effective and focused way, includes support for the development of crime prevention techniques and methods. Funding is provided, for example, to Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch.</p>
          <p eId="para_5633">Addressing the root causes of crime is a multi-dimensional task which of its very nature falls within the areas of responsibility of a number of Departments. A number of risk factors have been identified as being contributory factors to the causes of crime. These include neighbourhood and community factors, socio-economic deprivation measured in part by poor housing and consistent poverty, family background and parenting and individual factors such as lower than average IQ or low self-esteem and academic and school factors.</p>
          <p eId="para_5634">My Department supports and develops evidence-based preventative measures and interventions aimed at young offenders and those most at risk of offending. One of these measures is the Garda youth diversion projects. They are a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative which seeks to divert young persons from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda-community relations.</p>
          <p eId="para_5635">As the Deputy may be aware, recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of these projects, from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present, a process made possible, in part, by funding under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The locations of the new projects were decided upon according to local needs, prioritised by the Garda authorities, in conjunction with my Department. Funding of €5.577 million has been allocated to these and related projects in the current year.</p>
          <p eId="para_5636">The National Crime Council was established in 1999 and its key roles are to focus on crime prevention, with particular emphasis on the underlying causes of crime and to focus on raising public awareness of crime, to examine the "fear of crime" and identify research priorities and undertake in-house research.</p>
          <p eId="para_5637">With regard to reducing the numbers serving prison sentences, under the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act 1983, a court may make a community service order as an alternative to a sentence of imprisonment or detention in respect of any individual over the age of 16 years who has been convicted of a criminal offence and who consents to the order being made. The order requires an offender to perform unpaid work for between 40 and 240 hours, usually to be completed within 12 months. An offender may be rehabilitated through the discipline of having to work in the community and the making of meaningful reparation to that community for his or her crime. The probation and welfare service of my Department supervise those offenders undergoing community service orders.</p>
          <p eId="para_5638">The making of a community service order is a matter entirely for the Judiciary and one in which I have no function. However, the courts already have and do exercise wide discretion in using community service orders in dealing with people over 16 years of age who offend. It is used in practice for all age categories of offenders. Work projects are negotiated by the probation and welfare service with a wide range of community and voluntary agencies, usually resulting from an approach by the agency but, when necessary, arising from an approach to an agency by the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_5639">I would also like to advise the Deputy that the Children Act 2001 introduces a wide range of innovative measures that will provide a statutory framework for the future development of the juvenile justice system in accordance with modern thinking and best international practice. Three Government Departments have a role in implementing the Act, my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science. The National Children's Office has the responsibility of overseeing the implementation of the Act and co-ordinate regular working group meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_5640">It is an underlying concept of the Children Act to expand the options a court will have at its disposal when deciding on how to deal with a young offender. These options are an essential feature of the Act as they will allow effect to be given to the principle that detention for young offenders will be a last resort. Thus, the Act envisages committals to custody of young offenders being availed of only in situations where other alternative diversions and community-based options have been resorted to and have failed.</p>
          <p eId="para_5641">Prisons offer a wide range of services which aim to provide offenders with the means to avoid becoming reinvolved in crime following their return to the community. The services provided include work skills, training and education and are matched, where possible, to individual aptitudes and abilities, sometimes unrecognised or untapped prior to imprisonment. A comprehensive package of medical, psychological and other support services is available to assist those suffering from particular problems such as drug addiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_5642">The Irish Prison Service has established a new regimes directorate, composed of a multidisciplinary team of staff. The formation of this new directorate is facilitating the adoption of a multi-faceted approach to helping prisoners, both juvenile and adult, to develop their sense of responsibility and encouraging those attitudes and skills which will assist them to return to society with the best chance of leading law-abiding and self-supporting lives after release.</p>

          <p eId="para_5653">The missing persons bureau in Garda Headquarters is responsible for data relating to missing persons. When a person is reported missing, the local Garda district officer takes direct responsibility for the investigation and will appoint an investigation team to include any specialised unit deemed necessary such as, for example, the national bureau of criminal investigation or the technical bureau. The services of other agencies such as Interpol and Europol are also available to assist in the investigation. In addition, every district has a specially trained search team which is familiar with the locality.</p>
          <p eId="para_5654">I am further informed by the Garda authorities that every effort is made to locate all missing persons and that the current procedures for dealing with missing persons are considered adequate at present. Their view is that while specialist units prove extremely useful in investigating certain types of crime, the nature of missing persons cases requires specific local knowledge both about the area and the circumstances of the person who is missing. All files on missing persons remain open and under continuous review until the person is located, or, in the case of a missing person who is presumed drowned, a verdict to that effect by the coroner.</p>
          <p eId="para_5655">The Deputy may be aware that the missing persons helpline has been operating since October 2002. This is a dedicated helpline operated by Victim Support as a counselling and referral service and as a primary point of contact for the families of missing persons. The helpline provides advice and psychological support for families of missing persons as well as structured liaison with the Garda Síochána. A total of €65,000 was made available to it by my Department in 2002 and a further €45,000 in 2003. I have also been informed that the Garda authorities will enter into discussions with John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, with a view to exploring the possibility of agreeing exchanges of personnel with missing persons expertise.</p>

The position is that the efforts of the Prison Service to control costs in prisons are currently very much focused on reaching agreement with the Prison Officers Association on a range of measures designed to significantly enhance the operational efficiency of prisons. Negotiations on this are at a critical stage, and I hope and believe that agreement can be reached. I have made clear, however, that, in the absence of agreement, immediate and potentially significant measures will be required to bring costs under control.

To date 118 parties, accounting for 44.2% of 1990 developed country CO² emissions, have ratified or acceded to the protocol. As the US has stated that it will not ratify it, entry into force can now only be triggered through ratification by the Russian Federation.</p>
          <p eId="para_5665">EU international policy on climate change is determined through close co-ordination between all member states and the European Commission and a common EU position is presented externally. Negotiations with other parties are generally conducted by the Troika, comprising the EU Presidency, the incoming Presidency and the Commission. The Government, primarily through my Department, is working within the EU and the Troika system to encourage the Russian Federation to progress its ratification to ensure the protocol enters into force at the earliest possible date. The EU has made specific calls on the Russian Federation to expedite its ratification and meetings have taken place between EU and Russian representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_5666">I will continue to work within the EU framework to encourage Russian ratification before and during Ireland's Presidency in 2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_5668">There are currently five outstanding directives in my department's area of responsibility for which formal transposition has yet to be made. These are No. 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms, No. 2001/80/EC on limitation of emissions of certain pollutants from large combustion plants, No. 2001/81/EC on national emissions ceiling for certain pollutants, No. 2003/17/EC amending Directive 98/70/EC on quality of petrol and diesel fuels, No. 2002/3/EC on ozone in ambient air.</p>

          <p eId="para_5680">No application has been received from the council. Recently it passed a motion calling on my Department to release funding to it to continue with its central heating programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_5681">The position regarding the funding of the provision of central heating is as follows: the management, maintenance and improvement of their rented dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is in principle, the responsibility of local authorities to be financed from their own resources; and where capital funding is provided under remedial or regeneration schemes operated by my Department for the upgrading of local authority dwellings, the provision of central heating may form part of the work undertaken.</p>
          <p eId="para_5682">To date such funding has been provided for the council under the following schemes: the remedial works scheme which assists local authorities in carrying out major essential works to dwellings in designated estates; the special area regeneration programme which consists of a once-off programme of upgrading high density older flat complexes; and the redevelopment of a number of seriously rundown flat complexes involving a mix of new buildings, refurbishment and, where appropriate, demolition and replacement.</p>
          <p eId="para_5683">To date my Department has provided some €391 million for the above schemes, including over €160 million for the major programme of regeneration of Ballymun. In addition, the council has been undertaking a programme, funded from its own resources, to provide central heating in its older housing stock. My Department has approved borrowing totalling €12.861 million by the council for this purpose. At present it is finalising a survey of its stock to establish the number of houses remaining without central heating. The timescale for the completion of this programme is a matter for the council.</p>
          <p eId="para_5684">Local authorities may also seek my Department's approval to use their internal capital receipts which are surplus to the requirements of the local authority housing construction and remedial works programmes for the provision of central heating in their rented housing stock.</p>
          <p eId="para_5685">Apart from the foregoing, there is no specific funding mechanism available from my Department for the installation of central heating in local authority rented dwellings. The council has been advised to this effect on a number of occasions.</p>

Such proposals fall to be considered under the young people's facilities and services fund, YPFSF, the community development programme, CDP, and funding for local drugs task forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_5713">In the case of proposals relevant to the YPFSF, proposals submitted under the RAPID plans will be considered in the context of decisions to be made under round II and in light of the overall funding position for 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_5714">A number of proposals in RAPID plans relate to the community development programme, CDP. Allocations of funding to six new community development projects in RAPID areas were announced earlier this year. Projects in Bluebell, Dolphin House, Inchicore, Merchants Quay/Ushers Quay, Longford Town and Tipperary each received a renewable one year contract for funding of €60,000. In addition, in 2001 core funding was provided under the CDP to St. Munchin's CDP – £100,000, or €127,000, was provided to the building project and €25,000 was paid to St. Munchin's in 2002 towards equipping the centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_5715">An amount of €1 million was also allocated under the premises initiative to a local drugs task force project in Tallaght.</p>
          <p eId="para_5716">In addition, the Deputy should note that since the establishment of the RAPID programme, my Department has provided approximately €3 million by way of support to the local areas in the preparation and implementation of their plans and administration costs associated with the support team in ADM.</p>

          <p eId="para_5719">I refer the Deputy to earlier replies regarding the review of community and local development structures and, in particular, to my reply to Questions Nos. 108, 116, 126, 137, 139 and 141 of 26 March 2003. As mentioned in that reply, strengthening the democratic accountability of agencies and service providers in this area is one of the key principles governing the review. Consistent with this principle and referred to in the earlier reply is the requirement that local and community development bodies have their annual action plans endorsed by county/city development boards (CDBs). The review process is still on-going and my ministerial colleagues and I intend to bring proposals for change to Government before the end of the year.</p>

        </question>
        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_764">
          <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
          <p eId="para_5729">I propose to take Questions Nos. 324 to 331, inclusive, and Question No. 333 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_5730">My Department is committed to maintaining the maximum number of people in rural areas and to strengthening rural communities economically, socially and culturally. As pointed out in the national spatial strategy, in many rural areas the combination of high dependency on a changing agricultural base, a scarcity of employment opportunities and resultant out-migration has weakened demographic, economic, social and physical structures. In my statement welcoming the publication of the spatial strategy last November, I said it set down clear markers for the way ahead in rural development. The strategy addresses many of my concerns in relation to such issues as rural housing, services and cultural identity.</p>
          <p eId="para_5731">Government policy on rural development is set out in the White Paper published in 1999. The policy agenda is a broad one, involving the remit of many of my colleagues in Government and their related agencies. It covers such issues as agriculture, infrastructure, transport, environment, health and education and the challenge is to ensure coherence in pursuing our rural development objectives. For example, in the recent CAP reform negotiations, my colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, generally achieved Ireland's objectives. We have a balanced outcome that will reshape the Common Agricultural Policy and secure its future while making it more relevant to modern society. The reform of CAP will safeguard the rural economy and environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_5732">In the case of my own Department, the Leader+ programme is an EU initiative designed to encourage the implementation of integrated, high-quality and innovative strategies in rural communities. The initiative is delivered by 22 local action groups. The allocation for Leader+ for the period 2000 to 2006 is €73.6 million and the initiative is co-funded by the EU. The national rural development programme closely complements the Leader+ initiative but focuses more on mainstream activities, primarily rural and agricultural tourism. It is operated by 13 local groups. Again, an element of innovation is required for all activities funded. The allocation for 2000 to 2006 is €75.7 million, again co-funded by the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_5733">Leader groups are required to include a balanced and representative selection of partners drawn from the different socio-economic sectors in the area of operation. At decision-making level, the economic and social partners and associations must make up at least 50% of the local partnership. The board must be tri-partite in structure comprising representatives of the local community and development associations, private sector business interests and the local state agencies, including county council representatives. All community and development associations must be registered with the county development boards. The composition of local action group boards must include community and development group representation of at least 25%. I am satisfied that this provides a key opportunity for rural communities to participate effectively in decision making processes relevant to the development of their areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_5734">I introduced the CLÁR programme in October 2001 to address depopulation as well as the decline and lack of services in rural areas. Areas in 18 counties have been selected under this programme including areas I announced last January in honouring the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to review the areas in light of the 2002 population census results. These areas suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 2002 with an average population loss of 50%. The exception is the Cooley Peninsula, which was included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused there by foot and mouth disease. The measures introduced under the programme reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas that I consulted at the outset. These measures support physical, community and social infrastructure through a variety of measures such as electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village enhancement, health and sports projects. They are, for the most part, operated in tandem with the lead Departments or public utilities, as appropriate, thus ensuring efficiency and effectiveness as well as meeting the needs of the people in the CLÁR areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_5735">I am also interested in assessing the effects of placing development workers in rural communities as a method of expediting rural development and reducing poverty. For this purpose, I announced funding in May 2002 for four pilot which are aimed at testing the success of development workers in regenerating particularly disadvantaged rural areas. These projects are operating through a variety of community-based initiatives. They are intended to help reduce rural deprivation in the long-term at a low cost to the State by creating sustainable development. The initiative is being supported from the rural development fund of my Department. The purpose of the fund is to finance research, evaluation and pilot actions to provide information and advice for policy makers on important rural development issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_5736">Last week I announced that Fitzpatrick Associates, economic consultants, have been appointed to carry out a review of enterprise support in rural areas. This review will analyse official enterprise support, including tourism enterprise, already available in rural areas. The greater Dublin area, gateways, hubs and their areas of influence will be excluded from the analysis to ensure that the focus remains on regions which have not benefited from urban-generated economic growth. The way in which existing supports are delivered will be examined with particular regard to EU state aid law, the national spatial strategy and exchequer financial constraints. Also to be reviewed is the number and roles of agencies needed to optimise enterprise development in rural areas and yet avoid unnecessary duplication.</p>
          <p eId="para_5737">In addition, my Department funds the western development commission, whose functions include promoting, fostering and encouraging economic and social development in the western region and the operation of the western investment fund. Activities include policy analysis and development which feed in turn into policy development and planning in my Department. At my request, the commission is developing a strategy for towns on radial routes in its region to maximise the benefits of the national spatial strategy, major roads investment, the strategic rail review and decentralisation. My Department also supports the Gaeltacht areas through a range of measures aimed at the promotion of sustainable and culturally vibrant communities and the maintenance and strengthening of the use of the Irish language. Last year for example capital grants exceeding €16.5 million from my Department were approved for the improvement of Gaeltacht infrastructure, including roads, marine works, village renewal and various recreational facilities such as community centres, playing fields and other such amenities. A further €4.7 million was expended by my Department in 2002 under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts in order to further improve the housing stock in the Gaeltacht. My Department continues to support Gaeltacht households which provide suitable accommodation for learners of Irish who attend Irish language summer colleges. My Department also provided €1.5 million last year for various organisations working in the Gaeltacht to maintain and strengthen the Irish language and culture there.</p>
          <p eId="para_5738">Údaras na Gaeltachta, which, as the Deputy is aware, discharges its responsibilities through a range of socio-economic activities in the Gaeltacht, received a total of €42.9 million from my Department last year to allow it to continue with the development of the Gaeltacht economy and the preservation of the Irish language. In terms of advancing rural development generally both at EU and national level, the Deputy can be assured that my Department and I are availing of a range of opportunities through EU conferences, the rural development forum, etc., to advance the policy options necessary to meet changing rural agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_5739">In summary, my Department is unstinting in seeking to advance measures to support rural development through the provision of community focused schemes which deliver tangible benefits to thousands across towns, villages and countryside, policy research and related measures and critical innovations in support of enterprise and infrastructure in rural Ireland.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_766">
          <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
          <p eId="para_5745">As the Deputy is aware, the Official Languages Act 2003 is the first piece of legislation to provide a statutory framework for the delivery of public services through the Irish Language. The provisions of the Act, the primary objective of which is to ensure better availability and a higher standard of public services through Irish, include publication of Acts of the Oireachtas in Irish and English simultaneously; use of Irish on oral advertisements, whether they be live or recorded, on stationery, on signage and on notices. The Act includes provision for the publication of certain documents of public interest in each of the official languages simultaneously, for example annual reports, and places a duty on public bodies to ensure that they reply to correspondence – in writing or by electronic mail – in the language in which that correspondence was written. Also, any communication providing information to the public – in writing or by electronic mail – will be in the Irish language only or in the Irish and English languages. There is a requirement that an adequate number of staff are competent in the Irish language, the particular linguistic requirements associated with the provision of services in Gaeltacht areas are met, and that the Irish language shall become the working language of public offices situated in the Gaeltacht areas, within a certain time-frame to be agreed between the public bodies concerned and the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_5746">Clearly, full implementation of the Act will require us to draw on the language competences of significant numbers of people across both the public and private sectors. It was in this context that reference was made to an estimate of up to 2,000 such persons. I did not, at any time, indicate that an additional 2,000 jobs will be created in the public sector as a consequence of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_5747">The public service in Ireland has a total staff complement of approximately 276,000 people. Additional to this, there will be requirements under the Act on other bodies, as specified in the schedules to the Act. A complement of 2,000 people with a competence in Irish, as referred to above, would represent less than 1% of the public service. It may be anticipated that employment will also be created in training, translating, etc., outside the public service.</p>

          <p eId="para_5749">A person may qualify for payment of a back to school clothing and footwear allowance if he-she is in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment or is participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course, where a child dependent allowance is being paid in respect of the child and where the household income is at or below a specified level. For a lone parent with one child the income limit is €227.40 per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_5750">Income from family income supplement, FIS is not reckonable for BSCFA purposes and accordingly people are not refused payment on the basis of income from FIS. In the particular case referred to by the Deputy, the person has earnings from employment assessed by the health board at €343.88. This is in excess of the applicable income limit and accordingly the person does not qualify for the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_5751">The information sought by the Deputy, regarding the percentage of those in receipt of FIS who applied for BSCFA in 2002 and were refused, is not available.</p>

          <p eId="para_5759">There are currently 44 of my Department's regional staff serving on RAPID local area implementation teams throughout the country and an additional ten staff represent my Department on the RAPID monitoring committee. My Department is also represented on the RAPID national monitoring committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_5760">Although their engagement with the RAPID process does not constitute their primary duty, it is, nevertheless, a key component and valued aspect of the work of the staff concerned and demonstrates my Department's commitment to the success of the RAPID process.</p>

      <b>Ms Shortall</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
      if she will make amendments to the Social Welfare Act to respond to a situation (details supplied); the reasons that long-term disability benefit in the case of a person (details supplied) that has been in receipt of a payment for over a year is not considered a qualifying payment in respect of the household benefit package; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_5762">Under the rules for entitlement to the household benefits package of allowances, an applicant must either be residing alone or only with certain categories of excepted persons. The person concerned is residing with his sister, who is in receipt of disability benefit and does not qualify as an excepted person. She would only do so in the event that she was medically certified as being so incapacitated as to require constant care and attention in her own right on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_5763">On foot of the Deputy's question my Department has issued a medical assessment form to the person concerned in respect of his sister. On receipt of the completed form his entitlement will be reviewed and he will be informed of the outcome as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_5764">To make long-term disability benefit a qualifying entitlement for the household benefits package generally would have significant cost implications for the scheme and could only be considered in a budgetary context. There are no plans at present for such an extension to this scheme.</p>
