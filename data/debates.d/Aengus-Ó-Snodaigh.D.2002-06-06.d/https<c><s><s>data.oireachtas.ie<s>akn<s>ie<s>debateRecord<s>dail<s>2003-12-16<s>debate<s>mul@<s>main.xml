          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_5">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">The total allocation for my Department for 2004 is €35.254 million, of which €18.588 million is for administration and €16.616 million is for other services. Details of the Estimates are set out in the Abridged Estimates for Public Services, which were presented to the Dáil on 13 November. I look forward to addressing specific issues relating to the Estimates provisions when they are considered in the usual way by the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service. I also look forward to responding to questions which Deputies may wish to table separately on specific aspects of the work of my Department.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny:</from>
          <p eId="para_7">The country will face another referendum on the future of Europe possibly in 2005. Is the Taoiseach happy with the allocation given to the National Forum on Europe? I am sure we have all learned lessons from the first Nice referendum campaign when inadequate information resulted in the public not supporting the treaty because of confusion about the issues involved. Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the allocation for 2004, which is included in his Department's Vote, will be sufficient to ensure a proper presentation of the many difficult European issues? This places the Taoiseach in a challenging position for the next six months.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_8">I agree with Deputy Kenny that the National Forum on Europe is important and that it is one of the ways in which information can be disseminated to help the people to understand the issues. There is an increase of 25% in the provision to the National Forum on Europe. In line with the desirability to continue to have a forum in which to discuss matters relating to the future of Europe and to bring them to the attention of the public, especially in light of the ongoing Intergovernmental Conference, our Presidency of the European Union and, ultimately, a referendum on the constitutional treaty, the Estimate includes €1.15 million to provide for the ongoing work of the forum. This increase reflects the expected increased levels of activity. Javier Solana will be here early in January to begin the activities for 2004. I am satisfied that we have the resources to keep us going at the current high level.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">As we come to the end of this year, it is worth recalling the excellent range of speakers from across Europe and from the senior ranks of the Commission who have been here. I hope we can continue that in 2004.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. Sargent:</from>
          <p eId="para_10">There are some interesting aspects to the Estimates for the Department of the Taoiseach. The incidental expenses have increased by 28%. Perhaps the Taoiseach could outline the nature of those expenses. As regards the money for tribunals of inquiry, this is taxpayer's money which would not be foreseen as being necessary in a perfect world. However, while there has been no increase for the tribunal into the Dunne payments, there has been a 182% increase for the tribunal into payments to Mr. Haughey and Mr. Lowry. Perhaps the Taoiseach could indicate why there has been such a significant increase in that case.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">Deputy Kenny referred to the National Forum on Europe. There is a contrast between it and the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation which does not get an increase. Is money being withheld from the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and, if so, is that an indication that there are other ways to remedy the logjam in Northern Ireland which do not involve the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation?</p>

          <p eId="para_12">On incidental expenses, this subhead provides for a number of services, including training, official and State entertainment, the Library, the Government Information Service and other miscellaneous services. The 2003 provision for this subhead was subject to a considerable reduction of €973,000 compared with €1.311 million in 2002. Greater efficiencies were achieved in the subhead during the year. The 2004 provision is set at a more realistic level given the commitments in a number of areas, including training commitments under Sustaining Progress. This provision shows a reduction on the 2002 provision, demonstrating better value for money, despite additional commitments arising which will have to be met from this subhead, for example, the dual language publication requirements. As always, my Department makes every effort to ensure best value for money in the procurement of goods and services consistent with maintaining the quality and range of services it provides. There is an increase of 27% to 28% in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">The increase of 182% is for the Moriarty tribunal. The allocation is to provide for the ongoing legal and administrative costs of the tribunal. This provision relates to the annual running costs of the tribunal for next year. Based on the 2003 cost, this should be approximately €3.8 million. The provision also relates to the costs which are expected to arise next year should the tribunal complete its work. These costs include report publication and an element of legal costs. The provision of €6.66 million is only an estimate of what some of those costs, and hopefully all of them, will be. No provision for this element was included this year and that is the reason for the increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">The third question was about the resources for the forum next year. We need to keep that going. We hope we will be able to renew discussions and the political activities of the Assembly and the other institutions. For that reason we have not put in any additional costings for the forum.</p>

          <p eId="para_15">A significant element of the budget for the Taoiseach's Department is for the Moriarty tribunal. The allocation for 2004 is €10.3 million. Does the Taoiseach believe the Moriarty tribunal will come to a conclusion in 2004, as speculated in his last response? Can he confirm that closure in that instance can be reached in the next 12 months?</p>
          <p eId="para_16">I have asked the Taoiseach previously about the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission on the provision of legal fees for legal costs and expenses. Does he agree that a new system needs to be devised that takes into account the fact that these counsel are employed for a significant period of several months and, in some instances, many years and that the current formula for calculation is based on normal case representation which invariably lasts only days or weeks? The formula currently used is unsuitable, costly and a major drain on the public finances. Does the Taoiseach have proposals to address this major deficiency in the arrangement and is legislation to do that being considered?</p>

          <p eId="para_17">The Deputy asked if I am sure that the tribunal will complete its work next year. I am not sure but it was thought prudent to do this in the Department. We had thought it would finish this year but the tribunal moved into extensive examinations of other areas. It is prudent to make provision for 2004 but I cannot be certain that it will conclude. However, it is realistic to speculate that it might and that is the reason for the provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">I agree with Deputy Ó Caoláin's comments on the other issue. Over €100 million has been spent on these tribunals in recent years. When tribunals are due to sit for a long period of time, counsel costs should be more realistic. In the proposals he announced earlier this year, and in the legislation before the House on the investigations of tribunals, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform proposes to make enormous changes in this area. There will be far more budgetary control and more controlled costs for counsel opinion. That is how the Government would like to operate in the future.</p>

What are the deficiencies within his Department that he cannot avail of the expertise of the Civil Service in this regard? Where in the Estimate has he hidden the allocation for the media monitoring unit? Perhaps he will explain where the cost of the unit is designated, how much will be allocated for 2004 and whether it is an increase or decrease on 2003?</p>

          <p eId="para_22">On consultancy costs in my Department, there has been a 33% decrease in the provision for consultancy services next year. My Department has done a great deal of work in recent years in implementing modernisation reforms, including the implementation of new systems under the management information framework and human resource management systems. These items have accounted for most of the consultancy costs over the past two to three years. Given the full implementation of these systems, and with due regard to the need to minimise consultancy costs, only a limited number of projects which will require the expertise of external consultants have been identified, thereby accounting for the reduced provision in the subhead. Normally consultants from my Department are used. Generally costs are involved where there is no expertise or where IT services or some other function needs to be carried out to try to improve our services and resource capability. That is the position for this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">A few weeks ago, I gave a detailed answer to a question from Deputy Kenny on media monitoring, including details on staff provisions.

          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_47">I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 18, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">I held a series of meetings on 4 December with delegations from Sinn Féin, led by Mr. Gerry Adams, and the SDLP, led by Mr. Mark Durkan, and with the US ambassador, Mr. Richard Haass, who had also visited Belfast and met representatives of the parties. Our priority is to secure a sustainable basis on which the Assembly can be restored and the Executive quickly established and we will be continuing our intensive engagement with the parties in the period ahead. I thank Ambassador Haass for his valuable and deep engagement with the process since his appointment and wish him well in his new role.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">I met the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, at the British-Irish Council in Cardiff on 28 November. We remain committed to consolidating peace and keeping the political process moving forward. We made this clear in our joint statement afterwards. The DUP electoral strategy was built on a message that it would be responsible and constructive and would secure an agreement that both Unionists and Nationalists could support. The UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Paul Murphy, met representatives of the DUP on 1 December. After the meeting, the party publicly stated its intention to be constructive. It also conveyed that message to Ambassador Haass. We welcome its positive engagement and would be happy to meet representatives of the party in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">The vast majority of people in Northern Ireland want devolved government and there is an onus on everyone to bring this about. I do not imagine any of the parties are against considering how the Agreement has operated, which is why we are to have a scheduled four year review. I have indicated a willingness to listen to the views of all parties on how the Agreement has operated and to consider changes in its workings where such changes secure consensus support. Both Governments have made it clear that this is not a review of the fundamentals of the Agreement. There can be no change to these which include the principle of inclusion. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Secretary of State, Mr. Murphy, have written to the parties asking for their views on issues arising in the context of the review. The review proper will probably begin in early January.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">The British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and I will meet in London tomorrow to review the prospects for progress in the light of our recent contacts. We will also avail of this occasion to meet the Northern Ireland parties. The British Prime Minister met the DUP in London earlier today. We need to bear in mind that the current impasse essentially revolves around the operation of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland. The matters encompassed by the Agreement are far wider than devolution. It embraces a broad agenda of change, including in the areas of policing, criminal justice, human rights and equality. These provisions of the Agreement, reasserted in the Joint Declaration, remain the agenda for both Governments and we will continue to insist that they are implemented. I acknowledge that there has been important progress, but there are issues, specifically the matter of weapons decommissioning, that remain to be resolved. The sooner this can be done, the better the prospects of resolving the impasse.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">Until devolved government is re-established, the two Governments must drive and manage the issues, including through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, BIIGC. I expect the BIIGC, which is chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State, Mr. Murphy, to meet again early in the new year. We are also committed to ensuring the North-South arrangements continue to function in a satisfactory manner. No matter what the outcome of the election, it was always going to take some time to sort things out. It may take a little longer now and there are no guarantees, but we are committed to this process and to making it a success.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">On 28 November, together with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, the Scottish Deputy First Minister, Mr. Jim Wallace, and the Isle of Man Chief Government Minister, Mr. Richard Corkill, I attended the fifth British-Irish Council summit in Wales, hosted by the Welsh First Minister, Mr. Rhodri Morgan. Deputy Laurie Morgan represented Guernsey and Senator Frank Walker represented Jersey. The main focus of the meeting was indigenous, minority and lesser used languages. The council noted the rich linguistic inheritance possessed by all British-Irish Council members and reiterated the commitment on the part of members to support and promote their respective indigenous, minority and lesser used languages. In addition, the council was updated on work being undertaken in other areas.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">The DUP delegation met Prime Minister Blair this morning and the Taoiseach is to meet with him tomorrow. Does the Taoiseach expect to be briefed by the Prime Minister on the outcome of his discussions with the DUP this morning? Has the Taoiseach made arrangements to meet with the parties from Northern Ireland, the pro-Agreement parties and the anti-Agreement parties?</p>
          <p eId="para_55">What is the position of the Irish Government in so far as any changes to the Agreement might be concerned? It has been reported that the Government would support a weighted majority in terms of changes to the Agreement, that is, 60% of the members of the Assembly, including 40% of Nationalists and Unionists. Is that the position of the Government? Is that the basis on which the Taoiseach expects to discuss changes to the Agreement? As one member of the DUP delegation said, one person's changes is another person's renegotiation. I take the Taoiseach's view that what is not required is a renegotiation but a discussion on how it might be moved forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">Given that the Barron report, published last week, was critical of the extent of co-operation with the inquiry into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and given that the report has been referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, will the Taoiseach raise at his meeting with the British Prime Minister tomorrow the matter of non co-operation by the British Government in order that the committee, in whatever deliberations it undertakes, should be able to move the matter forward?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_57">The Deputy has raised a number of questions. I have already been briefed on the British Prime Minister's meeting with the DUP delegation this morning. We will have an opportunity tomorow to meet the other parties to assess the progress we will make and to work out the programme. I understand the meeting this morning was cordial and useful and the ground covered was that covered at a previous meeting with the Secretary of State, Mr. Murphy, on 1 December.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">In regard to the fundamentals of the Agreement, we have made it clear we do not believe any renegotiation should take place other than a review and that review obviously will not affect the fundamentals of the Agreement. I have not exhausted the issues we consider to be fundamental but I have said I do not want any changes to the institutional structure of the Agreement, including the North-South bodies, in particular, and the arrangements in place for them. The idea of devolved inclusive Government on a cross-community basis is an issue that cannot be renegotiated. The rights and principles enshrined in the Agreement, the areas of human rights and equality and that broad agenda we had worked on, and particularly the substantive document that came out of Weston Park, are issues we cannot go back on. It would obviously include a commitment to exclusively peaceful and democratic means because that is the basis on which we can proceed. There will be other areas but I refer to those by way of illustration.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">On one occasion, the Alliance Party, by re-engaging its structures, saved the institutions at a particular level. Since then the Alliance Party has asked for the question of the weighting of votes to be examined and that a review of the area be carried out. Various suggestions and proposals were made at the time. That will come up in the review, for the Alliance Party if not for others, but it is not an easy area to resolve.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">In all these issues it is for the parties to respond to the letter of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and to make their views known. We will then see how we can go forward. I do not wish to be prescriptive regarding discussions. On previous occasions I said what could be done regarding redesignation, but the Alliance Party has said it will not redesignate again, so I do not imagine that issue will arise. However, it must be examined and I have no doubt it and other issues will come up in the discussions.</p>

We have received the co-operation we are going to get on this phase of the Barron report and no issues remain. Following its work, the joint committee may come back with recommendations for further efforts. The efforts the Government has made with various Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland and through raising the matter with the Prime Minister have gained all available information. I take the Prime Minster's word that any information available to him or to the Northern Ireland Office has been given. The issue of records held by MI5 and whether they ever existed is beyond the Prime Minister. The inquiry tried to get what security records it could. It got what it was given and I did not imagine any others were going to be given over. My belief is that they never will be.</p>

In that regard, does he acknowledge that there would be merit in hosting bilateral meetings with the parties in the House, as the Northern Ireland parties that are members of the forum already have bilateral meetings such as those he referred to in his earlier reply?

          <p eId="para_71">The House has asked the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to consider the Barron report and to report back within three months. It would not be helpful for the work of the committee if there were to be a debate before it reports. We should leave it to the committee for now. There were several remarks outside the House about why we gave the report to the committee. That was part of the agreement worked out here on an all-party basis in 1999 and there are legal issues attached to this. That is why the House did this, it was not done off the top of the head. The House dealt with it in a procedural way as it had agreed to do. The House is entitled to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">The Irish language has been discussed and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, has continued to pursue initiatives on how the Irish language will be handled on an EU basis.

Is he aware that there is growing concern at the delay in the publication of the Cory report which was presented to both Governments last September and that now, following a three-month delay, there is concern on the part of the families of the victims and the bereaved, specifically the Finucane family? Will the Government be publishing that section of the Cory report as presented to the Dublin Government? Has the Taoiseach urged, or will he be urging, the British Government to publish the section presented to it? Does he have both sections of the Cory report? In the event of the British Government not proceeding to publish, would the Taoiseach, recognising not only the domestic but the international call for the publication of the Cory report in full, undertake to publish it in full? It has been reported that Cory calls for a sworn public inquiry into the Finucane case. Can the Taoiseach confirm if that is what the Cory report states?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_76">At Weston Park both Governments recognised that certain cases from the past remain a source of grave public concern, particularly those giving rise to serious allegations of collusion. We spent much time in the run-up to the meeting in Weston Park discussing those issues and the various cases and the Governments committed themselves in the event of Judge Cory recommending a public inquiry in any case, to implementing that recommendation. That is our understanding of what happened at that stage. We spent a long time searching the world for an independent senior figure to undertake these inquiries. Judge Cory is a highly respected former Canadian Supreme Court judge who has international experience. A long search was conducted in various parts of the world to find somebody of his standing.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">We agreed the cases that were to be examined, following which Judge Cory set about his work. The two reports submitted to the Irish Government will be published shortly. I hope it will be possible to finalise matters and to publish those reports this week. That is what I am endeavouring to do. The Government will proceed with the implementation of Judge Cory's recommendations as outlined in his reports. We will have to deal with those matters and we will make a statement on how we will do that when we release the reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">I also understand that four reports on the cases of Pat Finucane, Rosemary Nelson, Robert Hamill and Billy Wright were submitted to the British Government, which have not been seen by the Irish Government. They may not be published at the same time. I will ask about them again tomorrow afternoon. We would welcome their publication at the earliest opportunity, but in the meantime we intend to proceed with the publication of the two reports which Judge Cory submitted to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">There has not been a delay in this regard, as there was consultation with Judge Cory on the reports. He prepared the draft reports, checked them with both Governments and had follow-up discussions with both Governments. He did not change them but had such discussions in respect of substantive references and other legal issues. We have just completed that process. We moved on the process as quickly as we possibly could.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">I said that I believed both Governments should move together on this because we had agreed to it together in Weston Park. There was never an agreement that we would not move without the British Government. I was trying to help the position by trying to get it to move on this as well.</p>

I have made the British Government aware of my intentions.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">When I met Geraldine Finucane and her family in September, I stated the Irish Government's position was that an independent public inquiry was the only way to uncover the truth about all the circumstances surrounding the murder, and I still hold that view. Judge Cory has now reported but I have not seen his recommendation. However, I believe it is important that the Governments stand by the commitments made at Weston Park, and I intend to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">With regard to the general political situation in Northern Ireland, does the Taoiseach agree that the purpose of the Good Friday Agreement was to create political structures that would have majority support in both communities but, for whatever reason, that support has slipped away, specifically in the Unionist community? Does he therefore agree that there is an obligation on both Governments and all parties to consider measures that might restore that support? If so, would he indicate whether the Government has considered any measures to this end and whether he considers specific measures could be taken by the republican movement to attempt to rebuild that support in the Unionist community?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_40">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_85">We have to continue to work to win support. The Deputy's analysis of that is correct. We have to win such support from every side – loyalists, Unionists, republicans and Nationalists – to try to maintain support for the Agreement. In the election, it was argued on the Unionist side that there was a fall in support for it and perhaps some of their supporters did not vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">As I said previously, it would have given a boost and encouragement if we had been able to finish the work in which we were engaged and if the work of the Joint Declaration and the other matters had moved on. If the report given by General John de Chastelain of what was a significant and the largest yet decommissioning by the IRA had been able to feed into the process in a more constructive way, that could have given support for it a lift, but that was not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">We must now confront a number of issues. On Thursday next, this House will debate the Independent Monitoring Commission Bill 2003, which deals with the International Monitoring Commission to which the Government signed up on 25 November last. The members were appointed on 4 September, Joseph Brosnan being the Irish nominee, Lord Alderdice and John Grieve the British nominees and Richard Kerr the US nominee. The commission has started its work. It visited Dublin and met me and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. The British legislation in that area is now passed. The Irish legislation will be passed in the Dáil, having gone through the Seanad last week. That will help because it is the Government's assessment that without the mechanism of the Independent Monitoring Commission, it will not be possible to generate the confidence of which Deputy Kenny speaks, the confidence necessary to achieve the required outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">The commission will monitor and report on the carrying out of the commitments on the ending of paramilitary activity, including military attacks, training, targeting, intelligence gathering, acquisition and development of arms or weapons, other preparations for terrorist campaigns, punishment beatings, attacks and involvement in riots. The commission's report will assist in all of that being consigned to the past, and in an international verification that it is so consigned. The commission will also monitor and report on the programme of security normalisation to be implemented in the context of the definitive transition to exclusively peaceful and democratic means. Should the British Government request details in advance of the programme being announced, the commission may report on security normalisation that has taken place to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">This matter will be discussed at the next meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in January. Hopefully the Northern Ireland Assembly can be re-established early in the new year. The commission will also have a more general responsibility to consider claims by any party in the Assembly that another party is in breach of fundamental requirements in the Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">The establishment of the International Monitoring Commission was not the Government's recommendation or suggestion, but it should help to fulfil the objectives mentioned by Deputy Kenny, namely, to breed confidence and support. All the other matters in the Joint Declaration of last April on a range of issues should be advanced. We have some responsibilities in this area, though the British Government has the lion's share of responsibility. We think we should get on with the implementation of those issues in the early months of 2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_91">I wish to raise a matter which has not been raised before. Last Thursday I visited the Shankill area of Belfast with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and Deputy McManus. Some 500 houses in that area are abandoned, derelict and burned out. The people who lived there, some of them former UDA commanders, now understand that the road to progress is the road of peace. They showed us a street where six suicides took place within a 200-yard stretch. These people's political representatives do not meet them and they are grateful for the efforts being made by the Minister for Education and Science and the Irish Government to provide the incentive for such meetings. Will the Taoiseach raise this matter with the British Prime Minister and members of the political parties in Northern Ireland when he meets them in the course of the discussions on a review of the Agreement? In view of the work now being done by those political parties, that must be encouraged.</p>

I continue to engage with them. I agree with and encourage dialogue with the political parties in Northern Ireland. It is helpful. I am aware that sectarian attacks on Nationalists have increased of late. The more engagement and control there is, no matter from where it comes, the better. It will help eliminate these problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">This Government pressed very hard last year to relay the concerns of people such as those mentioned by Deputy Kenny directly to the British Government regarding the need for renewal and refurbishing of many of these people's communities. Such renewal is badly needed and we will continue to press the matter.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey):</from>
          <p eId="para_95">Ensuring the protection, health and welfare of children in schools is a key concern for parents, schools and society generally. At present, the central vetting unit run by the Garda Síochána processes requests for clearance from the Department regarding bus escorts and special needs assistants provided to children with disabilities or other special educational needs. However, other employees and volunteers in the education sector are not covered. My Department is actively involved in progressing work in this important area.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">As the Deputy will be aware, a joint working group on child protection was established by the North-South Ministerial Council, composed of officials from my Department and the Department of Education, Northern Ireland. The council accepted the broad approach taken in that report and signalled its desire to have detailed proposals for legislation prepared. The main thrust of the proposals is to provide structures through which people who are a risk to the safety of children can be prevented from being employed in schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">The proposed legislation would comprise: the establishment on a statutory basis of a register for persons who are considered unsafe to work with children; a framework for co-operation and liaison between the relevant bodies in the health, justice and education spheres as well as between agencies in Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales; provisions relating to access to the register which have due regard to child safety; and the rights of individuals named in the register. Work by my Department on the preparation of a draft discussion paper is at an advanced stage. The direction of the paper is dependent on the recommendations of the interdepartmental working group on reform of Garda vetting.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">The North-South Ministerial Council agreed at the time that the Department would consult with the education partners regarding the recommendations made by the group and it is my intention to do so. However, it is clear that the issues involved do not relate solely to my Department and continuing co-operation between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Education and Science will be required in bringing forward reforms.</p>

          <p eId="para_100">The Minister referred to the North-South Ministerial Council. I agree that anything done in this area must be done on a North-South basis to some extent. It is something that also needs to be dealt with on a wider EU level. Has the Minister any intentions in that regard during the Irish Presidency?</p>
          <p eId="para_101">Is the Minister aware that the system in Ireland is 20 years behind the system in place in Northern Ireland?

If legislation were to arise as a result of the work of the interdepartmental working group on Garda vetting, there would be a question of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform sponsoring that legislation. If one Bill can cover both I would be happy to be its sponsor or to allow the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">On the wider question of raising the matter at European Union level, I take the point made by the Deputy and I believe it is well worth pursuing. However, until such time as our own house is put in order and with regard to Northern Ireland and east-west, I would not put the matter of Europe at the top of my list. The systems must first be put in place here.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">The system is slightly further advanced in Northern Ireland but there is not a significant difference between us. The system used in Northern Ireland, the PECS system, allows employers to check the suitability of those applying to work with children or adults with a learning disability. That system is operated by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. I assure the Deputy that the Department will continue to regard the matter as urgent.</p>

That is the reason they were prioritised and the Garda agreed to do the vetting in that case.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. B. Lenihan):</from>
          <p eId="para_109">The Children Act 2001 introduces a wide range of innovative measures that will provide a statutory framework for the future development of the juvenile justice system in accordance with modern thinking and best international practice. Responsibility for implementing the Act lies with three Departments: the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Health and Children. I am the Minister of State with special responsibility for children and with the support of the National Children's Office, I am leading the interdepartmental working group on the co-ordination of the phased implementation of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">The Department of Education and Science has sole responsibility for the provision of residential services for children up to age 16 years who have been convicted or placed on remand by a court. There are five schools for young offenders providing such services under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science. The schools are governed by the terms of the Children Acts 1908 to 1989 which will be replaced by the Children Act 2001 when the provisions of the latter are commenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">The Department of Education and Science has responsibility for Part 10 of the Act, which provides for the establishment of children detention schools to replace the existing reformatory and industrial schools. These provisions cannot be commenced until separate detention facilities are provided by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for boys and girls aged 16 and 17 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">Part 11 of the Children Act 2001 provides for the Special Residential Services Board which was established on a statutory basis on 7 November 2003. Part 11 is jointly the responsibility of the Ministers for Health and Children and Education and Science. Its functions are to provide policy advice to the Ministers on the remand and detention of children and ensure the efficient, effective and co-ordinated delivery of services to children in respect of whom children detention orders or special care orders are made. To facilitate the appointment of the Special Residential Services Board, section 159(1) of the Children Act 2001 was partially commenced to allow for the membership of representatives of the children detention schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">I am sure the Deputy is aware of the importance of a proper liaison between the courts and the places of detention for children. This subject has attracted much criticism over the years and some of that criticism is echoed in an interesting article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> this morning. The board has recruited a number of officers who can liaise between the courts and the relevant detention centres. This recruitment has taken place and the officers will commence their duties when they are trained to perform them.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i>A key consideration for the Department in commencing the Children Act 2001 is the identification of the appropriate number of residential places required under the new arrangements. An independent international expert in residential care was commissioned to review the residential requirements for children detention schools so as to ensure there are sufficient and appropriate places into the future. The Department recently received the views of the Special Residential Services Board to the report and they are currently being considered.</p>

          <p eId="para_115">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I wish to focus in particular on the early intervention aspects of the Children Act. The Minister informed the Joint Committee on Education and Science that the early intervention aspects of the Act are not planned to be introduced until the medium rather than in the short-term. My intention is to ensure a focus on early intervention which all experts agree is far more effective than the later actions which include taking children into custody. What is the Minister's Department doing about bringing forward the early intervention measures envisaged in the Children Act? I am thinking about the children with wasted lives whom we saw on "Prime Time" a few weeks ago. They have become alienated from their communities and are causing havoc. We know they will end up in detention centres unless there is intervention, such as the youth encounter project. What will happen in terms of early preventative intervention?</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan:</from>
          <p eId="para_116">I have noted the Deputy's concern about early intervention but we must be clear about our terms. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible under the legislation for early intervention. The responsibilities of the Department of Education and Science include the detention of persons under 16 years of age. As regards the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the most fundamental form of early intervention is the Garda diversion scheme which has been put on a statutory basis under the Children Act 2001. That part of the Act has been implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">The work of the juvenile liaison officers and programmes operating under the diversion schemes is the first key barrier to offending. This is the first time an offender comes into direct conflict with the law and the diversion scheme has proved to be a considerable success. The new form of conferencing envisaged by the Children Act has been implemented by the juvenile liaison officers. In addition, the provisions for restorative justice, whereby the victim confronts the offenders, have been implemented under the juvenile liaison scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">The Deputy referred to the recent "Prime Time" programme, but it is difficult to say whether early intervention measures would have assisted that group of individuals who had already come before the courts on a substantial number of occasions. A stage of intervention before detention is clearly required for those offenders when they are first apprehended and appear before the courts. Responsibility for that type of required intervention, which can hardly be characterised as early because a person who comes before the courts regularly is on a serious progression of criminality, must be managed by the probation and welfare service.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">I accept the point that there are insufficient facilities in this area at present. That is why the Government agreed to sanction the recruitment of 30 probation and welfare officers for a dedicated service for the Children's Court. That recruitment is taking place. As a result, conferencing can commence with that group of children, which can lead to an engagement as to what interventions can be used as a last resort before detention, to attempt the difficult task of diverting these individuals away from the criminal path.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">In speaking of early intervention, I take it the Deputy will also consider the wider measures under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children concerning parenting and intervention for children under the age of seven, but that point raises wider questions.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Sullivan:</from>
          <p eId="para_121">I seek some interdepartmental thinking on early intervention before such young people are detained. Intervention in schools is needed, for example, especially with the younger brothers of the people we saw in the "Prime Time" programme. That kind of intervention should happen with a focused response from the Department of Education and Science to the specific areas in which these young people live and the schools they attend.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Miss de Valera):</from>
          <p eId="para_129">My Department provides funding to vocational education committees to assist towards the child care expenses of participants in the vocational training opportunities scheme, Youthreach and the senior Traveller training programme. Some 27 vocational education committees requested special assistance by way of additional funding in respect of 2003 for their child care services. These vocational education committees were asked to indicate their minimal requirements to maintain the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">Following a review of budgetary provision for 2003 across the range of further education programmes and supports, it was found possible to re-designate certain elements of funding, €2 million in total, to enable supplementary grants to be allocated for child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">The administration of grants to participants in VTOS, Youthreach and the senior Traveller programme is a matter for individual vocational education committees. The grant is a contribution to costs and any shortfall between the grant and actual costs must be funded from other sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">A working group comprising representatives of my Department and the Irish Vocational Education Association has been established to review the criteria for the allocation of grants for child care with a view to making more efficient use of the funds available in the light of increasing demand.</p>

          <p eId="para_133">I welcome back the Minister of State after her illness. Will she inform us of the number of VTOS and Traveller scheme students affected by the initial decision to cut the child care allowance? I have asked this question before but have not been able to elicit a response. Does the Minister of State have information on how many people are obliged to drop out of such courses due to the cuts? Many Deputies have anecdotal evidence of this matter from people attending their clinics, but perhaps the Minister of State has the actual number.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">Are the supplementary allocations being made on a once-off basis or will there be further problems concerning support for child care expenses for the programmes next year? I note the Minister of State has established a working group but the problem is that many families were informed only a week beforehand that there would be no child care allocation. I do not want to see this happening again. Given that we are talking about minimal requirements, is there no intention to increase allocations in this area? People involved in working with the disadvantaged recognise that child care is one of the key elements needed to help people out of poverty.</p>

          <p eId="para_135">I thank Deputy Crowe for his kind wishes. It is nice to be back, even if it is on the day that I am faced with questions. I will try to answer his supplementary questions as best I can.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">The issue of child care has caused a good deal of concern. Some 27 vocational education committees contacted my Department directly to see if there was a possibility of getting further funding because, if not, it meant that certain programmes might have to be closed down and certain other cuts made. Obviously, I did not want to see that situation arising if at all possible, so I sought a review on how my Department could further supplement the VEC allocation. It is in this context that the €2 million arose, as I explained in my initial reply.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">The 27 vocational education committees that approached me were accommodated. We asked each VEC to notify us of the amount needed to deal with what it saw as immediate concerns. We were able to provide 87.8% of the total the vocational education committees said was needed to maintain the level of service. This allocation was a one-off. It is important to realise that this money was channelled specifically to deal with this problem this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">I have established a joint review between my Department and the Irish Vocational Education Association to ensure that these programmes will be in place to help those most in need. I await the outcome of that review.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">The Deputy raised a specific question about the number of Travellers on such schemes. I do not have that specific information but I will try to accommodate the Deputy by way of correspondence.</p>

          <p eId="para_140">We talk in terms of minimum requirements but will the same problem arise again next year regarding this area? The Minister spoke recently at the education committee about different groups getting funding and so on. Is this one of the groups earmarked for funding but on which funding has not been spent? Is that the inference? I presume this service will be successful and will develop but the money for it does not appear to be available. What will be the Department's requirements if this service is to expand? The term "minimal requirements" does not deal with the problem. Will the Minister of State indicate the total supplementary resources allocated to the vocational education committees? She said money was diverted. Will she give a breakdown of the areas of the Department's budget from which the money was diverted?</p>

          <from>Miss de Valera:</from>
          <p eId="para_141">To answer the Deputy's second question first, it was not a question of moneys being diverted in that sense. It did not mean that any programme went without funding. It was money which would not be spent within that particular timescale and, therefore, it could be diverted with support from my colleagues in Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">When we talk about child care and the responsibilities of the vocational education committees, it is important to point out that the grant is a contribution to costs and any shortfall between the grant and the actual costs must be funded from other sources. It is not sole funding from the Department but a contribution to costs. There is an increase in demand and that is the reason the review we have set in motion is now needed. I look forward to the recommendations of the review.</p>

      asked the

      the reason for the ?60 million underspend in capital projects within his Department for 2003; the reason these moneys were not expended in view of the number of outstanding school building and refurbishment works to be undertaken; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey:</from>
          <p eId="para_144">Any underspend on the capital side of my Department's budget this year arises in the context of the necessary prudent and tight management of the overall envelope of funds available to me to ensure the delivery of all services across the education sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">As the year progressed I had to prioritise spending and divert funds to ensure that higher than anticipated demands in areas such as special needs provision and school transport were met.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">I want to make clear, however, that in managing the budget, capital funding intended for primary and post-primary schools was not switched. The re-allocation of funds across budget lines was made possible chiefly by savings in the capital budget in the third level sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">The Deputy is probably aware that I had announced a pause on all capital development in the third level sector in November 2002 when I decided that it was prudent to re-evaluate and review the overall position of third level capital projects and establish clear priorities for future years. The Higher Education Authority, at my request, is carrying out that review in order to assess the entire set of demands in all publicly-funded third level institutions, establish prioritisation and agree re-phasing. Savings on the capital budget can be associated with this pause and these savings are being used to address other meritorious programmes and urgent needs within the education sector.</p>

          <from>Ms Enright:</from>
          <p eId="para_148">I am well aware of the Minister's decision on the pause in funding for capital projects in the third level sector in November 2002. I was critical of it at the time but that announcement concerned the 2003 Estimate. The €60 million I am talking about is money for 2003. Is the Minister telling us there was a €60 million underspend in addition to the pause in funding for the third level sector? That appears to be what he is saying. Will he also tell us where the €60 million was spent? Did that come to us by way of a Supplementary Estimate which perhaps is not necessary? If it was, I am sure the Minister would have brought it to our attention. In what sectors was the money spent? I welcome the Minister's confirmation that it did not affect the primary or post-primary sector but I would be concerned about the third level element of it, particularly in light of the fact that this sector has been further cut this year.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey:</from>
          <p eId="para_149">Despite what might be in the public domain there has been an increase in current spending in the third level sector this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">On the question of the €60 million, that was provided for third level building in the Estimates for this year in anticipation that the review might have been completed, that we would have money to spend or that we would need the money for third level projects. As it happened, the review continues and we did not have to spend the €60 million. It is €60 million that was provided for in this year's Estimate and no Supplementary Estimate was necessary for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">During the course of the year, there was extra pressure on the current side in terms of expenditure. The major areas where needs arose were the special needs provision, that is, special needs assistants, resource teachers at first and second level and all of the areas providing for children with special educational needs. School transport was another area where it was necessary. That largely arose because of the special needs demand which is currently running at approximately 35% of the school transport budget. Extra provision had to be made for teachers' salaries arising from the supervision and substitution arrangements and the payment for those. The final area where extra money was needed was partly because of the package of increased grants we made available to students in higher education. There was a higher level of take-up in that area than we anticipated. They were the four major areas.</p>

          <from>Ms Enright:</from>
          <p eId="para_152">We have the same problem with this year's Estimate. When will the review of the third level sector be done and will that affect spending this year? Will the Minister agree it is very bad planning to allocate money to something, then have a review into it and not be able to spend the money available when there are many urgent third level projects?</p>
          <p eId="para_153">Perhaps I misheard the Minister on the money being provided for third level grants. My understanding was that the money for that area for 2003 came from the Tánaiste's Department.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_66">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey:</from>
          <p eId="para_154">A total of €12 million of the extra money needed for that came through the Tánaiste's Department. The extra cost, off the top of my head, was approximately €18 million and the contribution towards the cost of that was €12 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">On the first question, I do not know when the Higher Education Authority will finish its review of the third level sector. It would have been very bad planning on my part last year if I had told the Minister for Finance during the Estimates campaign that I did not want the €58.5 million he was giving me for third level capital because there was a review ongoing and I did not know when it would finish. It was prudent to try to provide the €60 million. As it turned out it was extremely prudent because of the increased levels of expenditure I needed in other areas. I would have been in a worse position if I could not provide the extra money for special needs assistants and so on. Rather than being blamed for that I think I should be congratulated for having the foresight to make sure I had enough in my budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_161">I thank the Minister for his answer, which was similar to a reply I received to a parliamentary question a week or two ago. He describes the current position in a general way without providing any specific information. Is he aware that negotiations for a full-scale extension to the Hibernia College started more than 20 years ago and that many of its classrooms were built before 1900? In light of this, why is the college still on a band 2 rating, which is deemed to be essential but not absolutely essential? Will he give parents, students and teachers a realistic timeframe for the school to proceed to tender and construction? Section 6, in which it is placed, contains 54 other schools, of which 37 have a band 2 rating.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">The Minister indicated that the proposal for Mohill national schools is in section 7, band 1, the same section and band rating as 33 other schools. Will he give a realistic timeframe for the construction of these schools?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_70">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey:</from>
          <p eId="para_163">When I publish the 2004 schools building programme, the Deputy and others will have a clearer picture of the position of schools and their future status. Mohill national school has been given band 1 status because it is an amalgamation. As I stated, the project is still in the early stages – one, two and three – and many other schools are ahead of it. Amalgamation and rationalisation proposals are guaranteed to proceed through the programme without undue delay and will not be stopped at various stages, whereas schools which are not amalgamating or rationalising go through various stages. Last year, we had to decide that none of the schools would proceed to the next stage. I assure the Deputy that because the school in question is an amalgamation, it will pass through the other stages relatively quickly towards tender, after which its progress will depend on cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">As regards bands 1 and 2, where amalgamation or rationalisation are involved, the schools in question are given band 1 status, in other words absolute priority. The reason for this is that from the point of view of the Department amalgamation of two or three schools is good for children and the educational system in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">The other category of band 1 school consists of those one would describe as an absolute disaster, which could mean, for example, a roof has blown off or similar serious circumstances have arisen. While not as bad as band 1, band 2 is serious and a high priority rating. I anticipate in general terms that both schools will make substantial progress in the next couple of years.</p>

          <from>Ms Harkin:</from>
          <p eId="para_166">Taking into account the figure in the Estimates and the additional €30 million allocated in the budget, the overall allocation for the programme is slightly more than €6 million above the figure in the 2003 Estimates. In light of the Minister's comment that schools with a band 1 rating are an "absolute disaster", does he agree that the increase of just €6 million compared to the 2003 Estimate is inadequate to deal with the large number of primary and post-primary schools in band 1 and on the waiting list?</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey:</from>
          <p eId="para_167">I am not sure how the Deputy arrived at a figure of €6 million. The increase in funding this year for primary and post-primary schools is 12%, while the figure for second level schools is exactly the same as last year. The funding available under the schools building programme for primary schools in the coming year is €190 million, almost €23 million more than this year. The basic difference between this year is that I had little or no discretionary funding for the schools building programme last year when funding for new primary schools was in the region of €12 million. Apart from the increase of €23 million for this purpose, I have received a further increase of €50 million to €60 million. I have, therefore, approximately €80 million to fund new starts this year, not the €6 million the Deputy cited, which is a substantial difference. The problem last year arose largely due to an overhang, which we do not have this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_169">The graduate diploma course is a full-time course run to enable third level graduates to train as primary teachers. The course was introduced as a response to a shortage in the supply of primary teachers. It was first provided in the 1995-96 academic year in four of the colleges of education and has been repeated on a number of occasions since. The most recent course commenced in February of this year. The intake to the postgraduate courses since their introduction is as follows:</p>

          <p eId="para_189">Figures from different years can be used to obtain averages that suit one's purpose. The number of applications for these courses is still significant and a large number of children are still being taught by unqualified people. In light of this, does the Minister consider his decision prudent? What factors did he assess in making his decision? Did the Hibernia teacher training course have any impact on his decision? Has he had further negotiations or discussions with the colleges of education on the possibility that they may provide modular or distance education? Does he intend to progress the issue of a teachers' council in the near future?</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey:</from>
          <p eId="para_190">I do not carry out the assessment, which is undertaken by my Department. The decision is based on an assessment of the needs of the system in subsequent years, taking into account changes in the pupil-teacher ratio, the number of retirements, possible retirement figures and other factors. In other words, the assessment covers any issue likely to affect the supply of teachers in the future. The number of teachers graduating from the full-time courses and the part-time postgraduate course, which currently stands at a record level, is also assessed. All these factors are taken into account when deciding how many places will be available on the postgraduate course.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">The additional factor taken into account this year was the new graduate diploma course in primary education being provided by Hibernia College. The fact that 195 people have started the course with the possibility of a further 195 starting in February has had an effect. The reason for offering these courses is to try to guarantee an adequate supply of teachers for primary schools. The INTO and others have indicated they do not want any part-time or unqualified teachers in the system by 2005. It is an aim I hope to attain as well and it is on that basis that decisions are made about the supply of places on the postgraduate course.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">As regards the modular courses, the Department of Education and Science asked the teacher training colleges earlier this year to come forward with proposals. They have not done so. They raised questions when they were asked. In the meantime, the Hibernia course was introduced and assessed. My Department takes the view that there is no need to continue talks on the modular course as the Hibernia course is filling the need.</p>

          <p eId="para_194">I do not foresee the end of the postgraduate course at present because according to our information, we need the current number of teachers in training. Changes and improvements within the system may also create a need for further teachers to be trained. I do not anticipate the other courses being phased out. However, if there is an oversupply of teachers the matter would have to be reconsidered, as would the question of places on full-time courses in the teacher training colleges. That is down the road.</p>

If it was providing the 460 or 480 places on the course, I understand the average cost to the taxpayer would be around €8,000, although I have no notes to support that. The Deputy can do his own calculations. However, the Hibernia course costs money.</p>

          <p eId="para_200">A joint working group on child protection was established by the North-South Ministerial Council and is composed of officials from my Department and the Department of Education, Northern Ireland. The group submitted its report to the Council who agreed on the broad approach taken and signalled its desire to have detailed proposals for legislation prepared. The main thrust of the proposals is to provide structures through which people who are a risk to the safety of children can be prevented from being employed in schools. Most of this information I have given earlier. The proposed legislation would comprise of the establishment of a register on a statutory basis for persons who are considered unsafe to work with children; a framework for co-operation and liaison between the relevant bodies in the health, justice and education spheres as well as between agencies in Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales; and provisions relating to access to the register with due regard to child safety and the rights of individuals named.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">A cross-governmental working group has been established by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider proposals to reform the vetting of employees by the central vetting unit run by the Garda Síochána. The group, which is chaired by a chief superintendent, has met on six occasions and is expected to report in the near future. Work by my Department on the preparation of a draft discussion paper is at an advanced stage. Its completion is dependent on the recommendations of the group to which I referred.</p>

          <p eId="para_202">We have discussed this already. The Northern Ireland system is in place 20 years, so it is fairly well advanced. The Minister has indicated he does not want to discuss future legislation. Does he envisage a system similar to that in Northern Ireland or one that could be more comprehensive and less bureaucratic? The system in the North is good, but it is operated across two government departments, as well as the PSNI, which is cumbersome.</p>

          <p eId="para_203">I hope we will learn from the experience in Northern Ireland. The Deputy has had a good look at the system and she will agree that there are good and bad aspects to it. It has much to recommend it, but it is bureaucratic. Much of the bureaucracy arises because of individuals' rights. We would hope in particular to learn from the experience there, and, while safeguarding rights of the individual, we will aim to make it more accessible for people who need to have that access. The major objective is to ensure that the systems to be put in place, both North and South, will be the same. That may mean that the Northern Ireland system will be somewhat changed in the light of experience.</p>

It will take time to complete the consultation process with the Northern Ireland authorities.</p>

It would be futile to take that approximately only to have to change it later. If I thought the work of the group would continue indefinitely, I would be prepared to reconsider.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">The working group was due to report by the end of November. It is a few weeks overdue. The group considered that further work was required on the report to finalise it.

In the youth area generally, at least two separate codes of practice exist. The Deputy may be using the opportunity to get me to issue advice. My advice is that all organisations should have a code of practice to protect the young people in their care and to protect workers and those who volunteer from being the subject of gossip, rumours, false accusations or whatever. An important balance between the two positions is necessary, but I would join with the Deputy in urging that codes of practice and conduct should be put in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_210">The funding for the youth affairs section of my Department for 2004 is €28.124 million, which represents a 4% increase in funding over 2003. Between 1997 and 2004, provision for the youth work sector has increased by more than 60%.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">It is intended that the National Youth Work Development Plan 2003-2007 will be implemented on a phased and prioritised basis as resources permit, following agreement on financial provisions with the Minister for Finance. As a first step, it is intended to appoint an assessor of youth work and also to commence the first phase of the child protection training programme for the youth sector. Given the discussion on the previous question, all of us agree it is important that codes of practice are put in place. I was happy to publish the code of practice in September 2002. I have stated that the child protection training programme should be one of the first priorities to be implemented in terms of the national youth work development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">As regards the Youth Work Act 2001, which provides a statutory basis for the development of youth work in Ireland, it was not the intention that the Act would be fully implemented immediately. Section 1 of the Act provides for sections to be commenced at different stages. To date, sections 2 to 17, inclusive, 18 and 24 have been commenced. The implementation of further sections will depend on the availability of the necessary resources. I assure the Deputy and youth work organisations of my continuing support for the work of the youth sector and that I will continue to seek additional funding for the sector in the future.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Sullivan:</from>
          <p eId="para_213">I welcome the Minister of State back to the House. The youth sector identified the need for an extra €5 million in the budget, but it received only an extra €1 million, which was disappointing. It is not the Minister of State's fault that she was not able to be here to fight that corner, although I know she did her best from her sick bed. Given that she is fighting fit again, perhaps she could find the extra €4 million. The Minister showed in response to an earlier question by Deputy Enright that he is adroit at transferring funds from one place to another when he underspends. I commend Mr. Kevin Hickey, president of the National Youth Council of Ireland, on his recent figures. He estimated that there were a total of 54,506 horses and greyhounds in the country and that each horse and greyhound received funding of €23.6 per week, while every young person only gets €1 per week in youth funding. It seems it is better to be a horse or a greyhound than a young person in need of youth funding. That issue should be prioritised in the coming year. Some 40,000 volunteers do valuable work, which prevents significant levels of anti-social behaviour.</p>

          <from>Miss de Valera:</from>
          <p eId="para_214">I thank the Deputy for her kind wishes. I am aware the National Youth Council of Ireland referred to a sum of €5 million. I have a good working relationship with the council and I will continue to work closely with it. I know it is embarking on an information campaign to ensure the work done in the youth sector is acknowledged. All of us support the further allocation of money to this sector. I have worked and will continue to work to ensure that further money is made available. I assure the Deputy on my behalf and on behalf of the Minister that we would love to have more money in the Department because we would know where to funnel it to meet the specific needs of the youth sector. The Government is committed to the youth sector. There has been a cumulative increase of 60% over the past six years since 1997. The provision of further sums of money is important because we want to facilitate the appointment of youth development officers and the establishment of youth work committees, local voluntary youth councils and administrative back-up.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">It will be necessary to continue discussions with the Irish Vocational Education Association and the chief executive officers about the further implementation of sections of the Act. I look forward to working with the vocational education committees and the youth organisations to see how best we can implement that. I am sure the Deputy is aware that a sub-committee of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee is currently developing detailed guidelines and procedures relating to the further implementation of the Act. It has been of tremendous help to me as Minister of State with responsibility for the youth sector. I look forward to working with the organisations because we all want to achieve the same goals. I assure the Deputy that although we do not have €5 million to spend at this stage, I will continue to work to increase the funding available in the Department for the youth sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_219">Yesterday in an operation north of the Border at Killeen a number of members of an illegal organisation hijacked a truck carrying 3.3 million cigarettes which were worth approximately €1.6 million. According to the Garda and the PSNI, the raid had all the hallmarks of a Provisional IRA operation. It follows on the heels of the discovery of a scam in the building construction area by the Provisional IRA. This comes a week after the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said he was certain that organised crime, particularly involving the Provisional IRA, was funding Sinn Féin. The Taoiseach has indicated on a number of occasions that Sinn Féin and the IRA are two sides of the same coin. Given the comments of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and yesterday's illegal activities north of the Border, does the Taoiseach share the view of the Minister that an illegal organisation, namely, the Provisional IRA, is funding Sinn Féin and, if so, what does he and his Government propose to do about it?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_220">I do not have any information about yesterday's significant seizure of cigarettes. There have also been other activities recently which are being investigated. I am aware of what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said in response to questions he was asked about this matter. Every Member of the House accepts that there can be no room for ambiguity on such issues in a democratic society. The Minister is determined to ensure that these criminal acts and organised gangs, regardless of where they come from, are dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">Sources in Sinn Féin have contacted me to point out that they have nothing to do with any of these things and they continue to make that position clear. Deputy Kenny is correct but I have also said, throughout my political career, that I consider the IRA to be the opposite side of that coin.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">During Question Time today I spoke about the importance of the International Monitoring Commission.

          <p eId="para_223">Deputy Kenny will appreciate that I am not at liberty to speak about security briefings or security issues, but I am aware that the Garda has been investigating certain activities by people who may have connections with the Provisional IRA.

          <from>Mr. Kenny:</from>
          <p eId="para_224">I accept that the Taoiseach cannot comment on sensitive matters arising from security briefings. However, is he happy with the evidence presented to him by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, based on the latter's certainty that organised crime by the Provisional IRA is funding the Sinn Féin Party?</p>
          <p eId="para_225">This is a democracy. I accept the Taoiseach's bona fides in his differentiation of right and wrong in the funding of political parties. This is provided for in legislation and I accept it. However, I do not accept that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can confirm publicly, based on evidence available to him, that he is absolutely certain an illegal organisation is funding a party that has successfully contested elections. Without outlining the security details, does the Taoiseach accept the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's comment that the Provisional IRA and organised crime are funding the Sinn Féin Party and, if so, what does the Government propose to do about it?</p>
          <p eId="para_226">My party is, correctly, constrained by law in how it raises money and we adhere to that. However, I will not stand for a situation in which an illegal organisation that is pursued by the Garda authorities is, according to the evidence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, funding a political party in this House. The Taoiseach must ensure that this is stopped and, if necessary, that the CAB is given extra resources to go about its business effectively.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">I am constrained in what I can say but I wish to make a number of points. I do not have evidence that a political party in this House is funded by illegal activity. I do not have that evidence and I am not going to say that. Senior people in Sinn Féin have made it clear to me that this is not the case and that they reject these accusations.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">Ultimately, it is a matter for the Garda to pursue criminal activity, regardless of who the perpetrators are, and to examine the connections. The Garda is doing this. There has been a number of big cases, some of them high profile, on which I have been briefed. There are certainly suspicions about them so I will not say there is nothing in all this. There have been occasional allegations that Provisional IRA members have been involved in what might be called organised crime, such as robbery and hijackings. That is a fact. They are not proven cases and they have not been dealt with in the courts, but obviously the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has more details about these matters. I am aware that the Garda has been investigating certain activities by people who may have connections with the Provisional IRA. I have been briefed accordingly and I do not wish to mislead the House.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_97">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte:</from>
          <p eId="para_229">Some time ago the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made an application to the High Court for recoupment of costs of the investigation into Ansbacher Cayman and a number of companies. This morning the application was, by consent, struck out in the High Court on the application of counsel for the State. Given that this involves taxpayers' money, can the Taoiseach say if an enforceable order for full value can now be registered against an entity in this jurisdiction? What are its terms?</p>
          <p eId="para_230">This investigation into tax evasion must be seen in the context of the testimony last Thursday to the Committee of Public Accounts by the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners that he has now recouped €922 million for the State as a result of various inquiries –€697 million from the DIRT inquiry, €48.5 million from National Irish Bank, €27 million from Ansbacher, €13.9 million from the Flood tribunal and €6.7 million from the Moriarty tribunal. This should be seen against the belief expressed in January 1998 by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, when he told RTE news:</p>
          <p eId="para_231">The sums uncovered are very small in the context of the level of tax paid each year, so I think you need to put it in context. It is an insult to the vast majority of taxpayers to say that tax evasion is widespread. The question of tax evasion is not a unique Irish problem, nor is the question of residents having offshore bank accounts for tax evasion a unique Irish thing as well. So these things should be borne in mind, rather than people going off half-cocked and making ridiculous and outlandish allegations, both against the Revenue Commissioners and against other people as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">It is an irony that the man who so derided the notion of tax evasion has been the beneficiary of €922 million falling into his lap as a result of inquiries pressed by this party and others in this House and which were opposed by the Minister at the time.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_98">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_233">It is evident from the quote that the Minister on that occasion was defending the Revenue Commissioners from attack. It was the Minister, with myself, who gave the Revenue Commissioners the powers over the years to deal with these issues. I agree with the Deputy that enormous sums of money have been recovered by the Revenue Commissioners as a result of the Ansbacher and other inquiries.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">I do not have the details about the court case and its settlement today. The State was seeking to recover costs of approximately €1.2 million in particular cases and it was the advice of senior counsel that it should settle in those cases. There were significant legal hurdles involved in doing anything else, based on the Lynch judgment in the Siúcre Éireann case of 1991. It was agreed that it was best to settle these cases and the State has recovered €1.2 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">This is part of a significant recovery of taxes and of dealing with those who abused their position in Irish society to defraud the State of taxes in one form or another. Time and again we have recovered those sums and forced people into legitimate business. That is the reason the tax base is as healthy as it is, in contrast with what it was in the past.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte:</from>
          <p eId="para_236">One cannot read the statement by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, as a defence of the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners were not engaged in tax evasion. Many people known to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, were. I am not saying that he knew they were engaged in tax evasion. The €922 million which was recovered bears this out dramatically. The Taoiseach took steps to close off some loopholes during my time in the House. He opened a few also, but I will not go down that road now.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">The actual application made by the Minister, Deputy McDowell, was for €3.4 million against a number of companies involved in the Ansbacher affair. There has been just one statement so far from the IIB, who said the settlement did not cost it any money. Is the Taoiseach saying €1.2 million of the €3.4 million has been recovered and against whom is the order registrable?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_100">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_238">I do not have the full details. Most of the recoveries today were in respect of Ansbacher accounts. Some of the €1.2 million was against Guinness Mahon Bank. These two accounted for the bulk of the sums recovered. The legal advice was that we should settle in respect of these accounts. In other cases the legal advice is not to settle but to continue to pursue the cases. This decision related to a group, including individuals with Ansbacher accounts and Guinness Mahon Bank.</p>

          <p eId="para_241">To return to the questions posed by Deputy Kenny, is it not the case that the Taoiseach's response to the Deputy's remarks only fuels the remarks of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, in casting a disgraceful slur on the party I and other colleagues in this House are proud to represent? Is it not the case that a veil is being used of so-called security briefings? Rather than stating he does not have such evidence, he should affirm quite categorically that there is no such evidence, because there is no such linkage. Sinn Féin has not just met the statutory requirements to furnish annual accounts, it has voluntarily submitted these accounts to the Revenue Commissioners. It submits to the requirements of the Standards in Public Office Commission and to the electoral office in the Six Counties. Will the Taoiseach agree that Sinn Féin is one of the most scrutinised parties in the country? Its accounts are not just scrutinised on this side of the Border, but north of the Border and in regard to the party's ongoing work in the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Is it not the case that there is absolutely no evidence and that the remarks of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are a scurrilous slight on this party? Is the Taoiseach aware of the great hurt and vexation caused to elected voices and supporters of this party throughout the island of Ireland and abroad? Is he aware that if he is not prepared to deny categorically the charges so abusively presented to the media by the president of the Progressive Democrats in his role as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he is aligning himself with these views and that there is a requirement on him to set the record straight?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_104">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_243">I do not think Deputy Ó Caoláin should get too upset. I have spent most of my nine years as leader of my party defending it in regard to investigations and examinations into all kinds of issues. I have had to answer to tribunals and facilitate all kinds of investigations. It comes with the territory in a democratic society. I have had to take on the issues and deal with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">I have said to Deputy Kenny that I have no information on the issue. Sinn Féin continues to make clear how it is funded. I have made it absolutely clear that I have no other information. However, I am not the Garda Commissioner, the CAB or the special investigation unit. What I am merely saying is that I am aware the Garda has been investigating certain activities by people who may have connections with the Provisional IRA. I also said there have been allegations from time to time that Provisional IRA members have been involved in what might be called organised crime, for example, robberies and hijackings of goods. If I say anything else, Deputies will say I am misleading the House. I will not go into the details. In fact, I will not say anything, because Deputies could deem anything I say to be unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">As Deputy Kenny acknowledged, I cannot stand up in the House and give security briefings. Neither can I say I have not been briefed. If the Deputy tells me his party has complied with the Standards in Public Office Commission and the electoral Act, I will believe him, even though when he raises issues in the House he says he does not believe what I or my party say. I will pay Deputy Ó Caoláin the courtesy of believing him.</p>

          <p eId="para_246">Given its seriousness, the issue requires a focus. I do not agree with the Taoiseach. It does not come with the territory. I roundly reject the sourcing of funding through criminal activity for Sinn Féin or any other political party. This is not acceptable under any circumstances. We are talking about funding of Sinn Féin which has met every requirement and demand of it. I will personally furnish the Taoiseach with a copy of our accounts so that he will be well aware of the facts in regard to this party's activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">We are in competition with Fianna Fáil and all the other political parties. It is no coincidence that following Sinn Féin's becoming the largest Nationalist voice north of the Border this attack has been launched on the integrity of our party. It is not only an attack on the name "Sinn Féin", it is an attack on each individual member of the party and the supporters throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">Does the Taoiseach not recognise that involved in all of this is the very dangerous situation that it represents an undermining of confidence in terms of both the peace process and the political process, with Sinn Féin seeking at this point to move forward from the electoral result north of the Border? What has been said is grist to the mill of the Democratic Unionist Party. Comments made previously in this House were grist to their mill and are now repeated. It will be used again to further stall and thwart the normalisation of politics on this island.</p>

I did not get excited, nor did any of my colleagues, because this is part of the territory. One must defend oneself in these positions. If Deputy Ó Caoláin has complied with requirements, such as those of the Public Offices Commission, it would be as relevant for him to send me his accounts as it would be for me to send him my accounts.</p>

It means this is the last week in which the matter can be dealt with. It must be considered by the committee and the Seanad and must be accepted or rejected by 2 January 2004. It is not good practice on the part of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring this request to the House on 16 December despite having obtained Government approval on 11 November.</p>

          <p eId="para_276">No. 15, which is concerned with a report by the Minister for Defence, is far more serious than is indicated by the Government's decision to deal with it in committee only. It needs to be dealt with in the context of a wider debate, given that it relates to members of the Defence Forces serving overseas. The matter has serious implications from a humanitarian perspective and for the safety of members of the Defence Forces as well as wider political implications. It needs a wider debate.</p>

        <heading>European Council Meeting: Statements.</heading>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_193">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_367">I attended the European Council and the Intergovernmental Conference in Brussels on 12 and 13 December. I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Minster of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Roche. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, attended the European Council meeting. The conclusions of the European Council have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I also participated in the extraordinary tripartite social summit in Brussels on 11 December.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">It was clearly disappointing that the Italian Presidency was not able to bring the IntergovernmentaI Conference to a definitive conclusion at the weekend. Like others, we had very much hoped a final agreement would be possible. In the end, however, it became clear that the time was not ripe. A basis for compromise, in particular on the key issue of how to define a qualified majority, was not present. In the circumstances there was a general sense that there was little to be gained from prolonging the meeting unduly.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">As the next President of the European Council, I undertook to reflect, initially in conjunction with the Italian Presidency, and then consult partners with a view to bringing a report to the spring European Council in March. I hope that in the light of our consultations it might be possible to have a better idea on how and when we can move ahead. In the next couple of weeks we will be considering how best to structure consultations. The entire Presidency team and I will be giving the highest priority to our Intergovernmental Conference responsibilities. In its Presidency Ireland will, on this issue as with others, be even-handed and open. In particular, we have repeatedly made clear that on the question of the voting system, we could live either with the Nice arrangements or the Convention proposals. Nationally, we could accept any reasonable compromise. Therefore, partners may be confident that we will be motivated only by the desire to build consensus.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">While the voting system remains the most difficult and prominent issue, it is not the only question to be resolved. Good progress has been made in recent weeks, including progress on issues of particular concern to Ireland. There also seemed to be an emerging consensus on most institutional questions, including the composition of the Commission and the Presidency. I made clear to Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi where Ireland stood on the outstanding questions, emphasising our desire to be positive and constructive.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">While I was pleased with the apparent direction of developments and the Italian Presidency's helpful approach to our concerns, particularly in the areas of justice and home affairs and European security and defence policy, there will obviously be no final agreement on any of these issues individually until there is an overall deal. The Italian Presidency has expressed the view that its proposals should stand. Its good work remains the obvious basis for the final stages of the negotiations. I have no doubt that there will be eventual agreement on a constitutional treaty. The open questions are exactly what the nature of the agreement will be and when it will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">At the weekend there were many present who thought that the Intergovernmental Conference was unlikely to finish in our Presidency. There was a strong sense that more time would be needed. The situation is complicated by the electoral calendar, not least the European Parliament elections in June.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">No Presidency can compel agreement if the political circumstances are not right. I will not promise that the Intergovernmental Conference will finish in our Presidency but equally it would be premature to conclude that it will not. If there is good reason to believe in the light of our consultations that fast progress is possible, I will spare no effort to achieve it. It depends on the overall atmosphere and whether everyone is ready to do a deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">This is a setback, not a crisis. Pending agreement on a new constitutional treaty and its subsequent ratification, the European Union will continue to function on the basis of the current treaties, as amended at Nice. There is a full programme of work ahead of us and much for the Union to do at home and abroad which does not depend on a new treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Clearly, it would be preferable if agreement was reached as soon as possible. There is a great deal in the current draft, as prepared by the Convention, which is not in dispute and clearly positive: a clearer statement of the European Union's objectives and founding principles; greater certainty as to where its powers begin and end; the simplification of decision-making procedures; a greater role for national parliaments; the enhanced prominence of human rights; the prospect of greater coherence in the Union's external action; and reformed Presidency arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">All of these aspects would contribute enormously to making the European Union more effective in meeting the expectations of citizens and responding to the internal and external challenges it faces. It would also be good to resolve finally the debate about the Union's future institutional framework which has lasted for several years from the time of the Amsterdam negotiation and which has been an ongoing source of tension and uncertainty within the Union. Agreement at the weekend would have been highly desirable but the Union has confronted these difficulties before. It has always united and overcome such difficulties. At a time when its core values of partnership and solidarity have never been more important, I am very confident that the Union will eventually succeed in this endeavour, even if it takes more time than we had hoped.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">The meeting of the European Council that preceded the Intergovernmental Conference was very productive. As the conclusions show, the current internal and external agenda of the European Union is broad and diverse. All of the issues on the table will have a significant impact on our Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">There are a number of issues of particular significance for our Presidency. The European Council endorsed the European action for growth initiative. This initiative by the Italian Presidency has enabled the European Union to mobilise investment in areas which will reinforce competitiveness, growth and infrastructural development. The initiative is very important for the Union and will be carried forward by Ireland during our Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">As part of the growth initiative, the European Council noted progress on the Quick Start programme which already includes two Irish projects, the Belfast-Dublin-Cork rail link and a "motorways of the sea" project for port infrastructure. As the list remains open and dynamic, there is further potential to add projects. Two additional Irish projects, the Cork-Dublin-Belfast road project and the Ireland-UK electricity interconnector, have the potential to be added to the Quick Start project list in the near future. We are also looking at possibilities in the broadband and research and development areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">At the European Council last October I expressed the concern that accounting practices could be obstacles to the implementation of infrastructural programmes. The European Union has now asked member states, together with the European Commission, to act to address any such technical, legal, administrative and accounting obstacles in the implementation of infrastructural projects. This includes the current view by EUROSTAT of the treatment of public private partnerships for national accounts purposes. I am very pleased that this concern has begun to be addressed and that there is an appreciation of the need for a considered approach to removing the other obstacles. Together with growth and competitiveness, employment will be a major priority for the next European Council in the spring. A key element in our consideration of employment will be the recent report of the task force on employment. This report was discussed at the tripartite summit with the European social partners in Brussels on 11 December, a meeting in which I participated.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">Following the tripartite summit, I had a meeting with the former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mr. Wim Kok, who chaired the task force. We agreed that, if we wished to achieve our employment goals for 2010, it would be important for the European Union to make the structural changes required. We also reached agreement on a range of sites for certain European Union agencies. These included the European Food Safety Authority which will have its seat in Parma, the Maritime Safety Agency in Lisbon and the European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Deputies will recall that the Heads of State and Government failed to agree these sites at Laeken in 2001. As such, the agreement at the weekend is clear evidence that a temporary setback can be overcome. The conclusions of the Heads of State and Government on this issue has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The European Council also noted progress in the justice and home affairs area, including on the management of migratory flows, progress on establishing a European border management agency and agreement on a number of measures in the fight against drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">At his request, I met the Prime Minister of Turkey, Mr. Erdogan, on 11 December, prior to the meeting of the European Council. I conveyed to him the European Union's preference for a united Cyprus to join the European Union on 1 May 2004. I also emphasised that a settlement of the Cyprus problem would greatly facilitate Turkey's membership aspirations. This message was reiterated at the conclusions of the European Council adopted the following day.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">The European Council noted a range of foreign policy issues which will impact significantly on the Irish Presidency, including the European security strategy and the declaration on transatlantic relationships. The European security strategy reflects the European Union's and Ireland's commitment to a comprehensive approach to security. It puts effective multilateralism and, in particular, the United Nations at the heart of the EU foreign and security policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">As the incoming Presidency, Ireland will be responsible for the first phase of the implementation of the security strategy and we will focus on effective multilateralism. Our aim is to give significant EU support to Kofi Annan's UN reform process. We will also give priority to implementation of the EU-UN agreement on co-operation in crisis management.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The declaration on transatlantic relations underlines the importance of the EU's relationship with the US. It emphasises that, by acting together, the EU and the US can be a formidable force for good in the world. This will be a priority for Ireland during the Presidency, as will the proposed EU-US summit to be held during the term.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">While it was a successful European Council, it was disappointing that we did not reach agreement in the Intergovernmental Conference on Saturday last. The Irish Presidency will do all in its power to take the process forward. We may or may not succeed in fostering final agreement, but I promise the House and our partners that we will not fail for want of commitment or determination. We will also focus on the other topics on the agenda, in particular the economic challenges facing Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Ireland will hold the Presidency at an exciting an challenging time for Europe. I am confident that Ireland will make a real difference and deliver positive results.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_194">
          <from>Mr. Kenny:</from>
          <p eId="para_390">I wish to share my time with Deputies Gay Mitchell and John Bruton. It is not every day I can state in the House that the eyes of the world are upon us without presenting Ireland as suffering either delusions of grandeur or acute paranoia, but today is precisely such a day.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">Europe has failed to reach agreement and this is certainly disappointing, but it must be regarded more as a delay than as a disaster. However, we cannot risk adding new fault lines to those that have appeared as a result of the war on Iraq. In January, it will fall to one country out of 25 to resolve the problem. The next country in line to shoulder that responsibility is Ireland. With the European Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference process over the past 20 months, there certainly has been, to borrow a phrase, a lot done. If the desired agreement is to be achieved before the accession of the ten new countries in May and the European elections in June, there is much more to do. For the sake of Europe, the Government cannot afford to sit back and do nothing until the Spanish elections are over and the summit meeting beckons.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">It is that tricky issue of leading and leadership that could yet prevent Ireland from playing an historic, as opposed to a mere historical, role in the new Europe. Above all else, leadership is exactly what securing the necessary agreement will require. It must be leadership based on principle and belief. This is a time for clarity and vision on the world stage. With the future of Europe at stake, there can be no equivocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">I had hopes for the new process adopted in these negotiations. The fact that the European Convention featured not just the 25 Governments of the member and candidate countries but the EU institutions and representatives of the various national parliaments augured well for achieving a positive result. It was sensed that such inclusive negotiations could yield a result based on what Europe needed in terms of efficiency and effectiveness as opposed to what individual Governments demanded. It is disappointing that all the hard work of the Convention has yet to bear fruit. In the end, the hangover from Nice proved problematic. Blaming individual countries for their perceived intransigence will do nothing to progress the desired agreement. Equally, we may never achieve agreement if the process is again ambushed by intergovernmental wrangling. It falls to Ireland to bring the recalcitrant bargainers back into dialogue at the earliest opportunity. The proposed double majority voting mechanism is a reasonable one.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">The Taoiseach and the Government, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs will not have an easy task. Instead of sitting back and waiting for agreement to be reached as if by some miracle, or even worse, passing the buck to the Dutch who assume the Presidency after Ireland, I suggest the Taoiseach and the Government act with alacrity and begin work on day one of Ireland's tenure. I urge the Taoiseach to facilitate immediately a series of bilateral negotiations between Germany and France and Spain and Poland. The Taoiseach must not be allowed to fool himself or Europe that the summit in March will be a new step in the negotiation process. That summit was scheduled on the assumption that agreement would have already been reached. For the sake of Europe and Ireland's credibility, the Taoiseach should make an honest and realistic examination.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">As a hard-core European leading a hard-core European party, I want to see agreement reached as soon as possible on anything that will make the EU more effective, efficient and democratic. This process was about making Europe more manageable, transparent, accountable and approachable so that it could be seen and perceived to operate on a human scale. A constitutional arrangement could have achieved much in each of those respects. I would like to see Ireland play a vital and an historic role in making that happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">This is a great opportunity for Ireland. It is an opportunity to show what a small island nation can achieve both in and for an enlarged Europe. Size does matter. It gives the message to all the new countries and those waiting for admission that a tiny island can heal, change, persuade, mend and even create a better Europe. As a nation, we are more than equal to this challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Now more than ever the world needs a strong Europe that speaks with one voice. The war on Iraq taught us an important lesson. Europe did not have the facility to speak with one voice and act cohesively and collectively. We were silenced and sidelined. In the interest of bringing a more enlightened view of the global interest, that cannot be allowed to happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The Taoiseach outlined some of the difficulties faced by the Government on the assumption of the Presidency from 1 January 2004. I wish him well in that work and assure him of my party's support where possible. The work of the Intergovernmental Conference continues. The Government faces a significant challenge. It is critical that Ireland uses its traditional gregariousness and negotiating and diplomatic ability to make further strides. I wish him well in his endeavours.</p>

          <from>Mr. G. Mitchell:</from>
          <p eId="para_399">I am grateful to Deputy Kenny for the opportunity to speak on this matter. There is some disappointment that the Italian Presidency did not reach its objective, but perhaps the Italians were a little eager to bring to a conclusion what has been a long drawn-out process involving both the Parliament and Government in this country and in other countries of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">I am pleased that, to some extent, a small state such as Ireland will have an opportunity to advance the Intergovernmental Conference. I do not like the idea of France and Germany seeing themselves as the locomotive of Europe, being able to stamp their own authority on the rules, such as what they will accept in the Growth and Stability Pact, holding joint Cabinet meetings of both countries and President Chirac standing in for Chancellor Schröder. There is the danger that this locomotive will set the pace for the rest of Europe. The Intergovernmental Conference is an Intergovernmental Conference and clearly it has decided that it is not yet ready to conclude. Now a small state such as ours will have the opportunity to advance that and perhaps bring it to a conclusion. I wish the Government well in that task.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">The Taoiseach should address the question of the democratic deficit and the role of national parliaments. The Amsterdam treaty advanced the role of national parliaments but the current Intergovernmental Conference proposes a further enhanced role for them. Even if the treaty under negotiation is not brought to a conclusion, it may be possible to start the process of national parliaments having such a role. Increasingly, we must realise that the entire ratification process will require 25 national parliaments, including this House, to be satisfied with it. The scrutiny process has shown that we are not prepared to be taken for granted. Some Ministers, and I include those present in the Chamber, have been well disposed to attend the Committee on European Affairs and to consider its views. Some Departments, however, have not yet realised that there is such a scrutiny process. The Government should signal its intention to support that process by trying to advance the cause of national parliaments, even before the Intergovernmental Conference concludes its deliberations.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">When Ireland assumes the Presidency of the European Union in January, the Committee on European Affairs will take over the chairmanship of COSAC, which comprises the European affairs committees of all 15 member states, the ten applicant countries and the European Parliament. Some 170 parliamentarians from those 25 countries will meet in Dublin in May. COSAC has invited the Taoiseach to open its conference and I hope he will have an opportunity to do so. In Italy and Greece, the Heads of State and Government played a part in that regard. The views and concerns of parliamentarians should be taken seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">I noted the Taoiseach's reference to the declaration on transatlantic relations, which I have not yet had an opportunity to read. I also note that the European Food and Safety Authority is to be located in Palma, while the Maritime Safety Agency is going to Lisbon as a result of the European Council meeting. Given that the EU is moving east, and given the special relations between Ireland and the United States and Canada, there is a case to be made for locating in Ireland some form of co-operation structure between the EU and North America. The Taoiseach should try to advance that matter, especially during the EU-US summit which is to take place here. I understand that there is some doubt as to whether President Bush will attend the summit, so perhaps the Taoiseach will say something about that in his response.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Given that the Intergovernmental Conference has not concluded its work, the terms of reference of the proposed chair of the European Council are important. From our point of view, anything that weakens the institutional balance or the relationship between the EU's institutions and its member states is a dangerous development. It would be easy for a powerful chairperson of the European Council to overshadow the Commission. If the President of the European Commission were also President of the European Council, the role of both institutions could become fused.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The Taoiseach should use Ireland's Presidency of the EU to consider the terms of reference of the person who will take on the role as chair of the European Council. That individual should have terms of reference to ensure that the roles of those institutions are not fudged. If the chair of the European Council oversteps his or her terms of reference, the Taoiseach should consider giving national parliaments a role in vetoing or removing him or her. The European Council is a creature of national parliaments so it may be possible to include such a measure in its terms of reference without having to rewrite the Intergovernmental Conference report.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">I may be in a minority but I am disappointed that we did not take the opportunity to have the protocol on defence drafted in such a way as to allow Ireland to opt into a common defence from the beginning, albeit on a case by case basis. There was an opportunity to do that. NATO members are being accommodated and non-NATO members may also be accommodated as a bloc, but I do not think our interests coincide with those of Austria, Finland and Sweden which are all armed and quite capable of defending themselves whereas we are not.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Rather than examining how we might stay out of a defence pact, we should ask ourselves what capacity we have to defend ourselves. If we had an opportunity to be in a defence entity or union, with the Dáil having the final word on a case by case basis, it would formalise what is <i>de facto</i> already the situation. I do not believe we would refuse to come to the defence of a member state if it were attacked, but it would also give us some cover. I hope the Taoiseach will use the opportunity of Ireland's EU Presidency to tease out some of these ideas. I join with Deputy Kenny in wishing the Taoiseach well during our EU Presidency, which will commence shortly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBruton" eId="spk_196">
          <from>Mr. J. Bruton:</from>
          <p eId="para_408">Between now and March, the Taoiseach should attempt to have the constitutional treaty agreed during the Irish EU Presidency. He was prudent to lower the expectations that he would be able to do anything between now and March, and I expect he will continue to adopt that stance in this debate. However, I urge him to go for it for a number of reasons. If he does not fix it up between now and March, we will be going straight into the European Parliament election campaigns. In the course of their domestic election campaigns, countries will take much more severe positions on issues that are still in contention. They may perhaps even retreat from matters to which they have already committed themselves, under the pressure of a domestic European election campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">If the constitutional treaty is delayed it will end up becoming entangled with the financial perspectives debate. I realise that debate will be launched in January during the Irish Presidency, but the real business on this matter will be done during the Dutch Presidency. The latter Presidency will have enough on its hands sorting out the financial perspectives and will thus be ill-equipped to deal with the constitutional question.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">As far as the financial perspectives are concerned, the Netherlands is the country that most wants to reduce the budget, so the Dutch will be in an outlying position on that issue, which does not make them especially well suited to be deal makers on the constitutional question. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be better placed than the Dutch Presidency to settle this matter and I strongly urge them to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">I also urge them to bear in mind that, if this treaty is concluded on the basis of matters that have already been agreed and are not in dispute, it will be a huge step forward for European democracy. This is because national parliaments, including the Dáil, will be involved in scrutinising EU legislation even before it is considered by the European Parliament or the European Council under the subsidiarity protocol. We will be involved and, through us, public opinion in Ireland will be alerted to EU legislation four or five years before it actually becomes law, whereas at present we often do not discover it until six or seven years after it has become law when somebody is prosecuted. If the treaty is accepted, this aspect of it will be a huge step forward for democracy, as also will be the holding of Council of Ministers' meetings in public session. Another element involves the constitutional treaty's step forward on qualified majority voting on EU legislation covering international crime which poses a huge threat to the lives and livelihoods of people in this city and every other city in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">If the Taoiseach can finalise this matter it would make this the greatest Irish EU Presidency in our history. I say that as somebody who oversaw a previous Presidency which was a comparative success in my view. If, however, the Taoiseach can pull this off, it will be the greatest Irish Presidency of all time. Nobody expects the Government to achieve it but, if it can be done, the Taoiseach will do us and Europe generally a fantastic, historic service. I urge him to make that effort.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">It is important to fix this matter while Mr. José Maria Aznar is still Prime Minister of Spain. A new Spanish premier will take office in March but will not have the confidence to settle this deal and unwind the position that Mr. Aznar had adopted up to now. The best chance the Taoiseach has of getting the Spanish down from the horse they have mounted is to do so while Mr. Aznar is still in office rather than when he has gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">If I were advising the Taoiseach, I would tell him to get on that plane and visit all the key EU capitals. The major mistake the Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, made was that he did not do a tour of capitals. I remember that during our EU Presidency we had to deal with much less difficult issues, although we did achieve the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Deputy Quinn and I had it fixed at the Dublin Summit but that was because I had done a tour of every capital and sat down with each of the leaders in their offices. Silvio Berlusconi did not do this before this summit. The Taoiseach will have an opportunity to do so. Perhaps there was an excuse for Silvio Berlusconi. He leads a very big country and big countries make bad Presidents under the system of rotating Presidencies. Small countries make good Presidents because their Heads of Government have a little more time. Somebody who has been six years in office and knows the shortcuts as well as the Taoiseach can make more time for himself or herself. I urge the Taoiseach strongly to take the risk, give it time and try to have this done during the Irish Presidency. I do not expect him to give a response now to what I am saying but say this to him in all sincerity, in the interests of Ireland and with confidence in what I believe he can achieve, as can the Minister.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte:</from>
          <p eId="para_418">We are debating the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference against a strange background. Normally, one would expect the failure of an international summit to feature on the front pages of Monday morning's newspapers but on this occasion there was no room because of the capture of Saddam Hussein. No democrat could fail to welcome the capture of the Iraqi dictator and express the hope the psychologically liberating effect of his capture will be long lasting. Similarly, no democrat could fail to express the hope that whatever trial is now arranged will satisfy the first requirement of not turning a dictator into a martyr and that whatever punishment is meted out for his crimes reflects civilised international norms.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The failure of the Intergovernmental Conference, relegated to the inside pages, must also raise questions for democrats. There is a temptation in a debate like this to concentrate on failure – there is no doubt, despite the success of the Council, that many will have been disappointed by the fact that the Intergovernmental Conference was not completed last weekend. However, I would like to begin by acknowledging one positive feature of the outcome, the fact that the leaders present decided not to repeat the mistake made in Nice and try to cobble together an agreement in which they did not believe themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The purpose of the Intergovernmental Conference is to produce a treaty which is comprehensible, accessible and practical. It is aimed at producing structures that will enable a significantly enlarged Union to function at least as well, if not better, than the current one. It is not aimed at fundamentally changing the character of the Union or the principles that underpin it. Because it is about structure and not, ostensibly at least, a principle, it might be thought that the task of reaching agreement is somewhat easier. One does not expect nations to negotiate about principle. By definition, fundamental issues of principle ought not be amenable to negotiation.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Negotiations on structures are a different matter because they are primarily about reconciling different interests. The only way to achieve a win-win outcome in such negotiations is to arrive at a conclusion in which everyone believes their interests will be reasonably protected in the longer term. Such negotiations, while they can be wearisome and time consuming, are worthwhile when that result is achieved. It means it is possible for everyone involved to promote the new treaty with enthusiasm and conviction. It is worth devoting the extra time to secure that result.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Perhaps the only real failure of the past weekend was the tight timeframe set for the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference. While it is ironic that the issue on which the talks failed was not one of the new big ideas in the draft treaty but the old question of the respective voting powers of member states, at least we now know where the main stumbling block lies. It appears to revolve around interest rather than principle. In that sense it is far better that the leaders accepted that agreement would not be reached over the weekend and that no attempt was made to push through a draft treaty that would have led to subsequent problems. That is not to say, however, that issues of principle do not arise in the negotiations. Even the issue of voting rights reflects the concern about democracy in its fullest sense, both the expression of majority will and also the determination to ensure minorities within the Union will never be oppressed. Neither can we be sure, until we see the final outcome, that Ireland's essential and legitimate interests have been fully protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Under both headings, principle and interest, we must reserve our final position until the treaty negotiations have been concluded but it has to be said that ever since it was originally negotiated, there has been wide recognition that the Nice treaty would not provide a suitable or appropriate basis for the long-term development of an expanded Union. Therefore, efforts to secure agreement on a new treaty must continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">I understand that behind the failure to reach agreement, the Italian Presidency was in a position to say it had reached conclusions on a paper covering many non-institutional issues and that it would have wished to publish that paper if the circumstances had been better. I understand, too, that it had in prospect a reasonable degree of consensus on issues important to us like taxation where we regard it as fundamentally important that unanimity be preserved. Even if the Italian paper is not published, I see no reason to believe the Italian Presidency would not be willing to share its information with the new Presidency. I assume the Government will now seek to take ownership of the document.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">It now falls to the Irish Presidency to seek to complete the job. In the reported comments of the Taoiseach over the weekend and also remarks made by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, there was a strong sense that both our representatives regarded this as a poisoned chalice, or at least a cup that they wished to pass from them as soon as possible. The Taoiseach, in particular, was widely reported as being frustrated at having to twiddle his thumbs throughout last weekend. Perhaps his frustration was the reason he found time to revisit and significantly rewrite history in terms of his and the Government's position on the Iraq war. Whatever about this, there are real grounds for concern in the image so far created, if the image reflects the reality, that the entire Government seems prepared to avoid these issues throughout the Irish Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">If the outstanding issues are not resolved before accession, they will be much harder to resolve after accession. If another European Council takes place in Dublin without success, the issues at stake will come to be seen as deeply intractable and the atmosphere necessary to produce agreement made unnecessarily more difficult. For this reason, the Government would be seriously shirking its duty if it were to spend its time preparing the ground for another failure, dampening down expectations in order that the outcome of the next Intergovernmental Conference would not reflect too badly here at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Endless talk about the need for a period of reflection will do nothing to solve the problem. The Government must now see itself in a leadership position and needs to start work immediately on the strategies to secure a breakthrough. It was not enough to say, as the Taoiseach was reported on Monday, that he would wait until the mood was right and that nothing would be done before March. He was also reported as saying that while completion during an Irish Presidency was not impossible, the variety of elections in the offing meant that it was all very unlikely. I understand there are difficulties but six months of stasis is not what the people of Europe deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">The draft treaty under negotiation was the result of the work of the Convention on the Future of Europe. The Convention was an unprecedented exercise in democratic consultation and virtually every political view in Europe was represented. It reached a remarkable degree of consensus. It is important that the momentum for reform it created is not lost in the aftermath of an unsuccessful summit. I argue that the central motivation of the Government as it takes over the Presidency must be to restore and sustain momentum. As part of that process, it should already be consulting as widely as possible on how momentum can be put back into the process. One initiative that should be considered is whether the Convention should be reconvened to advise on possible ways forward. Whatever approach is taken, I urge the Irish Presidency not to stand back.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">As far as the Labour Party is concerned, we will approach the outcome of the Irish Presidency as constructively and helpfully as possible but will be as critical as necessary of any lack of vigour in the process. The next six months must not be used simply as a public relations exercise enabling Ministers to swan around their constituencies with visiting dignitaries.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I am conscious that the Community at large is being urged to tighten its belt and that a number of particularly vulnerable groups are being subjected to savage and unnecessary cuts in social provision. I am conscious of the fact that the Italian Presidency was able to report some progress in the Presidency conclusions, including the accession of new countries. There is continuing progress in respect of reform in Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania while the European Council declaration on transatlantic relations is a helpful document.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">I genuinely hope the Government will succeed during its Presidency in furthering the aims and objectives of an accessible, cohesive, dynamic and socially integrated Union. The Labour Party will be as constructive as possible, provided we are satisfied as to the serious intent of the Government. We wish the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and their Government colleagues every success in their conduct of the Presidency.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" eId="spk_200">
          <from>Mr. Quinn:</from>
          <p eId="para_432">I fully support the comments made by my party leader, as well as Deputy John Bruton, on the issue of trying to resolve the impasse encountered last weekend. No one who is close to the action will be surprised with the outcome, which makes the matter all the more difficult. I endorse what has been said in this regard. As regards the Lisbon process and the agenda the Taoiseach will face in March, I am aware he met Wim Kok.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I have read the conclusions of the European Council which, on balance, make positive reading. Not many European Council conclusions are as comprehensive or positive in their achievements, including on what appeared to be an intractable problem, namely, the seats of the various centres. This demonstrates, as the Taoiseach has made clear, that intractable problems have solutions. Ultimately, solutions will be found to the vexed issue of the voting strengths of different countries and the question of whether qualified majority voting should be based on the double majority principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">I will make three brief points, to which I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, to respond. Mr. Kok will no doubt have told the Taoiseach, as he told others in Brussels over the weekend, that we are not on course to meet the timetable of the Lisbon process or strategy – the two words are used interchangeably. Our failure to obtain a decent outcome at the recent ECOFIN meeting and the effective destruction of the stability and growth pact will compound the damage.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">While the outcome of the ECOFIN and Eurogroup meetings at the end of November has been sidelined and obscured by other events, the commentators writing in the newspapers the following weekend indicated clearly that something serious was wrong in this area. Regardless of whether the Taoiseach likes it, the responsibility now rests with the Irish Presidency to decide at the ECOFIN Council whether it wants to ignore what was done by the Eurogroup and its effect on the European Commission and the authority of the Commissioner, or revisit the question of how to make the stability and growth pact work.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">In this context, the conclusions of the European Council under the employment heading and on changing the statistical basis for what constitutes capital investment or otherwise are of critical importance. In the next couple of months it will be essential from a European perspective to make progress in making the stability and growth pact work or enabling it to be rewritten in a manner which meets the requirements of the 12 eurozone states and others which would like to join. As a former Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach will be aware of the importance of this issue and the nature of the difficulties which surround it. Incidentally, one of the factors which contributed to the defeat of the Swedish referendum on membership of the eurozone was the perception last summer that the rules of the pact were not being properly adhered to and that large countries were being treated differently from smaller countries such as Portugal.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">Will the Taoiseach elaborate on the significance of the additional moneys allocated to Ireland under the trans-European networks programme? He referred to a motorway of the seas project and made passing reference to the completion of the Cork-Belfast-Dublin motorway. Will this funding, combined with the funding allocated in the budget, enable the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, to have a single programme and single contract for the completion of the motorway system between Dublin and the cities of Galway, Cork and Belfast? Most of the delay in the process and the most time-consuming element of delivering the motorway system occur in the pre-construction period, rather than when the contractor is on site. If the financial framework is signed off and the five year rolling programme proposed by the Ministers for Transport and Finance is possible, will the implications of the conclusions enable us to proceed, within the framework of the current rules of the stability and growth pact, to commission a single contract or set of contracts, have a single hearing and legal process and complete the project using one federal contract, as it were?</p>

          <p eId="para_440">The European Council special summit meeting ended in disagreement and breakdown on the proposed new constitution for the European Union. It now falls to the Irish Presidency to deal with the aftermath of the summit and prepare for the next step. I take a different view from earlier speakers. It is good there is difference and, therefore, debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">The Government should regard the Irish Presidency as a positive opportunity for reassessment and re-evaluation of the entire constitutional project. The breakdown is a vindication of many of the points raised by Sinn Féin in our extensive analysis of the draft constitution, the only such detailed analysis published by a political party in Ireland. Sinn Féin agrees that the simplification and consolidation of existing European Union treaties are necessary but opposes such a process being used to diminish national sovereignty and increase the power of the European Union, as the draft constitution did.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">We are opposed to the development of the European Union into a state and do not, therefore, accept the argument that it must have a constitution. This fundamental question must now be reopened during the Irish Presidency. The breakdown should be regarded not as a hitch in some inevitable process leading towards a single state but as an important crossroads and a chance to choose a new direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">As a party representing voters throughout Ireland and concerned about inequality and exploitation, not only here but also internationally, Sinn Féin has grave concerns about the implications of ratifying any new EU constitution. Our reading of the draft constitution leads us to believe the ongoing process of developing an economic and military superpower would be speeded up by ratifying such a constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">The draft constitution has been portrayed as a necessary consolidation and simplification of existing treaties but, as Ministers are aware, it is much more than this. It proposed fundamental changes in the structures of the European Union, gave those structures more power and the European Union a single legal personality for the first time. The effect of this would be to shift the balance of power yet further from sovereign national parliaments towards the European Union and take the single biggest step thus far in the creation of an EU superstate.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">The draft constitution has within it unresolved tensions between its objectives and principles, the powers of states and the role of the European Commission, and the desire for subsidiarity and the increased use of qualified majority voting. Some of these tensions emerged during the breakdown last weekend when we saw once again the larger states attempting to assert their dominance through the adoption of a new voting system which favoured them. We need to have a new debate in Ireland on these issues in the coming months. We need to ask, for example, whether the European Union can facilitate a transnational market economy while remaining a social economy with full employment as its core objective. Both of these goals were included in the constitutional treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">In terms of partition, while the treaty allows for special provisions for state aid and spending for the costs of reunifying Germany, it does not do so for Ireland where the arguments for funding all-Ireland infrastructure in energy, transport, telecommunications, health and education are compelling.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">There was little or no debate here on the judicial aspects of the treaty which would have significant implications. For example, the treaty envisaged a European framework law which would govern the mutual admissibility of evidence between member states. Such a proposal would be likely to result in evidence that is inadmissible in the courts of many member states being deemed admissible if obtained in another member state.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The Taoiseach at the Brussels Summit used the opportunity to say he had opposed the US invasion of Iraq all along. I just wish to refer to this briefly. This was much to the surprise of everybody inside and outside the House. Will the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, in replying to the debate, advise us whether he opposed the war all along?</p>

          <from>Ms Harkin:</from>
          <p eId="para_449">When reflecting upon what happened, or did not happen, in Brussels at the weekend, I consider two realities of the EU. The first is the vision, that is, Europe at peace after centuries of war with the European Coal and Steel Treaty replacing the coal that powered the engines of war and the steel which was part of the killing machine. There is a second reality of the EU, namely, power politics. It concerns influence, control and the wielding of power.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Both these realities have co-existed up to now to some extent with compromise, negotiations and consensus. However, the breakdown of negotiations last weekend has cast a cloud over the future direction of Europe. It has certainly put the brakes on the speeding freight train which was being driven largely by Chancellor Schröder and the former President, Giscard d'Estaing. It has yet to be seen whether the train has slowed down or has been derailed.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Now that we have had time to reflect on the outcome in Brussels, a number of questions need to be asked. One is of particular concern to many Europeans, namely, whether we are going too far, too fast. Are the soon-to-be 25 member countries of the EU being asked to bite off more than they can chew?</p>
          <p eId="para_452">For many Irish people, in particular, there is a sense of unease. We have just voted twice on the Nice treaty. We are barely out of the polling booths when we are being asked to vote on a new constitution for Europe. The fact that these three votes come so soon after one another does not indicate a problem in itself. The reality is, however, that many people might like to see whether the Nice treaty works. Can we learn lessons? Do we need to change? What do we need to change? Would our experience of the Nice treaty guide us down an alternative route?</p>
          <p eId="para_453">These are legitimate questions and while I, as a pro-European, could see the need to simplify the treaties and bring Europe closer to its citizens, I am aware that many people, including my constituents, view this new constitution with some scepticism. Even the word "constitution" is too much for too many people, especially those who changed their vote between the first and second Nice treaty referendums. This should not have been called a constitution, rather another treaty based on previous treaties that seeks to regulate the relationship between EU states and ensure that the Presidency, Parliament and Commission work more efficiently. That is what is most important and, in the end, will be the glue that holds the EU together.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">As a pro-European, I believe it is an important but extremely delicate project. Leaders should lead, but if there is a sense that they are going too far ahead of their electorates, then it is time to pause and reflect. In this context, I fully understand the position of Poland. It had just passed a referendum on accession to the EU and was being asked to change the goalposts before accession. The Nice treaty may have suited the Poles and not the Germans. It did, but it was agreed. The ink was barely dry on the agreement when change was proposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">The draft constitution has many pluses, for example, national parliaments will be more closely involved in the process of making European legislation, the UN Charter of Fundamental Human Rights will apply to EU citizens and 1 million EU citizens, working collectively, can petition the EU. These are just a few of the many pluses we may have lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I am concerned that the failure to reach agreement may fuel the arguments of many Euro sceptics who consistently ignore the positive aspects of the EU. Working collectively in an increasingly globalised world, we have found in the EU that the whole is better than the sum of its parts. I wish the Taoiseach and the Government well in the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sargent:</from>
          <p eId="para_457">I also speak as a pro-European. I do not need to remind the Government that the Laeken Declaration, which gave rise to the Convention and eventually the draft constitutional treaty, set out to bring the European Union closer to its citizens. The Government must keep this in mind as it steers a course through the six month Presidency. However, the Green Party is deeply concerned about several key aspects of the draft treaty's content.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">We do not accept the apparent official consensus that the problematic issues concern voting weights within the Council of Ministers. We have no difficulty with the concept of a double majority but believe that it will lead to inbuilt inequality between larger and smaller states unless addressed elsewhere. For this reason we would support equal representation being given to each member state on the Commission. We do not believe the Government should yield on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">We are concerned that a President of the European Union has been introduced despite that this was not specifically sought by most member states and that the rotating Presidency has been done away with although it has proved to be an extremely effective mechanism to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Substantive policy issues, such as defence, the common commercial policy and the EURATOM Treaty, as well as making Gaeilge an official EU language are not being given the consideration or the public debate they deserve. In the case of the EURATOM Treaty, there has been little formal debate on this at the Intergovernmental Conferences. At a previous Intergovernmental Conference, Austria rather than Ireland proposed that the Union should undertake a review conference on the treaty. However, at the conclave of Foreign Ministers in Naples on 28 and 29 November, when Austria again raised the issue and sought a review conference, strong opposition was expressed by France and the issue has apparently not been discussed further. Following the conclave, Austria put forward a suggestion that a declaration be attached to the final Act of the constitutional treaty calling for an Intergovernmental Conference on the EURATOM Treaty to be convened as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">Ireland's poor running on this issue is a disgrace given that the spectre of Sellafield is so close to us. We need to insist on a "sunset" clause as a bottom line. The defence provisions of the constitutional treaty are a matter of enormous concern to many Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">Article 40.6 concerns structural co-operation and is a significant advance on the enhanced co-operation mechanisms within the Nice treaty. Under Article 40.6, only those countries participating in the structural co-operation mechanism can participate in decision making, yet the group of states involved will be embarking on admissions under the auspices of the EU. Ireland as a supposedly neutral state, appears to have had little difficulty with the implications of this defence provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">Article 40.7 involves what can only be described as a mutual defence commitment by all member states. A proviso has been added to the clause to the effect that that the provision will not prejudice the specific arrangements of an individual member state. This may be viewed as merely a figleaf. It attempts to conceal the extent to which Irish neutrality has effectively been undermined by this draft treaty. Article 40.2, or what is known as the solidarity clause, commits members to assist another member state should it fall victim to a terrorist attack or even be subjected to the threat of such an attack. This clause, and the inclusion of the issue as appropriate to terrorist threats, bears an unfortunate resemblance to the pre-emptive doctrine of the United States. The Green Party is concerned about the failure of the Government to protect Irish neutrality strongly through the negotiation of a protocol to the treaty – similar to that secured by the Danes following the Maastricht Treaty – exempting Ireland from the necessity to participate in or contribute financially to military activities of the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">The issue of the common commercial policy as set out within the draft treaty, in particular the potential of Articles 111 to 217 to remove decisions on how health and education services are provided from the control of the member states, is of grave concern. It seems that those who argue that the new treaty enshrines the neo-liberal economic agenda are correct. Unless the Government uses its position during the Presidency to reverse the changes made to the protective clauses of Article 133 of the Nice treaty, the people will see their health and education services gradually privatised over the next decade.</p>

What effect will the outcome of the elections have on north Cyprus?

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_208">
          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</from>
          <p eId="para_467">Cyprus is successfully concluding its accession to the European Union and will join on 1 May. The hope was that a united Cyprus would join on that date. Following the failure earlier this year of UN mediated negotiations on a political settlement to the Cyprus problem, the European Council meetings in March, June and December reiterated the EU position which supports a comprehensive settlement within the framework of plans proposed by the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan. We are ready to assist in whatever way we can during our Presidency and continue to hope agreement can be reached in that time to permit the accession of a united Cyprus on 1 May.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">We share the view that a comprehensive settlement will involve difficult compromises. The December European Council concluded that there was a good prospect of reaching a just, viable and functional settlement by 1 May consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. It again urged all parties concerned, particularly Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership, to strongly support the UN Secretary General's efforts and, in that context, called for an immediate resumption of the talks on the basis of his proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">The impact of the outcome of the elections in northern Cyprus earlier this week is not yet clear. The pro-settlement party scored a narrow victory over Denktash's supporters in the popular vote. However, because of the proportional system of allocating seats, both sides will be equally represented with 25 seats in the Parliament of what they call the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. If either side fails to form a government, the elections will be rerun in two months' time. That would considerably reduce the time available to negotiate a settlement and hold separate referenda in both parts of the island before 1 May. Rauf Denktash's position as chief negotiator for the people of northern Cyprus is not under threat. Primary responsibility for the collapse of the UN mediated talks on 10 March 2003 in The Hague was ascribed to him by the UN Secretary General in his report to the Security Council.</p>

One proposal, which my party leader brought forward, was that the Irish Presidency would consult the Convention in a manner of its own choosing, whether that was in the Praesidium or somewhere else, to see if it would be possible to find a way forward from the conflicting position, the anvil upon which the Intergovernmental Conference had broken down. Perhaps the Minister will indicate the Government's attitude to the involvement of the Convention in whatever form might be considered appropriate.</p>

          <p eId="para_471">It is important to point out that before the Thessaloníki Summit under the Greek Presidency it was made clear that the mandate of the Convention was to be completed by the presentation of a Convention text which would end its consultative process. One heard at that Council genuine tributes to the quality of the work done which, in many cases, had exceeded the expectations of many of the Heads of State and Government. While one is, in the context of these consultations, in listening mode and taking soundings, formally or informally, from those involved in the process at the various stages, I do not see a structured re-entry of the Praesidium in that scenario. It would further complicate the situation in terms of the role of the Convention and the the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">The Taoiseach will be available for soundings, to take opinions and listen to all sides on this issue. There are no proposals for a structured re-entry of the Praesidium. Many are interested in this project on which they have views. We would be wise to listen to every view as we try to use our Presidency to further advance the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">As regards some of what was said previously, it is important to point out that as regards the negotiations, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. There are two texts on the table – the Convention text and the post-Naples Summit text of 9 December. Subsequent further discussions have taken place. We will be taking soundings from the Italian Presidency on its view of the situation. We will also take soundings from individual member states about their positions. We cannot make any assumptions. We have an incomplete set of negotiations. There was general recognition at the Intergovernmental Conference's final meeting on Saturday that substantial progress had been made under the Italian Presidency. However, people will not sign off on all or part of the treaty until we have a complete negotiated settlement.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">Everyone recognises the work done and the genuine efforts made. It is more the rule than the exception that Intergovernmental Conferences are not completed in the Presidencies in which they begin. We have had an intensive ten weeks of negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference, which followed more than 16 months of consideration by the Convention. Unfortunately, it was not possible to complete the negotiations. However, it is important to inform the House that there was no sense of recrimination or failure. We are talking about recognition by all sides. A call was made by the Italian Presidency, with which there was broad agreement, that it would not be possible to reach an agreement that would meet with the satisfaction of everyone if we were to continue over the weekend. There is now time to reflect and allow everyone to consider the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">We got a mandate from the Council, by which we must abide, to consult, assess and report to the Council at the spring European Council. As regards some of the contributions we made, people should not be under any illusion about the commitment we will bring to this process. We must recognise that sufficient political will must be mustered to achieve a successful and total outcome to the various outstanding issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_477">Has the issue of the EURATOM Treaty been addressed since 28 or 29 November? Following the example by Austria, will Ireland convene an Intergovernmental Conference on the treaty? It would be appropriate to have such a debate in Ireland given the difficulties associated with renewable energy, particularly the fact that Eirgrid is blocking the inclusion of wind energy on the grid and the favourable treatment being given to nuclear power.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">Council Directive 1/1958 will be amended in May to include several new official languages which will bring the total to 20. We have received many representations on this matter. Given the development of the European Union, it seems that English, French and German are the <i>de facto</i> working languages. It would not be as big a burden as some suggest to include Irish as an official language, given that everything written or spoken does not need to be translated. Given that Ireland will be a net contributor to the European Union, having been a net recipient heretofore, would it not be a good time to provide a level playing pitch and establish our national language as an official language? Údarás na Gaeltachta and others would benefit in a material way from such a measure.</p>

He said that the defence Europe had rejected 40 years ago and which was impossible a few years ago will be an important step towards a political Europe which is capable of playing its part on the international scene. He asserted that the decisions taken are in the interests of all Europe and of NATO. What are the Minister's views on and reaction to President Chirac's statement?

        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_223" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
          <from>Mr. Cowen:</from>
          <p eId="para_490">President Chirac is obviously referring to the fact that his security and defence tradition is reflected in the text which has been agreed. Our defence and security tradition is also reflected in the text and has been agreed. Anybody who has studied this area since the Maastricht treaty, when a treaty basis was given to the development of a security and defence policy in the European Union, will be aware that the then Irish Government secured a safeguard clause which confirmed that nothing in the treaty shall prejudice the specific character of the defence or security policy of a member state.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">That is a reflection of the Community method of negotiation. Under that method, there is an accommodation recognising that there are different security and defence traditions and policies within the European Union. Some member states are NATO members and others, such as Ireland, are not. That safeguard clause has been reflected in successive treaties since then regarding change, update, modification or adaptation of European security and defence policy. It remains in this text as well. It is something we fought for and obtained in the negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">President Chirac secured a reflection of his security and defence tradition in the text and policy, but so did Ireland. The purpose of the policy, from our point of view, is that we retain independence of action and that we take sovereign decisions as a Government and Parliament in compliance with the Defence Acts in respect of any area of participation in which we will be involved. There is no automatic obligation or enforcement upon this country of security and defence traditions with which we might not be comfortable or find satisfactory. That has been maintained in the negotiations I conducted and it is accepted by all member states. The discussions take place in an atmosphere of mutual respect for the fact that there are different traditions. Just as we must and should reasonably seek to ensure that our tradition is reflected so we can participate in a way that is consistent with that tradition, it is not reasonable to suggest that negotiation is possible whereby one would obliterate the security and defence tradition of other member states which come from a different tradition.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">With regard to the planning cell arrangements, there are three layers of involvement in security and defence policy within the European Union. The first layer relates to where there are NATO led operations with European participation. The second relates to where there are European led operations with NATO assets. The third relates to deciding in what areas the European Union would operate alone. This is what is called the Berlin Plus principles. In other words, to avoid duplication of assets and to ensure that policies work effectively between all member states, these principles are the basis of the security and defence policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">The discussion taking place about this treaty relates to the third stratum, which is the circumstances in which the EU should act in the event of NATO assets not being involved in a crisis management operation or in an instance where there is no NATO military involvement. That is the point under discussion. Members have agreed that there should be a situation where developing capabilities should be worked out autonomously from other obligations states might have to other organisations such as NATO.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">The bottom line for Ireland in this area is to secure a situation where our participation in the policy concerned remains as before in terms of maintaining the sovereign decision within the Government and Parliament. With regard to other arrangements, it is a matter for us to decide at any time in the future whether we wish to opt into a structured co-operation arrangement, for example, obtaining through public procurement procedures, at the best possible rate, the necessary equipment to ensure our Army is professionally prepared in the interests of our security and should we participate in any crisis management operations and enhanced Petersberg Tasks operations. Complete freedom and independence of action for Ireland in the context of the development of security and defence policy has been Ireland's negotiating goal under successive Governments.</p>

He also said the list remains open and that there is potential to add projects. In this context, he mentioned the Cork-Dublin-Belfast road project and the UK electricity interconnector. Three of these four projects will not contribute significantly to balanced regional development. Will the Minister consider ensuring that one of the Cork-Dublin-Belfast links, whether it be road or rail, travels through the south and east coast and the other along the west and north coast?

The Minister for Transport will continue to see in what way a review of the annual cycle at the spring summit can be used to add further projects that might be eligible or would obtain assistance.

          <p eId="para_501">On Deputy Kenny's question, as the Taoiseach said in his opening statement, the Government welcomes the declaration on transatlantic relations adopted at the European Council. The declaration underscores the importance of the EU's relationship with the US in particular. It emphasises that acting together, the EU and US can be a formidable force for good in the world. Strengthening this relationship will be a particular priority for us during our Presidency of the European Union. We are scheduling an EU-US summit during our tenure. Dates and location are under discussion with the US Administration and this will involve contact with the Secretary of State at my level in preparation for the summit.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The declaration also stresses the significance of the EU-Canada relationship. The Government welcomes the progress to date on the review of the EU-Canada relations.

Dates and location are under discussion with the Canadians.</p>

Efforts were made – we must discuss the situation with the Italian Presidency – in bilateral and trilateral meetings during the Intergovernmental Conference meetings in Brussels to collate and identify from the Presidency's point of view what areas of agreement or further modification will be needed, in addition to the papers formally tabled. A further text has not been tabled which would indicate broad consensus beyond the issues suggested in the post-Naples document. Different views have been expressed. There are two texts. We will discuss with the Presidency the precise nature of all the bilateral and trilateral discussions, their view of what people were prepared to bear and what was the point of breakdown specifically. As I said, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. It is an incomplete negotiation.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">We had a meeting with the Italian Presidency on Friday night and made clear our position on the issue the Deputy raised. We received a full hearing and there was a full understanding on the part of the Presidency as to our position in the matters. Unfortunately, when we returned on Saturday afternoon, it was clear there would not be an overall agreement. The Italian Presidency outlined to the Intergovernmental Conference meeting the issues it felt would require to be addressed, particularly the issue of unanimity. Ultimately, it felt that the institutional questions would not be resolved. Obviously we have a view as a country where these negotiations have taken us. Given the Presidency, we must take soundings and consult with all other countries to ensure we hear directly from them the rate of progress they envisage. We can then assess the situation and try to construct a negotiating outcome which would be successfully sustained by all.</p>

        <heading>Nally Group Report on Omagh Bombing: Statements.</heading>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_229">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</from>
          <p eId="para_505">On 22 March 2002 the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Mrs. Nuala O'Loan, presented a report to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. The report related to allegations made by a person described as a serving officer of the Garda Síochána concerning the handling of intelligence information about the activities of a paramilitary group in that year and about drug related matters in the period 1995 to 1996.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">The Minister for Foreign Affairs passed the report to my predecessor, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, who, in view of the gravity of the allegations involved, decided an examination of the issues should be carried out independently by Dr. Dermot Nally, former Secretary to the Government, Mr. Joseph Brosnan, former Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Mr. Eamon Barnes, former Director of Public Prosecutions, with the terms of reference to examine matters arising from the report raising concerns of the activity of the Garda Síochána during 1998, dated 22 March 2002, prepared by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and on the basis of the examination to report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and, if considered appropriate, to make recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">I received the group's report earlier this year and I have consulted the Attorney General about it. It is against that background that I am now making this statement. Certain legal issues arise because all the allegations which the group looked into were made by a member of the Garda Síochána who is suspended and facing criminal charges on unrelated matters. In those circumstances, in making a summary of the group's findings publicly available at this stage, I want to make it clear that nothing I say is intended to, or should be taken as, reflecting on the general credibility of the person in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">In summary, the group has informed me that the allegations can be summarised under three headings. The first is incidents which it is alleged could have been prevented. These are allegations that actions which could and should have been taken by the Garda Síochána could have prevented three terrorist attacks in Northern Ireland in 1998, that is, the mortar attack on the RUC station at Armagh on 10 March, the mortar attack on Beleek RUC station on 9 May and the bomb attack on Omagh on 15 August. The second is alleged ministerial interference with prosecution process. This is an allegation of a ceasefire deal after the Omagh bomb between the Irish Government and the Real IRA and of ministerial interference in the judicial process. The third is alleged unlawful or improper conduct on the part of Garda officers. These are allegations of encouragement or of complicity in criminal offences or other improper conduct by senior Garda officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">The group has informed me that it held its first meeting on 29 April 2002 and subsequently met on 62 occasions. It interviewed 25 persons, some more than once. It received a number of written submissions, some from people it did not consider necessary to interview in person. In particular, the group states as follows:</p>
          <p eId="para_510">When setting up the Group your predecessor indicated that the Garda Commissioner had confirmed that the Group would have the full co-operation of the Garda authorities, including access to all relevant material. The Group wishes you to know it has received this full co-operation and access. The Group's thanks are due also to other persons including serving and retired PSNI officers who helped it in its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">My predecessor, when announcing the establishment of the group, indicated that he would make a statement on the group's findings. In accordance with this commitment, I can now inform the House that the group has informed me that it concluded that there was no foundation for the allegations which it examined. While there was never a commitment that the report would be published, I am aware of the strong desire of the relatives of those killed in the appalling atrocity at Omagh for what has become known as the Nally report to be published. I am also aware that the failure to do so may lead some to suggest that the State is refusing to come clean. I will return to that suggestion before concluding my remarks.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">If there were no other considerations of the wider public interest I would be more than happy to put the report into the public domain. It is a lucid and compelling document and if people had access to it few if any would dispute its conclusions. The group's covering letter states that the report "deals with highly sensitive matters involving the security of the State and possible risk to the lives of individuals. It also describes Garda operational procedures and methods, public disclosure of which could adversely affect future operations."  I hope it will be generally accepted by Members of this House that under these circumstances no Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, no matter how strong his or her desire to deal with the concerns of the relatives, could put such a report into the public domain. To issue a redacted form of the report is not a practical proposition as it would require the deletion not only of the names of individuals but also of details of operational procedures and methods to an extent which would render the logic and force of the report nugatory and its conclusions no more meaningful.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">There have been many media reports about allegations that the group was asked to examine. I do not propose to comment on or respond in detail to this speculation. There is, however, one suggestion that has been persistently reported which, subject to the constraints I have outlined, I must deal with specifically: that the Garda failed to pass on to the RUC information which could have prevented the Omagh bombing. It is hardly necessary for me to spell out the grave implications of this if it were true. Everyone will understand why such an allegation is of such profound concern to the Omagh relatives and all right-thinking people. In fact, no such allegation was made to the group. On this point the group says:</p>
          <p eId="para_514">The core allegations. . .  about events preceding the Omagh bombing are that: a senior Garda officer would have been prepared, if a vehicle had in fact been stolen. . .  to allow it to go through in order to protect [an] informant; and [that] no intelligence was passed to the RUC about information, alleged to have been received on the eve of Omagh that the RIRA, who had been trying to steal a vehicle in the Dublin area, had obtained one elsewhere (place, vehicle type and destination unspecified).</p>
          <p eId="para_515">These are very serious allegations. However they are quite different from allegations that the Gardaí let the vehicle which was used in the bombing in Omagh go through or that they had intelligence about that vehicle. . .  which they had failed to pass on to the RUC. No such allegations have been made to the Group and no basis for any such allegations has come to its attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">As I outlined earlier, the group dismissed the allegations as being without foundation.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">The group also made some recommendations. In doing so it stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_518">The Group's only general recommendations relate to the desirability, while preserving confidentiality and security, of keeping better records of North/South contacts and exchanges in intelligence matters, and a written code of instructions and guidelines on intelligence-gathering and agent-handling.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">The Group understands that action has now been taken on both of these matters but recommends that the arrangements should be reviewed in the light of its report. The Group also recommends that consideration should be given to whether legislation covering intelligence-gathering and agent-handling would be desirable.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">These recommendations are receiving the necessary attention from me and the Garda Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">I am sure all Members of the House are grateful to the members of the group for undertaking a difficult task in the best traditions of public service. That such a group concluded that the allegations had no foundation is to be welcomed, not least by those gardaí who have been living under their shadow. However, I am aware from my contacts with the Omagh relatives that some of them will be disappointed that I am not in a position to offer further information. I emphasise that had evidence of Garda wrongdoing been established by the group there would have been no hesitation on my part or that of the Government in making that finding public.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">What I have set out today is not my assessment of the allegations in question but that of the independent group asked to examine them. I do not believe any Member of this House would have grounds for calling its work into question. I am aware of calls which have been made for a public inquiry into these matters on the basis that it would dispel people's genuine concerns, but on the basis of the group's report there are no grounds for such an inquiry to be established. Any repetition of unfounded allegations will not change that. What happened that day at Omagh was one of the worst outrages in the history of this island. Accordingly, allegations of culpability on the part of the Garda Síochána or others must be fully examined and that has been done.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">Earlier I said that the non-publication of this report, for what I and the investigation group believe are valid security reasons, may lead some to suggest that the State is refusing to come clean. I doubt that any reasonable person approaching this matter in a fair-minded and objective way will consider it remotely likely or credible that not just one but all three of the following criteria apply. First, a group of senior gardaí, knowing the truth to be otherwise, have conspired to distort and misrepresent the facts about one of the most serious atrocities in the history of this island. Second, the Government of the day has decided to support that Garda conspiracy. What motive could any Government have for such action? Why, if such a conspiracy exists, are so many members of the Real IRA behind bars? Why would the Garda or the Government risk exposing the conspiracy by continuing to pursue the perpetrators vigorously – a pursuit which has already resulted in one of those involved serving a sizeable prison sentence? Third, three distinguished individuals whose integrity is not at issue and who, as they have acknowledged, were provided with access to all relevant material, have proceeded to join in and support the other conspirators in a cover-up. The likelihood that any of these is true must be considered remote. The likelihood that all three apply is non-existent.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">It must be appreciated that even though a reasonable person objectively considering claims made about any atrocity involving major loss of life may conclude that the claims do not stand up to scrutiny, it does not necessarily follow that those who have directly suffered the consequences of the outrage will readily be able to bring themselves to take the same view. It is a perfectly understandable human reaction for people whose lives have been scarred by such outrages to attach weight to accounts and interpretations of events, especially those presented by what are taken to be informed sources, in the hope that they may help to explain or throw more light on the circumstances that have brought unbearable tragedy and suffering to their lives. Understandable though that reaction may be, responsible commentators, especially those in positions of authority, do no service to those who grieve when they persist in lending credence to presentations of events that lead us away from rather than towards the truth, even if it is done in the name of keeping hope alive.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">Against this background, it would be the height of irresponsibility for me to put in the public domain information that would be of use only to terrorists in waging their campaigns. We should not lose sight of the fact that the cruel mass murder at Omagh was committed by terrorists who are intent on using violence to overturn the democratic will of the people on this island. Our continued priority should be to support and assist the Garda Síochána and the PSNI in their fight to defeat the evil agenda of the perpetrators and bring them to justice. As I indicated earlier through the Taoiseach, I am prepared to revisit this matter when we have more time in the new Dáil term.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_230">
          <from>Mr. Kenny:</from>
          <p eId="para_526">When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform met the families of the victims of the Omagh bombing during the summer he gave an undertaking to make a detailed statement to the Dáil on the Nally report when the House resumed at the end of September. I regret that it has taken so long for this to come about, although I understand the complications. However, aspects of the report were selectively leaked to a certain journalist in the meantime, including the main conclusions and the Government's intention never to publish it in full. This information is contrary to the repeated answers given to the House by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, most recently last Thursday when the Tánaiste told the House that the Minister "has the report and is anxious to publish it as quickly as possible". This follows similar replies given by the Taoiseach on 5, 12 and 19 November. I regret that this commitment is not being honoured but I appreciate there are sensitive elements that cannot be put in the public domain.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">The bombing in Omagh in August 1998 was the worst single atrocity in the history of Northern Ireland. It left 31 innocent people dead and many more wounded. I have met the families of the victims and my only interest is in ensuring that they get the truth and justice for their loved ones. Their suspicions can only have been increased when they discovered that the Taoiseach had blatantly misled them about the contacts between the Government and the Real IRA, following the Omagh atrocity, and the fact that he has persistently refused to meet with them. We do not want a repeat of last week, which saw the impact of a 30 year wait in the case of the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. I do not want the Omagh families to be subjected to that kind of delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">I am grateful to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for providing me with a copy of the Nally report last Friday. Unlike the Minister and the Department, I do not have the benefit of five months to consider it. I do not want to jeopardise in any way any legal proceedings or other investigations, therefore, I do not propose in this contribution to comment to any great extent on the details of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">As pointed out by the Minister, the report was commissioned on the basis of information provided by the Northern Ireland police ombudsman, Nuala O'Loan, who, I understand, was given an assurance that the Nally group would meet her again before the report was finalised. Perhaps the Minister will explain why this did not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">Having read the report in the short time since I received it, I am not happy with it for a number of reasons. A key participant was not interviewed by the group. In a report which seeks to draw conclusions from seriously conflicting evidence, this is a major omission. The report does not adequately explain why a group appointed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform could not have done more to secure an interview with this participant. In addition, there appears to be unresolved conflict in a key area between the information supplied to the group by the PSNI and that supplied by the Garda Síochána – a direct contradiction in regard to a serious matter of evidence and intelligence. It is disappointing that the report makes no attempt to resolve this conflict, regardless of whether it is an issue of the degree of intelligence or a difference of opinion between the police forces or between individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">It should also be noted that the allegations which prompted the report appear to be given far more credence by the authorities in Northern Ireland than in this jurisdiction. The House will be aware that a person is facing trial in the Northern Ireland courts on 15 charges, one of which relates to Omagh. In the meantime I appeal to the Minister and the Taoiseach to meet with the Omagh families, perhaps to brief them on the scope of the work of the Nally group and on the conclusions reached. It would be difficult to refuse a meeting when it is requested. Such a meeting will convince the Government that the report on its own is not sufficient to satisfy the Omagh victims and their families. This is in no way a reflection on the eminent former public servants who served on this group, but they are not professional investigators and further investigations will be required to resolve the outstanding issues. I look forward to the more detailed statements on the report in the House in the new year and to comment on matters arising from the report and on issues with which it has not dealt.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_231">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte:</from>
          <p eId="para_532">In respect of the allegations that have given rise to the Nally report, there can be no argument but that they are the most profoundly serious that could be made against a law enforcement agency tasked with the preservation of life and public safety. In particular, the families bereaved and the individuals wounded and maimed by the devastating bomb attack on Omagh were entitled to every assurance that these allegations would be investigated independently and rigorously. There could be no reasons of state that would justify a cover up.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">The report's firm conclusion is that "there is no foundation for the allegations" and "the allegations were a direct consequence of and were motivated by concerns arising from the difficulties in which the named garda found himself with his superiors in the Garda Síochána and with the criminal law."  The group conducted its own inquiries which it details in its lengthy report. In addition, the PSNI forwarded to the group a transcript of a statement made to its officers by the garda detective in Scotland. The group was advised that parts of the transcript had been removed on the grounds, bizarrely it seems, that they were defamatory. Are police investigations usually hampered by fears that defamatory matter might lie on the file? Additional correspondence was received from the PSNI. That force has requested that it be consulted about any intention to place sensitive details in the public domain.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The group advises that its report deals with highly sensitive matters involving the security of the State and possible risk to the lives of individuals. It also describes operational procedures and methods, the public disclosure of which, it says, could adversely affect future operations. In these circumstances, a copy of the report has been furnished to me by the Minister, for which I am grateful, and I am now given the opportunity to make a brief statement in the House. The sensitivity of its contents has been impressed upon me and the Minister's intention not to publish the report has been made known to me in advance.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">I am aware that the Minister has committed himself, since at least August 2003, to addressing the House on the Nally report. He has not, so far as I know, committed himself to its publication, either in its entirety or on a redacted basis. As I am conscious of the high degree of sensitivity attached to the report, I will not place any more of it in the public domain than the Minister has done, nor in the time available to me am I in a position to query the group's methodology of analysis, to point to unexplored lines of inquiry, to put forward alternative hypothesis or to second-guess its conclusions. I confirm that the Nally report, which I have now returned to the Minister, details the allegations made by the garda in question in statements and interviews, that it also details the rebuttals provided by the officers of the Garda Síochána against whom the claims were made and that the balance of the evidence leads, compellingly, according to the members of the group, to the conclusion that these claims are false and without foundation. I confirm also that in the course of its analysis and findings the report goes into matters of Garda procedure and method, including, for example, the handling of informants, in a detail which I would not expect to be put into the public domain.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">Yesterday, a further seven suspected dissident republicans were arrested in Limerick and Cork. None of us is in a position to dismiss the continuing real and substantial threat to the peace process constituted by these groups and the importance of continuing police work to counter that threat. However, the Minister's decision not to publish this report will cause great distress and anxiety to the Omagh families. Security sources on both sides of the Border claim to know the identity of those involved in the bombing but say they are unable, at this stage, to charge them because of insufficient evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">At a stage when there is still no prospect of a successful criminal prosecution, the families have placed their hopes in civil litigation against the bomb suspects. They have sought the assistance of the authorities in both jurisdictions for that purpose. The Minister and the Government must make up their minds on a fundamental question. Are they willing to lend their full support to the civil case? What assistance can the Government offer to the Omagh victims and their families in circumstances where all right-thinking citizens want to support and assist them, as has already been done, to some extent, by the British authorities?</p>
          <p eId="para_538">The Omagh victims and their families have already suffered the crocodile tears of Mr. Gerry Adams and others in Sinn Féin who, shockingly, cited "historical as well as contemporary reasons" for refusing to call on those with information on the bombing to pass it on to either police force on this island. They have no need of further expressions of sympathy, no matter how genuine, if they are accompanied by a refusal to provide any concrete and worthwhile assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">The Government has confirmed that the House will return to this issue in the new year. There will be further statements and an opportunity for the Minister to answer questions. I strongly believe that, notwithstanding what the Minister has just said, he should use the intervening period to examine whether a version of this report that does not prejudice ongoing security operations may be made available to the Omagh families. The House and the families would expect no less.</p>

          <p eId="para_546">At the time of the Omagh atrocity I utterly deplored the bombing. I accused those responsible for the atrocity of attempting to destroy the peace process and I said their ill-conceived campaign set back the cause they claimed to serve. I reiterate each of those points this evening. I also express, once again, the deepest sympathy and condolence of my party and myself to all those who lost loved ones or who suffered injury in the bombing.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">It is unsatisfactory that some parties and the Independent Deputies are being asked to make statements on a report which they have not yet seen. Why have some Opposition party leaders had sight of this report while others have been denied the same access? I note with regret that the Minister and the Government have decided not to publish the report. As the Minister has indicated he will revisit the report on the floor of this House in the future, are the Minister and the Government also prepared to revisit their decision regarding publication?</p>
          <p eId="para_548">In the North of Ireland the police ombudsman's report on Omagh called for a review of the role and function of the RUC special branch. As Sinn Féin has pointed out time and again that one of the fundamental problems with the current policing arrangements in the North is the incorporation of the RUC special branch in the PSNI. The special branch was described in the Patten report as a force within a force. Of course, there are many accusations surrounding the Omagh bombing which highlight the role of the RUC special branch as an unaccountable force.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The decision of the Government to withhold the report from public scrutiny and to be selective in giving sight of the report to parties and Independent Deputies creates great concern in this House which will be reflected outside the House in the coming days and weeks.</p>

I support the Omagh families and their friends and I express my sympathy to them. All attacks on civilians are wrong and there should be no debate on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">Silence on the issue of bringing people to justice is not an option, nor is selective condemnation. All acts of violence in the last 30 years must be deplored and I include in this condemnation the use of state violence and collusion. In this regard, the Barron report has already been mentioned. This debate must be about listening and supporting the victims of violence. There should be no hierarchy of victims. All should be helped and respected.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">I commend those who were involved in the peace process and who have taken risks. The peace process is not over. It needs to be further developed.</p>

          <p eId="para_554">The undertaking and finalisation of the Nally report were intended as an exercise in inspiring and restoring public confidence. The formation of the group was part of that exercise. Unfortunately, in not making even a truncated version of the report available, the Minister has not inspired that confidence. In choosing to quote elements of the report selectively in the House he has further fuelled the demand that as much of the report as possible be made available.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">Many Opposition Deputies are at a disadvantage as we did not have the facility offered to other Opposition parties. More important, when we revisit this issue in the new year when time will be provided for a fuller debate, we must be presented with as much information from the report as possible. Otherwise we will debate in a vacuum. Until that information is made available, many of the people affected by this despicable atrocity will continue to have concerns.</p>

          <from>Ms Enright:</from>
          <p eId="para_568">A civilised society is one that respects and recognises its responsibilities. These responsibilities are wide-ranging and fall to the individual as well as to the Government. Each of us has responsibilities. If we fail in those responsibilities we damage our social structure: the responsibility to have compassion and concern for others; to pay our taxes; to vote; and to uphold the law or, if the law offends our conscience, to protest peacefully. These individual responsibilities are closely tied to the broader responsibilities of the State: the responsibility to ensure that people can go about their business without fear of violence or intimidation; the responsibility to apprehend those who break the law; and the responsibility to protect the younger and more vulnerable of any age within our ranks. Of all of the key responsibilities the last must rank as one of the most pressing and most important. However, it is a responsibility which the Government appears to be unable or unwilling to meet.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">I have spent much time recently evaluating the systems in place in Ireland to protect children and other vulnerable members of our society. I have also been comparing these systems with those in other countries and jurisdictions. Ireland is not meeting its responsibilities or realising its duty to protect all in our society. Every organisation that has people working with children or vulnerable adults needs skilled, resourceful and dedicated staff. However, when recruiting these staff, organisations must not only focus on a person's qualifications and experience but must screen out those who could pose a threat to a child or vulnerable adult. This screening process is called vetting and it is critical that both thorough vetting procedures and good recruitment practices are followed when recruiting personnel to work with children and vulnerable adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">In Ireland the vetting of those who work with children and vulnerable adults is still deeply inadequate. Access to the services provided by the central vetting unit is extremely limited and inconsistent, and many agencies wishing to use the service are turned away. The Government amendment congratulates the central vetting unit on eliminating a backlog. So few people have access to the unit that I do not know how a backlog could have been created.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">Health boards have access to the central vetting unit but even they are not using the system as widely as they should. In contrast, schools, charities and sporting organisations, all of which employ staff or volunteers who have considerable access to children in their work, have no access to formal vetting procedures. In terms of vetting, Ireland represents worst practice when compared with other systems in place in these islands and, in particular, in comparison to Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">The shortcomings in our vetting procedures are unacceptable at any time. It is a sad indictment of our society that at a time when children needed our assistance in the past we failed them. At no time was this more evident than during the regime of abuse and neglect in institutions charged with the responsibility for children which the State did not tackle. With hindsight it is easy to see there were many gaps in the provisions made to protect children from abuse in the past. Today we must ensure we take every reasonable step to prevent abuse happening. Where abuse occurs it should not be possible for the perpetrator to move to another part of the country and abuse again. If we fail to learn from the mistakes of the past then we gamble with the future but for children and vulnerable people these stakes are too high.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">Child abuse has an international dimension. Technological innovation such as the Internet and e-mail have assisted abuse over national borders. The distribution of child pornography can now happen in a few seconds. The increased mobility of people means that we need greater co-operation within the EU and farther afield to combat abuse on an international front. Above all, we must put in place procedures that offer the best protection against abuse in Ireland. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, said today that we must put our own house in order first, before we progress on a wider scale. It is clear that the Government has failed to implement appropriate procedures to protect children and vulnerable adults from abuse; to open up the central vetting unit and allow access to the unit by charities from the voluntary sector; to implement an adequate vetting procedure for health board employees and to bring vetting procedures to the schools, except for limited use by bus escorts and special needs assistants. This is why Fine Gael is proposing the introduction of a comprehensive system of vetting. Such a system is long overdue, and we are proposing that only a radical and far-reaching overhaul of our vetting procedures will meet the responsibilities that the State holds to every child and vulnerable adult.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The introduction of new and comprehensive vetting procedures for staff with substantial unsupervised access to children in the workplace will take some time. In other countries, vetting procedures have evolved over decades. However, because we have failed to implement even basic vetting requirements, we put children's safety at risk every day that we allow the current situation to continue. In Northern Ireland, vetting systems have been in place for 20 years, and have undergone improvement and refinement in that time. In contrast, it was not until January 2002 that a central vetting unit, operated by the Garda Síochána, was established to meet the demand for vetting in Ireland. This was a positive step but the service is far too restricted, being open only to staff at the health boards, and it needs to be radically extended. Moreover, even though the service is open to health boards, there are reports that staff continue to be appointed without the appropriate checks having being followed. The Irish Social Services Inspectorate report, 2002 stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_575">Boards have a responsibility to vet staff before they take up employment in centres, to ensure, as far as is possible, that people who are not suitable to work with children and young people are not employed. According to records seen by inspectors, only one centre had completed adequate checks on all staff before employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">The centre referred to here is a children's residential centre. The report concluded that "the situation in relation to vetting of staff is unsatisfactory and needs urgent attention."</p>
          <p eId="para_577">In light of that report the amendments clapping ourselves on the back for what has been done so far need to be looked at again. It is very clear that we need a new approach, where the vetting of health board staff, teachers and other school staff, voluntary organisation staff and volunteers are brought under one umbrella in the interests of child safety and security. The way to bring this about is to enhance and expand the work of the central vetting unit. This unit, which needs to be adequately resourced, should be the linchpin in a new and comprehensive system of vetting in Ireland. The responsibility for the day-to-day running of the central vetting unit should remain with the Garda Síochána, but additional staff and resources should be allocated to the unit so that the following organisations have access to its services: health board staff with substantial unsupervised access to children including full and part-time staff and staff at agencies or services funded by the health boards. A statutory obligation should be imposed to ensure the procedure is followed prior to a person taking up his or her post. The system would also vet all staff at primary and post-primary schools, full and part-time staff, teachers and support staff. Charities and voluntary sporting and youth organisations should be allowed access to the central vetting unit to vet staff and volunteers before they take up positions that involve having substantial unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults. Voluntary organisations should be encouraged to meet certain specified criteria to allow them register for access to the central vetting unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">In addition to being open to a wider number of organisations, the expanded unit should also hold information on those considered unsuitable to work with children or with vulnerable adults. In addition to carrying out a check for a criminal record, the unit would hold a list or register of personal details, to be cross-referenced in the event of an application for any person to be vetted by the unit. Information on any person unsuitable for employment with children or vulnerable adults should be given to the central vetting unit by schools, health boards, charities and voluntary sporting and youth bodies. Referral should take place following the application of normal employment procedures such as a disciplinary hearing that resulted in the individual being moved or dismissed from his or her post on the grounds of harm to children or vulnerable adults. Therefore, vetting teachers and other school staff, health board staff, or volunteers through the expanded central vetting unit would show whether the person has a criminal record and to what crime such a record relates, and any relevant non-conviction information; whether a school principal, vice principal or chairperson of a school board of management, a health board chief executive officer, director of service, or line manager, the chief executive officer or a director of a charity, voluntary, sporting or youth organisation, who employs or previously employed the person as either a member of staff or a volunteer, has recommended that the person should not be employed to work with children or with vulnerable adults, and the reasons for this recommendation.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">Before the details on any person could be added to a list held by the central vetting unit a fair and transparent process would be followed in compliance with the principles of natural justice. This type of expanded and extended unit would therefore rely upon managers and employers to give it information on any person whom they consider unsuitable to work with children or vulnerable adults. Not every disciplinary matter between employer and employee would result in a report being made to the central vetting unit. Only certain types of unsuitable behaviour would be reported, and the report would follow an internal investigative procedure. For example, an employer might contact the unit with specific information on an employee or volunteer if that person was guilty of sexual misconduct, physical or emotional abuse, theft from a child or vulnerable adult, or substance abuse. Before this report is made the employer would have to ensure the incident had been internally investigated and be satisfied that it took place; that a child or vulnerable adult was put at risk by the behaviour; and he or she considers the matter to be of such concern that any future potential employer should be made aware of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">By ensuring these internal procedures are followed only suitably serious breaches of acceptable behaviour would result in a report being made to the central vetting unit. There is one important difficulty, namely how employers should react when they instigate disciplinary proceedings against a staff member who then leaves employment, perhaps even moving to a different part of the country. The matter should not be dropped. Cases of this type are too important for us to take the "out of sight, out of mind" approach as happens at present. In this instance, even though an internal procedure has not been followed, the central vetting unit should be contacted. Otherwise a person who abuses can move from one organisation or county to another without check. Any report to the unit on the conduct of a staff member or volunteer would be a serious matter. Therefore, reports on the conduct of a staff member or volunteer would be accepted only from a senior member of staff at a school, health board, charity, voluntary, sporting or youth organisation. School principals, vice principals, health board chief executive officers and directors of service, and the directors of voluntary bodies would have the authority to contact the unit. Detailed guidelines would need to be circulated to each of these sectors to advise on the procedure for making a report to the central vetting unit. Additionally, these guidelines should advise on how to put appropriate workplace measures in place so that any relevant information on the conduct of a staff member or volunteer is brought to the attention of a senior member of staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Under Fine Gael proposals the rights of the employee would be protected. The new vetting procedures that we advocate employ important checks and balances to ensure people will not find their way onto the system in error. For example, when an employer makes a report to the unit, the unit should then write to the person concerned and inform him or her that his or her name has been passed to it for consideration for inclusion under any subsequent search for information with the unit. In this instance the following procedures would be applied: if the person against whom the report has been made does not oppose his or her inclusion, then his or her details and the details of the report to the central vetting unit will appear under any subsequent search on his or her name and details with the unit; and if the person chooses to oppose the report made the matter will be referred to a standing committee, whose remit would be to decide on contentious cases. This committee will decide whether the central vetting unit should hold the person's details.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">In line with the principles of natural justice, every individual in the State has access to the courts and an appeal against inclusion on the records held by the central vetting unit could be taken to court. If such an appeal was taken and was unsuccessful, the person's details could be added to a list or register held by the unit. The person concerned would have the right to have his or her case re-examined by the standing committee of the unit after a period of five years. Legislation to put the unit on a statutory basis should make abuse of it a serious offence. This should include a severe penalty for any person knowingly making a false report to the unit against any other person. Additionally, clear procedures governed by guidance and a system of registration should inform the manner in which any check on the unit is carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">To guard against abuse of the vetting procedures, and to ensure the confidentiality of the information held by the unit, only certain key personnel should have the authority to request that the unit vet a potential member of staff. The misuse of information released by the unit would be an extremely serious matter. The legislation putting the unit on a statutory basis should provide for an expansion of its role to deal with all the organisations to which I have referred. It should also make it a serious offence to abuse information released by the unit. This should include a severe penalty for any person leaking information obtained from the unit. Failure to protect the privacy of an individual against whom a check has been made should also be punishable.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">In all this it is important to state that the vetting proposals favoured by Fine Gael, and all vetting systems internationally, are not designed to answer every single question an employer might pose about an employee. The Government's amendment refers to this. The central vetting unit does not now, nor should it in the future exist to tell an employer that any person should or should not be employed. The expanded unit we propose would exist to share information that may be relevant to an employer when he or she is deciding whether a person is suitable for work, either paid or voluntary, that involves substantial unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">The purpose in collating and releasing this information is to empower the employer, not to pre-empt a decision on whether a person is suitable for employment with children or vulnerable adults. As stated in the Government's amendment, I agree that other procedures need to be in place within each organisation. It is critical that charities and voluntary, sporting and youth organisations have access to the unit. These voluntary agencies are involved in essential work in all parts of the country and are focal points in the communities in which they are based, but to fully protect children, adolescents and vulnerable adults who benefit so much from the work of these groups, they should be allowed access to the central vetting unit without delay. This has been requested by many voluntary, sporting and youth organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">The Minister for Education and Science has stated in the Dáil that vetting procedures were more advanced in Northern Ireland than here, but not too much so. I disagree with that statement and record that we are almost 20 years behind in terms of the type of vetting service available in the North. Vetting of those who work with children has existed in Northern Ireland for more than 20 years and is extensive, being spread across two Departments as well as the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the PSNI. Vetting procedures apply to staff at local health authorities, schools and certain voluntary organisations and are part of UK-wide arrangements to ensure that unsuitable people do not find employment with children.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">In Northern Ireland when a person applies for employment that involves substantial unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults, and if the prospective employer is registered with the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, that person will be checked according to the pre-employment consultancy service system, known as PECS. The PECS system provides a means for accessing information which might have a bearing on a person's suitability to work with children or vulnerable adults, which has been gathered from a number of diverse sources, including the PSNI, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the Department of Education under its List 99 system, and individuals listed on official registers as unsuitable to work with children in other parts of the United Kingdom. In this way, the vetting procedures in Northern Ireland are comprehensive. By cross-referencing information from a number of different sources, it is all the more difficult for a person who might pose a threat to a child to slip through the cracks.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">It is also critical to note that the PECS system is open to a large number of organisations. As well as applying to health authority and school staff, the system is also open to voluntary, charitable and sporting organisations which register with the Department for access to the service. It is also open to organisations based in the Republic of Ireland, which is ironic considering they do not have access to such information here.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The vetting procedures in Northern Ireland are thorough in the manner in which information is gathered and are open to a wide number of organisations. In direct contrast, the vetting procedures in place in Ireland are worryingly limited. Even with the establishment of the unit, vetting procedures are still off limits to most organisations, and even those few agencies which have access to it, such as the health boards, are not utilising its services as thoroughly as they should.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">I understand that the North-South Ministerial Council is examining proposals for an integrated vetting system on this island. This is to be welcomed, but these discussions cannot be used as an excuse for failing to implement proper vetting procedures in this country now. Northern Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland already have vetting systems in place. The danger this poses for Ireland is that we could represent a safe haven for abusers from which to operate. It is clearly the case that people who are not considered suitable to work with children and vulnerable adults in other parts of these islands can travel here and seek employment without a rigorous screening programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">Vetting procedures are a critical part of the infrastructure we need to protect children, vulnerable adults and those at risk in our society. Fine Gael has produced a clear and comprehensive way of putting these important procedures in place. I accept the need for discussion and consultation within the Government and with interest groups, but to quote the Minister for Finance in the Dáil last week – as he has quoted me in the past –"This is not in the same category as putting a man on the moon, the invention of the wheel or conquering the North Pole."  Putting in place these vetting procedures is detailed and complicated. Prior to producing our proposals we consulted widely here and in Northern Ireland. It comes down to making a decision and providing the necessary resources to implement a system.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">At present, we must find the resources to pay for our failure to adequately protect children in the past. I ask the Government to show it has learned from that experience and to put the appropriate legislation in place now to protect children and vulnerable adults. I regret that it has not accepted this motion in the spirit I and my colleagues have moved it, although I am not surprised as the Government's <i>modus operandi</i> is not to accept Opposition motions. Members of Government frequently say they seek constructive opposition, but we also seek constructive government. The proposals we put forward should be acceptable by Members on all sides of the House. Every day the current situation continues it poses an unacceptable risk.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deasy:</from>
          <p eId="para_595">That is not how it works. The Minister of State could support the motion. He should reconsider doing so, as to do so would not be a big deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">I want to go address the general area of sex crime. There is a problem here which has not been dealt with in recent years as adequately as it should have been. Recently the Rape Crisis Centre released horrific statistics indicating that some 21,000 women are victims of sexual assault every year. A woman is raped every 90 minutes in this country. Only about one in 12 women who are raped report it. There is a massive level of under-reporting of the crime, something repeatedly asserted by Victim Support.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">Victim Support points to the fact that the court system is a harrowing experience for anyone who is a victim of sex crime. It considers that simple measures, such as the physical layout of a court room and separate waiting rooms could be effective in helping somebody go through the harrowing process of our adversarial system. The difficulty is that the court rooms building project has been cut by 6% this year, which is an indication of the priority the Government attaches to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">With regard to how bad things are, in 1980, fewer than 50 rapes were reported, while in 2002, 400 rapes were reported. There are reasons for that. The population has increased, we have better recording systems, such as PULSE, and some people may be more willing to come forward than they would have been in the past. The definition of rape has been expanded. Another reason for the increase in such crime is that alcohol abuse has increased. Approximately half of rape cases are caused by the abuse of alcohol. In 1950, 85% of sex offences recorded by the Garda led to proceedings but in 2000, this figure had fallen to 25%.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">The London Metropolitan University found that more rape victims were denied justice in Ireland than in any other EU state. It compared the position among EU countries and reported that for conviction figures in rape cases across Europe, Ireland came bottom of the list. From 1993 to 1997 the conviction rate in Ireland was 2% in such cases. From 1997 to 2001 that rate fell to 1%.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The recent "Prime Time" programme on child pornography was quite convincing. It exposed the enormity and the disturbing nature of the problem. After it was screened, Children at Risk in Ireland, CARI, called for increased penalties for those convicted of child pornography offences. CARI noted that Ireland's sentencing system in this area is wholly inconsistent and that there is a reluctance on the part of certain members of the Judiciary to send people to jail for these offences. I agree with that criticism. This is a serious issue. There has been a hardening of attitude among some judges trying these cases, but a review is needed of sentencing structures for child sex abuse and child pornography cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">As the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is no doubt aware, it is the judge who decides whether to make the name of an accused person public. There is inconsistency in this area. Even in some cases where the victim is willing to give up his or her anonymity, the lawyers for the accused can petition the judge and make the case that the name should not be made public. The judge can then impose reporting restrictions. Judges often do so, for reasons that are unclear. The reasons given for refusing identification in such cases are very hard to explain.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">Last weekend I read that the Garda paedophile investigation unit's backlog of cases involves some three months' work. It is clear that the unit has not got the resources or manpower needed to deal with the mountain of cases built up over time. A couple of weeks ago, the Tánaiste said the necessary resources would be given to the unit to beef up its investigations of these crimes. Time will tell.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">As the Minister of State is no doubt aware, the Copine project operates in University College, Cork. It has done some very good work over the past four years. The project is involved in 40% of identifications of children abused by means of the Internet in Ireland and the UK. Those who work on the project say the problem has continued to grow over those four years. They have asked a necessary question, namely, whether one can rely on self-regulation within the Internet service provider industry to deal with the problem. One cannot do so. We must point to responsibility within that industry as well as among credit card companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">We also need to look at the recently rewritten UK laws in the area. The offence of grooming was introduced to UK legislation. Grooming means befriending children with the intention of eventually committing a sexual offence against them. We should consider introducing such a law.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">There are currently 300 sex offenders in our prisons, of whom only 10% to 12% participate in the sexual rehabilitation programmes offered. That is disturbing. If sex offenders do not participate in these courses, the communities to which they are relocated on leaving prison should know who they are and that they did not take part in the programmes offered. There is currently no pressure on sex offenders to rehabilitate themselves, and no incentive for them to do so. We should be talking about putting such pressure on them, in order to help them with their disease, which is what it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">It is also worrying that in the Estimates, the probation and welfare service budget was cut by 8%. This service and its officers maintain the sex register list with the Garda Síochána. The service has only 290 dedicated probation officers and cannot deal with the amount of work confronting them.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">I read recently that the State's only non Government-funded centre for sex offenders was swamped with referrals of sex offenders engaged in child pornography. Citing a number of studies, the head of the Granada Institute said that treatment of sex abusers reduced the re-offending rates from 30% to approximately 10%. He said that sex offenders do not change their behaviour unless they have to. That is why we should put pressure on sex offenders to rehabilitate themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">Last May, a ministerial advisory group recommended that teachers and those working with children should be vetted by the Garda before taking up their posts. The group said there was no current requirement to vet teachers, students or social workers, or staff in leisure centres, libraries and crèches. The report stated that the level of vetting carried out in Ireland falls far below the standard in Northern Ireland and the UK, as well as below those of many European countries. It expressed concern that the Garda does not routinely share information on convicted sex offenders with law enforcement agencies in other jurisdictions. It recommended that vetting arrangements should be extended to the education and health sectors and that such procedures be put on a statutory basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">To deal with sex crimes we must do the following: properly resource the Garda paedophile investigation unit; fully fund the courthouse building programme as well as the probation and welfare service; ensure there is proper statistical analysis of sex crimes; conduct a review of sentencing for child sex abuse crimes as well as for crimes involving child pornography; ensure publication of sex offenders' names if they do not participate in rehabilitation courses provided for them by the State; and provide for an immediate extension of vetting arrangements to education and youth services.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">The Deputies on the Government side sometimes make clear that they would like co-operation on certain Bills or initiatives taken by the Government. This motion is something the Government could support and for once agree with. It would gain a lot of credibility if it supported a quite open-ended motion. There is an opportunity to do so. As the Minister of State knows, this is not a political or partisan issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">I thank Deputy Enright for asking me to speak on this matter. We all recognise it as a very important issue and it would be good for us to work together on it. It is something the Government could support and I would appreciate if the Government would at least consider such support.</p>

In terms of its motivation, it was deliberately drafted in a non-political manner so the Government could accept it in the spirit in which it is meant. If the Government insists on introducing its own wording, it will vote against the Fine Gael wording tomorrow night. That would send out the wrong signals. The matter is one on which we want to work with the Government. It is a matter into which Deputy Enright has put a great deal of research and work. That should be recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">The motion which seeks to protect children from abuse by adults who may be working or participating in voluntary activity with access to children or vulnerable adults. It seeks to update and improve vetting procedures and structures to ensure that where possible, the State will do all it can to prevent those with a history of abuse from being employed to work with children. This motion is to do with the safety of children. It focuses on an area where the State can have a positive impact by resource investment and policy change. I congratulate Deputy Enright for her research and work in producing a detailed policy document to support the motion. This is not a motion that was thought up last week or the week before last; it has taken many months of preparation.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">It is impossible for me to consider this motion without reflecting for a moment on the shameful fact that, in the past, the State and its institutions failed many children, with horrific consequences. As someone with a significant involvement in the drafting of legislation leading to the setting up of the Residential Institutions Redress Board, I have spoken to many victims of child sexual and violent abuse, one of whom visits my office every week. The past failures by the State towards children in care must never be allowed to be repeated. We must learn from the many mistakes of the past and ensure that everything is done in a fair and balanced manner to minimise the likelihood of those who are clearly not suitable to have access to and responsibility for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">Vetting is a key element of any comprehensive strategy for keeping children safe. The ISPCC has campaigned on this issue in recent weeks. A balance must be struck between the need to protect children and the responsibility to treat adults fairly and not label persons in an unjust manner. However, the balance that exists at present is stacked against the child and in favour of potential offenders with a history of abuse. That is not a statement I make lightly. It has been documented and highlighted to the Government in recent independently commissioned reports following the setting up of the first central vetting unit in January 2002 which is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">The present vetting procedures in this country are inadequate. Persons with a history of child sexual or physical abuse obtain employment which gives them access to children because the employer does not have access to information to prevent it. The situation is now worse. As I understand it, not only is vetting inadequate in this country but because the vetting procedure has been tightened up in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland in particular, there is a movement of persons with a history of child abuse from the UK to Ireland to find employment in this country where they have access to children and vulnerable adults and can go undetected.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">For this reason and the need to overhaul our child protection procedures generally, this House must act. Fine Gael has done so by producing a detailed policy response which is the kind of response the Government often asks the Opposition to produce when it calls for constructive opposition. It makes sense to plan for equal regulations for supporting vetting procedures in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Fine Gael approach is consistent with where the UK authorities wish to be in a few years' time. It therefore merits serious consideration by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">Fine Gael calls on the Government to expand the role of the central vetting unit as outlined by Deputy Enright and to increase resources for the unit. All health board employees should be subject to vetting procedures as should all teaching and school staff. Persons employed by charities and those working in the voluntary sporting and youth sector should also be subject to similar vetting procedures. Fine Gael asks that a mechanism be put in place to report any instances of abuse between adults and children in the workplace or in the voluntary sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">I wish to draw the attention of the House to the growing phenomenon that offers the potential for children to be put at risk and exploited through the web, Internet access and chat room activity. Many people who are not regular Internet browsers or computer users are not aware of the current level of chat room activity among young people in Ireland, although I am confident the Minister of State is aware of it. Groups of people interact and cyber socialise through the computer in their bedroom or living room. Most of the time it is a positive experience but it is open to serious abuse by people who in a cynical and nasty manner, wish to take advantage of the vulnerability and openness of children. The problem was emphasised recently when Microsoft decided to close down a number of high profile chat room sites because of concerns regarding abuse of those sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">Deputy Deasy referred to the phenomenon of grooming and I do not need to emphasise that point apart from saying it clearly exists in Ireland, the UK and other European countries. It needs to be tackled at a national and governmental level.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">I appeal to the Minister of State to increase the levels of support for the unit in UCC that provides the Garda with much valuable information. Up to 40% of the information used by the Garda in the past two to three years has emanated from that unit which monitors child sexual abuse activities on the web and on the Internet.</p>

          <p eId="para_626">I agree. The Government has ambitious plans to roll out broadband across the country. I am sceptical of some of the plans but I am confident it will happen in time. Broadband will bring new risks to towns, regions and rural areas. It will bring the new world of the Internet to households and small businesses. I appeal to the Minister of State to accept the Fine Gael motion in the spirit in which it is drafted and to accept the Fine Gael wording which is non-partisan and non-political.

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_627">I move:</p>
          <p eId="para_628">To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_629">– welcomes the establishment in January 2002 of the State's first ever central vetting unit within the Garda Síochána;</p>
          <p eId="para_630">– commends the provision of additional human and other resources to enable establishment of the unit;</p>
          <p eId="para_631">– recognises the success of the central vetting unit both in eliminating all backlogs in processing vetting requests and in reducing the average time to process a request to approximately one week;</p>
          <p eId="para_632">– notes the continued implementation of the formal agreement between the health boards and the Garda Síochána to ensure the vetting of prospective employees in the health service and in certain facilities funded by the health boards who would have substantial unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults;</p>
          <p eId="para_633">–  notes that Garda vetting is and has been available to children's residential centres and special care units for many years;</p>
          <p eId="para_634">– endorses the decision to establish a working group on Garda vetting to examine the complex issues associated with enhancing the nature and extent of the services of the central vetting unit and looks forward to the outcome of its deliberations soon;</p>
          <p eId="para_635">– approves the Government's commitment to supporting the Garda Síochána in every way possible in tackling crime, and particularly the abuse, sexual or otherwise, of children, and also by facilitating and promoting a programme of legislative change and reform within the criminal justice system, in order to meet the challenges of present day crime;</p>
          <p eId="para_636">– commends the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, which provides for a package of measures aimed at protecting children from sexual exploitation by, <i>inter alia,</i> making it is an offence for any person to knowingly possess child pornography for the purpose of distributing, publishing, exporting, selling or showing it, punishable on conviction on indictment by up to 14 years imprisonment;</p>
          <p eId="para_637">– welcomes the obligation under the Sex Offenders Act 2001 that requires a convicted sex offender to inform his prospective employer of the fact of the conviction and that failure to do so is an offence attracting a maximum penalty of up to five years imprisonment;</p>
          <p eId="para_638">– commends the introduction, as provided for in the Sex Offenders Act 2001, of a notification procedure or tracking system for all convicted sex offenders, which extends to any sex offenders entering this jurisdiction from abroad;</p>
          <p eId="para_639">– notes that the criminal records of all persons convicted in relation to crimes perpetrated against children and vulnerable adults, whether of a sexual nature or not, are available to the central vetting unit during the process of vetting; and</p>
          <p eId="para_640">– recognises that vetting is not the sole answer to ensuring applicants' suitability for posts and that there will continue to be a particular onus of care on employers to maintain good employment practice both during the recruitment stage and in ensuring adequate supervision arrangements post-recruitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">I am sorry to disappoint but I agree this is an important and timely motion. I agree that Fine Gael has produced a detailed policy response for which I commend Deputy Enright. I agree in general with the spirit of the contributions made by the Fine Gael speakers. I regret that the Government cannot accept the Fine Gael motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The Government could not accept the inference that is drawn from the report of the Irish Social Services Inspectorate for 2002 which found that vetting procedures in Ireland were unsatisfactory and needed urgent attention. A careful examination of the context of the report will show that the inadequacy had nothing to do with the operation of the central vetting unit of the Garda Síochána. It related to other matters of legitimate concern which were raised by the Opposition this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">I do not accept the inference in the motion that there is not the necessary financial and human resources available in the unit to ensure that all health board employees or employees at any facility or service in receipt of health board funding, are vetted before taking up employment that gives them substantial unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults. That is current practice and it is implicit in the motion that it is not.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">I share the ambition of the motion in all its respects. I suggest there are substantial constitutional problems because the phrase "guilty of sexual misconduct" as used in the motion does not, in my view, refer to actual guilt as determined by courts of law and criminal proceedings but goes far beyond that.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">In answer to Deputy Coveney's point, I share legitimate ambition and I initiated considerable North-South contact on this matter in recent months. We need to have the same standard in the United Kingdom and Ireland as far as is practicable. We do not have the same constitutional arrangement. The type of arrangement that pertains in Northern Ireland to which Deputy Enright referred cannot be introduced here with any safety because, in Ireland, the determination of whether or not a person is an offender must be made in a judicial forum. I thank Fine Gael for having tabled the motion because it is important for the Government to have an opportunity to outline how it proposes to address the important issue of vetting persons with substantial unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">I wish to take issue with a presumption, which I think is inherent – although I am not alleging it is so – in the motion tabled by Deputy Enright. That presumption is that vetting, of itself, can detect the problems that can arise. Perhaps it is not a presumption in the motion and, if so, I will accept Deputy Enright's word in that respect. However, it is vitally important for employers to check out references as there is no substitute for doing so. Although I accept that vetting has to be a part of the system, as well, careful checking of references is fundamental to child protection. There are other arguments about the presumption but I will not go into those.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_254">
          <from>Ms Enright:</from>
          <p eId="para_647">I dealt with that in my speech.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_255" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan:</from>
          <p eId="para_648">Good employment practice is the fundamental issue to which the Deputy referred. Checking references is good employment practice translated into ordinary everyday language that people can understand.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">National guidelines for the protection and welfare of children were published by the Department of Health and Children in 1999, under the title "Children First". They recognise the need to support community and voluntary groups to develop best practice in their dealings with children. The guidelines are based on the key principle that the best interests of the child are paramount, and are designed to help organisations of all types and sizes to improve their policies, procedures and practices to safeguard children and young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">There is now a formal notification protocol between the health boards and the Garda Síochána, which I am pleased to report is operating well. Funds have been committed to all health boards to appoint officers to ensure that the public is aware of the existence of the "Children First" guidelines. I am concerned, however, because while health boards have invested substantial moneys in advertising the guidelines, there is still a widespread lack of public awareness about them.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">The guidelines are complemented at local level by specific procedures to be completed in the management of child abuse cases, thus maximising the capacity of the Garda Síochána to protect children effectively. The "Children First" guidelines have, in turn, formed the basis of a document entitled <i>Our Duty to Care,</i> which was published by the Department of Health and Children in April 2002. This document promotes good practice and procedures for organisations dealing with children, such as voluntary organisations, and consists of a booklet and fact-sheets covering areas such as safe recruitment practice, developing safe management practices and policies and raising awareness of child abuse among volunteers and staff. It also provides advice on how to report concerns to the health boards. This is an extremely useful tool for voluntary organisations. The “Trust in Care” guidelines were produced by the health service employers agency, in 2002, for health service employers on the prevention of patient/client abuse and on dealing with allegations of abuse against employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">Similar progress is being made in the education sector. In April 2001, the Department of Education and Science published its "Child Protection Guidelines and Procedures" for primary schools and the primary curriculum support programme has provided seminars on these procedures. In the 2001-02 school year, seminars were organised for the designated liaison person in each school. The training of trainers to deliver these information seminars was interdepartmental and multidisciplinary. Additional training was provided for schools in April and May 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">In March 2003, a working group, encompassing key participants from outside the Department of Education and Science, was established to compile draft guidelines for the post primary sector. It was decided that the working group should operate under the auspices of the social, personal and health education advisory committee. The draft guidelines were based on the "Children First" approach. As the Minister of State responsible, I insisted upon that to ensure that the distinctive institutional memories of the various Departments did not proceed to devise three different sets of guidelines. The aim is to have the completed guidelines in schools before the end of the current school year.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">The draft guidelines set out the legal framework in relation to confidentiality, qualified privilege and relevant items of legislation. It offers guidance on the definition and recognition of child abuse, and it sets out the responsibilities of all school personnel in handling disclosures from children and keeping records. In particular, it sets out the requirement for the board of management to designate a senior member of staff as the designated liaison person, to be known as the DLP, who will have specific responsibility for child protection and will be responsible for all dealings with the health boards, the Garda Síochána and any other parties in connection with allegations of and/or concerns about child abuse. The Department is working on the training that can be provided to accompany the roll-out of these guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">In the youth work sector, similar strides are being made via the national youth work advisory committee. This was the one area of funding which was proceeded with on the implementation of the youth plan. An expert group has been established to develop national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children in the context of the delivery of youth work services. A four-year training programme for child protection, based on the guidelines, was subsequently agreed at an estimated cost of €340,000 over four years.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">The key point to take from all the aforementioned activity is that, irrespective of whatever additional arrangements may be introduced in the area of vetting in future, it will be necessary to bear in mind that criminal record checks, although important, are not the sole answer to ensuring applicants' suitability for posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">Vetting arrangements for children and vulnerable adults have been in place for some considerable time. Since 1987, the Garda authorities have provided their vetting services to the Adoption Board in respect of prospective adoptive parents, as well as in relation to Irish persons applying for positions in the UK, which would give them substantial access to children.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">In 1994, arising from allegations of abuse in children's residential centres and following formal agreement between health boards and the Garda Síochána, Garda vetting was extended to the recruitment and selection of staff in these institutions. In 1995, vetting was further extended to candidates for employment in the health service and in certain facilities funded by health boards, that would have substantial access to children or vulnerable adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">It is not correct to state, as in some recent policy documents, that vetting is available only to health boards. Garda vetting is also available to certain organisations funded by health boards to provide services in respect of children and vulnerable adults. These existing arrangements are implemented by the Garda Síochána in strict adherence to legal advice received from the Attorney General, which is an issue to which I will return later.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">By the late 1990s, it was recognised that existing vetting arrangements were not adequate to the demands being placed on them, thanks to the disjunction between demand and service delivery that developed during the mid 1990s. Following consultations with the Garda Commissioner, a comprehensive review of Garda clearance arrangements was commenced in the child care area generally. Arising from this review, it was decided to establish a central vetting unit within the Garda Síochána to expand the vetting work carried out in order to deal with the then known demand for vetting. In recognition of the importance of vetting in our shared responsibility and duty of care for our children, additional resources were made available to realise its establishment.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">The unit became operational on 2 January 2002. It currently processes vetting requests in respect of prospective employees of designated agencies who would have substantial unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults. In particular, it processes requests in respect of prospective employees entering full-time employment in children's residential centres and other areas of health care and in certain external agencies funded by the health boards which would have substantial unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults; prospective adoptive parents with the Adoption Board; prospective child care workers on equal opportunities child care schemes funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; and Irish persons applying for positions in the United Kingdom which would give them substantial unsupervised access to children or vulnerable persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">In terms of the vetting process itself, staff of the unit use the Garda PULSE computer system. PULSE is an acronym for ‘police using leading systems effectively', and I am sure Deputies are aware it is a highly advanced information technology system which employs up-to-date technologies to ensure the Garda organisation has the information it needs when and where it needs it. This means that the central vetting unit has access to the criminal records of all persons convicted of crimes perpetrated against children and vulnerable adults, whether of a sexual nature or not, including crimes relating to child pornography on the Internet.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">I am pleased to confirm that, since its establishment and with the resources already made available to it, the central vetting unit has been operating well, with more than 100,000 applications dealt with last year. Those included many applications in respect of the Special Olympics. I would like to record my gratitude to the Garda vetting unit for its work on the Special Olympics.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">When the central vetting unit became fully operational in 2002 and the various backlogs were cleared, it was envisaged that the remit of the unit would be extended on a phased basis to other groups. This was because it was recognised there were good grounds, as the Opposition Deputies rightly pointed out in the House this evening, to extend the vetting arrangements to additional organisations. A working group has been established to examine the issue, taking account of all aspects of the vetting of persons coming in contact with children and vulnerable persons, be they full-time, part-time, voluntary or community workers or students on placements.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">The working group comprises representatives of the Garda Síochána, the Office of the Attorney General, the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Issues under consideration within the working group include the range of organisations which are seeking Garda vetting and the future likely demand; the resource implications of extending clearance arrangements to additional private, voluntary, community and education sectors; processing and liaison mechanisms with organisations to reduce duplication and to enhance standardisation in clearance requests; the viable means of processing clearance requests in respect of non-nationals taking up employment in the child care and health care sectors in Ireland; making the services of the central vetting unit available on a commercial fee basis to ensure that proportionality and common sense are applied by organisations; and the legal aspects of vetting.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Over the past number of months, the working group has been actively progressing its work by means of meetings; the submission of position papers; the consideration of written submissions and representations made by a large number of external organisations and umbrella groups; a site visit to the central vetting unit; and research into vetting arrangements in other jurisdictions. The arrangements that pertain in Northern Ireland and our other nearest neighbours – England, Wales and Scotland – have been especially illuminating. The group has also considered matters as they are arranged in the United States of America, Canada and New Zealand.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">I understand the working group is currently in the process of finalising its report and that it expects to be in a position to submit this to the Garda Commissioner and to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in January 2004. I commend Fine Gael for tabling the motion in the House before Christmas. We will address it early in the new year. The Government today announced the appointment of an ombudsman for children and the resolutions will be before the House tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">Although expanding the provision of vetting services clearly has resource implications, I refute the suggestion that it is all about resources; there are fundamental issues of policy and legislation as well. For example, under current arrangements, Garda vetting is carried out on an administrative basis. There is no statutory underpinning for the Garda Síochána to hold information from the Courts Service in regard to convictions recorded against a person. Deputy Coveney hinted at this problem in the course of his contribution but the advantage of the current system is that it is based on the consent of the individual on whom the information is sought. It operates through a defined category of identifiable employees, so that possibilities for fraud or the misuse of information are limited.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">As mentioned earlier, the Garda Síochána operates this system on the basis of legal advices from the Attorney General. A clear distinction is drawn in his advice between so-called "hard facts" and "soft facts". By hard facts I mean conviction information and information relating to pending prosecutions where the Director of Public Prosecutions is considering a file. By soft facts I mean allegations, rumours, complaints, unsavoury associates or generalised anti-social activity. There is a difficulty here. The Northern Ireland Register uses soft facts established through the employment context where problems have arisen in employment and a list is devised based on employment difficulties which is then made available to certain persons. We are advised that that constitutes soft facts and therefore legal difficulties arise. The Attorney General has advised that, as a general rule, although hard facts are disclosable, soft facts are not. He advises that issues of natural justice apply, although I am aware the Fine Gael document seeks to address those.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">That brings me neatly to the notion of a vetting register akin to the position in Northern Ireland, where the Pre-Employment Consultancy Service or PECS, the acronym referred to by Deputy Enright, carries out checks on the suitability of those seeking work with children or adults with a learning disability. The system allows employers to check the suitability of those applying to work with children or adults with a learning disability. PECS is operated by the Northern Ireland Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and was designed to ensure that, on the basis of information provided about those seeking to work with children or adults with a learning disability, a series of checks could be carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">Alongside a check of criminal records, checks are also carried out against the PECS register and records held on those prohibited from working in schools on the so-called "List 99". The PECS register is compiled from information provided by voluntary and statutory organisations on workers who have been dismissed, transferred to other work or who have resigned in circumstances where it is considered that they posed a risk to children or adults with learning disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">Leaving aside some obvious statutory issues regarding soft facts, which I have already mentioned, the question of establishing registers of this nature in this jurisdiction has arisen, especially in the education sector. In this respect, at the first meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council on 3 February 2000, the council decided to set up the Joint Working Group on Child Protection as one of a number of working groups to take forward matters for co-operation, having regard to the common concerns and interests of both sides. A report was submitted to the council at the end of 2000 and subsequently the council agreed on the broad approach taken by the group and signalled its desire to have detailed proposals for legislation prepared.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">The main thrust of the proposals is to provide structures through which persons who are a risk to the safety of children can be prevented from being employed in schools. There are a number of proposals involved. A draft discussion paper was prepared by the Department of Education and Science on the basis of these proposals but before work on that was completed, the cross-departmental working group on Garda vetting, which I have already mentioned, was established. It was considered wiser to await the recommendations of that group before engaging in discussions with the various interest groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">I would like to dispel the myth, however, that no vetting whatsoever is being conducted in the education area. The Garda central vetting unit currently processes requests from the Department of Education and Science in respect of special needs assistants, bus escorts and children detention schools. This is especially important, given that they are working with children who are the most vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">I would also like to dispel the notion that has been suggested that the 2002 Annual Report of the Social Services Inspectorate somehow calls into question the vetting arrangements that pertain in the vetting unit. In fact, the report states that according to records seen by the inspectors, only one centre had completed adequate vetting checks on all staff before employment. Five centres had obtained Garda vetting on all staff before employing them, and nine centres employed one or more staff for whom there were no records of Garda checks in the centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">Where criticisms are made, therefore, they are not directed at Garda vetting as such but in respect of the responsibilities of local management, which emphasises the point I made earlier that the central vetting unit is not the be all and end all on this issue. The Garda vetting has been available for many years to children's residential centres and special care units.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">I can assure the House that the recommendations made in the inspectorate's annual report on deficiencies in this area will be followed up by the Department of Health and Children. I have asked the inspectorate to do that and to raise these issues with the relevant health board to ensure a satisfactory response. Justifiable concern is entertained by many about vetting arrangements when there are legitimate fears about crimes perpetrated against children and vulnerable adults, and particularly offences of a sexual nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">Members of the House are correct to refer to the disturbing nature of the content of last week's RTE "Prime Time" programme. I assure the House that the Garda is fully investigating the allegations outlined in the programme in the context of an already well-established infrastructure to investigate these kind of offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">In October 2002, the Garda Commissioner established the paedophile investigation unit which is located within the domestic violence and sexual assault unit based at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation in Harcourt Square. This specialised unit is charged with investigating and co-ordinating cases relating to alleged child abuse and the possession, distribution and production of child pornography. It investigates allegations brought to its attention by Interpol, Europol, external police forces and through the Internet Advisory Board hotline, as well as complaints made by members of the public. The unit is also proactive in monitoring Internet chat rooms and strives to maintain best practice in the investigation of child pornography with an emphasis on Internet investigations.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">I understand from the Garda authorities that the unit currently has approximately 40 cases in hand. However, other than a small number of prosecuted cases, there is no evidence currently available to the paedophile investigation unit that pornographic material is being made in Ireland to facilitate trading.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">This is the reason I took issue with Deputy Coveney's statement that 40% of Garda prosecutions were the result of investigations conducted by the Copine foundation. The foundation does marvellous work at University College Cork, but it primarily assists police forces in other jurisdictions by using its significant bank of material to link children used in abusive photographs with particular individuals through the most careful collation and analysis of photographs. It is fortunate that it has not had to provide this service to the Garda Síochána as we do not have evidence of the occurrence of such episodes here, although we can never rule them out and must be vigilant. It is true that the bulk of the cases prosecuted by the Garda in Operation Amethyst resulted from disclosures made via the United States authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">The domestic violence and sexual assault unit established in 1993 continues to act as a resource to investigating gardaí throughout the State in the investigation of sexual crimes. Prior to the establishment of the dedicated paedophile investigation unit, members of the unit had already developed considerable experience and expertise in all aspects of paedophile activity and Internet crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">The Garda Síochána has been involved in a number of international criminal investigations into paedophile activity. These cases have involved the police forces of Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium, The Netherlands and the United States. As Internet paedophile crime is a global issue, it can only be tackled effectively through close international police co-operation on intelligence and investigation. Interpol, based in Lyon in France, is working together with Europol, based in The Hague, to develop a child pornography database containing all seized child abuse images worldwide. This will assist national police forces in the identification of victims of paedophile activity and minimise duplication of effort on criminal investigations internationally. The Garda Síochána plays an active role in the working groups of these organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">As a vivid demonstration of the importance of international co-operation, on 27 May 2002 the Garda Síochána carried out a co-ordinated search of more than 100 houses and premises for breaches of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, as part of Operation Amethyst. The information originated in Texas and was supplied by the Dallas police and the postal service via Interpol to Ireland. Images of child abuse were seized and a number of people were charged and convicted of their possession. A total of 124 persons were charged with offences of possession of child pornography in 2002 and a number are still before the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">Calls have been made for the strengthening of our current legislation, including one by Deputy Deasy this evening. As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has previously pointed out, the penalty structure in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 is recognised internationally as one of the most severe, if not the most severe, in any jurisdiction. With regard to Deputy Deasy's comments, we must bear in mind that the Director of Public Prosecutions is charged with the duty and responsibility of deciding the appropriate forum for the prosecution of a case and whether it should be proceeded with summarily or on indictment. We cannot question his discretion in that respect. In addition, the question of the consistency of sentences is a matter for the courts. The penalties provided by the Oireachtas, however, are among the most severe in any jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">Section 6 of the 1998 Act provides for a maximum penalty on summary conviction for knowingly possessing child pornography of a substantial fine and imprisonment for up to 12 months or both. If the charges are brought on indictment, a convicted person can be subject to a fine not exceeding €6,348 or imprisonment for up to five years or both. Section 5 of the Act contains even stronger measures in that it makes it an offence to knowingly produce, distribute, print, publish, import, export, sell or show child pornography. A person found guilty of such an offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €1,904 or to imprisonment for up to 12 months or both. Again, if convicted on indictment, the penalties are even more severe in that the offender may be subject to an unlimited fine or to imprisonment for up to 14 years or both. A person who has the custody, charge or care of a child and allows that child to be used for the production of child pornography commits an offence which can only be dealt with by way of indictment, with the possibility of a fine of up to €31,743 or imprisonment for up to 14 years or both.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">The Act is generally held up as model legislation and has worked well in practice. Nevertheless, if any weaknesses are identified in the legislation, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is more than willing to examine the legislation with a view to further strengthening its provisions. A number of non-statutory controls are also in place to combat the illegal and harmful uses of the Internet, including the Internet Advisory Board, the hotline for reporting child pornography and the self-regulatory system for the Internet service provider industry enshrined in the code of practice and ethics.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">Deputy Deasy raised the question of regulation or self-regulation by the industry. While the industry has done everything we have asked it to do, we would introduce legislation were it required. While we should consider this issue on a more international basis, it is difficult to get international agreement on legislation in this area. Clearly, however, international legislation would be desirable, given that we are dealing with multinational companies and a technology which is transnational in character. It is difficult to determine what further step could be taken in this area through domestic legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">The Internet Advisory Board was established in February 2000 and comprises representatives of relevant Departments, the Garda Síochána, child protection interests, the Information Society Commission and the service provider industry. Professor Max Taylor of the Copine Project at the Department of Applied Psychology, University College Cork, who featured on the recent "Prime Time" programme, is one of the members of the board. The board supervises a system of self-regulation by the Irish Internet service provider industry and supports the work of the hotline and promotes awareness of Internet downside issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">I launched a hotline Christmas awareness programme this year and I am glad to see the advertisements are of a high character, have been noted on many television programmes and coincided with the broadcasting of the "Prime Time" programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">All members of the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland subscribe to the code of practice and ethics. The membership of the association represents more than 95% of the service provider industry and efforts are ongoing to encourage membership by the remaining smaller providers. The hotline is operated and funded by the Internet service provider industry and the European Union's safer Internet action plan. It provides a central point of contact for members of the public who become aware of child pornography on the Internet in Ireland. The hotline attempts to identify the source of material and if it is hosted in Ireland, it will request the relevant Internet service provider to remove it. The hotline liaises with the Garda as appropriate and if the material originates in another jurisdiction, it will notify the relevant authority there which can take appropriate action.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">There is a growing recognition that in the investigation of child pornography images, not only must evidence be gathered for the prosecution of the perpetrator but we must also work towards the identification, rescue and rehabilitation of the victims. This is obviously of vital importance as it facilitates the rescue of the child victim and potential future victims from further abuse.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan:</from>
          <p eId="para_696">The Garda Síochána has robust measures at its disposal to deal with those involved in such activities. Combating these crimes online is a complex issue, involving multiple jurisdictions and different legal systems and requires international police co-operation, constant development of mutual best practice and, above all, co-operation from all members of society and vigilance on the part of parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">One matter raised by Deputy Deasy, to which I have not referred in detail, was the facilities available in the Prison Service for the treatment of sexual offenders. There are four forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders in the prison system. The view of the Prison Service has always been that the convicted person must be willing to co-operate with his or her rehabilitation. Deputy Deasy appeared to hint at compulsory rehabilitation. The current view is that this does not work and that unless the offender willingly takes the vital first step, one will not achieve a successful result in terms of rehabilitation.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Sullivan:</from>
          <p eId="para_700">I congratulate Deputy Enright on tabling this motion and the considerable work she has done in this area. It is important we have time to debate the issue and I hope it will have positive results. I am disappointed the Government did not see fit to accept the Fine Gael Party motion and has instead tabled its own motion. The bulk of the Fine Gael motion is in line with what the Government intends or hopes to do. While I accept the right of the Minister of State to quibble with certain aspects of one element of the motion, overall there is no reason for the Government not to support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">I support the content of the motion and want to see progress in this area. I have frequently raised the lack of progress on the stated Government policy of introducing legislation in the context of North-South deliberations to establish a register of persons considered unsafe to work with children. I looked back through the Government programmes of legislation over the last two years. It was expected in the 2002 programme that this legislation would be on the Statute Book for 2003. The latest information is 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">I have raised it again recently with the Taoiseach. He has indicated there is some delay. On the 27 May 2003 I received a letter from the assistant private secretary to the Taoiseach, because I had raised the issue on the Order of Business. The letter indicated the up-to-date position and said the matter was currently being examined by an interdepartmental working group with a view to preparing draft legislation for submission by the Department of Education and Science to the Government in time for the next Dáil term. That would be this Dáil term, which finishes on Thursday of this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">The Taoiseach gave me the following information by way of background. The purpose of the working group is to prepare proposals to establish a confidential mechanism for the identification of people who are considered unsafe to work with children and young people; to establish a register for persons considered unsafe to work with children; to establish a framework of liaison between the relevant bodies in the health, justice and education spheres; and the creation of a right of appeal against registration to an appeals body to facilitate co-operation between the agencies responsible for the maintenance of a similar register in the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">Again I have to call on the Government to proceed with that plan. I know there are issues involved because the Northern Ireland Assembly is not currently in operation, but there is no reason we in the Republic may not proceed, particularly in view of the information, as described by Deputy Enright, which indicates the North is already very much ahead of us as regards vetting procedures. The document referred to by the Minister, Code of Good Practice – Child Protection for the Youth Work Sector, specifically guides youth organisations to the pre-employment consultancy service in Northern Ireland and indicates that it may be used for youth organisations that operate cross-Border. We need to move forward in the Republic in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">I am disappointed at the extent of the vetting, as indicated in the Minister's speech. I thought the central vetting unit, as it operates currently, was somewhat broader than it is. The Minister referred to processing requests in respect of prospective employees entering full-time employment in children's residential centres, etc. I would have thought that part-time employees should be vetted in those areas. There is a large number of part-time workers in these child care centres owing to the difficulty of getting full-time workers. The limited area within the education sector which the Minister referred to, bus escorts and special needs assistants, is very constrained.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">While I accept the Minister's point that it behoves all employers to ensure that the people they hire are appropriate for the work they do, nevertheless, a less haphazard approach is required if children are to be protected. It is leaving the onus on the employer, the school, the sporting or youth organisation or whatever. Many of these organisations are concerned at taking on responsibilities. Things have changed. In the past one generally knew the type of people who might volunteer to work in sporting or youth organisations. Now people move around and there is not the same sense of trust for the person who might volunteer to work in these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">In the context of trying to be absolutely sure about what we are doing rather than leaving it to chance, I would like to quote the last paragraph of <i>Suffer the Little Children,</i> written by Mary Raftery and Eoin O'Sullivan. Mary Raftery was the producer of the “States of Fear” television programme which initiated so much of the response we currently have to the child abuse of the past. Referring to the Laffoy Commission, she says in the last paragraph:</p>
          <p eId="para_708">Most importantly, perhaps, for the future of children in this country, the deliberations of the Commission may finally allow society to learn fully the lessons of the abusive past – a past that had generally been conveniently forgotten. Through that process there may, at last, be a full acknowledgement in every aspect of the childcare system, both in legislation and on the ground that the potential for abuse is a constant reality. The children of this country have experienced so much of it in the past that we should now be in a position to deal with it thoroughly and ruthlessly whenever it raises its most ugly head.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">That is a timely warning that we need to learn the lessons of the past, when there was an assumption that children were safe because they were in the care of religious under the supervision of the Department of Education. It took decades before it was acknowledged that they were not at all safe and that people in whom the most trust was vested were those who least deserved that trust. That is a major factor in the consideration of the whole area of child abuse. People who abuse children can be extremely clever and deceptive in the methods they use. It must be ensured that the protection systems are absolutely foolproof and comprehensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">The issue of balanced rights must be considered. Deputy Enright went into that in detail, as did the Minister. It must be ensured that people are not falsely accused and put on a register or vetting list in error. The right of appeal, and the right to defend one's good name, must be written into the system. That must be insisted on.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">I would differ from Deputy Deasy regarding the extent to which he would go in respect of sex offenders. The Minister has made the point that people who are in prison have to go with the process. I would not agree with Deputy Deasy that local communities should be told if someone has not taken a course while in prison and gone out into the community. Such an approach is fraught with danger.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">I am disappointed to note the operation so far of the Sex Offenders Act 2001. The Minister indicated that over 500 names are on the register of offenders. These are people registered subsequent to the enactment of the legislation, which is not retrospective. I am not sure that those running schools, voluntary organisations or health, community or youth projects are aware of the existence of the register. Even though I participated in the legislative process when the Bill was going through the Oireachtas, I am not sure how people can access the information. If a principal is running a school and has to replace a teacher who is sick for a couple of weeks with a part-time or temporary teacher, I am not sure whether he or she may inquire from the local Garda whether the prospective employee is on the sex offenders' register. If I am not sure, as a legislator who took part in the process of enactment. I am sure many more people are in a similar position. I would ask the Minister to take that point on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">He has told us that over 500 people are on the register. I would like clarification as to exactly how people get access to the register, for example the principal of a school or people running a youth group. They need not necessarily have access to the names on it, but at least they should be able to have somebody run through the register on their behalf to ensure someone is not included if they are considering employment.</p>

          <from>Ms Lynch:</from>
          <p eId="para_717">I congratulate the Fine Gael Party and Deputy Enright on bringing forward a motion in which everyone will find something he or she can relate to. It is said that the hallmark of any civilised society is how the weakest are protected. If that is taken as a benchmark it must be accepted that everything possible must be done to protect children.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The country was shook to its core a few years ago with the revelation of numerous abuse cases. The call from everyone, including politicians, the church and civil society, was that we must not allow that to happen again. Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the programme, "States of Fear", and the excellent book written by Mary Raftery and Eoin O'Sullivan. I was horrified when I read that book. Most of us lived through that period. When "States of Fear" was shown, I remember talking to a woman who was in her 70s and who told me she had not known what was happening at that time. However, we all remember being threatened with the local industrial school if we did anything wrong. People may not have known the details, but they knew it was not a nice place to be and that children would not like to go there. Children are not fools.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">I attended a lecture a number of years ago which was given by a man whose name I will not mention but whom I have not forgotten. He is an expert in the area of child sex abuse. He asked the audience to describe a paedophile, but no one could do that. He said no one could describe paedophiles because they come in different shapes, sizes, colours, classes and creeds. However, he said one could clearly describe their victims and that it was possible to say where to find them. They could be found where there are children over whom they have power and to whom they have access and who can usually be taken away overnight. They can be found in scouting organisations, swimming clubs, youth clubs, schools or anywhere a group of children are gathered.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">The Government has not done what Fine Gael is looking for in the motion, but it has also failed to produce a programme to inform potential victims about their defence. It is not protecting our children. The man who gave the lecture said he could walk into any school yard full of children and pick out potential victims. They are the quiet ones who are looking for friends and who usually need protection. They do not have much social interaction. He said children should be taught to be noisy and brazen and to scream if anyone comes near them. We do not do that in Ireland. We continue to tell our children to behave and not to tell stories. We should tell them not to keep secrets. I have not forgotten that lecture. I can pick out potential victims in a group of children because they do not have the same self-confidence as the noisy child in the middle of the group. I presume each of us in the House was the noisy child in the middle of the group, which means we do not have that experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">I know some people who work with swimming clubs. The swimming world was hit by a big scandal. It was sued and brought before tribunals and the sport was brought into disrepute. Those involved in swimming are trying desperately to rebuild it. However, they cannot employ the people they need to rebuild the sport and to give the swimmers the confidence they need because the vetting procedures which they require to keep children safe are not in place. I am not sure that everyone knows about the vetting procedures. I am not sure that organisations, such as youth clubs, sporting organisations, swimming clubs and schools, know they can ask if it is safe to employ someone before doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The man who gave the lecture I attended, which had a profound effect on me, also said that serious sex offenders will make at least ten fumbled attempts at assault before they eventually succeed. He said they could have up to 50 unrelated victims before they are caught. If it is established that it is not safe to allow someone to work with children and that person is dismissed, he will move to the next victim or group of children. I am worried that organisations are not being given the type of information they need. We are putting our children at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">At the start of this month I visited Notting Hill in London at the invitation of a small group of people who represent a larger group of victims of institutional abuse. As soon as they got out of institutions in Ireland, they went to England by ferry and did not return. It is estimated that 40% of all the victims of institutional abuse in Ireland now live outside the State, the majority of whom live in England. They range in age from their mid-30s to their mid-60s and each of them was damaged for life. One woman told me she did not celebrate birthdays or Christmas and, therefore, she did not know how old she was. She said no one could give that back to her. We have the opportunity to ensure that such abuse does not happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">We have good intentions, but the Government is dragging its feet on this issue, which is disgraceful. We can tolerate many things, but we cannot tolerate the potential abuse of children. I congratulate Deputy Enright for tabling this motion. I hope the Government has a change of heart and accepts the motion. I hope we can do something significant to ensure that such material is not available for the type of book mentioned.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_267">
          <from>Mr. Ferris:</from>
          <p eId="para_726">According to the Barron report, many of the documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings have been lost or destroyed. The inquiry was not able to see the security file on the Dublin bombings, for example, and there are no files on the UVF and UDA for 1974 and 1975, while there are files for all other years. According to the report, the commission was not given any explanation for their disappearance nor for the files on the Dublin bombings on 1 December 1972 that led to the introduction of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, which is strongly suspected was carried out by British intelligence agents. It is also worth remembering that on the day the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1972 was introduced, the Government was on the verge of falling were it not for the intervention of the then leader of the Fine Gael Party, Liam Cosgrave. The bombings in this city on that day prompted him to support the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">Apart from the missing files, the report states: "The Garda investigation failed to make full use of the information it obtained . . . The Government of the day showed little interest in the bombings." Why this was so must also be the subject of an inquiry. It is vital that the commission of inquiry should proceed immediately with an investigation not only into the events referred to in the preface to the report but also into all incidents that took place within this State from 1969 to 1976 where there is strong evidence of involvement by the British military and intelligence services.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">It is also necessary to examine the killing of John Francis Green and subsequent evidence given by members of British military intelligence at that time that they were directly involved in that killing. There is too the case of Thomas Ludlow.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">Furthermore, the Littlejohns, self-proclaimed British agents, were at that time acting at the behest of British intelligence. There are hints of this in the report, with references to British military personnel seen in Dublin at the time of the December 1972 bombs and immediately prior to the May 1974 incidents. Another British officer was found in possession of weapons in Dublin on the day of the bombings. Such an inquiry should take place in public so there can be a full account of what took place.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">Another issue mentioned is the role of agents within the Garda Special Branch. John McCoy, who was central to the Monaghan investigation, is mentioned and there have been strong allegations over the years regarding his connections and meetings with British security forces. It also appears that former Garda Commissioner, Ned Garvey, was well aware of whatever contacts were taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The most damning aspect of the report, however, is its verdict on the role of the Fine Gael-Labour coalition Government of the time. This Government contained such upstanding defenders of law and order as Liam Cosgrave, Paddy Cooney, Paddy Donegan and, of course, Conor Cruise O'Brien.</p>

          <p eId="para_733">What was their reaction to the bombings in 1974? According to the report, they made no effort to assist the investigation and when they were told that some of those responsible had been interned, they made no effort to follow up and pursue those individuals after they were released a short time later. Furthermore, serving members of the Garda at the time were under the distinct impression that the Government of the day did not want the investigation to be continued. It was not.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">All these matters must be subject to a full public inquiry. Some of the families have already called for this. It appears that everybody else who was party to the conflict of the past 30 years is expected to apologise continually and explain themselves. The least that those who were responsible for ignoring the murder of dozens of people in this city and the subversion of the very institutions they claimed to cherish above all else ought to be made do is the same. Lest we forget, the then Minister for Justice, Paddy Cooney, was instrumental in the formation of the heavy gang.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kitt):</from>
          <p eId="para_737">The Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 17 May 1974 were devastating outrages, which left 34 people dead and more than 240 injured. Many people never recovered. For many others, the legacy of pain and suffering remains and some still suffer from their injuries to this day.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">Terrible distress has been caused to the injured and bereaved victims of the bombings not only by the pain and injury to themselves but also by their sense that they were bereft of the support of the State and abandoned at their time of need. Over the years since the bombings, the victims and the relatives of the victims have campaigned to find out the truth about what happened. They had many difficult years during which they found they could not get a hearing. Their representative group, Justice for the Forgotten, worked hard to bring their cause to the attention of the public and we owe them a debt of gratitude for their persistence.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">I welcome the publication of the report by the former Supreme Court Judge, Mr. Justice Henry Barron, into the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings. When the Taoiseach met with Justice for the Forgotten in April 1999, the first Taoiseach to do so, he assured its members that he would do all he could to find out the truth of what happened on that terrible day. The families have had a long struggle for the truth and the publication of the report last week is helpful. The Taoiseach had the opportunity, together with Mr. Justice Barron, to meet with representatives of Justice for the Forgotten at their request on Wednesday last, before the publication of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">At that meeting, the Taoiseach was glad to avail of the opportunity to thank Mr. Justice Barron and his team personally for their hard work and dedication in bringing this phase of work to a conclusion. He also paid tribute to Justice for the Forgotten for its assistance to the inquiry and for its dedication and tenacity in pursuing its campaign for the truth, to the earlier work of the former Chief Justice, the late Liam Hamilton, and to the work of the Victims Commission, whose sole member, the former Tánaiste, John Wilson, also recommended an inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights will now consider, including in public session, the report of the independent commission and report back to the Dáil and Seanad within three months with its findings on whether the report addresses all the issues covered in the terms of reference of the inquiry, the lessons to be drawn and any actions to be taken in the light of the report, its findings and conclusions. As Deputy Ardagh said on publication of the report: "The report represents almost four years of difficult, painstaking work and I believe makes a valuable contribution towards shedding light on a very murky world." The joint committee has been asked by the Dáil and Seanad to advise and report back, having regard to the report's findings and following consultations with the inquiry, on whether a further public inquiry into any aspect of the report would be required or fruitful.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">There are serious, complex issues involved and I do not wish to pre-empt the work of the committee. We should wait and see what the committee recommends before we make a judgment. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Paul Murphy, has said that the British Government will consider the report with great care and that the British Government, from Prime Minister Blair down, has been committed to helping the inquiry as fully as possible. I hope this assistance also extends to the work of the joint committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">The Taoiseach's objective and the objective of Justice for the Forgotten was to find out the truth about what happened. Substantial progress has been made. Now the joint committee will have to consider if it is feasible to get beyond the information we have now and, if so, how that can be done. The committee will wish to hear from relevant people and it can accept, including in public session, submissions on the report from interested persons and bodies. I am sure some people will want to avail of the opportunity to talk to the committee about the content of the report. I therefore do not wish to say anything until people have had an opportunity to consider what the report says regarding their role and have had the opportunity to respond. The committee has set a date of 9 January for receipt of submissions and it will issue invitations to various interested parties to hearings in January.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">Since its publication last week, the Barron report has given rise to considerable public comment. The report represents four years work by the independent commission of inquiry and will take some time to assess. It is entirely appropriate that the joint committee should undertake this assessment and I look forward to the report of the committee and its careful assessment of the report and its conclusions.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">I understand Mr. Justice Barron will report early in the new year on the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973 and on the other cases referred to him, including the Seamus Ludlow case and the Dundalk bombing of 1975. Following recommendations of the Victims Commission, the remembrance fund, which was established earlier this year, will accept applications for funding early in the new year from those who suffered as a result of the troubles in Northern Ireland in this jurisdiction. A sum of €9 million will be available over three years and the fund will be administered by a commission chaired by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, David Andrews.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_273">
          <from>Ms Burton:</from>
          <p eId="para_746">I ask the Minister for Finance to make a statement on the reported €6 billion now held in offshore tax havens in the Isle of Man. This follows the recent report by accountants, KPMG, on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">Compliant taxpayers are entitled to ask about the scale of operations of Irish banks in the Isle of Man. It is incumbent on me to ask whether these operations by Irish banks in the Isle of Man have facilitated tax evasion by their customers in Ireland. I am aware that some of the money – I am not sure how much – in the Isle of Man is presumably there legitimately. It is difficult, however, to understand why in the current financial climate and under the rules of the European Union so many Irish banks and deposit holders should choose to channel such large amounts of Irish deposits into holdings in the Isle of Man.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">I raised the issue with the Minister for Finance during Question Time in the Dáil last Wednesday. The Minister has been less than forthcoming by simply confirming that high level meetings have taken place between the Revenue Commissioners and a number of financial institutions. Five such institutions appear to have met the Revenue Commissioners and further meetings are to take place, the bulk of them to conclude before the end of the year. It is imperative that the Minister for Finance should state the amount of tax, penalties and interest likely to be involved in the current examinations by the Revenue Commissioners. Is he confident that all the tax due will be recovered, that the banks have supplied all the information the Revenue Commissioners require and that we can assure compliant taxpayers that the negotiations with the Revenue Commissioners will not result in some kind of trade-off between the banks and the Revenue Commissioners?</p>
          <p eId="para_749">Recent statements by the chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank called on the banking sector to hold meetings with the Revenue Commissioners. In view of the Revenue Commissioners pursuit, and rightly so, of individual account holders, it is important that the directors and management of the banks should accept their share of the responsibility for guiding Irish deposit holders to the Isle of Man.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">The official reason for the Minister for Finance's reticence on the issue is the traditional veil of secrecy in regard to the affairs of individual taxpayers and the Revenue Commissioners. On this basis, as with the investment made by Irish investors in the Onassis yacht, <i>Christina,</i> where up to €25 million of capital allowances will be granted, matters of important public interest are precluded from detailed discussion and examination by the Dáil. While confidentiality between the Revenue Commissioners and individual taxpayers is appropriate, it should not be at the expense of giving compliant taxpayers the information necessary to maintain their confidence in the equity and fairness of the taxation system.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">The Minister for Finance confirmed that to date the money collected from the activities of the subsidiary operations of three of the financial institutions is in excess of €125 million. As many Irish banks are involved in offshore business in the Isle of Man, it is important that the Minister should give an indication to the Dáil of the total amount of money likely to be involved. At a time when many taxpayers on modest incomes fall into the 42% income tax bracket, and there have been cutbacks of €55 million in social welfare entitlements, it is incumbent on wealthy individuals and banks to pay their fair share of tax.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_274">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan):</from>
          <p eId="para_752">I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. It is important to point out that these assets reflect loans made by these subsidiaries and may not totally reflect the deposit base of these institutions. If the deposit base is €6 billion, it will reflect intergroup deposits, deposits made by other financial institutions as well as deposits made by residents of other jurisdictions. The assumption that Irish banks deal exclusively in the external assets of Irish taxpayers is erroneous. The primary concern of the Revenue Commissioners is to establish the extent to which the deposit base reflects previously undisclosed income or gains of Irish residents and to recover unpaid taxes together with interest and penalties.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">As is the case in all jurisdictions, the use of offshore facilities by taxpayers to hide funds is a particularly difficult challenge for Revenue administration. In this country the issue of offshore accounts has been a matter of considerable concern to the Revenue Commissioners for some time. The Commissioners established a specialist unit, the Offshore Assets Group, in late 2001 to examine and tackle it. Despite the difficulties, the group has had considerable success. To date in 2003, it has through its activities recovered €126 million for the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">Recently the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners initiated a series of high level meetings with those financial institutions with offshore subsidiaries. The purpose of these meetings is to discuss issues concerning possible tax evasion by Irish resident taxpayers involving the use of offshore accounts in these subsidiaries and the level of co-operation which can be expected from the institutions in the course of Revenue's further inquiries. The meetings held to date have been useful in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">As the Deputy knows, no Minister for Finance since the foundation of the State has introduced as much legislation to tackle the problem as the current Minister, Deputy McCreevy. He introduced far stiffer powers and penalties to deal with those who engage in tax evasion, whatever form it takes. In recent appearances before the Committee of Public Accounts, the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners pointed out that almost all the developments in this area could be attributed to the 1999 powers introduced by the Minister for Finance, which allow the Revenue Commissioners to examine financial institutions in a way that was not possible previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">The Finance Act 1999 provided substantial additional powers for Revenue which included the facilitating of greater access to material held by or in financial institutions, allowing access to the account of a named individual by way of an order issued by one of the three Revenue Commissioners where previously High Court approval was required; broadening the existing powers of access to financial accounts of named individuals and in particular providing for access in the case of a group or class of unidentified persons, empowering Revenue to apply to the courts for search warrants to gain evidence of accounts for the purpose of criminal investigations; permitting Revenue to conduct on-site audits of a bank's affairs, not just a PAYE or VAT audit as had been the case up to then; and enabling Revenue to obtain a greater range of information from third parties. The Finance Act 1999 also provided for the closure of certain tax loopholes in regard to offshore trusts and companies and the transfer of assets abroad. Subsequent finance Acts also provided additional powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">All these provisions have been used to good effect and in recent times brought in substantial revenues in tax, interest and penalties. Apart from the recent investigation into offshore deposits already referred to, they have facilitated successful investigations into so called Ansbacher account holders, the Clerical Medical-National Irish Bank scheme, as well as the look-back audit of the financial institutions and the identification of bogus non-resident account holders. In addition, the Government has provided significant additional resources for Revenue, an additional 400 posts in recent years. It has facilitated a restructuring of the organisation to provide for an even sharper focus on evasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">The Revenue Commissioners' Statement of Strategy 2003-05 contains a strong emphasis on maximising compliance. Among the key developments aimed at improving tax compliance and tackling tax evasion, apart from the Offshore Assets Group, are the establishment of an investigations and prosecutions division to deal with the prosecution of persons involved in serious tax evasion and a large cases division with a specific focus on large companies and wealthy individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">While the ongoing investigations are yielding significant sums of money, a bigger strategic issue for the Revenue Commissioners is the creation of a culture of tax compliance. Citizens and all persons resident here have to realise that tax pays for services. The message is very clear. Anyone who hides taxable income or evades tax will be pursued by the Revenue Commissioners. Unlike others who had the opportunity, but failed to do so, the Government has backed the efforts to tackle evasion with important and effective legislative initiatives and has provided extra resources for those doing this job.</p>

        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_275">
          <from>Mr. O'Dowd:</from>
          <p eId="para_760">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this item again for tonight. This time I hope the Minister has a reply. There are continual seizures of cocaine all around the country and I commend the Garda for its attention to this problem, particularly those with responsibility for drugs, who are doing a tremendous job. I praise their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">On the ground in Dublin, community workers in the north and south inner city and throughout the whole city area have been deeply concerned for some time about increasing levels of cocaine use, especially among young people. The results of the survey carried out by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs are timely. They show that in terms of current use among those aged 15 to 34 cocaine is the second most popular drug after cannabis and it is used most frequently among 15 to 25 year olds. This is a serious issue. The advisory committee reckons that one in 20 people in that age group has tried cocaine during their lives so far.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">Cocaine is becoming an insidious and readily available drug. It is available with greater frequency than previously in clubs, pubs and late night bars. An RTE programme earlier this year outlined how serious and prevalent the problem is. It is also frequently used by poly-drug users, which is a serious problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">Dr. Des Corrigan, the chairman of the NACD, said when the report was launched that higher injecting frequency was increasing the chance of users contracting hepatitis and HIV. According to the website of <i>The Irish Times</i> this evening, the incidence of HIV in Ireland has increased by 22% in the last year. The report does not state how this relates to the increase in cocaine use but it is clear that increasing damage is being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">What will the Government do about this? How will the national drugs strategy, which has been very successful so far in fighting the heroin problem, cope with the problem? It needs to be adjusted significantly and more resources need to be used to fight cocaine use. According to Ms Mairéad Lyons, the director of the NACD, cocaine addiction is especially problematic because there are no replacement drugs available. She said: "Drug-treatment services across the sectors face an enormous challenge in managing problem cocaine use amongst the opiate drug-treatment population." What does the Minister intend to do about this serious problem which is growing every day? I am particularly concerned about the number of young people for whom it is the drug of choice. It is very worrying, especially for parents.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_276">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan:</from>
          <p eId="para_765">I am replying on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern. This Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. The strategy aims to tackle the drugs problem, including that of cocaine use, in the most comprehensive way ever undertaken in this country. It contains 100 individual actions under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">The NACD report on cocaine use in Ireland to which the Deputy refers was compiled at the Government's request and the Minister of State has been aware of its findings for some time. The statistics for cocaine use in the report were primarily based on the recent drug prevalence survey which showed that 3.1% of the population had used the drug at some point, 1.1% had used it in the 12 months prior to the survey and 0.3% had used in the previous month. Not all European countries have undertaken comparable surveys, but of the ten countries that have we are roughly midway in terms of cocaine use. There is no room for complacency.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">The Minister of State is aware that the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, has reported that its services are beginning to notice an increase in those presenting with problems related to cocaine use, though it should be noted that the numbers presenting are still low. While cocaine use is on the increase, the numbers presenting for treatment are still very low and, in total, make up approximately 1% of those in treatment for drug use. The Deputy made that point in his contribution.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_277">
          <from>Mr. O'Dowd:</from>
          <p eId="para_768">On a point of information, the number of cocaine users in treatment in some other countries is 30% of the total number in treatment, so the level in Ireland is very low.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_278">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan:</from>
          <p eId="para_769">The Garda and Customs and Excise are having a considerable degree of success in seizing drugs, including cocaine, and the Garda Síochána policing plan for 2003 includes as a major priority ensuring that the objectives of the national drugs strategy are met. Drugs seizures might not necessarily be related to usage in Ireland as the drugs may have been in transit. Cocaine-related offences remain relatively uncommon, accounting for approximately 3% of all such offences. The majority of offences continue to be for cannabis, at approximately 60%, and ecstasy. However, this does not mean that we are not aware of the problem and, contrary to what the Deputy said, the Minister has never denied that cocaine use was rising. I am not sure the Deputy stated that the Minister suggested that.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan:</from>
          <p eId="para_773">The national drugs strategy is designed to deal with the problem of misuse of all drugs. The problem of cocaine use can be tackled within that framework and particularly through the pillars set out in the strategy. Under the supply reduction pillar Garda resources in local drugs task force areas will be increased. In addition, the volume of all illicit drugs seized will be increased by 25% by 2004 and by 50% by 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">Under the prevention pillar an ongoing national awareness campaign highlighting the dangers of drugs has been launched and comprehensive substance misuse prevention programmes are now on all school curriculums. The NACD report pointed out that drug prevention approaches in Ireland are consistent with best practice internationally. Under the treatment and rehabilitation pillar the strategy provides that there will be immediate access to professional assessment and counselling for the individual drug misuser, followed by commencement of treatment not later than one month after assessment. A range of treatment and rehabilitation options will also be developed in each health board area and a protocol will be developed for treating people under 18 who present with serious drug problems. It also seeks to expand the number of rehabilitation places available for recovering drug users by 30%.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">Other measures within the context of the strategy also tackle the misuse of cocaine. For example, the local drugs task forces, for which the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has responsibility, were established in 1997 in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse, regardless of which substances were involved. There are currently 14 task forces – 12 in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Bray. In total, the Government has allocated more than €65 million to implement the proposals contained in the two rounds of plans for the task forces since 1997. Under the young people's facilities and services fund approximately €130 million has been spent on or allocated to the 14 task force areas. Regional drugs task forces are also being established.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">The Deputy asked what additional measures could be taken to tackle cocaine misuse. Specific challenges are posed which vary according to the type of user involved. For existing heroin users who are also using cocaine, often through injecting, the challenge is to treat such users for cocaine dependence while simultaneously dealing with their heroin use. To deal with the broader population using cocaine, mostly through snorting the drug, the challenge is a difficult one. We need more prevention initiatives and a greater capacity to attract users into treatment, as the Deputy suggested. In the area of prevention, we need to counter the deluded perception among some users that this is a safe, clean drug.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">The NACD report pointed out that drug prevention approaches in Ireland are consistent with best practice internationally. The Minister has asked that the issue of cocaine use be considered in the context of the ongoing national awareness campaign. Also, where there is a demand, there is a need to expand the provision of appropriate treatment. As I said, the EHRA has noticed an increase in the number of those presenting with problems of cocaine use, although the numbers involved are still low. The drug treatment services have also reported that the majority of cocaine use that has come to its attention is in the form of poly-drug use, usually with heroin. Unlike heroin, there is no substitute drug available for the treatment of cocaine dependency. Existing services such as counselling and behavioural therapy are the best treatments available. For such treatments the motivation of the users must be high. Although cocaine is not physically addictive in the classic sense it does produce severe psychological cravings.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">Additional counsellors and outreach workers have been recruited by the three area health boards of the ERHA in the last number of years. Cocaine users who present to the drug treatment services are provided with a full assessment of their treatment needs. The area health boards continue to monitor cocaine misuse in their regions and where necessary have developed specific responses. For example, in the South-Western Area Health Board training courses are provided for staff involved in the drug treatment services of all three boards, with a specific emphasis on the treatment of cocaine misusers. The area of cocaine misuse is constantly being monitored.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">Although the strategy is flexible enough to deal with these challenges, it should be noted that an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the overall framework is due to be carried out by the end of 2004. This will allow us to examine the progress being made and enable us to identify priorities and refocus if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 17 December 2003.</p>

Students eligible for means-tested student supports have the charge paid for by local authorities or the vocational education committees. This is in addition to their grants. No student with a family income of less than €40,000 will pay the charge.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_24">In 1998 the Higher Education Authority issued to the publicly funded third level institutions a framework of good practice for the provision of student services within the charge. Particular reference was made to the principles of transparency and accountability. The framework consisted of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with students on the allocation of funding from the charge and on the determination of student services to be funded from this source. For transparency the framework recommended that each institution should provide information on the allocation of the charge towards examination, registration and student services on an annual basis.</summary>

The initial information received in some cases was limited due to the long period that had elapsed since they were closed.

          <p eId="para_810">The original announcement was made in December 1999. The Minister for Finance has informed me that since then his Department received submissions, representations and inquiries on behalf of more than 130 centres seeking to be included in the new decentralisation programme. The Government had to take account of a wide range of factors when selecting suitable locations for the new offices, including the location of existing decentralised offices and transport links. At present a significant number of my Department's staff serve in Athlone and Tullamore.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">Following the announcement by the Minister for Finance of the decentralisation programme in his budget speech, officials in my Department had a briefing meeting with all staff representative unions. Assurance was provided to the staff representative unions that there would be ongoing consultation with them. The decentralisation of my Department was further discussed at a subsequent meeting of the departmental council and at two of my meetings with the Department's management advisory committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">Officials in my Department have had initial discussions with officials in the Department of Finance.

They will liaise with the Office of Public Works with regard to office accommodation in Mullingar and Athlone.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">It is not possible to be specific about timescales at this early stage in the process. The initial phase of the decentralisation programme will involve discussions with staff unions at central council regarding general issues relevant to all Departments and agencies. The Office of Public Works will produce a report on office accommodation by March 2004. I intend to progress the decentralisation of my Department at the earliest possible date, consistent with the overall approach.</p>

          <p eId="para_819">The Education (Welfare) Act was fully commenced on 5 July 2002. Under the Act the National Educational Welfare Board was established to ensure that every child attends school regularly or otherwise receives an education.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">To discharge its responsibilities the board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare-focused services to children, families and schools. It appointed a chief executive officer, directors of corporate services and educational welfare services and a management team of eight staff. To date 53 educational welfare staff have been appointed. This includes 29 former school attendance officers who transferred to the board from the pre-existing service. Recently the board advertised a competition to fill a further 15 vacancies that will bring the total staff complement to 84.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">At this stage of the board's development its aim is to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas, including areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme and most at risk groups. Five regional teams have been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. For the first time an educational welfare service is available in the cities of Limerick, Galway and Kilkenny. As many as 12 towns have significant school going populations and 11 are designated under the Government's RAPID programme. They now have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. These towns are Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo and Letterkenny. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not receiving an education.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_25">The board will provide a service to families who decide to have their children educated in places other than in recognised schools. A small number of people with the appropriate skills have been allocated to this work and assessments will commence shortly. Recently my Department issued guidelines to assist the board in meeting its responsibilities in the area. An information leaflet and an application form are being prepared for issue to families who are educating their children at home. Work is also proceeding on the establishment of the register for 16 and 17 year olds who leave school to enter employment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_26">Guidelines are being prepared for schools on the reporting of student absences. A protocol outlining the interaction between schools and educational welfare staff is being developed with the assistance of the school implementation group recently established by the board.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_27">As provided for under section 10 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, I have arranged for officials of my Department to work with the board to ensure that any opportunities for integrated working between educational welfare officers and staff on other educational disadvantage programmes whose work involves a school attendance element are exploited to the maximum. I consider the implementation of protocols for such integrated working on attendance matters between the board and, in particular, the home-school-community liaison scheme, the school completion programme and the visiting teacher service for Travellers to be very important. When in place they will assist the board in carrying out its remit and ensure that all available existing resources are utilised to the full. I consider it essential that the board should focus on ways it can deliver the service with the personnel it has at the moment and with the help of other people involved in the area. When this has been achieved I will consider the position again taking into account the available resources.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_28">The board's 2004 provision is €5.7 million as indicated in the recently published Abridged Estimates Volume. The provision has been determined in the light of developments to date, the overall resources available and the need to ensure a collaborative and co-operative approach by all involved in addressing issues of disadvantage.</summary>

          <p eId="para_823">Unqualified teachers should only be employed in primary schools in exceptional circumstances and when all avenues for recruiting qualified personnel have been exhausted. The primary sector has experienced a shortage of trained teachers in recent years, mainly as a result of the large number of posts created to reduce class sizes, to cater for pupils in disadvantaged areas and to provide for those with special educational needs and the reduction in teacher training places in the mid-1990s. The difficulties being experienced are aggravated by the number of teachers availing of career break and jobsharing schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">My Department introduced a range of measures to address the current shortage of qualified teachers. It is also examining further options for addressing the teacher supply issue in consultation with relevant interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">The measures introduced include doubling the number of students admitted annually to the BEd programme in the colleges of education; providing postgraduate courses each year; recognising BEd graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualifications, as fully qualified; recognising Montessori trained teachers, who have successfully completed the full-time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by HETAC, or the Montessori qualification that is awarded on completion of the three year course in the AMI College, as being fully qualified substitute teachers and to teach in certain categories of special schools, special classes and as resource teachers in primary schools; recognising fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of school and classes without the necessity to hold the Irish language qualification; and my recent decision to recognise graduates of a new primary teacher training course, accredited by HETAC and being delivered by Hibernia College, for the purposes of primary teaching.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">I am committed to ensuring that the existing shortage of qualified teachers will be eliminated within the next two to three years. My Department will continue to consider new initiatives and keep existing initiatives under review.</p>

          <p eId="para_828">My Department's strategy to address the long-term accommodation needs of the gaelscoil is the delivery of purpose built facilities on a greenfield site. Due to the commercial sensitivity involved in acquiring sites generally, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the issue at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">At present, the gaelscoil is located in temporary rented accommodation for which my Department's school planning section provides 95% grant aid. The school authority has not brought any difficulties with the accommodation to the attention of the section. Since the property is being rented dissatisfaction with its condition can be brought to the attention of the lessor having regard to the terms of the lease.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, the school management authority is obliged to identify possible hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate safeguards in place. To assist school authorities discharge their statutory responsibilities in this regard, all recognised primary schools with permanent recognition are given an annual allocation of €3,809 plus €12.70 per pupil under the grant scheme for minor works. The grant can be used entirely at the discretion of school authorities to address basic health and safety and maintenance issues.

          <p eId="para_832">The Education Act 1998 places a duty on the patron of a school to appoint a board of management.

          <p eId="para_836">I presume that the Deputy is referring to the announcement made by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, that the retirement age for new entrants to the public service will be set at 65 years. The change is based on the report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">The Government established the commission in 1996 because of concerns about the rising cost of public service pensions. The age at which public servants, including teachers, should retire were amongst the matters considered by the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">In September 2001 the Government accepted its report in principle. It also decided to establish a joint working group with the public services committee of ICTU to examine and report on the implementation of the commission's recommendations. Recently the group made a report. The Minister for Finance has overall responsibility for public service pensions policy and he considered both reports. Subsequently he brought reform proposals to Government. It approved them and the Minister for Finance made the announcement in his budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">When the commission considered the retirement age for public servants it noted that most categories, including teachers, may serve until 65 years of age. It also noted that, for operational reasons, certain categories of public servants are required to retire before reaching 65 years. These comprise the Garda, the Defence Forces, prison officers and firefighters.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">The commission considered all aspects of the matter, including the fact that life expectancy is rising. It recommended that the retirement age for all new entrants to the public service, other than those who are required to retire earlier for operational reasons, be set at 65 years. The Government decided to apply the recommendation to public servants recruited on and after 1 April 2004. Serving public servants will not be affected. The new retirement age will not come into operation generally until after the 2040 when public servants recruited after 1 April 2004 begin to reach 65 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">All public service jobs will have the same retirement age for new entrants. The only exception will be those that take earlier retirement for operational reasons. Pension benefits are a consideration in career choices. However, the changes are not likely to give rise to particular difficulties in the recruitment of teachers.</p>

          <p eId="para_844">Capitation grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools. This includes heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from £45 or €57.14 per pupil to €111.58 in the 2002-03 school year. Recently I announced that the grant will be increased by a further €10 in 2004 and represents an increase of almost 113% since 1997. I remain committed to further improving the funding position of primary schools in the light of available resources.</p>

          <p eId="para_858">The level of capital funding to be provided for the primary and post-primary schools building programme for 2004 amounts to €387 million. In excess of €200 million will be targeted at primary school projects. This compares favourably with the €342.9 million available in 2003.</p>

It will also assure people that the programme is being operated in an open and transparent manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">The programme will clarify the progress to be made on projects in 2004. It will be evident that substantial inroads will be made in 2004 into projects that have been waiting for funding for some time. The level of funding provided for the 2004 building programme is further evidence of the Government's consistent commitment since 1997 to education and the modernisation of school buildings.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">Last week I announced the introduction of a new initiative for capital grants for smaller scale improvement works for primary and post-primary schools. It is an innovative feature of the 2004 programme and will be known as the summer works scheme. It is designed to fund smaller scale works at those schools that are most in need of resources. Successful applicants will know by 27 February 2004 if their projects will receive funding. This will allow them to plan and carry out works during the summer months.</p>

          <p eId="para_867">It is important to consider the issue of insurance costs for voluntary secondary schools in the wider context of the equalisation of funding arrangements across the second level system. Different funding arrangements have historically applied to the three sectors at second level. The Government and its predecessor removed some of the anomalies and the process continues.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_34">The standardper capita grant for voluntary secondary schools has been significantly increased in recent years and now amounts to €266 as against the rate of €224 that applied in 1997. Recently I announced a further increase in the 2004 Estimates in the standard per capita grant with effect from 1 January 2004 to €274. The increase will bring the grant for disadvantaged schools to €312.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_35">My announcement builds on my commitment towards enhanced equalisation funding measures for voluntary secondary schools. In addition to theper capita grant of €25 that was introduced under the school services support initiative for second level schools in September 2000, and now stands at €99 since January, secondary schools have benefited from a further increase of €28 bringing the grant for such schools to €127 from January. The per capita grant was in addition to a range of equalisation grants of up to some €15,500 per school per annum that were also approved for voluntary secondary schools. For a secondary school with 500 pupils this amounts to additional equalisation funding of almost €30,000 per annum and overall additional support services funding of approximately €80,000 per annum.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_36">A further measure of my continuing commitment is my recent announcement in the context of the 2004 Estimates that the support services grant of €127 per pupil will be further increased from 1 January 2004 in the case of voluntary secondary schools to €131. That is aper capita increase of €4. A measure of the increase in overall funding for secondary schools is that by comparison with 1997 a secondary school with 500 pupils now receives extra annual funding of up to €105,000 per annum.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_37">Insurance costs take account of the value of school premises, the number of staff and the number of pupils. Different ratings apply and have done so for many years in the Dublin area, other major cities and rural areas.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_38">If the Government covered the insurance costs of voluntary secondary schools it might only encourage the insurance sector to keep increasing premia on the basis that the State would pay them. It would also reduce the incentive for school managements to reduce risks. Such a move would be akin to the State insuring private property and I am not about to contemplate that. Schools may have to obtain more competitive quotes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_39">I am committed to further improving the funding of voluntary secondary schools in the light of available resources and to addressing the issue of equity raised by voluntary secondary schools. At a time of increased financial constraints, the recent announcement of further significant increases in the funding of voluntary secondary schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</summary>

The general objectives of the programme are to provide students with access to ICT enabled learning, promote and develop a strong ICT skills base and enhance the quality of teaching and learning through ICT. Recent surveys conducted by the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, on behalf of my Department indicate that substantial progress has been made to date on a number of key issues. There has been a dramatic improvement in student access to ICT. Average student to computer ratios are down from 37:1 to just over 11:1 at primary level and from 16:1 to 9:1 at second level. All schools now have Internet and e-mail facilities. The vast majority of teachers have received ICT training and development and school principals have received professional advice and support in ICT planning and development. Use of ICT in the curriculum has increased significantly.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">Through the current three year plan, Blueprint for the Future of ICT in Education, due to conclude at the end of this year, officials in my Department are preparing a new strategic plan which will build on achievements to date and enhance the integration of ICT in education at first and second level. Key priorities in this regard will be further development of schools' ICT infrastructure with particular emphasis on networking computer facilities; provision of broadband Internet access and related technical supports; new professional development programmes for teachers with particular emphasis on pedagogical use of ICT; advancement of ICT as a teaching and learning tool across the curriculum, providing access to quality educational resources on-line for use in learning and teaching and monitoring and evaluating the impact of ICT at school level to ensure that ICT resources contribute effectively to learning outcomes.</p>

          <p eId="para_881">I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 118 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">The sum of €630.5 million has been provided in the 2004 Estimates for universities and Higher Education Authority designated institutions. In addition, a sum of €410.2 million has been provided for the institute of technology sector, including one vocational education committee college. The challenge of ensuring that our higher education system is responsive to, and a leader in terms of, change being key to our future national economic and social well-being. The Government has identified the need to achieve a successful transition to a knowledge-based economy as being central to our future competitiveness and prosperity. The Government has been investing heavily in our higher education system and in our research infrastructure in order to provide the vital foundation required for that transition.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">From 1997 to 2003, there has been an increase of €297 million in the recurrent provision to the university sector. This represents an increase of approximately 89% over this period. Overall funding, capital and current, for the wider higher education sector will stand at €1.48 billion in 2004. This is up €631 million or 74% on 1997 levels. Demands for resources in any sector must be considered in the context of many competing meritorious programmes. I must balance a number of highly sensitive and immediate issues to which an appropriate priority has to be afforded. Equally, I understand that real sustainable progress on all fronts is only possible if we achieve the social and economic growth which will flow in the longer term from continued investment in the higher education sector.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_40">I am aware that the universities will be significantly challenged in the short-term by the constraints on current Exchequer funding placed on them in 2004 having regard to overall cost pressures. I appreciate the difficult choices individual institutions are presented with in reconciling available budgets with pre-existing demands and commitments. Equally, I am aware that as we move up the value chain as an economy over the coming years our institutions must be primed for the delivery of world-leading quality services. Each of us with a stake in the governance of the university sector in the short-term has a strong interest in ensuring that our universities are placed to meet these challenges from the front in international terms.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_41">The OECD review of higher education which I announced last August will make a key contribution in this regard. The objective in carrying out the review is to lay down a strategy for future excellence for higher education in Ireland in the context of the intensely competitive global environment in which we now operate. Moving forward, we need to measure ourselves against the best systems worldwide if we want to build on the strong foundations for success which Ireland already enjoys.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_42">The OECD review will provide us with that international reference point. Important questions around the future financing of the university sector, highlighted in the recent CHIU document which pointed to a growing dependence on Exchequer funding over recent years, will be considered as part of the OECD review. I look forward to working with the universities as they play their central part in achieving the vision for our future economic and social development. Together we must address the very immediate challenges we face in putting our higher education system on the strongest possible footing as we face the strategic task ahead.</summary>

      <b>Mr. Quinn</b>
      asked the

      the steps being taken to counter the drop-out rate, either in terms of those who do not transfer from primary to second level, or those who leave the system before completing junior or leaving certificate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_300">
          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey):</from>
          <p eId="para_885">The latest information, published in the NESF report 2002, on early school leaving estimated that between 700 and 1,000 young people do not transfer from primary to second level. My Department is completing analysis work for the development of a primary pupil database which will facilitate the collation of comprehensive data on transfer rates from primary to post-primary level in the future. The most recently published analysis by my Department of retention rates at second level was released in August of this year. The report indicates that of those who commenced the junior cycle programme in September 1994 approximately 3,600, or 5.7%, left school before completing the junior certificate three years later. Approximately 8,900 of those who sat the junior certificate did not sit the leaving certificate and approximately 12,500, or 18.2%, young people leave school annually without the leaving certificate.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">The problem of early school leaving is complex and addressing it requires action on a number of fronts, including legislative and curricular reforms and preventative interventions. This is the approach that my Department is taking. The Education Welfare Act 2000 and the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board provides a comprehensive framework for promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The Act requires schools to draw up school attendance strategies to promote regular school attendance, tackle the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The board is developing a nationwide service which is accessible to schools, parents, guardians and others who are concerned with the welfare of young people. It recently announced the establishment of five regional teams with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. For the first time, an educational welfare service is available in the cities of Limerick, Galway and Kilkenny and in 12 towns, 11 of which are designated under the Government's RAPID programme. The total staff complement of the board is 84.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">My Department's curriculum reform strategies have included widening the educational experience available to students. These strategies aim to achieve a greater level of inclusiveness in curricular provision by expanding funding for programmes such as the junior certificate schools programme, JCSP, the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, vocational preparation and training, VPT, and the leaving certificate applied, LCA. The Giving Children an Even Break programme provides additional financial and teaching supports for children in primary schools who are from disadvantaged backgrounds and most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. Expenditure on this programme in 2003 will exceed €17 million. The school completion programme has been implemented to directly target those in danger of dropping out of the education system and is a key component of my Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_43">The focus of the school completion programme is on young people between the ages of four and 18 years. It aims to develop local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people of schoolgoing age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes. There are also five youth encounter projects – three in Dublin and one each in Cork and Limerick – which are supported by my Department to provide educational facilities for young people aged between ten and 15 years who have become alienated from the conventional mainstream education system. The projects liaise closely with specified schools in their catchment areas.</summary>

          <p eId="para_907">My Department has just completed a survey of all post-primary schools on this issue. Student councils have been established in 558 of the 743 schools surveyed. Under section 27 of the Education Act 1998, students in a post-primary school may establish a student council, whose role is to promote the involvement of students in the affairs of the school in co-operation with the board of management, parents and teachers. This development had its origin in my Department's recognition that students have a voice and a contribution to make to their school. Student councils can play an integral and important role in the school community by providing a representative structure through which students can debate issues of concern and undertake initiatives of benefit to the school and the wider community.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">In 2002 my Department issued comprehensive guidelines on student councils to all second level schools.

The working group is comprised of students' representatives and all the partners in education. It will work to encourage the establishment of effective and democratic student councils in all second level schools in the country. The working group will examine the number, composition and operation of existing student councils in second level schools and will seek to identify the barriers, if any, to the establishment of student councils. The group had its inaugural meeting on 24 June 2003 and has met twice since. The working group will report on its findings and a proposed three year strategy to support the establishment and development of student councils to my colleague, the Minister of State with special responsibility for children, by December 2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_910">Individual school management authorities are responsible for implementing effective policies to counter bullying in schools. There is no requirement for individual school management authorities to report incidences of bullying to my Department. However, I am very aware of the issue of bullying in schools and my Department has moved to tackle it on a number of fronts. The education of students in primary and post-primary schools about anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education curriculum. The social, personal and health education programme is part of the curriculum in every primary school and is also a mandatory component of the junior cycle in all second level schools. The content of the programme reflects current best practice in the area of educating children in relation to bullying.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">As part of school development planning, schools are advised to have stated policies and to develop plans on discipline, health and safety and countering bullying behaviour. Parental involvement in the planning process is encouraged. Through their representation on boards of management and parents associations, parents can readily be consulted in the clarification and development of these policies and plans. The purpose of guidelines put in place in 1994 was to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents.</p>

It is currently under consideration in the light of the ongoing work of the committee. One of my key concerns in tackling disadvantage is to improve the level of integration between the various educational disadvantage programmes operated by my Department. I have requested the committee to undertake a root and branch review of all programmes to ensure optimum synergy and integration in them. The committee is engaged in this review.</p>

          <p eId="para_923">The indemnity agreement provided that the property contribution of the congregations was to be divided into two separate and distinct parts. The first part concerns property to be transferred from the congregations to the State, State agencies, local authorities or voluntary organisations after the date of the signing of the indemnity agreement on 5 June 2002. The total value of these property transfers for the purposes of the indemnity agreement was to be €36.54 million. The second part concerns property transferred from the congregations to the State, State agencies, local authorities or voluntary organisations between 11 May 1999 and the date of the signing of the indemnity agreement on 5 June 2002. The total value of these property transfers for the purposes of the indemnity agreement was to be €40.32 million. At this stage in respect of the properties in the first contribution, my Department has accepted in principle 34 of the properties offered. These properties have been valued by the congregations at €22.6 million. Of the properties offered, eight were rejected on the basis that no benefit to the State could be identified by acquiring a title while three properties are still under consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">In view of the fact that the State rejected eight of the original properties, the congregations submitted a list of additional properties for the State to consider in June 2003. One of the congregations was not in a position to offer an alternative property and decided to offer a cash sum equivalent instead. The amount being paid in cash by this congregation is €4 million, €2 million of which has already been received. The further €2 million will be paid in early 2004. The receipt of these cash payments reduces the value of the property to be transferred from €36.54 million to €32.54 million. Officials of my Department have considered the replacement properties offered and have informed CORI's legal representatives that the State was not in a position to benefit by acquiring a title to six of the properties concerned. The remaining six properties on this list are being considered by my Department. A decision will be conveyed to CORI's legal representatives in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">In relation to the schedule of properties already transferred, officials from my Department have sought additional information from CORI to ensure that each qualifies under the criteria laid down in the indemnity agreement regarding valuation, title and restriction on transfer for a 25 year period. To date, none of the properties on this list has been accepted.</p>

A EUROSTAT group is currently reviewing the accounting rules on this issue and a final report on the matter has not yet been issued. Consideration of the project will also be based on an evaluation of the completed pilot post-primary public private partnership schools project. This will include a thorough assessment of affordability of the project in the context of the competing demands on the capital funding envelopes going forward and will take into account the issues surrounding the general government balance.</p>

          <p eId="para_953">In this regard, a technical inspection at this school was completed recently and the report is being examined in my Department. This report, which includes consideration of the appropriate location of the school, will influence consideration of how best to provide for long-term accommodation needs. My Department will continue to liaise with the board of management in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">I regret that parents have taken a decision to deprive their children of education in this manner but I am pleased that a number of children have returned to school and I commend their parents. I urge all parents to return their children to school to continue their education.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_55">It is quite clear that the core issue in this case is not amenable to an early solution. My Department is willing however, to engage with the patron and the board of management to secure the future education of the children in appropriate accommodation. In the meantime, it is my strongly-held view that the children should be allowed to return to school to continue their education.</summary>

          <p eId="para_958">A revised syllabus for science was introduced, on an optional basis, in the current 2003-04 academic year for the junior certificate examination in 2006 and following years. A new syllabus in religious education at leaving certificate level was introduced in the current academic year; it is available as an option for those schools in which pupils took the religious education junior certificate examination in June 2003. Other schools will be invited to apply in subsequent years. Religious education will be examined in the leaving certificate examination in 2005 and following years. Revised syllabuses in history and in geography will be introduced in September 2004 for the leaving certificate examination in 2006 and following years.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">In addition to the above, a revised junior certificate physical education syllabus has been introduced as a non-examination subject in a selected number of schools with effect from 2003-04, and social personal and health education, also a non-examination subject, has been made a mandatory junior cycle subject in all schools with effect from September 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">The prescribed material which pupils may study – mainly in the case of language subjects such as English or Irish – may change from time to time.

          <p eId="para_964">In announcing the 2004 Estimates for education, I outlined the key features of my spending proposals for 2004 as follows: an additional €23 million for the primary school building programme; the allocation of €25 million as the first instalment on a €140 million capital investment by the Government to ensure that cycle three of the programme for research at third level, PRTLI, progresses rapidly; improvements in capitation payments for primary and post-primary schools – an additional €10 per pupil at primary and an additional €8 at post-primary, with a supplementary €4 per pupil for voluntary secondary schools as part of equalising funding in the sector; and continued targeting and prioritisation of disadvantage and special needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">It also features funding for the special education council, which will be established on a statutory basis under the upcoming disabilities Bill; €115 million extra being provided for residential institutions redress; €325 million for benchmarking and Sustaining Progress; €90 million for improved payments to temporary teachers and part-time workers; an increase of €80 in the student registration fee; and an increase of €10 in standard examination fees for the junior certificate and leaving certificate examinations.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">The Government regards education as a strategic priority and the overall increase of 12% in the education Estimates compared with the general Government increase of 5% is a clear demonstration of the Government's specific recognition of that priority. I should add that the recent budget announcement contained a further allocation of €30 million for school building which I welcome and which is a further indication of the Government's firm resolve to deal with school accommodation issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_974">The early start pre-school pilot project was established in 1994 and is in place in 40 schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk. The White Paper on early childhood education, Ready to Learn, published in December 1999, set out a comprehensive strategy for the development of early childhood education for all children aged up to six years.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">The enhancement of early childhood services, in accordance with the White Paper's recommendations, is being undertaken on a collaborative, phased basis and will draw together and build upon the many examples of best practice in early childhood education that have emerged over recent years. In order to help combat disadvantage and promote equality, special emphasis will be placed on the provision of appropriate pre-school education in areas of social deprivation and for those with special needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">The Department established the centre for early childhood development and education, CECDE, in October 2002, to develop within a three-year life span, a quality framework for early childhood education and to develop, through action research with existing programmes, targeted interventions for children who have special needs or who are disadvantaged. As recommended in the White Paper, the Department will, having reviewed the work of the centre in 2004, establish the early childhood education agency to replace the CECDE.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">The CECDE has begun work on the development of a conceptual framework of early childhood learning and development and this will be finished in early 2004. Furthermore, the centre recently completed an audit of research into the area of early childhood. The research, which will be made available in an online searchable database, will be of great benefit as a resource to policymakers, professionals and researchers working in the early childhood area.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">An audit of provision for disadvantaged children and children with special needs has also been completed and will be launched early in the new year. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is currently preparing for publication and consultation, a discussion paper Towards a Framework for Early Childhood Learning, which aims to support learning in the first six years of life, in all settings, including home, crèche, pre-school and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">Ireland participated in a recent OECD review with the aim of assessing quality, access and co-ordination in early childhood provision here. The review, which will be published shortly, will inform policy and programme development in the sector and will assist the work of the CECDE.</p>

          <p eId="para_983">Education has a crucial role to play in tackling social exclusion by providing access to life chances and thereby breaking the cycle of disadvantage. In this regard, my Department is implementing a wide range of programmes to tackle educational disadvantage. Some €460 million is being provided in 2003 for these programmes. Early school leaving is a key indicator for subsequent difficulties, including criminal activity. The school completion programme is being implemented to directly target those in danger of dropping out of the education system. The National Educational Welfare Board has been established on a statutory basis and will develop a nationwide service to provide welfare-focused services to children, families and schools. The board's work will complement that being done under the home-school-liaison scheme, the school completion programme and the visiting teacher service for Travellers, to ensure that every child attends school regularly or otherwise receives an education.</p>

In all this work, I am advised by the statutory Educational Disadvantage Committee set up under the Education Act 1998 to advise on policies and strategies to be adopted to identify and correct educational disadvantage.</p>

As a result, substantial progress has been made, not only in relation to pupil-computer ratios, but also in relation to a range of other indicators including Internet and e-mail facilities, the provision of teacher training in ICT and the development of ICT advice and support services for schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">In regard to pupil-computer ratios, a recent national survey of schools' ICT indicates that since 1998 average ratios have reduced from 37:1 to just over 11:1 at primary level, from 16:1 to 9:1 at second level and from 9:1 to under 4:1 in special schools. Although this is still slightly behind the EU average, it nonetheless represents a considerable improvement over a relatively short period of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">I should add that my Department is currently preparing a new strategic plan for schools' ICT which will build on the achievements made to date and will provide the necessary infrastructural supports for the advancement of ICT in education at first and second level. A key priority will be to make further improvements in student access to ICT in schools. However, the ratio of pupils to computers is not the only consideration in this regard. To help ensure that ICT is used effectively in teaching and learning in schools, particular emphasis will be placed on: developing appropriately designed local area networks within schools; delivering high-speed broadband Internet access to the classroom; introducing new teacher training programmes focusing on best use of ICT as a teaching and learning tool across the curriculum; developing quality educational online resources for use in the curriculum, and monitoring and evaluating the impact of ICT at school level to ensure that ICT resources contribute effectively to learning outcomes.</p>

          <p eId="para_998">The report, Supporting Equity in Higher Education, which was published in August 2003, was the outcome of a review of student support arrangements, undertaken, at my request, within my Department with the objective of ensuring that the benefits of the substantial investment being made in this area were maximised. It was also designed to provide options, for my consideration, in order to promote greater equity in access to, and participation in, higher education.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_62">The Deputy will be aware that I announced, on 25 May 2003, a €42 million support package for disadvantaged students in higher education. In constructing this package of measures, I had regard to the various policy options outlined in chapter 4 of the report which were developed on the basis of their potential to improve equity of access to higher education.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_63">In so far as the issue of reviewing the means test for third-level grants is concerned, the report identified the fairness of the means assessment on which student support is based as being a vitally important issue in promoting equity. It noted that the current system is widely regarded as being inequitable. The report concluded, in this context, that the administration of the student support schemes needs to be reformed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_64">In accordance with our commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, it is my intention to introduce a unified scheme. I also propose to put in place a more coherent administration system which will facilitate the introduction of more sophisticated means testing arrangements and ensure consistency of application and client accessibility as suggested in the report. I have asked my Department to enter into consultations in this regard and I expect such consultations to commence in the near future.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1000">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 127 of 12 November 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">The action group's report was published in July 2001. Department expenditure on third level access measures since 2001 has been as follows: 2001, €15.3 million; 2002, €23.98 million; 2003, €26 million (provision).</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">The most significant spending recommendation of the report of the action group on access to third level education concerned the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, commonly referred to as top-up grants. These recommendations were introduced, with retrospective effect, from the 2000-01 academic year.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_66">Following a review early in 2002, I increased the annual income threshold for the special rates by 32%. For 2002-03, I also increased the special rate of grant to €4,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and to €1,600 for students residing within 15 miles of college. As a result of the review, it was expected that the number of students qualifying for the top-up grant in 2002-03 would double to 7,000 students. Recent figures show that this target was exceeded with approximately 8,000 students receiving the top-up grant in 2002-03.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_67">A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. Area Development Management Ltd, ADM, under whose aegis the partnerships operate, administers the fund. The total allocation for the 2001-02 academic year was €1.2 million. For 2002-03, I increased the provision for the fund to €2 million. Allocations were made to 50 area partnerships and community groups in respect of the 2002-03 academic year. The provision of €2 million will continue to be made in respect of the fund for 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_68">The report of the action group on access to third level education set out a co-ordinated framework of actions required to improve equity of access to third-level. The group considered that a single co-ordinating body was essential in order to realise the framework. Accordingly, a key recommendation of the group was that a national office for equity of access to higher education be established to ensure the effective implementation of many of the recommendations in the report.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_69">I have given approval for the establishment of the national office for equity of access to higher education, within the Higher Education Authority. A number of senior staff have been recruited and I expect the office to be fully operational shortly. I anticipate that the national office will facilitate the aim of increasing third level access by the three target groups, in partnership with my Department, the third level institutions and other stakeholders and agencies.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_70">Some of the action group's recommendations relate to the achieving of targets for access to third level education, over the period of the national development plan, in regard to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability. I am committed to progressing these, and other recommendations in the report of the action group on access to third level education and to ensuring that the issue of equity of access to third level education remains a priority during my tenure of office as Minister for Education and Science.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_71">The Deputy will be aware of my announcement, on 25 May 2003, of a new package of measures costing €42 million in a full year to further address and ameliorate the problems facing students from low to moderate income households in accessing third-level education. This package combines substantial improvements in the level and coverage of the maintenance grant for those on low to moderate incomes, with increases in the level of top-up grant for those who are most disadvantaged.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_72">I believe that this substantial package of measures will provide the opportunity, in an unprecedented manner, for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to achieve their full potential in the education system.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1022">I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 356 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">A number of important steps have been taken to encourage increased take up by students of the sciences. In particular, important progress has been made in regard to curricular reform and inservice training support for teachers, with new syllabuses already implemented in leaving certificate biology, physics and chemistry. At primary level, a new syllabus in science was introduced in September 2003. A revised syllabus in junior certificate science was introduced on an optional basis in September 2003. More than 600 schools have indicated that they are introducing the revised syllabus. Work is under way on a new leaving certificate physical sciences syllabus to replace the existing physics and chemistry combined syllabus.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">All of these developments are being or have been supported by national inservice programmes for teachers. A total of three days inservice was provided for all primary teachers to support the implementation of the primary science programme, supported by a national team of 24 trainers. Some 1700 second level biology teachers, 900 chemistry teachers and 1000 physics teachers received inservice for the leaving certificate revised syllabuses, and a national programme is now being implemented for the revised junior certificate science syllabus.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">Significant additional resources have been provided, including substantial grants to primary schools in 1999, 2001 and 2002 at a cost of €10.376 million over three years. At second level there was an additional <i>per capita</i> grant for physics and chemistry at leaving certificate and a capital grants programme for senior cycle science ICT and science equipment. I recently announced a once-off grant scheme, likely to cost in the order of €12 million to support the implementation of the new junior certificate science syllabus.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_74">The following initiatives are designed to impact positively on science uptake: an ICT integration projects in teaching and learning under the schools IT initiative, and a new scope initiative in partnership with RTE, NCCA and the National Centre for Technology in Education; provision of materials and publications to schools to promote the attractiveness and relevance of science for students as a subject option and career path; reviews on mathematics, grading of subjects in the leaving certificate, gender equity issues in science, and initial reports on teacher training have been undertaken; awareness measures supported by industry and third level colleges linking with schools; foundation, bridging and progression measures to promote access to third level education; quality assurance initiatives in third level, including the sciences and the development of a national framework of qualifications by the National Qualifications Authority as an important step in developments to improve access, promote flexible assessment and accreditation processes, and enhance mobility across the further and higher education and training sectors.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_75">This work continues to be progressed and enhanced as resources permit in collaboration and consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Forfás and industry. My Department is fully committed to strengthening the quality of science teaching and learning, promoting increased scientific literacy and encouraging more students to choose science subjects at senior cycle and progress to third level options in this critical area as a vitally important part of the national strategy to support competitiveness and employment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_76">While the effect of these measures may only be felt in the longer term, there are already some signs of improvement in the numbers taking sciences. At leaving certificate level there are three main science subjects, namely, biology, chemistry and physics. Biology remains a popular subject with 40.3% of the cohort sitting the examination in June 2003, an increase from 39.8% in 2002. The uptake of physics and chemistry has been a cause of concern for some time. The decline in uptake of these subjects started in the 1980s and continued until recently. However, there has been a reversal of the trend in 2002. In the leaving certificate examination in June 2002, 15.6% of the cohort took physics – up from 14.1% in 2000 – and 11.7% took chemistry – up from 11.1% in 1999. In 2003, 15.7% took physics and 11.9% took chemistry.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_77">At junior certificate level there is one science subject and the uptake of this subject has been consistently high; 85.7% of the cohort took it in 2003. The STEPS programme provides for awareness initiatives to encourage the take up of engineering as a career, and provides information for students, and seminars for guidance counsellors and teaching staff, development projects, specific initiatives to encourage girls to choose engineering, roadshows, and school-industry links initiatives. The STEPS programme has now been incorporated into the discover science and engineering programme managed by Forfás with funding of €1.5 million in 2004 provided from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_78">Other initiatives are also under way between third level colleges linked with schools, such as the DCU science bus, the Blancharstown Institute of Technology science centre and the Waterford Institute of Technology chamber of challenges.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1034">Currently there are two video conferencing systems in my Department, utilising ISDN lines installed by Eircom, at the start of this year. The first system is set up in the office of my Department's second secretary, who has responsibility for the Northern Ireland division and European and international affairs division. The second is set up in one of my Department's conference rooms. This equipment is flexible and can also be utilised in other conference rooms and a number of offices, including my Department's press centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">I should add that video conferencing facilities will be expanded early next year to incorporate further locations within my Department and additional ISDN lines, which will allow more concurrent video conferencing.</p>

No special requirements apply regarding Irish language competency when recruiting staff for the Office of the Attorney General. The office is committed to encouraging the development of skills and proficiencies in the Irish language within the office and to supporting and participating in Civil Service Irish language training initiatives. The office has very recently agreed a language training policy which gives the Irish language a very high priority. It is intended to introduce the policy with effect from January, 2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_1043">In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, CE, participation levels have gradually been reduced in line with a strategic shift in policy in favour of training and other more appropriate supports. As part of this restructuring future participation in CE by an individual was capped at three years, effective from April, 2000. This change was introduced to discourage repeated participation in CE and to encourage unemployed persons to avail of training or education options where possible, which are shown to have more successful progression outcomes for individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">The three year-cap was amended in August 2001 to allow particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period. FÁS currently has discretion to offer up to 20% of the total number of CE participants a further period on the programme, on a case by case basis. Participants are considered for an extension if on reaching the end of their normal entitlements on CE they are likely to experience difficulty in getting employment due to their age, literacy or numeracy problems or a lack of suitable jobs available locally. There is no entitlement to additional time for persons having completed three years or longer, after they have left the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">The CE programme is currently under review. A decision on the future eligibility criteria for CE will be taken when the current review process has been brought to a conclusion.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey):</from>
          <p eId="para_1047">The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 transposed into Irish law, the original Working Time Directive 93/104/EC. This directive excluded a number of sectors such as mobile road transport workers, off-shore work and work on board sea-going sea fishing vessels and doctors in training.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">Amending Council Directive 2000/34/EC of 22 June 2000 was adopted to include the above sectors, previously excluded under the original directive. The position is that the transposition in Ireland relating to the sectors and activities covered by Council Directive 2000/34/EC involve policy areas which are the responsibility of a number of Government Departments as follows: policy decisions relating to mobile road transport workers require consultation with the Department of Transport; off-shore work and work on board sea-going sea fishing vessels are the responsibility of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and doctors in training are the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">My Department has overall central responsibility for employment rights legislation in Ireland and has been working closely with the above three Departments given the fact that it had previously transposed the original Working Time Directive 93/104/EC into Irish law through the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">The position in relation to each of the sectors covered by amending Council Directive 200/34/EC is as follows:</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">Mobile workers: The Department of Transport is currently examining a number of policy issues, relating to decisions about the utilisation of available derogations under the directive, in the cases of (a) mobile transport workers – for "workers concerned with the carriage of passengers on regular urban transport services" and (b) rail and aviation workers. The Department of Transport has undertaken to advise my Department of the position in relation to any decisions taken in this regard as soon as possible.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_81">Off-shore work and work on board sea-going sea fishing vessels: The provisions of the amending directive relating to off-shore work and work on board sea-going sea fishing vessels were due to have been transposed by 1 August 2003. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is drafting a statutory instrument to transpose this directive with respect to workers on board sea-going fishing vessels. Drafting is at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that the statutory instrument will be promulgated by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources by mid-December 2003 at the latest. Work on drafting the second ministerial statutory instrument in respect of off-shore work is also under consideration, and will involve consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. This statutory instrument is expected to be signed into Irish law shortly.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_82">Doctors in training: The Department of Health and Children has pointed out that Article 2 of the directive states that the date for bringing into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions shall be 1 August 2004, with regard to doctors in training. For that reason, that Department was not obliged to implement the provisions of the directive by 1 August 2003, as is the case for other professions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_83">The Department of Health and Children has also indicated to my Department that negotiations between the relevant medical representative organisations and that Department are about to commence. A primary aim of these negotiations will be to achieve agreement on the implementation of the requirements of the directive regarding reduction of non-consultant hospital doctors, that is, doctors in training, working hours by the relevant deadline. It is the Department of Health and Children's intention to transpose the provisions of the directive as regards doctors in training at the earliest opportunity, but in any case in advance of the 1 August 2004 deadline.</summary>

The announcement in July this year of the Government decision to release Magee Barracks, Kildare, and Gormanston Camp, County Meath, as well as a number of sites in the administration of the Office of Public Works, was a critical first step in ensuring early delivery of affordable housing under this initiative which is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. It is envisaged that the local authorities will have an important role in ensuring delivery of affordable housing at these sites. Arising from this development the necessary legal formalities are in train to effect a transfer of Magee Barracks from the administration of the Department of Defence at an early date.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_201">Under this Chapter, which is entitled Action with respect to threats to the Peace, Breaches of the Peace, and Acts of Aggression, the United Nations Security Council is mandated to take whatever action "as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security". Peace support operations mounted under this chapter are commonly known as peace enforcement operations where the consent of the parties is not required. The Defence Forces have previous experience of such missions, including UNMISET in East Timor, SFOR in Bosnia, KFOR in Kosovo and UNMEE in Eritrea.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_202">I understand the rules of engagement for UNMIL provide that the principle of minimum force and proportionality shall apply at all times and in all circumstances. Wherever the operational situation permits, every reasonable effort shall be made to control a situation through measures short of using force, including personal contact and negotiation. Any force used must be limited in its intensity and duration and be commensurate with the level of threat.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_203">Personnel serving with UNMIL are entitled to use force, up to and including deadly force, to defend and protect themselves, other UN personnel, international personnel, UN installations and, within their capabilities, civilians, where there is an immediate threat to life or of bodily harm. Personnel are entitled to use force, excluding deadly force, to prevent the escape of any apprehended or detained person pending handover to appropriate civilian authorities. However, the use of force, including deadly force, shall only be resorted to if all other means to control the situation have failed, or if an attack is so unexpected, that a moment's delay could lead to death or grievous injury to oneself or other designated personnel.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1362">One of the terms and conditions of the area-based compensatory allowance scheme is that applicants must meet a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare of the holding in the year preceding application. However, farmers who are unable to meet that minimum stocking density but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and-or sheep may continue to qualify for payment, provided their land is being utilised and is not in danger of undergrazing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363">The person named was not a headage recipient in 2000, and according to my Department's records, the stocking density of the holding did not meet the minimum requirement. My Department wrote to the person named with a view to establishing the type of farming activity being pursued. He replied stating that he had no stock. He was written to on 11 December 2003 advising him that he was not eligible for grants under the area-based compensatory allowance scheme and he was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed by writing to my Department within 21 days setting out any facts which he wished to put forward to support his case. His application will be further dealt with on receipt of his reply.</p>

          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</from>
          <p eId="para_1414">As part of the Sustaining Progress agreement, the income unit, IU, ceiling for eligibility under the dairy hygiene scheme is to be increased from the current level of 200 IUs to 450 IUs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1415">The investment ceiling is also to be increased to €50,000 together with a standard rate of grant of 40%. However, as the scheme is co-funded by the EU, the approval of the European Commission is required before the changes can be implemented. As it is a matter for the regional assemblies to seek this approval, the proposals were considered and approved at recent meetings of the monitoring committees for the regions, following which the formal approach to the European Commission was made. This was done by the directors of both assemblies on 24 October.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_208">In the meantime, work is at an advanced stage on revising the scheme document and the necessary application form in anticipation of early EU approval. In the recently published Estimates, the funding for the scheme for 2004 has been increased by 66%, compared with the 2003 allocation, to ensure that sufficient resources are available for this purpose.</summary>

In addition, staff from Cork city will be relocated to Macroom.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_210">My Department is already substantially decentralised as will be seen from the following table. My Department has carried out a number of decentralisations already to Castlebar, Cavan, Portlaoise, Johnstown Castle and Maynooth. It will be necessary to provide new accommodation for the staff moving to the Department's headquarters in Portlaoise.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_212">In the interim I can confirm for the Deputy that: the current headquarters of my Department is owned by the State; the offices needed for the new headquarters in Portlaoise have yet not been designed or built; discussions have taken place with representatives of the Department's staff involved and these discussions will be continued; the chairpersons and chief executives of the State agencies have been informed of the decision; Teagasc headquarters was sold earlier this year and the plans for relocating the headquarters to Carlow are advanced; the headquarters of Bord Bia and Bord Glas are in leased buildings.

          <p eId="para_1489">One of the terms and conditions of the area-based compensatory allowance scheme is that applicants must meet a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare of the holding in the year preceding application. However, farmers who are unable to meet that minimum stocking density but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and-or sheep may continue to qualify for payment, provided their land is being utilised and is not in danger of undergrazing.</p>

My Department wrote to the person named with a view to establishing the type of farming activity being pursued. She replied stating that she had eight cattle and six mares on her farm. An inspection was carried out on 11 December 2003. Six cattle and one mare were found at the inspection but it could not be ascertained that the cattle were registered under her herd number on the CMMS database or that the mare was registered under her name in the Irish Horse Register. A decision on payment of 2002 and 2003 area-based compensatory allowance cannot be made until ownership of the animals is established.</p>

      [31144/03]

        </question>
        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_387">
          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</from>
          <p eId="para_1492">I have placed a very high priority on improving Ireland's animal identification and traceability systems and I am determined to ensure that Ireland operates to the highest standards of disease monitoring and control, and remains at the forefront in terms of consumer assurance and food safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_1493">In the wake of the foot and mouth crisis of 2001, and against a backdrop of earlier unsuccessful efforts in this regard, I introduced a comprehensive individual sheep identification system – the national sheep identification system, NSIS, – which provides full individual identification and traceability of sheep from farm of origin to carcase and which is designed to be multi-functional, facilitating aspects such as flock management, consumer assurance and disease monitoring and control. In the latter regard, the FMD crisis underscored the potential damage to which our economy and the agriculture sector is exposed in the event of serious disease outbreaks if shortcomings in animal identification and traceability were not addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1494">Based on monitoring of NSIS and feedback to my Department from various quarters since 2001, I am satisfied that all elements of NSIS are now firmly bedded in across the sheep sector and working well. I have however made it clear consistently that I am always willing to enhance and improve NSIS and to address any operational difficulties which might arise, while maintaining its key components.</p>
          <p eId="para_1495">A new harmonised system of identification for the whole of the European Union has been proposed by the European Commission. The current proposals provide that there will be electronic individual identification of sheep from January 2008, together with a central movement database recording movements on a batch basis. The implementation date is subject to review following a Commission report in 2006. For the interim period it is proposed that all sheep be double tagged and identified individually, but that all recording would be on a flock basis. The final form of the proposal, which the Italian Presidency are bringing before the Council of Agriculture Ministers tomorrow will afford member states which already have systems in place offering a higher level of traceability than would be the case under the interim period system the option of retaining their own systems until the advent of electronic identification in a few years from now.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_215">I support the broad principle which underlies these proposals. In particular, I believe that it is necessary to have in place a robust, harmonised system of sheep identification backed up with good record-keeping allowing full traceability of animal movements at all times. I have always been in favour of making use of new and efficient technologies to achieve this end, subject of course to practicalities and cost-effectiveness, and I would be very anxious that Ireland and other member states would be in a position to move at the earliest possible date to an electronic system. In the interim, however, I believe that the system now in place and operating throughout the Irish sheep sector will continue to afford Ireland the level of protection and assurance in relation to both identification and traceability which I believe is strategically appropriate to this country.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_216">I have no plans, therefore, to dismantle NSIS and roll back the progress which has been made in this area since 2001 only to see Irish sheep farmers, marts, meat processors, etc. being asked a few years from now to once again reinstate and accommodate individual identification and traceability by the 2008 target date for the introduction of electronic systems. However as I have earlier stated, I am willing to examine and address aspects relating to the operation of NSIS in so far as these be addressed within the EU system that is put in place.</summary>

Since the stocking density of the holding of the person named exceeds 1.80 livestock units per hectare, it is regretted that he cannot be considered for payment of 2002 extensification premium.</p>

          <p eId="para_1590">The person named included a land parcel on his 2003 area aid application which was also being claimed by another applicant. The area aid unit of my Department wrote to the two applicants involved to clarify the situation. Replies were received from both applicants and the matter was resolved. The 2003 area aid application of the person named has been fully processed with an area determined for payment purposes of 39.07 hectares.</p>
          <p eId="para_1591">One of the terms and conditions of the area-based compensatory allowance scheme is that applicants must meet a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare of the holding in the year preceding application. However, farmers who are unable to meet that minimum stocking density but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and-or sheep may continue to qualify for payment, provided their land is being utilised and is not in danger of under grazing. While the person named was a headage recipient in 2000 and applied on 30 ewes under the 2003 ewe premium scheme, he does not hold 2003 ewe premium quota. It will be necessary therefore to have an on-farm inspection carried out. Following the inspection, a decision on entitlement to 2003 area-based compensatory allowance will be made.</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</from>
          <p eId="para_1601">A double taxation agreement between Ireland and France has been in force since 1966. However, because capital gains tax was not introduced in Ireland until 1975, it is not covered by the agreement. Therefore, where French tax and Irish tax arise on the same gain, principally in the case of a disposal of French immovable property by an Irish resident person, the French tax on the gain may be deducted as an expense for the purpose of calculating Irish capital gains tax, but may not be credited directly against the Irish tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_1602">Given that the existing agreement is almost 40 years old, it should be acknowledged that there are many issues that need to be addressed in any future agreement. Revenue have had first round negotiations on a new treaty with the French authorities and no dates for further discussions have yet been fixed. Consequently, it is difficult to predict when the negotiations will be concluded but it is the intention that capital gains tax will come within the scope of any new agreement.</p>

          <p eId="para_1672">As the Deputy will be aware, the gain arising to employees from shares in their employer company acquired under an approved profit sharing scheme or an approved share option scheme is not, subject to conditions, chargeable to income tax. In the case of shares acquired under other share option schemes, the employee is charged income tax on the difference between the acquisition price of the shares and the market value of the shares at the date of exercise of the option.</p>
          <p eId="para_1673">The Finance Act 2003 introduced new arrangements regarding the payment of, and accounting for, income tax due on the exercise of share options. Where such options are exercised on or after 30 June 2003, an amount known as relevant tax on a share option, RTSO, must be paid to the Collector-General no later than 30 days after the date on which the share option is exercised. Each payment of this tax must be accompanied by a return setting out details of the gain and the tax due.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_225">Prior to the introduction of this measure, some participants in such schemes were experiencing difficulty arising from unpaid tax liabilities incurred on the exercise of options in cases where the shares subsequently declined in value. This measure ensures that the tax due is paid as quickly as possible after the shares have been acquired thus avoiding the payment problems experienced by certain taxpayers under the previous arrangements.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1681">For the purposes of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 1938, as amended, the term "office holder" refers to a holder of a "qualifying office" as defined in section 13 of that Act. The following positions fall within the category of qualifying office: Taoiseach, Tánaiste, Minister, Attorney General, Minister of State, Ceann Comhairle, Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad and Leader of the House in Seanad Éireann. However, the term "office holder" would also apply under various Acts to many civil and public service positions. The detailed application of the measures announced in the budget to positions throughout the public service will be a matter for consideration during the implementation stages of those measures</p>

The sector identifier used on the tax records is based on the three digit NACE code which is an internationally recognised economic activity code system.

        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_415">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</from>
          <p eId="para_1742">I propose to take Questions Nos. 209 to 219, inclusive, and Question No. 226 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1743">I have established an implementation committee to oversee the new decentralisation programme announced in the budget, involving the reallocation of over 10,000 public service jobs to 53 provincial centres throughout 25 counties. It will be the responsibility of the committee to drive forward the implementation of the programme. The chair of the committee will report to a special Cabinet sub-committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1744">In addition, a joint Department of Finance-OPW unit is being established to support the implementation committee and to liaise with Departments. Furthermore, each Minister will establish a decentralisation unit in his or her Department which will report to the management advisory committee and the Minister. Each Department will report on a regular basis to the special Cabinet sub-committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1745">The overall objective will be to ensure that property being acquired at regional level is matched as closely as possible, both in time and in cost terms, by disposal of property currently held in the Dublin region, whether held on lease or otherwise. The implementation committee will oversee the production of a plan by the Office of Public Works by March 2004 to give effect to this objective. An extra allocation of €20 million capital is being included in the Department of Finance Vote for 2004 to meet any up front capital investment that may be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1746">The programme will be implemented on a voluntary basis. There will be no redundancies and, as on previous occasions, the payment of removal or relocation expenses will not arise. The existing partnership structures within each Department or agency will deal with any implementation related issues which are specific to that Department or agency. Any public service-wide issues will be addressed under the auspices of the public service monitoring group provided for in Sustaining Progress.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_230">The following table lists the organisations or agencies under my Department where staff are being decentralised, together with the locations and the approximate numbers of staff being decentralised in each case. The appropriate structures outlined above are being established in respect of my Department and the agencies under my Department. The further information requested by the Deputies relates, therefore, to matters which will only be determined through those structures in due course.</summary>

The regulations governing the payment of travel and subsistence expenses in the Civil Service specifically provide that travelling expenses are not payable in respect of any portion of a journey which covers all or part of an officer's usual route between home and headquarters. The impact of this provision is that if an official opts to remain living in Dublin after his or her post has been decentralised, while continuing to work in the post, he or she will not be able to avail of travel and subsistence payments for travel to and from work</p>

The commission decided against recommending a further general option to join spouses and children's schemes across the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1801">The only exception in this regard related to certain teachers. The commission noted that an option to join the revised spouses and children's scheme had not been afforded to national and secondary teachers who were in service in 1984 and recommended that such an option should now be offered to national and secondary teachers in the original schemes. As I indicated in the budget of 2004, I will be proposing certain changes to the pension terms and conditions of serving staff along the lines recommended by the commission and, in this context, I will give consideration to the foregoing.</p>

As there are a number of options still under consideration, it would be inappropriate to comment on any particular site at this stage. However, further progress on the acquisition of a site for Castledermot national school is dependent on reaching agreement with a vendor on a fair and reasonable price for a suitable site and funding being made available by the Department of Education and Science.</p>

          <p eId="para_1809">As part of budget 2004, I announced certain changes decided on by Government to pension arrangements in the public service. These changes largely represent the implementation of recommendations of the Commission on Public Service Pensions. These recommendations were themselves the subject of a further report by a joint management-union working group which reported in October 2003. The report of the working group did not contain agreed recommendations on many issues, including issues relating to teachers' pensions. As mentioned earlier, the budget changes reflect the pensions commission recommendations. The commission considered teachers' entitlements under the PCW in formulating its recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1810">Under the PCW, second level teachers achieved equalisation with the terms enjoyed historically by primary teachers in that pension benefits became payable at age 55 provided that a teacher had 35 years' service. The changes which I announced recently in the budget regarding retirement age for teachers and other public servants affect new entrants only and do not affect the pension arrangements of existing teachers.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_231">A limited early retirement pilot scheme for teachers was agreed as part of the PCW restructuring agreement between the Department of Education and Science and the teachers' unions in early 1997. Under the agreement the pilot scheme was to be reviewed in the light of the pensions commission report. The commission recommended continuation of the scheme for a further five years, after which it should be subject to further review. I envisage that this pilot scheme will be addressed in line with the commission approach.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_232">On the basis set out above, I am satisfied that my budget announcements concerning public service pensions do not breach agreements reached under the PCW in respect of the pensions of second level teachers.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1824">I propose to take Questions Nos. 233, 237, 239 and 240 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1825">In December 1999, the Minister for Finance announced in his Budget Statement that the Government intended to proceed with a new more radical programme of decentralisation, involving up to 10,000 civil and public servants. That intention was also signalled in An Agreed Programme for Government 2002-2007, where it was stated that "We will move forward the progressive decentralisation of Government Offices and Agencies taking into account the national spatial strategy".</p>
          <p eId="para_1826">Since his original announcement, the Minister for Finance and his Department have had extensive consultations about the issue with interested parties, including other Departments, Civil Service staff unions and associations and the strategic management initiative implementation group of Secretaries General. The Minister for Finance also received submissions, representations and inquiries from or on behalf of a large number of centres throughout the country seeking to be included in the new programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1827">Arising from this process, the Minister for Finance, on 3 December last, sought and received Government approval for the new programme of decentralisation, the details of which he later announced in Dáil Éireann during his budget 2004 speech. Under the programme, the development co-operation directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs will be transferred to Limerick. Details of the directorate's staffing numbers and payroll costs are given in table 1 below.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_233">In approving the decentralisation programme, the Government decided it would be put in place over the next three years and that it would be overseen by a special Cabinet sub-committee comprising the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Ministers for Finance and Environment, Heritage and Local Government and that decentralisation would be on a voluntary basis and without the payment of relocation expenses. The Government also approved the establishment of an implementation committee, which would be charged with developing a detailed implementation plan and associated communications strategy. The Minister for Finance announced the membership of the committee on 4 December. The committee will be chaired by Mr. Phil Flynn. The other members are Mr. Dermot Quigley, former chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Ms Jane Williams, managing director, Sia Group, Mr. Fred Devlin, chartered surveyor, Mr. Eddie Sullivan, secretary general, PSMD, Department of Finance, and Mr. Seán Benton, chairman, Office of Public Works. The committee has been asked to provide an implementation plan to the Cabinet sub-committee on decentralisation by the end of March 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_234">Preliminary discussions have been held with departmental staff representatives about the decentralisation programme and with the management of the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, APSO. That agency is in the process of being integrated into the Department of Foreign Affairs and it is expected that this process will be completed in the very near future. Another body under the aegis of this Department, the Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange, the Fulbright Commission, is not directly affected by the programme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_235">A passport office was established in Cork City in 1987. Details of the current staffing numbers for this office are given in table 2 below. I also announced in February of this year, plans to transfer sections of the Dublin passport office to Balbriggan in 2004. The staffing arrangements for the Balbriggan passport office are under consideration at present.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_236">Responsibility for all office accommodation issues relating to the decentralisation programme has been given to the Office of Public Works. An additional €20 million has been provided for in the Department of Finance Vote to meet any up front investment required in 2004. Any capital funding requirements for future years will be dealt with within the overall five year capital allocation framework announced in the budget. The Department of Foreign Affairs will be working with the Office of Public Works to secure a suitable premises in Limerick for the development co-operation directorate. The directorate currently occupies 4,300 sq. metres of rented office accommodation at Bishop's Square, Redmond's Hill, Dublin 2. The annual rental cost for this accommodation is €1,624,136.18. The expiry date for the lease, which is held by the Office of Public Works, is 3 January 2022.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_237">As regards other issues relating to the decentralisation programme, a committee has been formed within the Department to consider the practical and all other aspects of the decentralisation move.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1873">There can be no justification for so-called honour killings which result each year in the murder of thousands of women. While honour killings are predominantly targeted against women, children are also among the victims of these practices. Honour killings, which are mainly perpetrated by members of the same family, can be considered an extreme form of domestic violence. The Government condemns all forms of honour killings and calls for effective measures to put an end to such practices and to bring perpetrators to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1874">In the third committee of the United Nations General Assembly, Ireland was a co-sponsor of a Netherlands' resolution on the elimination of domestic violence against women which was adopted by consensus on 24 November 2003. Ireland also co-sponsored a Netherlands' resolution, again adopted by consensus, which requests the Secretary General of the United Nations to conduct an in-depth study on all forms of violence against women. Ireland believes that this study should address the question of honour killings, and looks forward to its recommendations.</p>

        <speech by="#TomKitt" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_430">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kitt):</from>
          <p eId="para_1876">Recent statistics published by UNAIDS indicated that in 2003 over 40 million people were living with the HIV-AIDS virus. Sub-Saharan Africa, by far the worst affected region, is now home to over 26.6 million people living with HIV-AIDS. Approximately 3.2 million new infections occurred there in 2003, while the epidemic claimed the lives of an estimated 2.3 million Africans in the past year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1877">HIV-AIDS has devastating effects on individuals, families and communities. It is also having profound effects on the social and economic development of the countries most affected by the epidemic. In many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, life expectancy rates are declining sharply, food production is falling as agricultural workers fall ill, children orphaned by HIV-AIDS leave school and suffer stigma and discrimination, and administrative capacity in Governments and the private sector is being undermined due to the loss through HIV-AIDS of experienced personnel.</p>
          <p eId="para_1878">In these situations, the HIV-AIDS epidemic is the biggest single obstacle to reducing poverty and attaining the development goals agreed by the international community at the United Nations millennium summit.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_243">Poverty, underdevelopment and illiteracy increase the vulnerability of people to HIV infection, and AIDS in turn exacerbates poverty. Although both rich and poor can be infected, the poor have fewer resources to cope with long-term illness. When they fall ill, they lose the capacity to generate income and incur additional medical costs. This results in a further deepening of their poverty.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_244">In the absence of well resourced health systems, the burden of care is falling more and more on communities to look after the sick, as well as the care of children who are being left behind as orphans. Women are particularly vulnerable and also carry the additional burden of having to be carers to those affected by AIDS.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_245">HIV-AIDS is a key priority for the Government's programme of official development assistance – Development Co-operation Ireland. Ireland was one of the first donors to develop a HIV-AIDS strategy. Since 2001, Ireland's financial allocations to the fight against AIDS have increased tenfold with a budget allocation of €40 million in 2003. These resources are directed at HIV-AIDS activities at the global, regional, national and community levels and are implemented through international and regional organisations and in our programme countries. The latter include six highly affected countries in southern and eastern Africa.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_246">The Government's strategy on debt, which I launched in June 2002, explicitly calls for a revision of the heavily indebted poor countries' initiative, the World Bank-IMF managed international response to the debt crisis. Our strategy criticised the fact that HIPC does not take into account the impact of the HIV-AIDS epidemic on a country's economy and its capacity to repay debt. We have actively campaigned for changes to the HIPC debt sustainability criteria to take account of HIV-AIDS, thereby providing a higher level of debt relief, or debt cancellation, for countries with high HIV-AIDS prevalence rates.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_247">I will continue to promote this policy, including during our forthcoming EU Presidency. We are in discussions with the European Commission about a study on debt sustainability currently being undertaken by the Commission which we hope will be published during our Presidency. This would provide a useful opportunity for discussion among our EU partners on the related issues of HIV-AIDS and debt relief.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_248">Many of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa most affected by HIV-AIDS are also marginalised from the global economy and their share of international trade is falling. The EU, through its Everything But Arms trade initiative, has completely opened the EU market quota and duty free to all exports from these least developed countries with transition periods for rice, sugar and bananas. At the WTO and in the UN, the EU has called on other major trading blocs to follow the EU's example and completely open their economies to goods from these countries. I will continue to promote this policy during our forthcoming EU Presidency, particularly at the 11th UN Conference on Trade and Development, UNCTAD, which will take place in Brazil in June 2004. Ireland will speak for the EU at this conference which will provide an important opportunity for the EU to engage in dialogue with developing countries on the key issues on the international trade and development agenda.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_250">An official of my Department participated in a conference held last month at Cambridge University in England, the purpose of which was to examine, from a legal perspective, the text of the draft treaty which is under discussion in the NGO forum.

        <summary eId="sum_251">I reiterate that I very much welcome the work being carried out on the text of the draft treaty and support the principle of having legally binding international agreements on export controls with the widest participation possible.

Ireland is committed to working with others to ensure that the illicit trafficking of such weapons is dealt with effectively by the international community. I understand that the NGOs involved in the promotion of the draft treaty are planning to hold a further meeting early next year to decide on how the process of developing the treaty can be advanced.

          <p eId="para_1931">The various levels of resource teaching support for pupils with special needs are outlined in my Department's circular 08/02. The numbers of hours available range from 2.5 hours per week to five hours per week. Each pupil allocated resource teaching provision must meet the criteria laid down in the circular. The levels of resource teaching provision in question have been in place since my Department's automatic response commenced in 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_1932">In conjunction with circular letters 7/02 and 8/02, my Department has issued guidelines for all professionals who may be involved in assessing children, including NEPS psychologists. These guidelines specify levels of support that are appropriate for the different categories of disability, and are based on the recommendations contained in the report of the special education review committee. In certain very exceptional cases, a NEPS psychologist may arrive at a professional judgment that a child would benefit from resource levels above those set out in the guidelines. In such cases, the psychologist will so recommend to my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1933">Circular 24/03, which issued to all primary schools in September 2003, outlined the process involved in dealing with all applications for special educational need supports received between 15 February and 31 August, 2003. The circular indicated that a dedicated team of inspectors and psychologists would review all applications for supports together with the relevant supporting professional documentation. It is not possible at this stage to provide specific information as to the breakdown of the number of applications dealt with by inspectors and psychologists, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_1934">The Deputy should note also that circular 24/03 reminds schools that an undesirable practice has developed in recent years of using resource hours for individual tuition only. It points out that an exclusive reliance on this approach is contrary to the principle of integration in teaching and learning. Wherever possible, the circular advises, schools should provide additional help for children in the mainstream classroom or, if necessary, in small groups. This approach minimises the disruption caused by the withdrawal of pupils for individual tuition and maximises the level of resource teaching available to them.</p>

          <p eId="para_1945">The group has raised two issues regarding the redress scheme to which a reply has already issued. The first of these issues is a request that additional institutions be added to the Schedule to the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002. At present, 128 institutions are listed on the Schedule to the Act. Section 4 of the Act enables additional institutions that are identified as reformatory schools, industrial schools, orphanages, children's homes and special schools, in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function, to be added to the Schedule. It is my intention that a list of additional institutions will be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as the verification process is completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1946">The second issue relates to the groups which wish that full information in relation to the operation of the redress board be made available to all former residents. Section 5 of the Act provides that the board shall make all reasonable efforts, through public advertisement, direct correspondence with persons who were residents of an institution, and otherwise, to ensure that persons who were residents of an institution are aware of the redress board and its remit. In this regard, the board commenced an advertising campaign in Ireland in December 2002 and has indicated that a targeted advertisement campaign in the United Kingdom will commence in January or February 2004.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_252">In addition, the Government, in devising its policies in the redress area, was conscious that a significant number of former residents of institutions had emigrated to the United Kingdom, particularly in the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Accordingly, five outreach officers were appointed to existing Irish centres in the UK to appraise and advise former residents who reside in the UK of developments in relation to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the Residential Institutions Redress Board. The outreach services are funded by my Department and continue to operate and provide appropriate advice in relation to the redress board and other matters.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1952">Under the terms of the free fees initiative, my Department meets the tuition fees of eligible students. The main conditions are that students must be first-time undergraduates and hold EU nationality or official refugee status and have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course. I would point out that this residency requirement applies to all EU nationals, including Irish nationals, in accordance with the judgment of the European Court of Justice that access to vocational training must apply equally to all EU nationals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1953">I would emphasise the distinction between the criteria that determine eligibility under the free fees initiative and the criteria by which individual third level institutions establish what rates of tuition fees should be charged in cases where a student does not qualify for free fees. The universities are autonomous bodies and, as such, may determine the level of fees to be charged in cases where the free fees initiative does not apply. The classification of a student as an EU or a non EU applicant is a matter for each institution to determine in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1954">Under section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000, educational establishments may not discriminate as regards the terms and conditions of admission on the basis that an applicant is of a different race, colour, nationality or ethnic or national origin. However, educational establishments may exercise differential treatment as between EU and non-EU nationals in relation to fees for admission and the allocation of places.</p>

          <p eId="para_1980">All of the functions of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and all of the head office functions of the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) which now operate from Dublin are included in the programme of decentralisation recently announced by the Minister for Finance. In the case of the NCCA, the square footage of its current main office building is 7,000. The premises are leased, with an expiry date of 13 August 2023, with a break option in the lease at 13 August 2013, subject to a penalty payment of six months rent. The NCCA also occupies 1,482 square feet of space in another building, the lease for which ends on 31 January 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_1981">In the case of the NEWB, the rent for its head office, in Green Street, Dublin, is €225,899 per annum. The lease is for 25 years and expires on 20 November 2028, with break options in the fifth and tenth years, with penalty payments of six months rent. Suitable accommodation, within Office of Public Works accommodation norms, will be provided for the staff in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_1982">No consultations took place with staff or staff representatives in the National Educational Welfare Board or National Council for Curriculum and Assessment prior to the recent announcement on decentralisation. The existing partnership structures will deal with any implementation-related issues which are specific to the two agencies. Any public service-wide issues will be addressed under the auspices of the public service monitoring group provided in Sustaining Progress.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_470">
          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey):</from>
          <p eId="para_1984">The decentralisation plans provide that a combined total of 75 staff in the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council and the Further Education and Training Awards Council will move to Edenderry. The staff range in grade in each agency from chief executive to clerical and administrative grades.</p>
          <p eId="para_1985">In the case of the National Qualifications Authority, the premises is leased with effect from 5 December 2002 for 25 years, with the right to terminate the lease at the end of ten years if the authority wishes to do so. The authority is responsible for the rent and outgoings until the end of the tenth year, but may assign the lease, with the landlord's consent, to a third party. If the permitted assignment is to a State tenant, the provisions contained in the termination clause continue to apply. The premises is 547.5 square metres and the rent is €219,217.50 per annum, with rent reviews every five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1986">In the case of the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, (HETAC) the premises is leased, with effect from 31 December 2002, for 21 years. The area of the premises is approximately 13,400 square feet. The rent is €280,000, with rent reviews every six years. HETAC is responsible for costs until the expiry of the lease. In the case of the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, the premises is leased for 25 years with effect from 26 June 2002. A break out clause provides that the lease may be re-assigned after 15 years. FETAC is liable for all costs until this date. The area of the premises is 17,610 square feet, plus 22 car spaces and the rent is €393,211.85 per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1987">While all the leases do not provide specifically for sub lease to a third party, it is anticipated that this can be negotiated and will not present insurmountable problems. Detailed plans and time-scales for the decentralisation move will not emerge in advance of the report from the national decentralisation implementation committee. It is not anticipated that the agencies will retain premises in Dublin after the move.</p>
          <p eId="para_1988">Decentralisation of staff will take place on a voluntary basis and, accordingly, payment of disturbance or removal expenses will not arise. Local authority tenants on the staff of these agencies will be given every possible assistance, but in the event of not being able to address their needs, they will still have the option of redeployment to a Dublin-based service. The Department does not expect difficulties in administration to arise, having regard to the scope for communication through new technologies. Discussions with staff interests are being planned at present.</p>

          <p eId="para_1993">As I have indicated previously, under present EU rules, where projects are financed on a deferred payment basis by the private sector, such as the Cork School of Music PPP project, the capital value of such projects is a charge on the general Government balance over the construction phase. The GGB is the critical measure of what can be accommodated within our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact of the Maastricht Treaty. A Eurostat group is currently reviewing the accounting rules on this issue and a final report on the matter has not yet been issued.</p>
          <p eId="para_1994">Consideration of the project will also be based on an evaluation of the completed pilot post-primary PPP schools project, together with a thorough assessment of affordability of the project in the context of the competing demands on the capital funding envelopes going forward and taking into account the issues surrounding the general Government balance.</p>

          <p eId="para_2011">Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann is a company limited by guarantee and without share capital, having been incorporated in 1972. In recent years a value for money study and an independent consultancy study have made recommendations for the reorganisation of the institute's activities. My Department had discussions with representatives of the executive committee of the company on their future intentions, having regard to a number of operational issues. The operation of the company is a matter for the members in accordance with its memorandum and articles of association.</p>
          <p eId="para_2012">At an extraordinary general meeting of the company, on 18 July 2003, the company agreed to initiate a process of voluntary liquidation. This decision was taken prior to the finalisation of the Department's estimates for 2004 and was not related to financial considerations. I understand that the agreement reached at this meeting was communicated to staff by the company at this time. A meeting of the executive committee of Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann on 5 December agreed a timetable for the proposed appointment of a liquidator on 9 January 2004 and agreed to issue redundancy notices to staff in advance of this. A briefing for staff of the institute was held on 5 December to apprise them of developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_2013">My Department has given a commitment to provide every assistance to the company in giving effect to its future intentions, in partnership with the staff of the institute. This will include arrangements for ensuring the continuation of the research functions previously carried out by the institute and, in the interests of assisting with an orderly wind-up, facilitating appropriate re-deployment or other appropriate arrangements for permanent staff in line with general public service policy in these matters and subject to agreement with the Department of Finance. Officials from my Department are meeting with staff of Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_2014">Options that may be available in this context are being explored and my Department will aim to be in a position to advise in this regard in advance of the expiration of the period of notice of redundancy and the appointment of a liquidator, who will assume responsibility for the control of the company's affairs upon appointment. The entitlements of those employees for whom appropriate re-deployment arrangements are not made will be determined in accordance with the terms of their contracts. I have asked to be kept informed of progress in these matters.</p>

This service is focused on students with literacy and numeracy difficulties who score below the 10th percentile in standardised tests of literacy and numeracy. The level of support provided in each case is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school. In the case of schools with an enrolment in excess of 600, a full-time post is allocated. Schools with lesser enrolments receive five of a teaching post. A total of four whole-time equivalent learning support teacher posts have been allocated to County Louth VEC.</p>
          <p eId="para_2022">The role of the resource teacher service is to support students who have been professionally assessed as having a special educational need arising from a disability. All applications for such support are referred to the national educational psychological service for consideration and recommendation as to the nature and level of the support required. Applications for resource teacher support in respect of students attending schools in the County Louth VEC area are being reviewed by the national educational psychological service. Every effort is being made to expedite this process so that any necessary supports can be put in place as speedily as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_2029">The Education (Welfare) Act was fully commenced on 5 July 2002. Under the Act, the national educational welfare board was established to ensure that every child attends school regularly or otherwise receives an education. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare-focused services to children, families and schools. It has appointed a chief executive officer, directors of corporate services and educational welfare services, and a management team of eight staff. To date, 53 educational welfare staff have been appointed. This includes 29 former school attendance officers who transferred to the board from the pre-existing service. The board has recently advertised a competition to fill a further 15 vacancies which will bring the total staff complement to 84.</p>
          <p eId="para_2030">At this stage of its development, the aim of the board is to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas and most at-risk groups. Five regional teams have now been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and staff have been deployed since early December in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the RAPID programme. Thirteen towns with significant school going populations, 12 of which are designated under the RAPID programme, also now have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. These towns are Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo and Letterkenny. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not receiving an education.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_257">The board has also moved to provide a service to families who decide to have their children educated in places other than in recognised schools. A small number of people with the appropriate skills have been allocated to this work and assessments will commence shortly. My Department has recently issued guidelines to assist the board in meeting its responsibilities in this area. An information leaflet and an application form are being prepared for issue to families who are educating their children at home. Work is also proceeding on the establishment of the register for 16 and 17 year olds who leave school to enter employment. Guidelines are being prepared for schools on the reporting of student absences and a protocol outlining the interaction between schools and educational welfare staff is being developed with the assistance of the school implementation group recently established by the board.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2037">There are no grants available from my Department for the employment of fitness teachers in crèches, pre-schools or junior schools. Physical education is however a compulsory part of the curriculum for primary schools.

          <p eId="para_2038">In October 2000, my Department introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools. Since the introduction of the scheme, my Department provided in excess of €5.5 million in grant aid to primary schools under this scheme for schools to provide coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or for the purchase of resource materials associated with the provision of physical education.</p>
          <p eId="para_2039">Materials and equipment purchased by schools in previous years will generally be available to them for the year. In 2002, primary schools designated as disadvantaged schools received a grant of €1,270 while other recognised primary schools received a grant of €635. Approximately €2.4 million was allocated to schools in 2002 under this scheme. In light of budgetary constraints, I decided to withdraw payment of the grant for 2003. The position will be kept under review as part of the normal Estimates process in the coming years.</p>

When that legislation was being enacted, it was considered possible that the Schedule may not cover all relevant institutions and, in order to ensure that institutions that may be identified at a later stage could be subsequently added to the Schedule, the provisions outlined in Section 4 were included in the Act. Section 4 of the Act allows that additional institutions that are identified as reformatory schools, industrial schools, orphanages, children's homes and special schools, in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function, can be added to the Schedule.</p>
          <p eId="para_2060">My Department has received correspondence from both individuals and survivor groups identifying a number of additional institutions that may be eligible for inclusion in the Schedule. Discussions have taken place between my Department and other Departments that may have provided a regulatory function in the operation of these facilities in order to ascertain whether these institutions are in fact eligible for inclusion. It is my intention that a list of additional institutions will be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as the verification process is completed.</p>

          <p eId="para_2107">The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced the introduction of a new initiative for capital grants for small scale improvement works called the summer works scheme. This new initiative will empower school authorities to manage their individual projects with minimum intervention from and interaction with the Department. The initiative will replace all existing small-scale building project schemes that have applied to both primary and post-primary schools with the exception of the grant scheme for minor works, commonly referred to as the devolved grant scheme, that applies to primary schools. Only applications that are made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this scheme will be considered for funding in 2004. Even where an application has already been submitted to my Department or a small-scale project has been sanctioned but is not yet at construction, it is essential that a fresh application be completed and submitted to my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_2108">The purpose of this approach is to ensure precise targeting of funding for small-scale works to those schools that are most in need of resources. This will be achieved by using a structured time bound application process open to all recognised schools. This process will elicit specific relevant information to enable a verifiable, speedy and equitable prioritisation process. A further key feature is that successful applicants will have early notice of the inclusion of their projects in the scheme. In this way, school authorities can achieve speedy delivery of necessary works. It is a matter for the authority of Scoil Mhuire, County Kildare, to apply to my Department under the terms of this new scheme for any improvement works which it wishes to have implemented at the school.</p>

          <p eId="para_2145">The Government established the business education and training partnership in late 1997 to develop national strategies to tackle the issues of skill needs, manpower needs estimation, and education and training for business. Ireland's future competitiveness and prosperity relies on the ability of education providers to respond quickly and flexibly to the skills needs of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_2146">The expert group on future skills needs was established by the Government in late 1997 as one element of a business, education and training partnership. Its remit is to develop national strategies to tackle the issue of skills needs, manpower needs estimation, and education and training for business. The objectives of the group are to identify the skills needs of different sectors and to advise on the actions needed to address them; develop estimating techniques that will assist in anticipating the future; advise on the promotion of education and continuous training links with business at national and local levels; consider strategic issues in developing partnerships between business and the education and continuous training sectors, in meeting the skills needs of business; advise on how to improve the awareness of job seekers of career sectors where there are demands for skills, of the qualifications required, and of how they can be obtained.</p>
          <p eId="para_2147">The expert group operates under the aegis of Forfás and is composed of employer and employee representatives, education, training and enterprise representatives, Departments and State agencies. My Department and the Higher Education Authority are represented on the group. The expert group has produced four major reports to date, together with two further single issue reports on e-business skills needs and in-company training. The fourth report of the group was launched in October 2003. This focuses on ICT, construction, biotechnology, food processing, logistics, engineering and financial skills. The importance of soft skills for organisational success is also explored and an overview of the labour market is provided.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_264">The work of the expert group is continuing, both in terms of revisiting skills areas already examined and in identifying and analysing new and emerging areas of skills needs. My Department will be working with all of the agencies concerned in overseeing progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the fourth skills report. Progress is also continuing in the implementation of recommendation of previous reports, including through the provision of a dedicated ICT skills fund amounting to €2.5 million in 2003. The provision of additional places in the health therapies on foot of a separate skills review conducted by Peter Bacon and Associates has also progressed during 2003 with new courses commencing in occupational therapy at University College, Galway and physiotherapy at the University of Limerick and new places being provided in physiotherapy at University College, Dublin, Trinity College, Dublin and the Royal College of Surgeons, Ireland.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_265">The Deputy will also be aware of the significant investment being made in research in higher education, primarily through the programme for research in third level institutions and the overall commitment to research in the national development plan. This investment acknowledges the importance of creating a leading edge research environment in higher education, which will both facilitate the development of future of graduates, postgraduates and doctoral students to leading international standards and will have a positive impact on the quality of education and training delivered in higher education institutions.</summary>

      his proposals to address literacy problems; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey):</from>
          <p eId="para_2149">Literacy skills are the fundamental building blocks of a good education. Young people with poor levels of reading literacy are a source of concern to my Department and form the target group for a range of actions. My concern and that of my Department is reflected in commitments given under the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion, 2003 to 2005, and under the latest social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which contains a special initiative on tackling educational disadvantage entitled, Literacy, Numeracy and Early School Leavers. I am fully committed to achieving the two headline national action plan targets relating to literacy, namely, halving the proportion of pupils with serious literacy difficulties by 2006, and reducing the proportion of the adult population aged 16 years to 64 years with restricted literacy to below 10% to 20% by 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_2150">My Department has a range of measures in place to prevent and ameliorate literacy difficulties at primary and second level. Learning-support teaching is provided in all primary schools by over 1,500 teachers who give intensive support to children with literacy difficulties. At second level, in excess of 540 learning support teachers are employed. In addition, resource teachers are provided for students with more severe learning difficulties and disabilities.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_266">My Department provides additional supports for schools serving areas that are designated as disadvantaged. These supports include the reading recovery programme in primary schools, reduced class sizes, home-school liaison schemes and additional grants, all of which assist in improving literacy levels.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_267">At post-primary level the junior certificate school programme focuses specifically on developing literacy skills while schools participating in the school completion programme are given considerable financial resources to provide targeted students with opportunities to improve their literacy skills in accordance with their identified needs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_268">In May 2003, the Educational Research Centre carried out, on behalf of my Department, a survey of reading literacy in primary schools designated as disadvantaged. The aim of this study is to benchmark the progress of children in first, third and sixth classes in acquiring literacy skills against national norms and to identify factors associated with literacy achievement. I look forward to receiving the results of this research which are due to be available in May 2004. This survey will be followed by a national assessment of reading in first and fifth classes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_269">Continuing assistance will be given to disadvantaged primary schools in implementing my Department's learning support guidelines, including adoption of a whole-school approach to supporting children with literacy difficulties and development and implementation of a literacy plan by each school. One-day seminars on literacy and the learning support guidelines were delivered by learning support trainers to whole staffs of all designated disadvantaged schools from March to June 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_270">My Department has taken the following steps which will ensure progress towards achieving the relevant NAPS target for adult literacy. Investment in adult literacy has expanded eighteenfold from €1 million in 1997 to €17.9 million in 2003, and participation in VEC literacy schemes had increased from 5,000 in 1997 to 28,000 by the end of 2002. My Department is implementing a quality framework and nationally certified staff development programmes. The use of television and radio has also been piloted and mainstreamed, with the fourth series of "Read Write Now" attracting an average weekly audience of over 120,000. In all cases, the television programme has been backed up by free learner support packs and a freefone helpline provided by the National Adult Literacy Agency. Family learning programmes, literacy and language for non-nationals, programmes for special needs and for Travellers have also been expanded. A workplace literacy programme has been piloted successfully and is being extended to all local authority areas, in co-operation with the Local Authority National Partnership Board. The promotion of workplace literacy is a commitment under Sustaining Progress.</summary>

While the report deals with the needs and capacity of the national gas network and the volumes of gas required up to 2025, the main thrust of the report is the analysis of future gas supply options and covers evaluation of infrastructure configurations, indigenous gas supply potential and security of supply issues.</p>

       if his attention has been drawn to the need for spoil from Dunmore East dredging to be brought at least five miles offshore instead of the present inshore dumping in Waterford Harbour Estuary off Hook Head which is damaging lobster breeding grounds and jeopardising the investment by the BIM v-notching project.

          <p eId="para_2596">The current position is that a fishing effort – days at sea – regime remains in place for vessels in the RSW pelagic fleet segment. Following agreement of a new Common Fisheries Policy at last year's Fisheries Council, the Commission adopted new implementing rules for fleet management in August 2003. These rules do not specifically provide for the continuation of the effort regimes provided for under the EU multi annual guidance programme IV which provided for, <i>inter alia,</i> an effort regime for the RSW pelagic segment of the Irish fleet. The continuation of the current effort regime for this segment of the fleet is now a matter of national competence. Policy Directive 2/2003 on national licensing policy does not propose any change to the current policy on fishing effort in respect of the RSW pelagic segment. I have asked that this issue be considered by the sea-fishing boat licensing policy review group before I make any decision on a possible change in the current policy in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_2598">Seven fishing vessels in the pelagic segment in respect of which replacement capacity requirements were not fully met were granted sea-fishing boat licences on a short-term basis in the period concerned. The names of these vessels are as follows: <i>Aine,</i>
                        <i>Antarctic,</i>
                        <i>Atlantean,</i>

                        <i>Neptune,</i> and <i>Western Viking</i>. The owners of these vessels had claimed that the tonnage shortfall involved related to safety capacity. The European Commission, earlier this year, turned down their safety capacity applications. The new sea-fishing boat licensing policy sets out the particular replacement capacity requirements which must be met in order for these vessels to continue to be licensed.</p>
          <p eId="para_2599">I am not aware of any vessels in the polyvalent segment having been licensed in the period concerned without full replacement capacity requirements having been considered to have been complied with. I understand, however, that there was one case where an issue arose subsequent to licensing as to whether a portion of replacement capacity had originally been assigned to the licensee. This matter has been pursued with the individual concerned.</p>

      <b>Mr. Gilmore</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</b>
       the number in respect of the sections of his Department or boards or agencies operating under the aegis of his Department, it is proposed to decentralise which are currently housed in leased office space or premises; the annual amount paid in rent in each case; when the lease runs out in each case; if there are financial penalties involved in the breaking of the lease in each case; his views on whether it is appropriate that a headquarters of a Department dealing with the marine brief should be located in an inland county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_2604">The various office premises of my Department in Dublin are either owned or leased by the Office of Public Works which is directly responsible for the rent and lease arrangements. I can advise the Deputy that the Central Fisheries Board owns its current premises in Dublin and Bord Iascaigh Mhara rents its current offices in Dun Laoghaire.</p>
          <p eId="para_2605">My Department's wide-ranging brief encompasses communications, broadcasting, energy, natural resources and inland fisheries as well as the marine functions. Given the breadth and diversity of my Department's business and customer bases, any county would be an appropriate location and I am satisfied that Cavan is an eminently suitable location for the Department's new headquarters.</p>

          <p eId="para_2607">The reason for the delay in the processing of the licensing application concerned was that the independent licensing authority, established under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, had to suspend the processing of sea-fishing boat licence applications. This situation arose, initially, from the need for clarification with regard to a new EU fleet management policy and, more recently, from the consequent need to introduce a new national licensing policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_2608">On 17 November I issued a policy directive to the licensing authority, as provided for under the aforementioned Act. The licensing authority is processing outstanding licence applications as rapidly as possible. It has advised me that a letter of offer of a licence has issued to the individual concerned.</p>

The programme is advertised on an annual basis. One of the main objectives of the programme is to assist such organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in suitable locations that will maximise use in terms of participation in sport and recreation; with the provision that the facilities should be high quality, safe, well designed and sustainable for both the user and the provider. Grant-aided projects must ensure that their facility-equipment will be accessible to people with disabilities.</p>

The Museum of Irish Country Folklife is the only area of my Department which has been already decentralised. It is located at Turlough Park House, Castlebar, County Mayo. There are currently 26 posts at this location.</p>
          <p eId="para_2633">The building occupied by my Department in Kildare Street is owned by the Office of Public Works, and the building in South Frederick Street is leased by the Office of Public Works, as is the Irish Sports Council's premises in Fitzwilliam Square. The Arts Council has commercial lease arrangements with two landlords for adjacent buildings in Merrion Square. The rent in total is €249,748 per annum. Termination arrangements will need to be negotiated for the unexpired portion of the leases, 14 years and 13 years respectively, and the council is seeking professional advice in this regard.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_281">Fáilte Ireland staff are currently located in office accommodation at Amiens Street, which is owned by Fáilte Ireland and which houses, in addition, a direct training centre, and in leased premises at Baggot Street Bridge and Pembroke Row. The rent for the premises on Baggot Street Bridge and on Pembroke Row is €345,140 per annum, with the leases due to expire in September 2060 and 15 March 2017 respectively.

In fact, the total expenditure on consultants' reports to date has been €883,700, which was made up of an expenditure of €492,700 on the feasibility study – A Stadium for the New Century – commissioned in 1998 and €391,000 in 2001 for the High-Point Rendel report.

Among the 23 expressions of interest received in October 2002 was a proposal from a consortium which outlined a turnkey proposal for the construction and operation of a stadium and arena at Abbotstown specifically for football and rugby use on the basis that a serviced site with the necessary transport infrastructure would be provided. However, no detailed financial proposals were provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_2638">The expression of interest initiative was intended to assist the Government in establishing what potential, if any, existed in the private sector for investment in a stadium.

The Irish representative at the meeting indicated that Ireland supported the Commission proposal. This decision was against the background of the scientific risk assessment undertaken on this product, initially by the Netherlands' competent food assessment body and subsequently by the EU scientific committee on food, which concluded that Bt 11 sweet maize is as safe for human food use as conventional sweet maize.</p>
          <p eId="para_2644">Ireland's position also reflected the fact that safeguard measures on labelling and traceability are now in place, following the completion of the European legislative framework for GMOs earlier this year. In this regard, two regulations have been adopted which establish a clear EU system to trace and label GMOs and to regulate the placing on the market and labelling of food and feed products derived from GMOs. This new legislation ensures full traceability of GMOs throughout the chain from farm to table and provides consumers with comprehensive information by labelling all food and feed consisting of, containing or produced from a GMO. Sweet maize from genetically modified maize line Bt 11 and any food containing same as an ingredient will be required to comply with the provisions of these new regulations.</p>

          <p eId="para_2660">I presume the Deputy is referring to a report titled, Keeping the NHS Local – A New Direction of Travel, published by the United Kingdom Department of Health in January 2003. The conclusions and overall approach of this document are closely in keeping with those of the report of the national task force on medical staffing – the Hanly report. Keeping the NHS Local notes that patients want more, not fewer, local services. It highlights a range of possibilities for more localised services, including increasingly sophisticated day surgery and clinical networks supported by telemedicine links.</p>
          <p eId="para_2661">As in the case of the Hanly report, Keeping the NHS Local concludes that there is a need for change in delivery of accident and emergency and acute services in "smaller" hospitals. It proposes removal of 24-hour on-site surgical staffing, introduction of minor injury units and a greater role for local hospitals in delivery of day procedures, specialist outpatient care and diagnostics.</p>
          <p eId="para_2662">The NHS report argues – section 2.2.12 – that patients need, above all, high quality care and the best possible outcomes. It asserts that improving quality of care will always be an important factor in developing new configurations, with patient safety coming first, underpinned by research evidence and professional opinion section – 2.2.13.</p>
          <p eId="para_2663">Keeping the NHS Local highlights – section 2.2.15 – how important it is "that future service models allow working patterns that are compliant with the EWTD"– European working time directive. It stresses that "the nature of 24 hour services in a number of locations may need to change. Making greater use of networking between community minor injuries units and acute centres and other redesign approaches will be needed to ensure that people have locally accessible emergency care."</p>
          <p eId="para_2664">Keeping the NHS Local mirrors many of the recommendations of the Hanly report, noting – section 2.4.8 – that the pilot programmes to implement the EWTD, and many other hospital sites in the UK, are exploring opportunities for: nurse practitioners to provide a first on-call tier cover in medicine, surgery, accident and emergency and intensive care; senior house officers to provide cover across related clinical specialties e.g. surgery, trauma and orthopaedics and ear, nose and throat; pharmacy technicians to manage patient medicines; medical assistants to reduce the workload on doctors in training; surgical discharge led by nurses or other non-medical practitioners.</p>

          <p eId="para_2666">The publication of the report of the national task force on medical staffing – Hanly report – following on the publication of the Prospectus and Brennan reports in June 2002, completed the package of reforms set out in the health service reform programme announced in June. The Government published the Hanly report on October 15 and endorsed its recommendations in principle, including its central conclusion that a consultant-provided service is the only viable means of providing safe, high quality care while reducing the working hours of doctors in training as required under the European working time directive and reorganising medical education and training appropriately.</p>
          <p eId="para_2667">The Hanly report contains a range of recommendations on medical education and training, which the Government has endorsed in principle. In particular, the report recognises that genuine training posts for all non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, are integral to a consultant-provided service by recommending a definitive shift away from the creation of NCHD posts for purely service reasons, the phasing out of all such non-training NCHD posts and the regulation of all hospital medical posts by a single agency subject to a requirement for independent approval of NCHD training posts on the basis of training, as distinct from service, criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_2668">The report also recommended a dedicated statutory central authority with a wide range of medical education and training functions including the approval of NCHD posts. The Government endorsed the need to draw together the various functions relating to medical education and training, but believed that this could best be achieved within the reformed health structures announced in June on foot of the Prospectus and Brennan reports. Current thinking is that these functions are best carried out within the health service executive, when formally established. This will require putting in place appropriate mechanisms to guarantee sufficient independence of service pressures to ensure that all junior doctors will be in genuine structured training posts.</p>

I also understand that the college of anaesthetists has decided to adopt an approach which considers satisfactory performance in anaesthesia, in a recognised training post, of more than 24 months as sufficient to issue the general professional training certificate to facilitate full registration. This will be contingent on satisfactory in-training assessments and an assessment of competence in anaesthesia by the appropriate consultant anaesthetists.</summary>

The STFA published an interim report in May 2002 which contained a number of recommendations, the main thrust of which are to protect health and public safety as well as creating an environment that helps people to make healthy choices. An interdepartmental group was established to co-ordinate the responses of other Government Departments to the recommendations and that group will report back to me shortly.</p>

          <p eId="para_2688">The SLÁN survey published earlier this year revealed that reported rates of overweight and obesity, highlighted in the graph below, have increased in both adult men and women from 1998 to 2002. Obesity rates for men have risen from 11% reported in the SLÁN survey in 1998 to 14% in 2002 and from 9% of women to 12% in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_2689">The increase in obesity is accompanied by a significant increase in levels of physical inactivity. Numbers of those reporting no physical activity at all have increased among both men, from 21% to 30%, and women, from 20% to 25%.</p>
          <p eId="para_2690">One of the key strategic aims in the national health promotion strategy is to increase the percentage of the population who consume the recommended daily servings of food and maintain a healthy weight. As part of the strategy, a key objective is to implement national healthy eating guidelines. Food and nutrition guidelines for primary schools will be published shortly, the aim of which will be to educate children on nutrition and enable them to make healthy food choices throughout life.</p>
          <p eId="para_2691">The health strategy's primary goal is to achieve better health for everyone through a population health approach. National campaigns support the implementation of these strategies, the aims of which are to raise awareness of nutrition and physical activity. The campaign, "Let it Go – just for 30 minutes", focuses on the message that even minor increases in the level of activity can lead to positive health benefits. The national healthy eating campaign has concentrated on encouraging people to eat four or more portions of fruit or vegetables per day.</p>
          <p eId="para_2692">As part of these campaigns health boards provide regional and local focus. As a direct result of the cardiovascular health strategy there are now 36 additional community dieticians in post.</p>
          <p eId="para_2693">Dietitians have formed partnerships with community groups to provide nutrition education, cookery programmes and healthy eating projects. The majority of boards have been resourced to run specific targeted, focused, sustained programmes aimed in particular at those on low income. Physical activity co-ordinators have also been appointed in each board, their task is to promote physical activity amongst the population as recommended in the national strategies.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_357">The results of the recently published SLÁN survey demonstrates that further action needs to be taken to halt and reverse this trend. Obesity has been linked to increased prevalence of diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. The Department of Health and Children recognises the need to respond to this information rapidly.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_358">A multidisciplinary task force comprising the key stakeholders will be established shortly. The task force's primary aim will be to halt any further increase in obesity levels.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2706">As the Deputy is aware, Ireland is legally obliged to begin applying the conditions stipulated in the European working time directive to doctors in training from 1 August 2004, and I am anxious not to avoid or postpone application of these employment rights. Discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation in relation to the implementation of the directive as it relates to doctors in training are set to re-convene in the labour relations commission on 17 December 2003.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_359">The report of the national taskforce on medical staffing, Hanly report, specifies a number of national initiatives which, when combined with appropriate local action, provide the capacity to deliver on the requirements of the European working time directive in relation to the reduction of working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, by 1 August 2004. These initiatives are as follows: Reduction of tiered on-call by different grades of NCHD; introduction of cross-cover arrangements; new NCHD working patterns; rostering of hospital medical staff; changes in skill-mix and practice for other grades of hospital staff.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_360">The Hanly report also recommends review of a range of work patterns, accurate recording of information and centralised rostering by each health agency; and at a national level, regulation by a single national agency of all hospital medical posts, subject to independent approval of training posts based on training criteria. Other steps recommended to reduce the working week as required include the establishment of a national industrial relations process group to implement the task force's proposals on tiered on-call, cross-cover and other relevant issues and to monitor progress in relation to the reduction in NCHD hours, and the immediate establishment of a working group in each hospital to work with the national industrial relations group and to progress measures proposed by the task force for the reduction of NCHD hours at local level. These groups should include appropriate hospital managers, consultants, NCHDs, nurses and other relevant health care professionals. Arrangements for the establishment of these groups will be on the agenda for discussion with the Irish medical organisation at the meeting on 17 December.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_361">No additional funding is being allocated to health agencies for the implementation of the European working time directive. As the working week for NCHDs will be reduced from the current average of 77 hours to 58 hours as required under the directive, this should result in significant financial flexibility in the implementation of the necessary measures.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_362">The possibility of penalties for any instance of non-compliance with the terms of the EWTD will, in the first instance, be levied on health employers for non-compliance with Irish law rather than on the State by the European Union. In this context, I have not set specific funds aside within my Department or on behalf of the health agencies to pay such penalties should they arise.

          <p eId="para_2726">I propose to take Questions Nos. 432 and 433 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2727">The chief executive officer of each health board-authority is responsible for the management of the workforce in his-her region, including the appropriate staffing mix and the precise grades of staff employed, in line with service plan priorities, subject to overall employment levels remaining within the regional approved ceiling.</p>
          <p eId="para_2728">Staffing requirements in the areas highlighted by the Deputy should be viewed in the context of the substantial increases in employment levels achieved in these areas over recent years. In this context, comparing employment levels at end of June 2003 to those at end of 1999, there were nearly 85% or 5,817 more health and social care professionals employed in the health services in wholetime equivalent, WTE, terms.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_363">Developments such as pay increases, improvements in career structure and enhanced opportunities for professional and career development have all supported increased staffing levels for key health and social care professions. The implementation of the pay recommendations of the public service benchmarking body – subject to the successful completion of the performance verification process – will make a further important contribution to recruitment and improved retention. The ongoing implementation of the action plan for people management – a key action under the health strategy – has a crucial role in improving retention and reducing turnover of skilled professional staff.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_364">Specific human resource initiatives have contributed significantly to meeting the human resource requirements of the health services, including those highlighted by the Deputy.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_365">As far as the therapy professions are concerned, the report, Current and Future Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists, commissioned by my Department from Dr. Peter Bacon and associates, concluded that a major expansion was essential in the numbers of therapists and this required a very substantial increase in therapy training places to meet the long-term requirements of the health services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_366">Significant progress has been achieved in boosting the number of therapy training places in line with the recommendations of that report. In May 2002, the Minister for Health and Children announced, in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Science, an additional 175 therapy training places in physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy to achieve the recommended increase in the number of therapists over the next decade recommended in the report. The first intake into these additional training places, which include 75 speech and language therapy places, in UL, UCC and NUIG, commenced this year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_367">Intensive efforts have been undertaken to improve staffing levels in occupational therapy and speech and language therapy both at local and national level. The success of these measures are reflected in the increase of 77 speech and language therapists, which is more than 20%, and 208 occupational therapists, which is more than 47%, employed in the public health service over the past two years. Relevant developments include the continued implementation of the recommendation of the report of the expert group on various health professions, which included new pay scales and career structures, the undertaking of a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards, the introduction of a fast-track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals and the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications.</summary>

A particular priority is to secure the best return, in terms of graduate output, on the significant financial resources being invested in the health services to support postgraduate clinical psychology training. Consequently, my Department, together with the health boards' directors of human resources, has been examining various issues in relation to human resource planning for clinical psychologists in the health services including the requirement to increase the number of postgraduate psychology training places on a planned and sustainable medium-term basis. A paper outlining a proposal to develop a new model has been produced and this document has been circulated to the relevant parties for discussion.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2752">Under the Health Acts, hearing aids are provided free of charge to adult medical card holders over the age of 16 years who require them. The determination of eligibility of applicants for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. Persons aged 70 and over are automatically eligible for a medical card without reference to their means.

          <p eId="para_2753">The means test applicable for medical card applicants is based on family income. In exceptional cases, where the family income of applicants' exceeds the income guidelines, a medical card may be issued for one member where medical and/or other needs may so dictate.</p>

I welcome this report as a major contribution to the issue of addressing crisis pregnancy and I look forward to working with the agency in implementing the strategy.</p>

          <p eId="para_2761">A working group established by the Minister for Health and Children is examining the provision of home support and personal assistants for people with disabilities. The working group is comprised of representatives of the Department, service providers and service users.</p>
          <p eId="para_2762">It is the intention of the working group to produce a draft set of standard policies and procedures covering various aspects of personal assistance and home support services for consideration by the health boards early in 2004. The issue of direct provision of personal assistance services will be considered by the working group.</p>
          <p eId="para_2763">A sum of €3 million is being made available in the 2004 budget for services for people with physical or sensory disabilities to meet priority service pressures as identified by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in consultation with other relevant agencies. These service pressures include respite, home supports and personal assistants, services for people with significant disabilities, support services for children with disabilities, and the provision of aids and appliances.</p>
          <p eId="para_2764">My Department has been and continues to work with the health boards, people with disabilities and their families in relation to the development of a range of support services, the aim of which is to enable the individual with a disability to live as independently as possible within their communities for as long as possible. In cases where residential services are required, the aim is to provide them in a manner which maintains the independence of the individual to the greatest extent possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_2838">Domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is a monthly allowance administered by health boards and may be paid in respect of eligible children from birth to the age of 16 who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. The condition must be likely to last for at least one year.</p>
          <p eId="para_2839">Eligibility is determined primarily by reference to the degree of additional care and attention required by the child rather than to the type of disability involved, subject to a means test. While no condition is debarred, conditions such as asthma, diabetes or epilepsy are not normally considered unless there is a very high degree of additional care and attention required. It is a matter for the senior area medical officer or other designated medical officer in the relevant community care area to decide whether or not a child qualifies for DCA on medical grounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_2840">The assessment of and entitlement to the domiciliary care allowance in any individual case is a matter for the relevant health board. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer, Midland Health Board, to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.</p>

The report was commissioned by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The report points to information gaps in respect of monitoring of both the condition of the environment and the health of population around waste disposal sites. These issues are subject to ongoing discussions between officials of my Department and officials of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In addition, the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, published in 2001 recognises the need to address issues in this area. Under the strategy the national health information strategy, NHIS, will be published and implemented. This strategy is being finalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_2876">One of the principal motivations behind the development of the NHIS has been the recognition of significant gaps and deficiencies in health information. The NHIS will therefore make recommendations for addressing these issues through a range of initiatives and structural changes. A key element of the latter will be the establishment of the health information and quality authority, HIQA, which is expected to have a broad remit in information system development, standard setting, and dissemination.</p>

One fifth of reimbursable drugs in Ireland have generic substitutes available in this market.

          <p eId="para_2896">There are no grants available to crèches, pre-schools to employ the services of an exercise or fitness teacher. Health boards provide some financial support to certain pre-school services, which cater for children who are regarded as being at risk or disadvantaged. This function is in keeping with the health boards overall responsibility under the Child Care Act 1991 in regard to the promotion of welfare of children and the provision of family welfare services.</p>
          <p eId="para_2897">Under the equal opportunities child care programme the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform provides staffing grants towards the cost of child care staff in community not-for-profit pre-school services.</p>
          <p eId="para_2898">However, the Department of Health and Children has identified school children as one of the groups that should be given priority during the planning and delivery of programmes and initiatives for good health throughout life. In the Government's National Health Promotion Strategy 2000-2005, there is a focus on two major objectives for children as follows: to promote healthy eating and a healthy body image among schoolgoing children and young people; to facilitate the implementation of health education and health promotion programmes, in partnership with the Department of Education and Science in the implementation of social, personal and health education in all schools consistent with the health promoting schools concept.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_380">Eating habits throughout life are established at a young age. Therefore, learning to choose and enjoy different foods in childhood provides the foundation for healthy food choices in adulthood. The purposes of targeting primary schools are as follows. The primary school setting provides an excellent health promotion arena for reaching large sections of the population – children, teachers, families and the surrounding community – in an effective and efficient way. Schools, through the SPHE, provide opportunities to promote lifelong healthy eating as well as encouraging physical activity. SPHE aims to create a healthy ethos within the school and improve children's self esteem and well-being. Teachers play a valuable role in communicating and supporting the healthy eating message, especially through the adoption of a whole school approach to healthy eating. Within a health promoting school consistent messages about healthy eating are communicated through all aspects of school life – the classroom, the curriculum, school breaks, school lunches and physical activity.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_381">Food and nutrition guidelines for primary schools will be published shortly the aim of which will be to educate children on nutrition and enable them to make healthy food choices throughout life. This document will become part of the SPHE programme together with a physical activity programme to be introduced as part of the school curriculum.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2903">Health boards are not legally obliged to provide chiropody services to medical card holders. The formal position is that arrangements for the provision of services, including chiropody services, are a matter for the individual health boards, having regard to their priorities within the funding allocated. Accordingly, chiropody services provided by health boards vary somewhat throughout the country. However, priority is usually given to medical card holders who are aged 65 years and over, persons who have contracted hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of human immunoglobulin anti-D, or from the receipt within Ireland of any blood product or a blood transfusion and who have Health (Amendment) Act 1996 cards, and for people with illnesses such as diabetes or arthritis.</p>
          <p eId="para_2904">A person must be referred for chiropody services by their general practitioner or a public health nurse and most boards provide three chiropody treatments per annum to all medical card holders over the age of 65 when considered clinically necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_2905">Chiropody services in Ireland are provided by health boards where arrangements have been made with chiropodists or podiatrists to provide this service on a salaried or on a sessional basis. Services are also being provided at chiropodists' practices. Rates payable by health boards to chiropodists for services under the general medical services scheme are increased in line with the general round increases. Rates payable as at 1 October 2002 are as follows: treatment, €3.31; surgery visit, €18.32; and domiciliary visit, €27.55.</p>
          <p eId="para_2906">In some board areas the chiropody service is being delivered by voluntary agencies, which provide the services in locations in the community, for example day care centres, and to which an allowance is paid by the health board. Domiciliary visits are made in some areas, if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_2907">I have written to the chairman of the health boards' chief executive officer group asking for an investigation of the levying of this charge by chiropodists and podiatrists and their reply is awaited.</p>

          <p eId="para_2913">The policy of the Department of Health and Children on services for older people is to maintain them in dignity and independence at home in accordance with their wishes, as expressed in many research studies; to restore to independence at home those older people who become ill or dependent; to encourage and support the care of older people in their own community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies; to provide a high quality of hospital and residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home. The role of the home help service is vital to this policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_2914">Since my appointment as Minister of State, I have been encouraging the authority and the health boards to introduce personal care packages for older people as an alternative to long-stay residential care. Personal care packages are specifically designed for the individual concerned and could possibly include the provision of a home help service, home subvention payments, arrangements for attendance at a day centre or day hospital and other services such as twilight nursing. Personal care packages allow older persons the option of remaining living in their own home rather than going into long-stay residential care.</p>

          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan):</from>
          <p eId="para_2955">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 340 on 18th November 2003, when I stated:</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_387">As I mentioned in previous replies to the House on 1 July 2003, the present red zones at Dublin Airport were formally established in 1968. I understand that the red zones at Cork and Shannon were drawn up around the same time. The then Department of Transport and Power was originally responsible for proposing the establishment of the zones which were approved and incorporated in the local authorities' development plans, and development within those red zones is controlled by the local authorities through the Planning Acts.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_388">I should describe for the Deputy precisely what the red zones are and how they differ from public safety zones and protected areas. International civil aviation operates under the 1944 Chicago Convention, which is administered by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO. Annex 14 of the convention, which prescribes standards for aerodromes, recommends that certain pathways through the air on approaches to runways should be clear of obstacles at certain heights, depending on how far away they are from the runway. These are known as obstacle clearance surfaces, and are imaginary slopes in the air extending away from the ends of runways. They were designed for the protection of aircraft taking off and landing as an aid to safe navigation. If those slopes in the air are, on a map, projected onto the ground, they form a trapezoid shape with the narrow base at the end of the runway.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_389">Those shapes have been coloured red on maps for ease of identification, and have therefore been known as red zones. The current dimensions of the red zones were established in 1968 and were notified to the local authorities on whose land the State airports are situated. While the width of the red zones was the same as the projection onto the ground of the obstacle limitation surfaces, the length of the red zones was delineated by the officials of the then Department of Transport and Power at specific distances from the runway, which varied by runway orientation, by airport, and by projected air traffic density. In delineating the length of the red zones in particular, the then Department was seeking to assist the local authorities to have regard to the dimension of public safety in the vicinity of the airports, that is, the safety of people on the ground, living or working underneath an approaching or departing aircraft.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_390">In Ireland, as elsewhere, these zones have been used as a basis for restricting development to limit the numbers of people on the ground who may be killed or injured by a crashing aircraft. Public safety zones are different in that they are zones that are specifically designed with a view to protecting the public on the ground and they have a substantially different size and shape from red zones. Public safety is not covered by an ICAO standard. The Department of Transport, in conjunction with the then Department of the Environment and Local Government, commissioned consultants to make recommendations for such public safety zones in the vicinity of Cork, Dublin and Shannon airports. The recommendations of the consultants, ERM, specifically deal with the risk to people on the ground, and make use of the latest techniques in risk assessment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_391">That study is now complete and was formally presented to me and the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 30 September 2003. In preparing their report the consultants engaged in a comprehensive public consultation, including holding public meetings in Cork, Dublin and Shannon during the summer. The intention now is that the Department for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will issue planning guidelines based on the public safety zones identified in the consultants report to the local authorities to assist them in their consideration of the public safety aspects of planning applications in the vicinity of airports.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_392">I should also point out that the obstacle clearance surfaces are not affected by the report by ERM. Those surfaces will continue to be a matter for the IAA which will be responsible solely for advising the planning authorities in relation to the aviation operational safety implications associated with particular proposals-planning applications. In future it will be a matter for the IAA to modify, if it sees fit and acting on ICAO advice, the geometry or dimensions of the obstacle clearance surfaces themselves.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_393">Regarding protected areas, section 14 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1950 empowers the Minister to make an order to declare that a particular piece of land in the vicinity of an aerodrome was to be a protected area, if the unrestricted use of that land would interfere with the navigation of aircraft.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_394">Of the three terms, red zone, public safety zone and protected area, only the red zones are three-dimensional surfaces in the sky in so far as they are used to protect the safe navigation of aircraft. In so far as the red zones, as projected onto maps, have been used in the past for public safety purposes, they are two-dimensional surfaces on the ground. The public safety zones and protected areas are two-dimensional surfaces on the ground.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_395">I am advised by the IAA, that the slope of the first section of the approach surface, which forms part of the obstacle limitation surfaces as defined in chapter 4 of Annex 14 to the Chicago Convention for runway 10/28 at Dublin Airport is 2%. The maximum height of an object beneath the approach surface to avoid infringing the surface is a function of the threshold elevation and the ground elevation of the site. Without knowing the ground elevation at a particular position, it is not possible to determine the maximum permissible height of a construction.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_396">I am advised by the IAA that the respective sizes of the first section of the obstacle surface on the approach to the runways at Dublin Airport, with particular reference to inner and outer widths, slope, divergence and length, are as follows:</summary>

The working group has addressed all of the major issues relating to speed limit policy including the range of speed limits deployed on roadways and for particular categories of vehicles, the policy on signage used to indicate speed limits and the implications of the adoption of metric values for speed measurement in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_3025">One of the issues discussed in detail in the report is the question of the deployment of special arrangements for a speed limit of 30 kph at locations with high levels of pedestrian activity.

          <p eId="para_3038">The Government Strategy on Road Safety 1998-2002 recognised that the influence of drugs on driving behaviour is an issue of increasing concern. Identification of the presence of drugs is however more complex than for alcohol. Consequently, considerably more work is needed to develop a more detailed regulatory regime for drugs and driving.</p>
          <p eId="para_3039">It is illegal in Ireland to drive while under the influence of drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle. Section 49 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as inserted by Section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 prohibits the driving of a mechanically propelled vehicle by a person while under the influence of an intoxicant. An intoxicant includes alcohol and drugs and any combination of drugs and alcohol.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_406">Enforcement of the law on drug driving is a matter for An Garda Síochána. When a member of the Garda suspects that a motorist is driving under the influence of any intoxicant the garda may arrest the suspect under Section 49 of the Road Traffic Act 1961.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_407">In 2002 the Medical Bureau of Road Safety continued to analyse specimens for the presence of drugs. Since 1 January 2002 all samples found under the legal limit for alcohol are automatically being tested for the presence of a drug or drugs as well as cases where the Garda requests that a test for drugs take place. A total of 388 specimens were tested in 2002 of which, 60% tested positive for drugs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_408">Following on the success of the road safety strategy, the Government is committed to the development of a new road safety strategy to apply for the next three years. Preparation of the new strategy is being completed and I expect to bring specific proposals for the strategy to Government in the near future. The new strategy will set out the best approach to future policy on drug driving.</summary>

This is being achieved through the introduction of new railcars on the route. Iarnród Éireann also informs me that over the next four years, it will be adding more new carriages to the fleet and by 2007 all of the old rolling stock is planned to be out of service.</p>

          <p eId="para_3126">The Deputy might recall that earlier this year I was considering the possibility of increasing the retirement age for members of the Garda Síochána from 57 to 60 in consultation with Garda management and Garda associations. This was in the context of achieving the maximum authorised strength of the Garda force at the earliest possible date. Based on the anticipated rate of retirement, the Garda Commissioner has now projected however, that the maximum authorised force strength of 12,200 will be achieved during 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_3127">Having considered the matter, I have decided not to alter the retirement age for the moment.</p>

          <p eId="para_3140">The interim parole board, which replaced the sentence review group, was established on an administrative basis in April 2001. The board's principal function is to advise me in on the administration of long-term prison sentences.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_411">The interim parole board reviews the cases of prisoners sentenced to determinate sentences of eight years or more. Prisoners serving sentences for certain offences, such as the murder of a member of the Garda Síochána or the Prison Service in the course of their duty, are excluded from the process. The board, by way of recommendation to me, advises of the prisoner's progress to date, the degree to which the prisoner has engaged with the various therapeutic services and how best to proceed with the future administration of the sentence. I consider in full all recommendations put before me by the interim parole board before making the final decision regarding sentence management.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_412">Previous judgments in the Irish courts have found that the management of prison sentences is a matter for the Executive and under current legislation I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, am entrusted with the power to grant temporary release to a sentenced prisoner. As the Deputy is probably aware, new legislation in the form of the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 has been enacted and will commence in the near future when the text of the associated rules has been finalised. The Act will provide a clearer legislative basis for the power to grant temporary release by setting down the principles which will apply to the exercise of this power and will provide a clear and transparent basis, as well as the necessary safeguards required, for the operation of the system of temporary release. The power of release will be retained by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the Act.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_413">I am not aware of a particular requirement in the European Convention of Human Rights that parole board recommendations be implemented in full by me, as stated by the Deputy. I am also not clear what precisely the Deputy means by "high profile" cases. However, I am aware that there have been a number of judgments by the European Court of Human Rights against the United Kingdom on the issue of parole for long-term prisoners. However, it should be noted that the system as operated in the United Kingdom is significantly different from that which operates in this jurisdiction, involving in particular the application of tariffs to life sentences, which I understand was a central factor in the judgments concerned.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3192">The information required by the Deputy was contained in the reply of 9 December 2003, which is set out below.</p>
          <p eId="para_3193">My Department has responsibility for disability equality policy and legislation development, and in that context has in the last number of years, in co-operation with the European Commission, organised the Irish national information day on disability. Each year, a particular theme is chosen for the day. Themes to date have included: "Progress Through Partnership" on 24 November 1997; "Progress Through Employment" on 30 November 1998; "Building a Future Together" on 29 November 1999; and "Information Technology – Access for All" on 27 November 2000, which took place simultaneously in 3 locations – Dublin, Sligo and Ennis; "Design for All" on 22 October 2001; and "Do they take sugar?"– a television programme aired on Network 2 on 3 December 2002 at 9 p.m.</p>
          <p eId="para_3194">This year, my Department chose to focus the national information day on the public sector. More than 200,000 brochures were distributed to public sector employees to inform and raise awareness of disability issues.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_418">As this year is the designated European Year of People with Disabilities, Ireland and our EU partners are working together to create awareness about disability issues among the population at large and, more importantly, to promote awareness of the right of people with disabilities to equal opportunities and protection against discrimination. My Department designated the National Disability Authority, NDA, as the national co-ordinating body. The NDA is chairing the national co-ordinating committee, which is co-ordinating events for the year in Ireland. The members of the committee represent disability organisations, the social partners, Government Departments and the media. My Department is represented on the committee, which is focusing on four particular themes for the year: awareness raising; youth and disability; rights, partnership and responsibilities; and employment. The committee is supporting a wide-ranging programme of projects nation-wide to highlight the aims of the year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_419">My Department funded other initiatives and events to publicise the year including: the "Youth – Beyond Disability" seminars, organised by People with Disabilities in Ireland; a calendar, in conjunction with PwDI; and the "Design for All" exhibition in partnership with the Office of Public Works.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_420">While my Department has been active in promoting disability awareness, it should be noted that there are other State organisations, which are also actively involved in ensuring that this issue is active in the public consciousness. The Equality Authority, Comhairle and other Departments are involved in promoting this issue.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_421">The Government remains committed to bringing forward a disability Bill that will underpin the principle of mainstreaming and provide for positive action measures to remove barriers to equal participation for people with disabilities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_422">Given the complex and crosscutting issues involved, the process of overseeing the preparation of the disability Bill has been referred to a Cabinet committee. As stated in an Agreed Programme for Government, the Bill will include provisions for rights of assessment, appeals, provision and enforcement. However, pending completion of the Cabinet committee and Government deliberations, it would not be appropriate to comment in detail on the likely content of the Bill.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_423">The intention is that the Bill will be ready for publication before the Dáil resumes after the Christmas recess. The Taoiseach met the Disability Legislation Consultation Group, DLCG, on 28 November 2003 to advise them accordingly. The DLCG is a group representative of people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers, which was brought together by the National Disability Authority, NDA, to facilitate dialogue at national level.</summary>

The Minister for Finance is establishing a central implementation committee to drive forward the implementation of the programme. A departmental implementation committee, working with the central committee, has also been established.

      asked the

      his views on the research report of a company (details supplied) which reported on adverse pregnancy outcomes around incinerators and crematoriums in Cumbria, north west England, between 1956-1993, in particular the finding that there was a significantly increased risk of lethal congenital anomaly, specifically spina bifida and heart defects, in relation to proximity to incinerators; and if he will make a statement on the danger incinerators pose to health and the implications these findings have for the Government's incinerator policy.

          <p eId="para_3286">Waterford County Council's proposal for a new fire station at Ardmore, at an estimated cost of €775,000, is due to proceed to construction stage under the fire services capital programme. On 12 September 2003, approval issued to the council to invite tenders for the project. A tender proposal is now awaited in my Department and on receipt a decision will issue as soon as possible. An initial recoupment of €90,400 to the county council to meet expenditure already incurred on the project, in respect of site acquisition costs, fees, etc., has recently been sanctioned by my Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_3288">My Department is concerned to put in place an adequate legislative and financial framework within which local authorities, voluntary bodies and Travellers may provide or be assisted in the provision of accommodation for Travellers. As required under the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, each county and city council, borough council, and the town councils of Bray and Dundalk, has prepared and adopted five-year Traveller accommodation programmes covering the period 2000 to 2004. The councils are also obliged under the Act to take any reasonable steps necessary to implement their respective programmes. All relevant local authorities are now in the process of implementing their programmes.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_424">My Department continues to provide the necessary funding to meet the cost to local authorities of the provision of Traveller specific accommodation. Expenditure under the Traveller accommodation capital programme during the first three years of the currency of the accommodation programmes was €65.46 million. A further €30 million was provided for Traveller specific accommodation in 2003. This expenditure is in addition to the amount spent on standard local authority accommodation and accommodation funded under my Department's voluntary housing schemes, which was allocated to Travellers in this period.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_425">Authorities have indicated, with a number of exceptions, that they hope to address the identified needs for Traveller accommodation in the lifetime of the programmes. Some local authorities are not required by the Act to set annual targets or deadlines for the provision of Traveller accommodation. My Department is engaged in a review of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998. Earlier this year, to assist in the review, I requested the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee to consider and make recommendations to me in relation to the operation of the Act. I understand that the question of barriers to the implementation of accommodation programmes is one of the issues the committee is considering in this context.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3290">The Building Control Act 1990 assigns responsibility for complying with the building regulations primarily to the owners, designers and builders of the buildings involved. Under the 1990 Act, the role of local building control authorities is to monitor buildings for compliance with the building regulations and to institute enforcement action, where appropriate. The City and County Managers Association has adopted a target of inspecting a representative sample of buildings, currently expressed as at least 12% to 15% of buildings covered by valid commencement notices served on each building control authority. My Department has consistently encouraged local authorities to enforce building regulations actively. The appointment of building control officers has been sanctioned. FÁS, in partnership with Offaly County Council, has developed a customised training course and computer software for building control officers. Building control fees have been substantially increased to make adequate funds available for local enforcement. My Department will continue to remind building control authorities of the need to achieve and maintain the target level of inspections.</p>

          <p eId="para_3301">A number of schemes administered by the local authorities, such as the disabled person's grant and the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme, are available to assist handicapped persons in achieving independent housing accommodation. Under the disabled person's grants scheme, a local authority may pay a grant to a person for the provision of additional accommodation or the carrying out of necessary adaptation works to a house to render it more suitable for a handicapped member of the household. The administration of the scheme and decisions on individual applications are the responsibility of the relevant local authorities. My Department's involvement relates primarily to the recoupment of certain amounts of local authority expenditure in the payment of individual grants, with €33.460 million having been recouped to the end of November 2003 in respect of 5,485 grants paid by local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_3302">The voluntary housing capital assistance scheme provides financial assistance in the provision of housing by approved voluntary bodies for homeless, elderly, disadvantaged and disabled persons. The detailed administration of the scheme is devolved to local authorities within their areas. My Department provides funding for local authorities for individual projects sanctioned by them, within the allocation available in the public capital programme. A total of €102.5 million has been sanctioned for this purpose in 2003 in respect of 884 units of accommodation, of which 250 are intended for disabled persons.</p>

          <p eId="para_3304">Part M of the building regulations, which applies to all new buildings and extensions or material alterations to existing buildings commenced on or after 1 June 1992, requires that adequate provision shall be made to enable people with disabilities to safely and independently access and use a building. The technical guidance document on Part M specifies methods of achieving compliance with this requirement in relation to both entrance doors and internal doors to rooms and on circulation routes. The guidance specifies door widths – entrance doors: 800 mm and internal doors, 750 mm – which are considered adequate for wheelchair use. It allows both automatic and manually operated doors. It specifies an unobstructed space at least 300 mm wide on the side next the leading edge of a single leaf door, in order that a wheelchair user can reach the door handle and operate the door. My Department has asked Departments, State agencies and local authorities on a number of occasions to make pre-June 1992 public buildings accessible to people with disabilities.

A draw-down contract for the supply of further equipment has also been agreed. It is intended to use the units initially to enhance communications with offices in Brussels during the forthcoming EU Presidency. Thereafter, the use of the units will be extended to communications between my Department's various locations as well as communications with other Departments and external bodies. It is envisaged that video conferencing will play a major role in improving communications in my Department as it moves to additional decentralised locations.</p>

          <p eId="para_3535">I propose to take Questions Nos. 549 to 553, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_3536">Details of the numbers of departmental staff who will move to Wexford, New Ross, Waterford and Kilkenny are found in Table 3 of the summary of the 2004 budget measures announced by the Minister for Finance on 3 December 2003. The number of National Building Agency staff to be decentralised to Wexford is also set out. As all of the functions of my Department, with the exception of Met Éireann and Dublin local services, are to move there, it is likely that there will be a substantial complement of grades in each location, although the precise details remain to be determined.</p>
          <p eId="para_3537">My Department has 1,137 members of staff at 22 locations in Dublin. This number will reduce when staff dealing with operational aspects of the built heritage transfer shortly to the Office of Public Works, which is responsible for all property issues relating to our current and future accommodation requirements. Information about the accommodation of the National Building Agency is not held in my Department. Arising from the announcement by the Minister for Finance, my Department has held meetings of its partnership committee and departmental council. It has also moved to establish an internal implementation team and will fully support and liaise with the central implementation arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_3538">Decentralisation is to be implemented on a voluntary basis and the question of disturbance payments does not arise. Staff transferring to decentralised offices will be able to access their housing requirements either in the private market or with the assistance of one of a number of schemes operated or supported by local authorities in relation to social or affordable housing. The operation of such social and affordable housing schemes is kept under continuing review by local authorities, under my Department's general guidance, in the light of local circumstances. The remaining details sought in the question will emerge as part of the implementation process.</p>

It is now a matter for Cork County Council to proceed with the preparation of contract documents with a view to advancing the scheme to tender stage as soon as possible.</p>

This represents an increase of approximately 14% over the corresponding allocation for 2003. Details of individual allocations to local authorities are set out in the table which follows this reply. For comparison purposes, the amounts listed as general purpose grants for 2003 include motor tax office expenses which were consolidated into the 2004 baseline and excludes the once-off allocations in 2003 towards the operational costs of water and sewerage schemes.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_430">My Department has 2,266 staff, of which 904 are industrial workers. This total is made up of 1,137 staff in 22 separate locations in Dublin, 80 staff in Ballina, 73 staff in Shannon and the balance in various field locations.

          <p eId="para_4545">I refer the Deputy to my replies to Questions Nos. 346, 348 and 351 of 12 February last, in which I detailed the various grant schemes operated by my Department. While my Department has no specific funding arrangements in place to cater for scout den refurbishment, such funding may be considered through local Leader groups, provided the scout group is within the Leader operational area. Decisions on eligibility are made by the Leader groups in accordance with detailed operating rules drawn up by my Department and approved by the European Commission. Proposals are assessed on a case-by-case basis. Such funding might also be considered under the Gaeltacht grant schemes, provided the scout group in question is based in the Gaeltacht.</p>

          <p eId="para_4660">Under section 171 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993 any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his or her basic needs and the needs of any adult or child dependant may be entitled to assistance under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Assistance, which is subject to a means test, may be provided in the form of a basic allowance or supplements in respect of rent, mortgage interest, special dietary or heating needs. Having regard to all the circumstances of a case, a health board may also make a single payment to meet an exceptional need if it considers it reasonable. In general, legal residency is not a requirement for receipt of supplementary welfare allowance. However, rent supplement is not payable if the applicant is a person who is not lawfully in the State, or who has made an application under the Refugee Act 1996 or the Aliens Act 1935 to remain in the State and such application is awaiting final decision by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This provision applies in the case of applications for rent supplement made on or after 27 May 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_4662">The school meals programme provides funding for a statutory urban school meals scheme, which operates in conjunction with certain local authorities, as well as a non-statutory local projects scheme which targets schools with high levels of disadvantaged pupils in both urban and rural areas. During the summer invitations were issued to the most disadvantaged schools to join the school meals programme. A total of nine schools in Donegal have received funding this year benefiting some 679 pupils. In addition, a project was set up that is benefiting some 31 children in seven other schools. It is planned to target additional schools in the country next year. In 2003, some 386 schools with a total of more than 51,000 pupils will have benefited under the urban scheme while 210 projects benefiting some 23,500 children received funding under the local projects scheme. The budget for 2004 provided an additional €1 million for the further expansion of the school meals programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_4665">I propose to take Questions Nos. 575 and 576 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_4666">As the Deputy will recall, the budget for 2004, which was announced on 3 December last, provides for increases in the weekly personal rates of social welfare payments. There will be a €11.50 increase in the maximum personal rate of widow's or widower's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit for those aged 66 years and over – this represents an increase of 7.4% or a real increase of 4.8% – and a €10 increase in the maximum personal rate of all other weekly payments, including all other widow's and widower's pensions and all old age pensions. These represent increases ranging from 6.4% to 10.3%, or real increases of between 3.8% and 7.6%. The budget for 2004 also provided for increases of between 6.3% to 11.4% in the weekly rate of qualified adult allowances. These increases are well ahead of inflation. Child benefit will increase by €6 per month for the first two children and €8 for the third and subsequent children. Other improvements include an increase of €200, from €2,500 to €2,700, in the widowed parent grant, a €100 increase in the respite care grant and a significant increase in the weekly income disregard for carer's allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_4667">Social welfare spending has nearly doubled since 1997, from €5.7 billion to a projected €11.2 billion in 2004. In this period the rate of the old age pension has increased by 80%, representing a real increase of 40.5% and the old age contributory pension has increased by 69%, representing a real increase of 32%. The widow's and widower's contributory pension for those aged 66 and over has increased by 85.3%, representing a real increase of 45%. The levels of increases provided in budget 2004, when taken with other increases provided since 1998, demonstrate the Government's continuing commitment to safeguard and enhance the living standards of the most vulnerable in our society.</p>

          <p eId="para_4674">The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate certain groups of social welfare recipients to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active workforce. The survey referred to by the Deputy is part of a larger study of the scheme. That study is one element of my Department's programme of reviews under the Government's expenditure review initiative. The objective of the programme of reviews is to provide a systematic analysis of what is being achieved by expenditure in each spending programme and to provide a basis on which more informed decisions can be made on priorities within and between expenditure programmes. A working group comprising representatives of the Departments of Finance, Education and Science, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social and Family Affairs has been established to conduct the expenditure review.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_435">The education and employment experience of participants is being examined under the agreed terms of reference of the review. Consultants have been engaged through the normal tendering process by my Department to carry out a survey of past participants of the scheme. The purpose of the survey is to establish basic facts about participants in the scheme and to inform the review. It was not intended to provide an in-depth exploration of participants' college experience. In drafting the survey questionnaire, the working group was conscious of the need to canvass as broad a cross section of past participants as possible. A random sample from the various qualifying schemes was selected to achieve this. The survey was conducted between 24 November and 12 December of this year. The results will be presented to the working group in the near future and the review will be published in 2004.</summary>

My Department has no record of having received any communication from the person concerned, either verbally or written, in respect of her increased earnings arising from a change of employment in March 2001.

      the reason the Government continues to means-test the blind pension.
      [30807/03]

        </question>
        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_697">
          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan):</from>
          <p eId="para_4678">The blind pension is a means-tested pension payable to people who are resident in the State and are blind or visually impaired. The blind pension has been historically linked with the old age non-contributory pension. It is payable subject to the same general means test conditions as that pension. Those persons in receipt of a blind pension automatically qualify for free travel and may also qualify for the free schemes operated by my Department subject, of course, to the normal qualifying criteria. Blind pensions form part of the social assistance payments which target resources towards those most in need. In this regard, account is taken for the purposes of determining entitlement to all such payments of the means of the claimant and his or her spouse or partner.</p>
          <p eId="para_4679">There have been significant improvements in the means tests for persons with disabilities in recent years. In the cases of the blind pension and disability allowance, for example, up to €120 a week from rehabilitative employment is not assessed. The amounts of capital that a claimant and his or her spouse or partner can have and still qualify for payment have been substantially increased. The number of recipients of blind pension has been reducing in recent years as a consequence of a number of factors, including medical advances and the fact that many people who become blind have been in the workforce and qualify for non-means-tested contributory social insurance payments, such as disability benefit, invalidity pension and old age contributory pension. It would be difficult to justify paying non-means-tested payments to one particular group of people with disabilities and not to all others. It should be noted that 85% of blind pensioners are in receipt of the maximum rate of pension.</p>

          <p eId="para_4689">The person in question has been in receipt of unemployment assistance since August 1999. The benefit arising to him from the income of his spouse, who is engaged in insurable employment, is assessed in calculating his means. Following a review of his entitlements, a deciding officer has assessed his weekly means derived from the benefit of his spouse's gross weekly earnings of €353. After allowing for tax, PRSI contributions and working spouse allowance the weekly means assessment is €210 of which half is assessed against the claimant. This amount is deducted from the maximum weekly rate payable, in his case €141.60. This entitles the person concerned to a weekly payment of €36.60. It is open to the person concerned to appeal this decision. An application form for family income supplement has been issued to the spouse of the person concerned as it is possible that she may have an entitlement to payments under this scheme. Under social welfare legislation, decisions in respect of claims and the insurability of employment must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in making such decisions.</p>

      the number of persons who will be affected by her review of the back to education allowance scheme at 1 January 2003 which disallowed participation in the scheme for postgraduate qualifications; if she will reconsider the decision by allowing existing participants in the scheme up to 1 January 2003 to claim the back to education allowance for postgraduate qualifications due to the fact that when they entered the scheme originally, this option was available to them and natural justice dictates that the rules should not be changed in midstream; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_4691">The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate certain groups of social welfare recipients to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force. As the Deputy is aware, the conditions for entitlement to back to education allowance were revised with effect from 1 January 2003. The scheme does not apply to certain full-time postgraduate courses from that date. Participants on the scheme who had commenced postgraduate courses of study prior to this change continue to receive funding under the scheme to the completion date of the course for which they had applied. Following this revision, only those applicants wishing to take up a higher diploma in any discipline or a graduate diploma in primary school teaching have been approved for participation in the scheme at postgraduate level.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_436">Some 149 such students are pursuing such courses of study in the 2003-04 academic year. Of the 135 applications for postgraduate courses which were refused as a result of the change in the postgraduate criteria, 108 were refused because they failed to satisfy one or more of the other qualifying conditions for the scheme. I am satisfied that there has been full consideration of natural justice in implementing this revision of the rules of entitlement. The postgraduate element of the scheme is a separate element requiring separate application. There is no automatic entitlement to the postgraduate scheme for those undertaking a course at primary degree level. Some 191 postgraduate students who commenced postgraduate courses prior to 1 January 2003 are availing of the scheme even though they are pursuing courses that are no longer within the remit of the scheme. A total of 340 students are in receipt of the allowance while pursuing postgraduate courses in the 2003-04 academic year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_437">The person mentioned by the Deputy was a participant in the back to education allowance scheme from September 1999 to May 2003 while pursuing a four year primary degree. In September 2003, he applied for further participation in the scheme to pursue a postgraduate qualification. This qualification is outside the revised scope and objectives of the scheme. This application was disallowed because the person concerned has already achieved a high level of academic attainment while participating in the scheme, which has already enhanced his prospects of securing employment. In a time of financial constraint, I have to ensure that supports are directed at those with the most pressing needs. In this context, limited resources must continue to be aimed at those in most need and who are most distant from the labour market. Having participated in the scheme for four years and having attained a high standard in his primary degree examinations, I consider that the outcome in the case raised by the Deputy does not give rise to any concerns in terms of natural justice.</summary>

My Department has wide experience of the issues associated with decentralisation, having previously relocated functions and staff from Dublin to Sligo, Letterkenny, Longford, Waterford and Dundalk. This programme of decentralisation will involve major change for my Department. A key objective will be to ensure that it is implemented in a planned way, with due regard to the effects on staff and the need to maintain high standards of policy making and service delivery.

          <p eId="para_4708">The one-parent family payment was introduced in 1997 when it replaced a number of schemes for different categories of lone parent, including the lone parent's allowance, deserted wife's benefit and allowance and the non-contributory widow and widower's pension for those with dependent children. Under the new scheme, lone parents are encouraged to maximise their income from different sources. The means test for the scheme makes allowance for the exemption of significant levels of earnings and maintenance payments. Lone parents may earn up to €146.50 per week from employment without affecting their payment. Earnings above this limit are assessed at 50%, up to a maximum of €293 per week. These figures were not altered in the recent budget. The earnings disregard is designed to assist in overcoming the obstacles which lone parents may face in taking up employment and training opportunities and to encourage them to return to employment instead of remaining dependent on social welfare payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_4709">The Abridged Estimates provide for the ending of the transitional payment that applies under the scheme. Lone parents who exceed the upper income limit applying under the one-parent family payment may be eligible for the family income supplement, however. This will mean that lone parents on low income will be treated in the same way as other workers on low earnings with child dependants. The family income supplement, in providing cash support for employees with families on low earnings, preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where employees might only be marginally better off than if they were claiming other social welfare payments. Lone parents are eligible to avail of the full range of employment support schemes operated by my Department. I am satisfied that the social welfare arrangements in place for lone parents are appropriate and provide a reasonable level of income support for lone parents while at the same time encouraging them to consider employment.</p>

          <p eId="para_4713">The objective of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to meet immediate, short-term income maintenance needs. The crèche supplements, which have been provided under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, were intended as a short-term income support for the parents of children who were referred to child care services for medical, family support or child protection reasons by the health board public health nurses or social workers. However, in many cases the supplements in question have been in payment for long durations and for reasons which are outside the scope of the original intention of the scheme.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_440">As the Deputy is aware, most of the funding for the crèches in question comes from health boards. My Department has written to the health boards, where crèche supplements are paid, informing them of my decision in this regard and of the cost of these payments in their functional area. In addition, my officials have met representatives of the health boards to discuss the measures I announced in the context of the 2004 Abridged Estimates volume, including crèche supplements. The Northern Area Health Board has confirmed that the crèches in question will not close as a result of the withdrawal of supplementary welfare allowance crèche supplements. The board is examining the financial support it provides and will seek the additional funding deemed necessary within its child care and family support budget for 2004. My officials have also met representatives of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has responsibility for child care supports. That Department is considering the scope it may have to provide support to the crèches in question.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4715">The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who receive certain qualifying payments from the Department of Social and Family Affairs or a health board and who are unable to provide for their heating needs. A fuel allowance payment of €9 per week is paid to eligible households while an additional allowance of €3.90 per week is paid in areas where there is a ban on the sale of bituminous fuel, bringing the total amount payable in those areas to €12.90 per week. These payments are made for the duration of the fuel season, which lasts for 29 weeks. The person in question does not qualify for a fuel allowance as he is in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance on an interim basis pending the outcome of an appeal in relation to a claim for disability allowance. Supplementary welfare allowance paid on an interim basis pending the determination of entitlement to a primary social welfare payment is not a qualifying payment for fuel allowance.</p>

          <p eId="para_4717">The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance, with means assessed from self-employment of €15, from 10 January 2000 to 23 September 2003. His payments were suspended from that date as he failed to provide information regarding his means as requested by an inspector.</p>
          <p eId="para_4718">It subsequently came to light that he had been engaged in employment on a part-time basis, working five days each week since 16 January 2001. He had not informed the Department of this employment. A deciding officer has disallowed the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned from 16 January 2001 to 23 September 2003 on the grounds that he was not unemployed for this period. An overpayment of €14,486.46, which is the total amount of unemployment assistance paid to him from 16 January 2001 to 23 September 2003, has been raised on his claim. A letter regarding this decision and the overpayment arising issued to him on 4 December 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_4719">He should contact the Belmullet local office to make arrangements regarding the refund of the overpayment. It is open to him to appeal the decision and a form for this purpose has been issued to him. Under social welfare legislation, decisions in respect of claims and the insurability of employment must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers who are statutorily appointed. I have no role in making such decisions.</p>

          <p eId="para_4721">The objective of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to deal with emergencies and short-term income maintenance needs that arise when a person suffers a change in circumstances, for example, when a tenant becomes unemployed and can no longer afford his or her rent. Rent supplements were never intended to meet a person's long-term housing needs. In this regard, new measures which are being introduced will help to refocus the rent supplement scheme on its original objective of short-term income maintenance. The requirement to have been in rented accommodation for at least six months will not apply to persons who have been assessed by a housing authority as having a housing need. Those people to whom the Deputy refers – people who have been assessed by a housing authority as having a housing need and where that need cannot be met by the housing authority, by a voluntary housing organisation or by the person concerned – will continue to be entitled to claim rent supplement.</p>

          <p eId="para_4723">A person must be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare-type payment and be living alone or living only with certain excepted categories of persons to qualify for the various allowances under the household benefits package. There is no record in my Department of an application for the household benefits package having been received from the person concerned. As he is in receipt of unemployment assistance, which is not a relevant qualifying payment, he would not be entitled to the various household benefits. People who qualify for a carer's allowance are entitled to the household benefits package, provided that they are the account holder on the relevant utility bill and that the benefits are not already in payment to anyone else in the household. The person concerned did apply to my Department for a carer's allowance in February 2000. His application was refused as he failed to submit relevant medical reports. In the light of this question, the Department will issue an application form for a carer's allowance to the person concerned in case he wishes to reapply and submit the necessary medical information. His eligibility for the household benefits could be reassessed if it transpires that he qualifies for the allowance.</p>

          <p eId="para_4725">The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate certain groups of social welfare recipients to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active workforce. The person concerned applied for participation in the allowance scheme to pursue a four-year BSc in occupational therapy at Trinity College in Dublin. She already holds a BA. Resources must be aimed at those most in need. Therefore, this application was refused on the grounds that the person concerned has already achieved a high level of academic attainment. As the back to education allowance is a non-statutory scheme, decisions made on applications are subject to appeal. However, if a person is dissatisfied with the result of their application they can request a review. In this instance, a review of the decision was carried out by a more senior officer. Following a re-examination of the case, the original decision was upheld.</p>

The locations of specific sections have not yet been finalised. The Department's information services division will also be relocated, although the location has yet to be determined. The Combat Poverty Agency and Comhairle, which are under the aegis of my Department, will be relocated to Monaghan and Carrickmacross, respectively. The sections of my Department to be relocated which are currently housed in leased accommodation in Dublin are Oisín House in Pearse Street, Gandon House in Amiens Street, Landen House in Townsend Street and No. 3 Parnell Square. Details in respect of leases and rents on these properties are a matter for the Office of Public Works.

      <b>Mr. Deasy</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
      the measures she is taking to ensure that people who are awaiting arrears of disability allowance do not have to wait up to five months for arrears to issue as is the case at present; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan):</from>
          <p eId="para_4830">My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers. Entitlement to disability allowance is contingent on the applicant satisfying both medical and means conditions. There is an unavoidable time lag involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to ensure accurate decisions. The appropriate weekly rate is put into payment without delay once entitlement is decided.</p>
          <p eId="para_4831">Arrears accruing for the period from date of entitlement to date of first payment are then computed and issued as soon as is practicable. Many claimants are in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance or other primary social welfare payment during this period. The amount of such overlapping payments must be established and deducted when computing the net arrears due.</p>
          <p eId="para_4832">One of my Department's priorities is to minimise the time lags which are involved in processing claims generally. Targets are set for claim processing, including calculation and payment of arrears, but pressures can arise at certain times due to claim volumes, resource issues, etc. My Department makes every effort to ensure, however, that payments are made as quickly and expeditiously as possible.</p>
