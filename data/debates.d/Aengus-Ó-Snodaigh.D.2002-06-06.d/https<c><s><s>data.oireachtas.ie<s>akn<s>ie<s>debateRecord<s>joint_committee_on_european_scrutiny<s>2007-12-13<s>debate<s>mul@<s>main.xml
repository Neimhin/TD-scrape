Is that agreed?  Agreed.  It is proposed they should be forwarded to the relevant sectoral committees for information.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">It is recommended that COM (2007) 46 does not warrant further scrutiny at this stage but should be forwarded to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service for information, which may wish to request the CSO to keep it informed on developments in the negotiations and, in particular, on the likely implications for Ireland.

Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">It is recommended that COM (2007) 52 does not warrant further scrutiny, but that it should be referred to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Services for information, in view of the Departments concerns regarding the element of harmonisation involved.

          <p eId="para_15">It is recommended that COM (2007) 196 does not warrant further scrutiny at this stage, but should be forwarded to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for information, in view of the Department's assessment of the collection of reliable data as of critical importance.

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Given that the measure is adopted, it is proposed that COM (2007) 289 does not warrant further scrutiny.  However, given concerns about the regulation as regards its effect on the Irish fisheries industry, it is also proposed to forward it for information to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">It is proposed to note the adopted measure in COM (2007) 350 and that the proposed measure does not warrant further scrutiny but it be forwarded to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs for information.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">No. 7 concerns proposals for further scrutiny.  COM (2007) 90 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Regulation No. 11 concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions in implementation of Article 79(3) of the treaty establishing the European Economic Community and Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004 of the European Parliament and the Council on the hygiene of foodstuffs.  The lead Department is the Department of Health and Children with various others.  The proposal forms part of the Commission's action programme for reducing administrative burdens in the European Union.  The main objective is to contribute to the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs.  The proposal has two distinct elements, the first of which is transport and involves the abolition of outdated obligations on road transport operators to carry documentation on routes, distances, rates and other conditions and to allow instead the use of existing consignment notes to provide information on the remaining requirements related to the current transport document; while the second is food hygiene and involves the exemption of micro-enterprises, with an annual turnover not exceeding €2 million and employing fewer than ten people, from the hazard analysis critical control points, HACCP, requirements of Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004 on food hygiene.  It should be noted that the proposal indicates that the fact that both elements have the common aim of a reduction of administrative burdens makes it appropriate to combine the amendments in a common regulation.  However, the Department's note indicates that it may be necessary to split the elements into two separate proposals because of their differing legal bases.  This issue has not yet been resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">The Department of Transport is supportive of the transport aspect of the proposal and sees the amendment of the regulation as benefiting the road transport sector.  The Department of Health and Children has concerns about the food aspect of the proposal.  It states Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004 includes HACCP flexibility provisions for smaller businesses since January 2006 and believes the proposal to be premature.  The position of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is unclear at this stage.  It is recommended that the transport aspect of the proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  However, in view of the concerns about excessive regulation expressed by small food producers and in the light of the Department of Health and Children's reservations about the proposed exemption of micro-enterprises from the HACCP requirements, it is recommended that this aspect of the proposal be scrutinised in further detail.  Is that agreed?</p>

          <p eId="para_47">No. 8 is a proposal that documents forwarded to sectoral committees for observations be returned to the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny, preferably within four weeks but within six weeks at the latest.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">The proposed directive COM (2005) 593, being the seventh of seven measures, forms part of the third maritime safety package introduced by the Commission.  The package seeks to promote healthy competition between shipping operators who comply with international rules on safety and compensation.  Currently, for much of the damage caused to third parties, civil liability regimes for EU shipowners vary considerably and insurance schemes are not compulsory.  The proposed directive seeks to establish "core" rules, to be common to all member states, which would govern civil liability, insurance for shipowners and the liability of any person responsible for operating a ship.  It would do this by incorporating the IMO Convention on the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, LLMC, into EU law.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">The view of the Parliament has been that there is a need to ensure only safe ships sail and that accident victims should receive speedy and adequate compensation.  It was also in favour of including a definition of "gross negligence".  It voted for EU member states to be responsible for enforcing the rules in the directive, for a fund to be set up to compensate victims of damage caused by ships sailing in EU waters without a financial guarantee certificate and also for the establishment of a Community office to keep a register of certificates issued and check financial guarantees issued by third countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">The proposal seeks EU-wide adoption of the International Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims 1996 through a directive on civil liability and financial guarantees of ship owners.  That would result in the incorporation of the convention into EU law in order to ensure uniform application throughout the European Union.  The LLMC sets limits for liability for loss of life or personal injury claims and also for property claims.  The Commission is also seeking a mandate to negotiate within the International Maritime Organisation for a revision of the LLMC, and, in particular, a review of the level at which ship owners lose their right to limit their liability.  The proposed directive would also make provision for the repatriation of seafarers in case of abandonment.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">Of the 25 amendments adopted by the Parliament the Commission has decided to accept 18 in their entirety, while two have been rejected.  The remainder have been accepted in part or in principle.  The proposal is now going for its First Reading by Council under the decision procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">MEPs also voted to strengthen Commission proposals to increase the liability of ship operators and compensate third parties and passengers in the event of accidents.  For damage caused by ships to third parties, international conventions allow shipowners to limit their liability in almost all cases.  The Department states in its information note that this proposal would have some significance for Ireland.  However, Ireland already plans to implement the 1996 LLMC Protocol by virtue of section 28 of the Sea Pollution (Hazardous Substances) (Compensation) Act 2005.  The Attorney General's office has expressed concern on the Community's competence to pass a directive giving effect to an IMO convention regardless of member states' rights and obligations under international law and as members of the UN.  The Commission has held a consultation process with industry and views are mixed on the question of obligatory insurance.  In Ireland, the Irish Chamber of Shipping has been consulted and the views of the Irish Maritime Development Office are also being sought.  In view of the concerns expressed by the Attorney General, it is proposed that this proposal should be scrutinised in further detail and in this regard should be forwarded to the Joint Committee on Transport and the Marine for written observations to be returned to this committee, preferably within four weeks of the date of this meeting and within six weeks at the latest.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">COM (2007) 249 is a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council providing for sanctions against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals.  The purpose of this Commission proposal is to sanction employers who illegally employ third-country nationals.  It forms part of the EU's overall policy to develop a comprehensive migration policy.  The proposed regulation specifically targets employers who employ third-country nationals who are working illegally in the Community.  The scale of employment of illegally staying third country nationals in the EU is hard to quantify and estimates vary from between 4.5 million to 8 million.  Illegal employment is concentrated in certain sectors, mostly low -skilled and low paid jobs in construction, agriculture, cleaning and hotel-catering.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">The central focus of the proposed regulation is a general prohibition on the employment of third-country nationals who do not have the right to be resident in the EU.  The regulation sets out common sanctions and measures to be applied to employers who infringe that prohibition.  Included in the proposed measures are: employers would be required to undertake certain checks before recruiting a third-country national; the procedure for making complaints would be facilitated; and member states would be required to undertake a certain number of inspections.  Employers who do not comply with these obligations will be required to pay fines and other administrative measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">Member states would also be required to provide for criminal penalties for four types of serious cases and repeated infringements, the employment of a significant number of third-country nationals, particularly exploitative working conditions, and where the employer knows that the worker is a victim of human trafficking.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">The Department states in its information note that the part of the proposal providing for levying criminal sanctions on employers is a major issue for Ireland in relation to the extent to which the EU can impose such sanctions.  The Irish position is that this is possible only in certain limited circumstances.  The Irish Government is awaiting clarification of the position by way of a European Court of Justice ruling expected before the end of 2007.  The consequences for national legislation are currently unknown.  However, if Ireland accepts the proposal, transposition may require amendment of primary immigration and work permit legislation.  There are no consequences for the European budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">In view of Ireland's concerns over the competence of the EU to impose criminal sanctions on employers, it is proposed that this proposal should be scrutinised in further detail and in this regard should be forwarded to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for written observations to be returned to this committee preferably within four weeks of the date of this meeting and within six weeks at the latest, pending clarification with the Department of the current status of the case in the European Court of Justice.

          <p eId="para_61">It is an issue that we can scrutinise on its return.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">COM (2007) 330 is a proposal for a Council regulation concerning authorisations for fishing activities of Community vessels outside Community waters and the access of third country vessels to Community waters.  The purpose of this proposal is to set up general rules and conditions to be applied for all transmissions of the requests for authorisations for fishing activities of fishing vessels outside EU waters and the access of third country vessels to EU waters.  The proposal follows the proposal laid down in the 2006-2008 action plan for simplifying and improving the Common Fisheries Policy.  The proposed regulation would repeal Council Regulation (EC) No 3317/94 which laid down the general provisions concerning the authorisation of fishing in the waters of a third country under a fisheries agreement.  To take account of changed circumstances for fisheries outside Community waters and to comply with international obligations under Regional Fisheries Management Organisation agreements, the Commission believes it is necessary to introduce a general Community system for authorisation of all fishing activities of EU vessels outside EU waters.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">The overall aim of the proposed regulation is to create clarity for the member states and fishermen on what conditions need to be fulfilled and help the Commission to manage the transmissions in a more effective and efficient way.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">The Department's note indicates that the Government supports the principles of this draft regulation as it will endeavour to ensure that measures put in place are appropriate, taking into account the challenges associated with participation in third country agreements.  However, while in principle the measures in the proposed regulation look beneficial, it is clear that they are also wide-ranging and could have a significant impact on how the Irish fishing fleet operates.  The proposed regulation is currently under negotiation and is unlikely to be adopted before June 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">Given the importance of the CFP to Ireland and to ascertain the full implications of this proposal for the Irish fishing industry, it is proposed that this proposal be scrutinised in further detail and in this regard should be forwarded to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for written observations to be returned to this committee preferably within four weeks of the date of this meeting and within six weeks at the latest.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">COM (2007) 439 is a proposal for a Council regulation extending the provisions of Regulation (EC) No. 883/2004 and another regulation to nationals of third countries who are not already covered by these provisions solely on the ground of their nationality.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">The purpose of this Commission proposal is to extend provisions on the co-ordination of social security systems to third country nationals by way of a Council regulation.  This is to be achieved by extending the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 on the co-ordination of social security systems to nationals of third countries who are legally resident in an EU member state and who are not already covered by those provisions.  It is intended to simplify existing acts and can be regarded essentially as a recasting exercise.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">The proposal is designed to ensure that the same rules which are applied to European citizens for co-ordinating social security schemes will be applied to nationals of third countries since regulation (EC) No. 883/2004 and its implementing regulations have entered into force.  This is regarded by the Commission as a key extension to the co-ordination of social security systems, both in terms of equal treatment and non-discrimination with respect to the nationals of third countries and also in terms of administrative simplification, the reduction of administrative costs and legal clarity for all parties involved, including national administrations, social security institutions and the persons insured.  The Department indicates in its information note that a proposed proposal presented by the Commission, COM (2002) 59, to extend the application of the provisions of Regulation 1408/71 and Regulation (EEC) 574/72 to nationals of third countries was considered by the Joint Committee on European Affairs on 27 March 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">By the Government decision of 7 March 2002, the Government agreed that Ireland should opt in and thereby participate in and apply the measure.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas approved the decision on 28 March 2002.  The resulting Regulation 859/2003 came into force on 1 June 2003 and since that date third country nationals and their families and survivors can rely on Regulation 1408/71, provided they are legally resident in the territory of an EU member state and are in a situation which is not confined in all respects within a single member state.  This new proposal aims to extend the provision of Regulation 883/2004, which will replace Regulation 1408/71, and its implementing regulation to third country nationals.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">In terms of the implications of this proposal for Ireland, the Department states that Ireland supported the Commission's proposal to extend the provisions of Regulation 1408/71 to third country nationals.  However, it is anticipated that the number of persons who will benefit from this proposal will be small.  Unlike Regulation 1408/71, the scope of Regulation 883/2004 also covers people who are not professionally active, known as non-active persons, and accordingly, Ireland will be keen to participate fully in the discussion of this proposal in order to assess in particular the implications for means-tested payments and the health care system.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">There are no consequences for national legislation in that the measure will form part of domestic law without the requirement to enact separate domestic legislation.  There will be no consequences for the EU budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">In light of the concerns expressed with regard to implications for means-tested payments and the health care system, it is recommended that this proposal be scrutinised in further detail and in this regard should be forwarded to the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs for written observations to be returned to this committee preferably within four weeks of this meeting and within six at the latest.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>

          <p eId="para_74">COM (2007) 480, which follows up a Commission decision on spectrum designation, creates a legal framework for an EU-wide co-ordinated selection and authorisation process with a view to allowing the 2GHz band to be used for mobile satellite services and achieving the objectives of the internal market for electronic communications.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources indicated in its information note that the proposal has no negative implications for Ireland as no licences have been issued in this country for the frequency band in question.  the Department has pointed out, however, that Ireland will be obliged to accept the operators that are selected and to give them authorisation for complementary base stations if it is requested to do so.  In view of the highly technical nature of the proposal, it is recommended that it warrants further scrutiny and should be forwarded to the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for written observations which are to be returned to this committee, preferably within four weeks of the date of this meeting and within six weeks at the latest.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">COM (2007) 571 proposes a Council regulation on the establishment of a fuel cell and hydrogen joint undertaking using a joint technology initiative.  Such initiatives combine private sector investment with national and European public funding to create a single European research programme.  Fuel cells are quiet and highly efficient energy converters which are capable of delivering substantial reductions in cumulative greenhouse gases and pollutants.  Although considerable EU public funds have been directed into research into fuel cells and hydrogen, there are concerns that developments in this area will continue in an unfocused way unless a focused programme is put in place, with the possible danger that industrial development in the area will stagnate and fall behind global competitors.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">Joint technology initiatives are public private partnerships.  Given the novelty of these structures, certain guiding principles have been identified relating to the governance and management structures of joint technology initiatives to ensure their success.  The legal structure of the initiatives will take the form of joint undertakings, established on the basis of Article 171 of the EU treaty, and will include measures to protect the financial interests of the Community, for example, in areas in which the Community will have veto rights.  There will be internal and external controls.  Joint technology initiatives will have the right to recover money if irregularities are discovered.  Structures will be put in place to provide for the organisation of consortia, calls for proposals, accountability, communication, reports and governance.  As public and private contributions are linked in the operation of these initiatives — they form a consolidated whole in the accounts of initiatives — it is envisaged that the entire budget will be covered by the Parliament's discharge.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has indicated that Ireland is unlikely to be a leader in this field.  The Department has suggested, however, that there is potential for Irish organisations to become involved in joint technology initiatives as associate members.  It seems that Irish small and medium-sized initiatives will be encouraged to participate in the activities of the joint technology initiatives through calls for proposals and the adoption of specific measures to assist them.  Negotiations are expected to conclude by the middle of 2008.  No consequences for legislation are anticipated.  The projected EU budget contribution is €470 million.  In view of the amount of funding involved and the potential for Irish organisations to become involved, it is proposed that the proposal be scrutinised in further detail and should be forwarded to the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment for written observations to be returned to this committee, preferably within four weeks of the date of this meeting and within six weeks at the latest.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">The purpose of COM (2007) 613 is to make technical amendments to the provisions of regulation (EC) 648/2004 on detergents, arising from the changes to the classification of substances and mixtures under proposed regulation COM (2007) 355 on the classification, labelling and packaging of chemicals.  This proposed regulation accompanies proposed regulation COM (2007) 355, which is also under negotiation.  COM (2007) 355, if adopted, will implement in the EU the international criteria agreed by the UN Economic and Social Council for the classification and labelling of hazardous substances and mixtures — the globally harmonised system of classification and labelling of chemicals.  At its meeting on 20 November last, the joint committee decided, given its potential impact on Ireland, to scrutinise COM (2007) 355 further.  We forwarded that proposed regulation to the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment for written observations.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">While the Department's note indicates that the implications of COM (2007) 613 have not yet been fully assessed, it does not believe the proposed regulation will have a substantive impact.  The Department indicated in a previous note, however, that COM (2007) 355 will have wide implications for Ireland, including for Departments and State agencies such as the Health and Safety Authority, the pesticide control service and the National Poison Information Centre.  It will also have implications for the Irish chemical industry and many users of chemicals.  It is important to examine proposed COM (2007) 613 at the same time as COM (2007) 355, given that the two regulations are directly linked and it is envisaged they will have wide implications.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">In view of its link with COM (2007) 355, which could have wide implications for Ireland, and the fact that its implications have yet to be assessed properly by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, it is proposed that COM (2007) 613 be scrutinised in further detail.  Therefore, it is proposed to forward COM (2007) 613 to the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment for written observations to be returned to this committee, preferably within four weeks of the date of this meeting and within six weeks at the latest.  These written observations should be part of the written observations already requested by this committee on COM (2007) 355.  Is that agreed?</p>

          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_107">No. 8 is scrutiny of a European Union Council legislative proposal for a draft Council decision on the implementation of Decision 2007/JHA on the stepping up of cross-border co-operation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime, 11045/2007.  On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Mr. Martin Power, Mr. Michael Kirrane and Mr. Fergus O'Callaghan of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to discuss the proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">Before we commence, I draw witnesses' attention to the fact that while members of the committee have absolute privilege, this privilege does not apply to witnesses appearing before the committee.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  We will have a 15 minute presentation followed by a question and answer session.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_40">
          <from>Mr. Martin Power</from>
          <p eId="para_109">I assure members that I will not take 15 minutes to complete this part of the presentation.  I am a principal officer and head of the Department's security and Northern Ireland division.  I am accompanied by Mr. Michael Kirrane, a principal officer in the Department's Garda division, and Mr. Fergus O'Callaghan, a principal officer in the international policy division.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">Members of the joint committee will be aware that this draft Council decision is an implementing decision of an earlier Council decision.  It will be helpful, therefore, to briefly outline the background and contents of the earlier decision.  The threats posed by terrorism and organised crime must be tackled in a comprehensive manner by the competent authorities in all member states, working together in a collaborative manner.  It is well recognised that terrorists and organised crime groups do not respect borders and it is often said that they exploit borders to their advantage.  Against this background, it is the law enforcement authorities who appear to be hampered by the existence of international borders.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">European Union measures to enhance police co-operation are aimed at eliminating barriers to effective police measures against terrorists and organised criminals.  Police co-operation has long been a feature of the efforts of the Garda Síochána in its fight against terrorism and organised crime.  Against this background, the EU is endeavouring to fill the gaps in police co-operation and information exchange.  It is a multi-layered approach involving greater co-operation and exchange of information between different competent authorities, including judicial and law enforcement authorities.  In January 2007, a proposal was made for a Council decision to improve cross-border police co-operation in preventing and investigating crime.  A central element of this decision was the exchange of certain information between law enforcement authorities.  The decision received political approval in June 2007 and currently awaits implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">This Council decision requires EU member states to increase co-operation in preventing or investigating cross-border crime or terrorism through a series of measures, including that member states should: maintain a national DNA database and share information from it with other member states; provide legal assistance in collecting and examining samples of DNA in connection with a criminal investigation or with criminal proceedings; maintain and share data relating to fingerprints; and share information relating to vehicle registrations.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">The Council decision contains other measures to improve police co-operation, including provisions requiring member states to share information for the purpose of maintaining public order and security in connection with major events which have a cross-border dimension and to share information for the purposes of preventing terrorist offences.  Other measures in the decision relate to improved police co-operation in the use of joint patrols and joint operations with officers from another member state.  These particular provisions are not mandatory in the decision.  A member state may decide it does not wish to participate in or host joint patrols or joint operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">The Council decision also contains provision for one member state to afford another member state mutual assistance in connection with the policing of mass gatherings, disasters and serious accidents.  Such assistance will be provided in accordance with member states' national law governing the provision of mutual assistance.  As the decision is primarily concerned with the exchange of data, there are provisions relating to the protection of personal data and ensuring that data are processed only for the purpose for which they are supplied under the Council decision.  Other data protection provisions deal with such matters as ensuring that data are accurate, are retained only for as long as necessary for the purpose for which they were supplied and that personal data are properly protected.  They also provide that the data subject's rights are protected and that damages will be available where these rights are violated.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">Finally, the Council decision contains a provision that requires the Council to adopt measures necessary for its effective implementation.  The draft Council decision, which is the subject of the committee's proceedings, meets this latter requirement.  It sets out a number of principles for the technical and administrative implementation of the earlier decision that I have just outlined.  To achieve this, it provides for common technical specifications governing the request for information and the provision of that information in response.  In addition, member states will be required to exchange information electronically via a common communications network.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">Accordingly, the draft Council decision contains the following provisions.  There should be common technical specifications for queries and answers concerning searches and comparisons related to DNA profiles, fingerprints and vehicle registrations.  Electronic exchange of data is to take place through a secure network.  Member states will be expected to maintain 24 hour, seven-day capability for automated search of data.  A request for search and comparison of DNA must contain certain specific information and a response to such a request must also contain standard information.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">Regarding fingerprints, there are provisions relating to their quality and that requests should be processed within 24 hours.  Vehicle registration data exchange will take place using the European vehicle and driving licence information system.  Furthermore, an annexe to the draft Council decision contains the detailed technical specifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">The possible implications for Ireland in this regard revolve around the following matters.  Given that Ireland has yet to develop its own DNA database, it will be possible to incorporate the relevant specifications in its development.  The forensic science laboratory has confirmed that the system of profiling used by the laboratory incorporates the standards as specified in the draft Council decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">The Garda Síochána is currently in the process of implementing a new and upgraded automated fingerprint identification system, known as AFIS.  The Garda confirms that the database is compatible with the standard specified in the annexe to the draft Council decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">The sharing of vehicle registration data will take place through the European car and driver licence information system, known as EUCARIS.  Ireland is not currently a full member of EUCARIS.  However, plans are in place to ensure compatibility with the system envisaged in this draft Council decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">The annexe is the subject of discussions in a working group consisting of experts in these areas.  A Council working group will also decide on a mechanism to evaluate the administrative, technical, operational and financial application of the draft Council decision.  In terms of implementation of the draft Council decision, the Attorney General has advised that the approval of the Oireachtas will be necessary for the adoption of the decision.  In addition, he advises that it will probably be necessary to enact primary legislation to implement the decision here.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">The voting method in the Council for this decision is qualified majority voting.  In summary, therefore, the draft Council decision is one more element of a comprehensive scheme to facilitate the law enforcement authorities in all the member states of the European Union in the fight against terrorism and organised crime.  That concludes my presentation.  If the members of the committee have any questions, I and my colleagues will endeavour to answer them.</p>

          <p eId="para_123">I thank Mr. Power.  How does he envisage this measure will deal with organised crime in Ireland in terms of drug trafficking, the importation of cars and the issue of false documents?  Does he consider it will make an impact?  In recent weeks drug importation has featured in the media.  Will this measure enhance law enforcement by the Garda and help detect those who are illegally importing drugs or deal with any other illegal activities that occur outside Ireland that impact on us?</p>

          <from>Mr. Martin Power</from>
          <p eId="para_124">This decision is one of a number of EU measures that will be implemented in some way or other.  It is intended to assist in the fight against international organised crime.  For example, the sharing of fingerprint information may well be useful in detecting the movement of drugs or other contraband around the European Union which are being imported into Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">The sharing of vehicle registration data may well assist in any scheme which is intended to avoid the payment of proper dues in regard to taxes, customs or whatever.  These measures can assist in defeating or countering those actions.</p>

          <p eId="para_126">The importation of cars appears to be highly organised.  Main car dealerships are facilitating this and the occurrence of the problem appears to be widespread.  Forgery also appears to be common and these crimes have a significant impact on the Exchequer.  It is clear that legal documentation must have been provided also.  Is this a case of white collar crime which is being operated at the highest level by corporate entities?</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_44">
          <from>Mr. Martin Power</from>
          <p eId="para_127">It could well be.  The searches on vehicle registration data can include searches based on the chassis number and the sharing of information on matters of this nature can assist the relevant authorities to detect the movement of these cars and whether it is being done illegally.</p>

          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_128">The trafficking of drugs is at epidemic proportions.  Cross-border co-operation with other police authorities and the sharing of information on DNA and fingerprints on known criminals such as drug barons is important.  That information will become more available once the agreement in principle is in place with other European police authorities.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_46">
          <from>Mr. Martin Power</from>
          <p eId="para_129">It should do because it will provide for an electronic transmission of data on fingerprints and DNA for comparison purposes and it should enable the authorities to better compare information and know whether they are dealing with the same individuals at various times.</p>

          <p eId="para_130">It will also aid in tracking the movement of known criminals from country to country.  Will the traceability system involve working with passport control?</p>

          <p eId="para_131">Passport control is not part of this system but the sharing of information between law enforcement authorities goes on independently of this measure.  I presume law enforcement authorities share information on the movement of people who might be of interest to them.</p>

What about waterways in terms of illegal drug smuggling activity?  Boats can travel on the Shannon-Erne waterway from the South to the North and the same is true between Derry and Donegal and Louth and Down.  Is the progress of these boats logged when travelling from one jurisdiction to another, given that it could facilitate the smuggling of drugs from one jurisdiction to another?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_50">
          <from>Mr. Martin Power</from>
          <p eId="para_133">The kind of measures the Senator is thinking of are already in place between the Garda and the PSNI.  My understanding is that there is excellent co-operation between those two forces on various levels, not just on terrorism but on ordinary crime.  The Border is porous and people move freely back and forth.  In order to defeat criminality as best they can, the Garda shares information with PSNI colleagues and <i>vice versa</i> about people who may be involved in moving contraband from this jurisdiction to the North.  It is not just a question of drugs, other types of contraband are involved as well.  My understanding is that co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI is excellent and this is an important factor in the fight against crime generally.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_134">I welcome the witnesses and thank Mr. Power for his presentation.  From where does this draft Council resolution emanate?  Did any country in particular promote it?  Is it largely directed towards combating terrorism or cross-border crime <i>per se</i>?  In this country we have a particular perception of what constitutes cross-border crime, which is the importation of drugs, weapons and engagement in certain fraudulent activities.  This approach seems to be different from that followed in the rest of Europe in that we have different requirements.  Senator Burke asked about waterways but we should note that the biggest waterway of all is the sea surrounding Ireland.  This serves as a resource in combating cross-border crime in that it serves as a boundary.  The largest drug haul ever in this country was discovered by pure chance owing to a storm off the south-west coast.  Over €100 million worth of drugs was seized.  However, we do not have the means to patrol the coastline; therefore, there is cross-border crime because of a lack of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">The position on airports is similar.  A number of airports are not properly policed or do not have excise officers.  Shipping ports have the same problems.  These issues are not addressed by the Council decision.  What input has Ireland had to deal with its specific requirements in combating drug trafficking?</p>
          <p eId="para_136">Where will the databases containing personal information be located?  Will they be in central police headquarters, Europol, or elsewhere?  Will the content be exchanged directly between member states?  For how long will data be retained?  DNA and fingerprints provide important personal information, as do vehicle registrations.  Who will supervise the system and how will they do so?  Will there be accountability?  What auditing mechanism will be in place?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_52">
          <from>Mr. Martin Power</from>
          <p eId="para_137">As I mentioned, this is one of a suite of instruments being put together to improve effective co-operation between police forces to try to counter various crimes, including terrorism.  The measure emanated from a police co-operation agreement between a number of member states and included matters beyond the scope of justice and home affairs.  The German Presidency considered it would be useful if all member states were in a position to sign up to an agreement containing the elements of the earlier treaty dealing with police co-operation in fighting crime and terrorism.  It extracted the elements specific to justice and home affairs and the fight against crime and terrorism and on that basis brought forward the Council decision.  However, the decision required a number of implementing provisions, one of which is before us.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">In sharing DNA information for analysis and sharing fingerprint information it is necessary that all member states have a system in place that will allow them to have common standards for the collection, sharing and analysis of data.  The decision is designed to ensure this.  The agreement states data will be used only for the purpose for which they are provided and will be retained only for as long as is necessary.  There are provisions stipulating data can be retained for five years, but I will check this.  This is set out in the Council decision which outlines the minimum level of protection afforded to data subjects by way of the Council of Europe convention on data protection.  Member states can provide for greater protection if they wish.  Irish data protection legislation implements the provisions of the convention.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_53">
          <from>Mr. Michael Kirrane</from>
          <p eId="para_139">On the question of where data will be stored and how they will be transferred, the mechanism for transfer is bilateral between countries.  There will be no central database.  As my colleague outlined, the aim of the annexe to the decision is to work out the practical and technical solutions in order that the exchange can take place between the various member states which may have different systems.  A common standard is being developed in order that the exchange of information can take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">The fingerprint database is located in Garda headquarters.  In all cases we are talking about the national system.  The DNA database will be a matter for the forensic science laboratory when it comes on board and the Garda will be involved in the collection of fingerprints.  Vehicle registration details are a matter for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Transport which hold vehicle registration and licensing details for everybody in the State.  The location of each database is determined by the responsible agency in each country.  A bilateral exchange of information is involved.  The decision sets out the standards according to which it will take place.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Connick</from>
          <p eId="para_141">I welcome the delegation and thank it for its presentation.  The proposal is very interesting and timely.  We have a very good working relationship with the PSNI in Northern Ireland.  In this regard, do we have good co-operation with other member states, including France?  I ask this in the light of a number of issues that arose recently, including human trafficking, in respect of which the Bulgarian authorities claimed people were being trafficked into Ireland through Rosslare.  Are we working from a central base already or is there a haphazard approach, whereby, if an issue arose in France or Germany, we would then contact its police force?  Have the delegates knowledge of the resources required to ensure delivery of the three databases?  Has a system of common standards been identified?  If so, is it up and running?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_55">
          <from>Mr. Martin Power</from>
          <p eId="para_142">There is a high degree of co-operation between the Garda and police forces in other member states.  We have seconded staff to The Hague.  Part of the role of Europol is the provision and analysis of intelligence for member states, in addition to putting together the information it receives from all its sources.  In addition, the Garda has a number of liaison gardaí posted in Irish embassies abroad.  There is one in Paris and at least one in London.  Their role, in part, is to liaise with their counterparts to ensure matters that might impinge on both jurisdictions or more member states are brought to the attention of the appropriate authorities.  It is appropriate to have as much advance warning as possible to ensure one can act against organised criminals who might be transporting people or contraband.  We liaise with Interpol and there are frequent conferences and seminars between police forces in the European Union, in which the Garda participates.  The level of co-operation is high.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_56">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_143">I have a number of questions.  Anybody would welcome greater co-operation if it was to deal effectively with drug importation and crime which go hand in hand with importation of weapons.  A range of high-powered weapons has come in with many of the drug shipments seized recently which indicates the scale of the problems, as do the recent drug-related deaths.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">Why is Ireland not part of the European Car and Driver Licence Information System, EUCARIS?  Would it require legislation for us to sign up to it?  The Attorney General advises that it would probably be necessary to enact the primary legislation to implement the draft Council decision.  Does this apply to the whole decision and if not, to which parts does it apply?  Do some of our recent legislative changes cover the exchange of data?</p>
          <p eId="para_145">I have criticised our rush in recent years to pass legislation in this area because the data protection standards in other countries are not as high as they are here.  There has been no harmonisation upwards of the data protection aspect of this and we hear scare stories such as the loss of personal data of 24 million households in England.  Some officials here have made criminal use of data to which they have access.  What standard will apply to the national DNA database when it is set up?  Is there a set standard for storage of DNA that is immediately transferable because systems vary from one country to another?  The same applies to fingerprints.  Someone sent me an article from <i>The Guardian</i> about how a Japanese mathematician was able to recreate fingerprints from a passport.  It was said this could not be done because of the way the information was stored.  That raises the problem of people having access to that kind of information without proper controls, resulting in large scale identity theft.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">Other countries have security services but we have the Garda Síochána.  By their nature secret services are secretive and love nothing better than to have access to as many databases as possible worldwide.  In this case the data will be retained only for as long as necessary for the purpose for which it is supplied.  How do we ensure that happens because once it is transferred it is out of our jurisdiction?  Given the nature of, and the relationships between, security services and police services in other states, how can we be sure there is no trawl, transfer or duplication of data that we have supplied for a specific criminal investigation?  Secret services deal with political and economic espionage as well as criminal activity.</p>

          <from>Mr. Aidan Carrigan</from>
          <p eId="para_206">I thank the Chairman.  Mr. Cathal Sheridan and I work within the insurance unit of the financial services division, so we are integrally involved in the whole solvency process on behalf of the Department of Finance.  We thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to make this presentation on Solvency II, the EU directive which reforms the prudential framework for insurance companies and consolidates existing insurance directives.  In my presentation, I will summarise the main aspects of Solvency II, describe some background to the reforms of EU insurance supervision contained in the Solvency II process, outline the objectives of the Solvency II regime and draw attention to key elements of the proposed directive.  We are still at a relatively early stage in Council discussions and important information is still being collated and analysed.  This is a complex and technical proposal and the directive proposal runs to over 350 pages of legal text.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">Solvency II has four stated general objectives.  These are to deepen integration of the EU insurance market, to enhance the protection of policyholders and beneficiaries, to improve the competitiveness of EU insurers and reinsurers and to promote better regulation.  Within these general objectives, Solvency II seeks more specifically to encourage cross-sectoral consistency, advance supervisory convergence and co-operation, increase transparency, promote internal convergence, improve risk management of EU insurers and achieve better allocation of capital resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">The Solvency II proposal reflects the culmination of a long period of preparatory work by the EU Commission, in consultation with member states and key stakeholders, and is supported by advice from CEIOPS, which is the committee of European insurance supervisors.  Solvency II seeks to correct weaknesses identified in the current Solvency I regime.  To achieve its objectives, the draft framework directive has changed the emphasis of the regulatory regime to a system which focuses on risk management.  Solvency II also adopts what is known as a total balance sheet approach to the determination of capital requirements.  This will mean that both the risks on the asset and liability side of an insurance company's books will be addressed under Solvency II, unlike Solvency I where the focus was primarily on the liability side.  The Solvency II project is an important element of the EU financial market integration agenda.  This agenda was set out in the financial services action plan for 1999 to 2005, which has led to increased competition across the financial service sector as a whole.  Solvency II is an important outstanding issue to be addressed and once it is in place we believe it will make a significant contribution to a more efficient and effective insurance marketplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">The benefits of a risk-based approach were highlighted by the EU Commission in its regulatory impact assessment report on Solvency II.  The report concluded that introducing risk-based regulatory requirements will ensure that a fair balance is struck between strong policyholder protection on the one hand and reasonable costs for insurers on the other.  All stakeholders were consulted by the Commission in the preparation of the report, including representative bodies for industry and consumers, as well as the European Central Bank.  They were all favourably disposed to the direction Solvency II is taking.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">A key conclusion of the impact assessment was that policyholders will be among the main beneficiaries.  This is because an enhanced level of policyholder protection will be available across the EU under Solvency II, while the introduction of an economic risk-based approach under Solvency II will promote better risk management, sound pricing of products and strengthened supervision, giving policyholders greater confidence in the products of insurers.  The impact assessment also concludes that Solvency II will increase competition, especially for mass retail lines of business, such as motor and household insurance, putting downward pressure on many insurance prices and increasing choice by encouraging product innovation.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">The basic architecture for the new solvency regime, which has been endorsed by the European insurance and occupational pension committee, is an adaptation of the three pillar approach used in the banking sector under Basel II, the capital requirements directive.  Pillar 1 covers quantitative issues such as the measurement of technical provisions, the calculation of the capital requirements associated with those liabilities and the calculation of assets that cover them, known as the solvency capital requirement and the minimum capital requirement.  Pillar 2 covers qualitative elements such as corporate governance and the supervisory review process, requiring regulated firms to assess and manage their own risks and assess their own capital requirements.  Pillar 3 addresses disclosure requirements to enhance market discipline.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">The Commission has also proposed a new group support and supervision arrangement, reflecting the fact that insurance groups are the dominant business structure in the EU insurance market operating within the EU on a cross-border basis.  Under the Commission proposal currently under examination at Council, subject to certain conditions, the group supervisor will have primary responsibility for key aspects of group supervision and capital over and above the minimum capital requirement that can be held outside the subsidiary and can be covered by a commitment known as group support.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Quantitative impact studies have been carried out to ensure that the structures and calibrations of Solvency II achieve their intended impacts.  In these studies conducted by CEIOPS, industry carries out exercises applying the Solvency II framework to specific scenarios and this provides information to enable the impact of the proposed capital requirements under Solvency II to be tested and validated.  Three rounds of QIS studies have been completed to date.  The results of the latest study, QIS 3, have just been published and have proved to be a useful indicator of the potential impact of the Solvency II requirements.  However, certain issues have been identified in QIS 3 where further work needs to be carried out and an approach to the next round of studies, QIS 4, is currently being prepared by CEIOPS in consultation with industry.  This study will begin in April 2008 and it is essential that industry fully participates if we are to ensure that we get the right balance in Solvency II.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Solvency II will make full use of the Lamfalussy committee structure, a new four level structure developed to make the EU legislative structure more flexible and efficient.  Under this four level committee architecture, the Solvency II directive will set out only high level principles.  These principles subsequently will be supplemented by detailed implementing measures at Level 2 and further supervisory guidance at Level 3.  Level 4 is about ensuring effective member state compliance with legislation.  At this stage, attention is focussed primarily on the Level 1 principles directive which was published in July this year.  This is currently being assessed by Parliament and Council, a process which is targeted for conclusion by late 2008 or early 2009.  Some time will then be required for transposition, as it may not be possible to begin this process until implementing measures have been approved.  It is not expected that Solvency II will come into force until 2012.  In the interim, work will continue at CEIOPS level and at the Level 2 policy group, EIOPC, on the development of more detailed implementing measures consistent with the principles of the directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">There are 304 insurance or reinsurance companies authorised and supervised by the Financial Regulator.  The vast majority of these are subsidiaries of international groups with parents located mainly in the EU, but also in places like the US and Switzerland. These subsidiaries conduct a significant amount of cross-border business.  Only 17 of the supervised insurance companies are domestic insurers.  Within the insurance subsidiary category, there are 135 small specialised insurance or reinsurance companies known as captives.  These companies are a means whereby large industrial, commercial or financial entities in effect self-insure.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">Ireland supports the risk-based approach being introduced under Solvency II, as we see it being to the long-term benefit of industry and the consumer both domestically and throughout the EU.  The Department of Finance is working very closely with the Financial Regulator in co-ordinating our input to the Solvency II process.  In addition, we recognise the importance of engagement with industry and have been consulting with it through regular formal and informal contacts.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">Given the number of small insurance companies located here, we have sought as a priority to ensure that the Level 1 principles directive includes a proportionality principle which can be appropriately applied in regard to small companies trading across borders.  We recognise that if the Solvency II requirement is excessively onerous or costly for small companies to comply with, it could result in Europe becoming a less attractive location for small niche market insurers.  We are not alone in raising this concern and are satisfied with progress in the discussion on the recognition of proportional application of the directive to small companies.  We have also arranged for separate discussions with the Commission and other interested states with a view to recognition of the particular circumstances of our captive insurance and re-insurance companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">We have discussed the Commission's group proposal with the Financial Regulator and with industry.  In principle, we accept that there is merit to the group support and supervision proposal which should contribute to the future growth of the European insurance industry on the world stage, and we have contributed to the group support regime debate accordingly.  We also recognise the case made for recognition of group diversification effects.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">We would, however, be concerned to ensure that group support would work in practice, particularly in situations of financial stress, and we consider it important that the directive strikes the right balance between group and local supervision.  Accordingly, we are awaiting the outcome of further analytical work by the Commission and CEIOPS which is intended to clarify further the operation of the group support regime.  We see the development of effective colleges of supervisors as an important step in the EU supervisory system which can be developed further without changing the current institutional balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">We have supported the recent Presidency and Council progress report to ECOFIN, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, which concludes that further analytical work is required.  We look forward to further reports from industry and from CEIOPS on how the group proposal might actually work in practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">In conclusion, it is clear Solvency II is a complex project and our approach to it has involved a considerable amount of consultation with all stakeholders.  Progress has been made through the publication of a draft framework directive for consideration by Council and Parliament.  However, there is still quite a way to go in finalising the directive and in the preparation of Level 2 implementing measures to support the directive.  The Department of Finance will continue to engage proactively with the Solvency II process and will continue to work closely with industry and the Financial Regulator with a view to achieving the best outcome for EU and Irish industry and policyholders.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_113">
          <from>Mr. Michael Kemp</from>
          <p eId="para_223">I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee.  I will summarise where possible as some of the remarks in our note have already been covered in Mr. Carrigan's presentation.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">To introduce ourselves, the Irish Insurance Federation is the trade association for insurance companies in Ireland.  Our members collectively employ over 14,000 people across 95% of domestic business in the Irish market and have control over €90 billion in assets, so obviously we have a considerable interest in the supervisory process and how it develops.  In addition, we have a number of members based in the IFSC who write international business, particularly in the life assurance side with regard to investment products.  We are also the national member of CEA, the European insurance committee, which is the umbrella association for national insurance associations in Europe and has been the main interlocutor with the Commission and CEIOPS in the development of the Solvency II proposal.  Reflecting this, we have been talking to the Department and the Financial Regulator in the lead-up period.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">One of the advantages of Solvency II and one of main reasons we are supportive of it is that it is a thorough overhaul based on an economic assessment of risk which is a much more complex and sophisticated measurement of the true solvency requirements of insurance companies in the market compared to the existing system under what is called Solvency I, which has been enhanced over the years but which essentially dates back to 1972 and is a relatively straightforward computation of solvency requirements based purely on premium income and claims reserves.  What is proposed under this new directive and the system which will come in under it is much more sophisticated.  Obviously, considerable detail will have to be left to Level 2 and Level 3 in the Lamfalussy process.  This is in some respects a landmark legislative process because essentially it will be the first time the Lamfalussy process has been tested in the insurance area.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">As has been said, the three pillars of the draft directive are based on the evolution of the Basel II process.  One of the benefits of the level of consultation that has gone into the preparation of the directive is the broad level of consensus about how it is being structured and the rules which are going into it.  We believe this could be a major step forward and will benefit all of the stakeholders, not just the industry but policyholders and supervisors, and will lead to a healthy and well regulated European insurance market.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">It is important to remember that the objective is not to specifically increase or decrease the overall level of solvency capital which will have to be held by the market but rather to ensure it is more accurately distributed according to the specific risks which are being run by individual companies.  In that regard, it is not just related to insurance risk but to the overall operational risk that the company faces.  It is a very sophisticated model and developments are also being closely watched elsewhere in the world, which is important to bear in mind.  The concept of risk-based solvency supervision originated and has been developed in the US, but what is being proposed under Solvency II is considerably more sophisticated and could help to leapfrog the standards of supervision in Europe over those in the US and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">We are strongly of the view that the risk-based economic approach which underpins the directive is the way forward.  This ensures that the true underlying risk exposure and risk mitigation processes that are in place are correctly reflected in solvency requirements and will help to eliminate regulatory arbitrage, which might distort or weaken competition or consumer protection.  The draft directive also has a consistent approach to "real world" market conditions in terms of valuing assets and liabilities and recognising the benefits of diversification.  It allows for the use of internal models which companies may develop, which will allow them to develop more sophisticated and responsive models to determine their specific solvency requirements, subject to approval by supervisors.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The other aspect of the directive that needs to be stressed is that it will lead to much greater harmonisation among regulatory authorities across the EU whereas at present, under Solvency I, because the computation is effectively a relatively blunt instrument, considerable discretion is left to national supervisors to impose additional buffer margins in particular circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">To highlight the outstanding issues, which we feel need further work, we call the committee's attention to the problem of the smaller and specialist insurers to which Mr. Carrigan referred.  There is concern that these companies may suffer as a result of the application of the standard solvency computation models.  We would be supportive of the proposal that the implementing measures should be proportionate and that special provisions would be developed for the smaller companies.  There is a need for these to be elaborated further as QIS 4 unfolds and as the directive evolves, and in the supporting Level 2 and Level 3 measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">Our members are supportive of the directive's proposals on the supervision of groups, in particular the concept of the group supervisor who would have responsibility for key aspects of insurance group supervision throughout the EU and the EEA.  This will allow for more streamlined and effective supervision and again reflects economic reality by allowing groups to use group capital to support part of subsidiaries' capital requirements in certain conditions.  However, we appreciate that the regulator in Ireland and those in a number of other countries have concerns about how group supervision would operate in the event of a crisis either at the level of the subsidiary, the parent or the group as a whole.  We agree that further work needs to be done to elaborate more detailed rules to apply in those circumstances.  Hopefully, this will be adequate to reassure regulators, particularly in smaller markets where subsidiaries or pan-European groups are common, as in our market, that the rights of policyholders will be adequately protected in the event of solvency problems arising.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">It is worth pointing out, however, that we also feel the group supervision provisions will provide opportunities for countries such as Ireland to attract inward investment, particularly from third countries such as the US, in terms of attracting headquarters operations for the EU market.  This is on the basis that the professional but flexible approach for which our regulator is known will be an attractive option for new inward investment where there is a strong role for the lead supervisor, which in such circumstance in Ireland would be the Financial Regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">There are some 14 or 15 areas in the existing text of the directive that have been identified by us and by our European association as needing further improvement.  I will not go through all these but we have identified four that are particularly important.  First, the alignment of the minimum capital requirement, MCR, and solvency capital requirement, SCR, calculation methods is necessary to a greater degree than is provided for to ensure they respond consistently to changing economic conditions.  As it stands, there is a risk that one requirement could go in one direction and the other in a different direction.  That should not be the case.  We suggest that the MCR should be expressed as a percentage of the main target, which is the SCR.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">Second, the directive includes, particularly in the area of the risk correlation measures, some unduly detailed specifications.  In general, we would prefer to see as much detail as possible in the lead directive and as little as possible left to the subsidiary levels two and three measures.  It must be recognised that this is a complicated and technical directive that should, to a large extent, act as a framework directive, with detail left to the levels two and three measures.  In some areas, there are calculations and specifications that probably should be devolved to levels two or three.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">The third issue is the calculation of the SCR.  In the context of increased harmonisation, this is a difficult target that all companies would have to meet at all times.  This fails to take account of the fact that, on occasion, there will be short-term adverse features in the market.  A company would have to hold capital in excess of the SCR as it is currently laid out to maintain a buffer to absorb any short-term volatility.  We propose that some mechanism be introduced to allow for temporary breaches of the SCR.  Otherwise, there could be undue interference in the management of companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">The final issue I call to the committee's attention is the need for account to be taken in the design of the supervisory system for the non-life insurance cycle.  In this country, in particular, we have had significant peaks and troughs in the non-life market.  Although recent reform measures here will narrow the gap and take out some of the extremes of the cycle, there should be some recognition that it is a cyclical business.  This is an issue that arises not only in Ireland, but also in other countries.  In hard markets, companies make underwriting profits that are then available to offset losses and so reduce the capital required to achieve a specific level of protection.  Conversely, in soft markets, underwriting losses lead to higher capital requirements.  We suggest that expected losses on future business must be allowed for, along with current losses, pending the bottoming out of the cycle.  Similarly, when there is a hard market, one should be able to take account of the expectation of the cycle topping out.  This would be in line with the economic approach that otherwise underpins the directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">These are the main areas that we propose require further work.  In general, however, I reiterate that we are supportive of the thrust of the directive.  We expect it to be a major step forward for insurers and their customers at both national and European level.</p>

          <p eId="para_238">I thank Mr. Kemp for his detailed submission.  It is good to hear his encouraging remarks on the solvency issue in particular.  I call Mr. Patrick Brady, head of insurance supervision with the Financial Regulator.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_115">
          <from>Mr. Patrick Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_239">I am conscious of the time limitations and will not repeat what other contributors have said.  I will cover four aspects of the proposal: the general structure of the Solvency II directive, which has already been mentioned; the Financial Regulator's involvement with the Solvency II project; the key regulatory issues; and challenges for stakeholders, which include industry supervisors and market participants.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Other speakers have outlined the purpose of the Solvency II directive.  Essentially, it introduces a market-consistent, risk-based approach to the assessment of solvency.  From a consumer protection perspective, a robust supervisory regime, particularly in regard to solvency, is the main protection for consumers in terms of the industry fulfilling its policy obligations.  The main drivers have already been mentioned.  One interesting driver is the desire for harmonisation and convergence of supervisory practices and, more importantly, regulatory regimes in Europe.  Mr. Kemp mentioned the attractiveness of Ireland as a location because of the way we regulate.  However, increasing harmonisation and convergence across Europe will lessen that attractiveness, which poses a challenge for us.  In addition, changes are being considered by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors and, perhaps more importantly, the International Accounting Standards Board.  The idea is that whatever we introduce in the solvency regime will be consistent with new accounting practices that are already being discussed at international level.  The current regime does not address any of these concerns, based as it is on 13 directives in the insurance area.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">The three pillars have already been mentioned.  What is important about them is that they interact in the sense that each pillar cannot be considered independently.  It is important to point out that the first pillar is entirely quantitative.  It deals not only with technical provisions for known liabilities of insurers, but also the questions of what capital is for and what solvency is all about.  In essence, solvency is concerned with unseen losses.  This is sometimes forgotten in the debate; it is a question of unknown rather than known challenges.  Institutions must have sufficient capital to get through those times.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Interestingly, there are two levels of capital, the MCR and SCR.  The idea is that there be different elements of supervisory intervention if capital falls below the SCR.  If the MCR is broken, we have what the directive describes as "ultimate supervisory action", which is the withdrawal of authorisation.  This structure of an MCR and SCR is consistent with what we already have in our regulatory process in that we have a requirement above the absolute minimum set by the directives.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">The second pillar, which focusses on corporate governance, internal control and risk management, will present a challenge for many supervisors in Europe but, fortunately, not so much in Ireland.  It requires institutions to have their own risk and solvency assessment carried out on at least an annual basis.  The Financial Regulator already focuses very much on corporate governance and risk management in companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The provision regarding disclosures will have significant implications for the industry across Europe.  Institutions will be required on an annual basis to publish a financial condition report as well as details of how they have complied with their solvency requirement for the year in question.  This applies equally for groups, subsidiaries and solo entities.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Since 2004, the Financial Regulator has committed significant resources in terms of person days to the Solvency II process.  We have partaken in all the working groups of the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors, CEIOPS, and we chair the Insurance Groups Supervision Committee, IGSC.  We have also participated in the work of the Financial Stability Committee, FSC, for the last three years.  We were involved in the drafting of advice requested by the European Commission from CEIOPS.  The latter drafted advice, put it out to public consultation and, having considered the findings of that consultation, sent formal advice to the Commission.  Slide No. 24 outlines this formal advice.  I use the word "formal" because CEIOPS responded to official calls for advice.  Mr. Carrigan mentioned that the Commission has called for further advice on groups issues.  The advice was given prior to the publication of the directive earlier this year.  I do not claim that all the advice was taken on board but a large part of it was.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">As members know, the Commission is responsible for drafting EU legislation.  It was involved with member states at Finance Ministry level, or Level 2 under the Lamfalussy process, in the context of Council working party negotiations.  Since the proposal was put forward under the Portuguese Presidency, as Mr. Carrigan mentioned, several meetings have taken place and various regulatory issued were notified.  One of these is group supervision.  Another relates to diversification effects and what is called group support.  Other regulatory issues include harmonisation and supervisory co-operation.  Finally, there is the issue of "one size fits all".</p>
          <p eId="para_247">Although it is not proposed to have a "one size fits all" regime, the proposal is based on a risk-sensitive regime and is, as Mr. Kemp noted, highly technical.  It is not obvious that all companies will be able to comply with it.  This certainly has implications in an Irish context and in respect of offering competition to consumers in a European context.  This is because while there are almost 5,000 insurers throughout Europe, there only are 122 insurance groups.  Members will find that the regime is designed largely for the more complex and dominant insurers in the market, as distinct from the large numbers of insurers that exist.  Our statistics show the presence of 229 insurance undertakings in Ireland.  This figure excludes 120 reinsurers that were deemed authorised from last Monday of this week.  In addition, 42 branches of other jurisdictions operate directly in this jurisdiction.  Significantly, however, as companies are allowed to operate here on what is called a freedom of service basis, they are not obliged to locate here and we have received 711 notifications of companies who can do business in Ireland on a freedom of service basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">As for group supervision, the initial advice provided to the Commission essentially was to effect an incremental change to the current regime.  Supervisors in Europe already had done much work in this regard and a fairly detailed paper was published last December on a lead supervisor concept for insurance groups.  Mr. Carrigan mentioned colleges of supervisors.  Co-ordination committees, which amount to the same thing, have operated for a number of years in the field of insurance supervision.  Consequently, for most of the 122 insurance groups in Europe, a lead supervisor already has been appointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">Under the proposal, greater responsibility will be vested in the group supervisor and most supervisors have no major difficulty in that regard.  Essentially, the directive will put into law what supervisors had already proposed on their own initiative last December.  Supervisors throughout Europe have concerns relating to the diversification benefits from which groups may benefit and what is called the group support regime, which constitute two different issues.  In any group that seeks to benefit from the group support regime, the group supervisor will have a vastly increased role and responsibilities and, consequently, the local supervisor will have significantly less responsibility in this regard.  Essentially, local supervisors only will oversee the minimum capital requirement, whereas the group supervisor will oversee, even in respect of a subsidiary, the solvency capital requirement, which is the higher level of capital that the solo entities will be required to hold.  Moreover, it is not clear where the capital in excess of the minimum capital requirement can be, or will be, held in a group context.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">Hence, reservations exist among supervisors in Europe on these issues.  As Mr. Kemp pointed out, this is because the proposal assumes a willingness on the part of both the group and the group supervisor to act promptly if a subsidiary is under financial stress.  As Mr. Carrigan mentioned, it also looks to the economic form of supervision and the economic manner in which groups are established, instead of the legal way that groups have set up, which largely involves using subsidiaries rather than branches.  Clearly, the only obligation on groups that wanted to benefit from having centralised capital would be to set up branches in all the jurisdictions in Europe as such a benefit would then arise automatically.  The worrying question then arises whether capital could be moved from one jurisdiction to another when either the group or the individual company is in stress.  Clearly, there is a potential conflict with the existing reorganisation and winding up directive, which specifically exists to protect policyholders in a winding-up situation.  Moreover, what can be regarded by large groups as small subsidiaries may in fact be fairly large subsidiaries in a domestic context.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">I will not mention the additional work on groups that is being carried out because Mr. Carrigan has already done so.  However, CEIOPS and the European Commission will examine these issues over the coming months and, hopefully, advice will be given to the Commission by next May on how to deal with them.  As Mr. Kemp noted, the fourth quantitative impact study will take place next April, which should identify other issues on the group support regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">On harmonisation, while there are common directives, the member states' regulatory regimes are entirely different and member states have exercised different options in respect of such directives throughout the Union.  Some member states have what is called gold-plating or super equivalence when compared to a directive's contents.  Supervisory approaches diverge and the legal frameworks that operate across the Union also differ.  However, harmonisation is one of the key objectives of Solvency II.  If successful, it will create a truly single market in insurance and, consequently, an institution really should experience the same regulation irrespective of its location.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Everything that has emerged from the ECOFIN Council, the Commission, the European Parliament and the inter-institutional monitoring group on the Lamfalussy process in particular has stressed the desirability of convergence in supervisory practice in both insurance and across all financial services legislation and practices in Europe.  This objective faces several challenges including differences between the conservative regulators in Europe and those that are progressive, rules-based regulators as opposed principles-based regulation and expedient measures to reach agreement during the negotiation of directives.  An example of the latter is that the directive already calls for a five-year review of the group support regime although the directive has not yet been agreed.  Other challenges to harmonisation include its local implementation, as well as failure to consider all relevant situations.  Clearly, the legislation focuses on the larger companies and issues and it is not always possible to address all institutions in all circumstances in a directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">Mr. Kemp has already mentioned an issue in respect of the "one size fits all" approach.  Although the work on the directive focuses clearly on large market participants, particularly in the non-life sector, Ireland has many cross-border companies, that is, companies that are located here specifically to write business in other jurisdictions.  In addition, Ireland has a very large captive sector, which essentially comprises insurers that have been set up to cover the own risk of their parent entities rather than selling it to third parties.  Ireland also of course has a significant reinsurance business.  It is the third largest in Europe and holds approximately 7% of the global insurance premiums in reinsurance.  Our concern is that, given the broad nature of the directive's framework, significant attention will not be paid to such issues and I agree with Mr. Kemp's comments in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">The key message for stakeholders is to start early.  Although Mr. Carrigan mentioned that it will not be implemented until 2012, we have learned significantly from developments in the banking sectors.   I refer to the Basel II rules and the negotiations leading up to the capital requirements directives.  In that instance, banking institutions in particular are playing catch-up although they had a good few years' notice of what was coming down the tracks.  Another lesson is to avoid underestimating the complexity of the project and, undoubtedly, as Mr. Kemp has mentioned, it is complex.  The current insurance regime is very straightforward and simple.  Essentially, solvency is calculated on the basis of either premium income or claims.  However, the new regime will have capital requirements for credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, equity risk, property risk and operational risk.  Hence, as all these risks apart from insurance underwriting must be taken into account, it will be complex.  A further lesson pertains to the importance of securing the involvement of the Irish industry in particular in the quantitative impact surveys.  I compliment the industry in this regard as 39 companies became involved in the third survey, which has provided us with a good idea of the potential impact on Irish insurers.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">This will have major implications across Europe from a supervisory perspective.  However, for the Irish regulator, the implications initially may not be so great in terms of the supervisor review process.  Nevertheless, as Mr. Kemp has noted, the attraction to Ireland of the complex institutions would involve major information technology demands and the validation of internal models might require significantly greater actuarial expertise within the regulator.  I refer to level three, which has not been mentioned.  It constitutes the third level of the Lamfalussy process, whereby, in essence, supervisors will agree on proposals and convergence in supervisory practice without needing legislation to so do.  This certainly will happen and, ultimately, there also will be greater transparency and accountability for supervisors.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">In conclusion, although this is a prudential directive that is significantly, if not entirely, focused on technical and governance aspects of supervisors, as I noted at the outset a sound robust prudential regime constitutes the bedrock of prudential supervision.  This is a consumer protection directive because although it only focuses on industry, consumers will be better protected by it.  The Financial Regulator is the institution charged with the protection of consumers in respect of financial services and my colleague, Ms Colette Drinan, who is from our consumer protection department, will answer any questions in that regard.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_117">
          <from>Ms Sarah Goddard</from>
          <p eId="para_259">I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for inviting us to give our views on Solvency II.  Many of our views are those the committee has already heard from my colleagues here and I see little point in continuing those particular avenues.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">I will give the committee a brief idea of the Dublin International Insurance and Management Association, DIMA, and how it operates.  What is little known generally is that within Ireland, there is a very large international insurance and reinsurance sector.  DIMA represents those organisations.  We have 56 member companies.  Each of these companies has a parent company which is outside the State with local operations but which are all writing cross-border business.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Within those member companies, we have four broad categories.  The first category is the insurance businesses.  We then represent life reinsurers who are writing primarily US business; non-life reinsurance, which can be global business; and captive management.  Within those categories, we are looking at operations writing business from the commercial or corporate sector.  There is not so much of the consumer-focused operations as one might see with, for example, the federation.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Analysing our membership, we have €44 billion in assets under management, as of last year.  The gross premiums were in excess of €17 billion and the net premiums were €12 billion.  This means that in Dublin, we have what we like to term a market of substance.  It is not a place where business comes in and goes out again.  We have a very strong marketplace operating here.  The corporation tax take last year was €168 million and only 700 employees were employed in the sector.  Although it has a very high value, it does not have very great demands as far as the individuals are concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">We very much welcome the changes proposed in Solvency II.  We see it as very much a root and branch change to reinsurance and insurance regulation across Europe.  We see it as being not just an evolution, but a revolution in the way people are looking at the regulation.  Bringing 27 member states into one type of regulatory regime will be a very onerous and challenging task to undertake.  However, the benefits will be paramount in respect of what comes through.  We see that there will be a much more appropriate recognition of risk within reinsurance operations.  As Mr. Brady said, risk itself will be seen not only in the context of what is being underwritten, as is currently the case, but will be seen in the way the organisations themselves are run and managed.  It ultimately leads to the directors of the organisations being responsible for how their companies are run.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The consequences we will see as a result of Solvency II will include increased complexity in both the management and running of companies.  Inevitably, that will lead to greater costs.  However, those will be offset by the other benefits.  Solvency II is already being seen as a challenge to the rest of the international marketplace as a standard setter for international regulation.  Just the other day, the Mexican government said it intended to adopt a Solvency II-based regime.  I know the US is looking very closely at what is going on in Europe.  As I have said, a considerable amount of US business is being written in Dublin.  To have US regulators looking at that sort of regime will only be beneficial to us.  There are 50 states in the US which have different forms of regulation and which may be forced to look at adopting a similar form to that being implemented in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">As far as the positive consequences are concerned, we will see a much more realistic capital base being demanded of the insurance and reinsurance entities.  This will ultimately lead to greater policyholder security and protection.  Generally, we feel that across Europe we will see a more level playing field and that different factors will be brought to bear as far as competitive pressures are concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">Within DIMA, we see certain issues.  The one we deem to be most important for our membership is proportionality for smaller companies.  The committee has heard quite a lot about this already.  We represent the captive sector, about which I will provide more information later.  There is a specific impact, which we identified by carrying out one of the qualitative impact studies, that will have a very detrimental effect on a number of captives, both in Ireland and other EU member states.  We have been urging the European Commission and the European Parliament to look much more closely at what they are doing in respect of small companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">As of Monday this week, the reinsurance directive was supposed to have been transposed across Europe.  This is one for every reinsurance entity and is the first time there has been any Europe-wide demand for a level playing field in reinsurance regulation.  That directive was implemented in Ireland in July of last year.  Ireland was the first country to implement it.  The directive has been pretty much adopted wholesale into Solvency II.  There are certain aspects of it which will be superseded by the requirements of Solvency II because they are moving to a solvency-based environment, rather than the environment that currently operates under the reinsurance directive.  We feel it is probably worthwhile revisiting some of those issues and seeing whether there is any requirement for them in the Solvency II regime.  Ultimately, the critical item as far as we are concerned is the issue of proportionality.  As Mr. Brady said, it affects not just the companies here but those across most of the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">To date, we as an organisation have engaged actively with our counterparts in other countries and with other regulators to ensure that this proportionality principle is brought to the fore in Brussels, in particular for the captives.  As I said before, we engaged in the QIS 3 procedure, which took place this spring and identified the issues for captives.  We have made our feelings known within the European Commission and the European Parliament.  It was brought to our notice that the Commission was not aware of these problems until very late in the day with the development of the directive.  We are trying our best to ensure that the proportionality principle is brought into account specifically for captives and are seeking to have changes made to the framework directive so that the captive environment will be noted for this.  The concerns have been escalated to the highest level and we are continuing to work with other organisations which, for example, represent smaller companies and the mutual associations and which have similar issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">I will now deal specifically with captives.  It was the reinsurance directive officially transposed across Europe on Monday which first defined a captive operation.  Interestingly, this is one of the definitions left out of Solvency II at this point.  However, it makes it clear that a captive insurance or reinsurance entity is one which is owned by the organisation to which it is providing insurance.  The parent company, therefore, is the policyholder.  This leads to different issues from those one might see with other types of insurance or reinsurance operation where third party involvements are concerned.  If there is a claim on the policy, the claim is by the owner of insurance company.  This means that, obviously, we do not see any contingent risk going too far into marketplaces.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">The rationale for captives, which has been highly recommended by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, the ultimate grouping of insurance regulators across the world, is that having the captive model available increases competition to corporates, can provide a lower pricing environment and gives greater flexibility of cover.  We have seen, for example, that in times of market crisis when capacity has become unavailable due to, for example, the events of 11 September 2001, or when certain sectors have such bad claims experience that insurance companies are either withdrawing their capital entirely or are pushing the rates up to the point where it is impossible for corporates to afford to buy the insurance cover, they can turn to their captives to help them manage these exposures, which otherwise would be impossible to have on their balance sheets.  This also means that because they are taking a greater awareness of and a greater position with the risk, they manage it better.  In that respect, it improves the risk profile of the organisation.  Its risk management gets higher, which again feeds into some of the requirements that Solvency II is trying to undertake to address in the way in which it is currently being structured.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">There are more than 100 captive insurance and reinsurance entities in Dublin.  The first international insurance entity that came into Ireland in the IFSC regime was a captive insurer.  We are seen as the leading centre of cross-border European captives industry.  The vast majority of the captives operating here also operate in a number of EU member states.  Some of the largest Fortune 500 and FTSE 100 companies have set up their European operations here.  The captives model also provides the opportunity for those companies to see the advantages they could have in putting other types of financial services operations into Ireland.  We have seen some organisations do this.  For example, a large German automotive company with an operation in Ireland has, subsequent to setting up a captive company, set up a treasury operation.  It has knock-on effects within the greater regime.  According to our internal assessments, the captives industry in Ireland contributed in excess of €65 million in corporation tax last year, so it has another value in its own right.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">We discussed our proposed changes to Solvency II with the European Commission and representatives of the European Parliament.  The changes are to amend the draft directive to have some explicit recognition that captives, as part of the smaller company regime, must be dealt with in a proportionate manner.  We are examining the tier 2 level of QIS4, which will occur in spring 2008, to determine how the proportionate regime can be brought to bear and how the structure can be formulated in such a way that it recognises the risk management position, the proportionality and the lack of requirements for policyholder protection in the same way as if there were consumer issues surrounding insurance offerings within the organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">Ireland has been recognised as one of the top eight reinsurance centres in the world.  Ireland brought the reinsurance directive into effect in July 2006.  The first country to do so, we have reaped benefits by seeing a number of global reinsurance entities putting their European headquarters in Dublin.  It is a continuous opportunity for the country because companies that have looked forward to using cross-border possibilities are now allowed to do so by the directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">The area of finite reinsurance has been incorporated into the reinsurance directive out of necessity.  However, the structure of Solvency II, which is risk-based, should make finite reinsurance unnecessary in the proposed directive.  Therefore, we are proposing that finite reinsurance be removed entirely.  There are issues, such as the lack of clarity on the calculation of the MCR outlined by Mr. Kemp and the fact that third country service providers do not appear to be specifically addressed by the directive.  As a number of DIMA's member companies have third country parents, this matter may come to bear on the structure of their operations and Ireland's attractiveness as a place to locate international operations.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">I thank Ms Goddard for a complex, detailed and informative presentation.  Regarding the high start-up costs and competition in the free market, Mr. Brady referred to the advantages of single market insurance.  However, the difficulties experienced in subprime lending have led to a global banking debacle.  Banks anticipated risks, but their stock valuations are now in difficulty and there is a question of security surrounding people taking out loan insurance.  During the boom years, there was a rush and a great deal of anticipation in what was a growth economy.  People did not quantify the risk and gave money at slightly higher rates.  Does this situation prevail in the insurance industry?</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Ireland's corporation tax regime lends it a distinct advantage.  What impact would European harmonisation have on the industry in terms of the level of competition?  The growth of SMEs is being encouraged in Europe, but there are distinct differences between Ireland and other European countries' definitions of what constitutes an SME.  There is no harmonisation in that regard, as SMEs are quantified differently within Ireland, the United Kingdom and elsewhere.  In the context of Lisbon, the approaching European referendum and Europe's growth, people have a certain fearfulness of Europe.  There is a clear difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">Mr. Brady referred to value for money.  What do DIMA's total assets amount to?</p>

Will the European regulations make it difficult for American companies coming to Ireland?  If there are 50 different regulators in the US, will American companies considering Europe not be frightened by over-regulation, as evident in Solvency II, which would not prevail in the US?  Does Mr. Brady wish to answer any of my questions?</p>

          <p eId="para_280">I will not take the question on tax.  I will allow the Department of Finance's representatives to do that.  I hope that we are still discussing a consolidated corporate tax base as distinct from our rates of tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">Regarding integration, it is interesting that the Chairman mentioned the subprime crisis.  For years, people called for greater integration in financial services, but the crisis has proven that we have that integration.  One of the difficulties of the markets being so integrated is that, if someone is hurt in the US, we in Europe can be hurt.  However, one good aspect of market integration and different players being in the market was displayed by the events of 11 September to which Ms Goddard referred.  On the back of one day's events, two reinsurers alone took a hit of approximately $7 billion but the market survived and the reinsurers are still in business.  Market integration is good and the proposal for Europe will lead the world in terms of how to achieve regulation for insurers and reinsurers.  Europe has a significant influence in the International Association of Insurance Supervisors where we are pushing the boundaries in terms of solvency supervision.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">I agree with the Chairman concerning small companies, as an SME in Ireland would be a non-existent company in some other member states and an SME in Germany would be a large corporate here.  From the earliest days, we have emphasised the differences in company sizes in different jurisdictions.  In the directive, there is expression driven by Ireland in respect of the nature, scale and complexity of companies.</p>

          <from>Mr. Patrick Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_289">Fortunately, from an insurance perspective, life companies have appointed actuaries.  They act independently and that is their function.  In non-life companies there are signing actuaries who do the same thing.  There are also external auditors who audit the accounts and must be satisfied with the accuracy of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">It will be more of a challenge in the Solvency II regime because this is where assets and liabilities are valued at market value.  This is where the challenge for supervisors is relevant.  They must be satisfied that the assets are correctly valued.  One always relies on auditors that they will do their job correctly.  We will not be correct 100% of the time.  There are 50 state regulators in the US.  Unlike banks, they do not have a common central regulator like the Federal Reserve for large international insurers so a Solvency II regime is attractive to US players.  European law is structured so that third countries, such as the US, are not allowed to write insurance business in Europe other than limited aviation and marine insurance.  Normal insurance cannot be written unless they are established in Europe.  The Solvency II framework should attract that business to this jurisdiction.</p>

          <from>Ms Sarah Goddard</from>
          <p eId="para_291">From the perspective of the Irish reinsurance industry there are collateralisation requirements in the US, whereby reinsurers must collateralise 100% of the business they do in member states.  There have been talks with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners over the years to lower those collateralisation requirements.  With the reinsurance directive there is now a harmonisation of regulation, which is used as a strong bargaining tool to level the playing field.  By implementing Solvency II one would hope to set the playing field as an open market environment.  That is the ultimate aim, enabling entities operating in Europe to have a more transparent and easy operation of business between Europe and the US.  That will be an advantage to business operating from Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_295">There are two bases.  One is based on quantitative impact studies.  There is also the opportunity for companies to develop their own models, equivalent to what would come out of quantitative impact studies.  There are different risks with different types of business.  The motor business may be considered a low risk business because it is relatively stable.  The catastrophe risk business, where one protects against severe wind storms, is much higher risk.  Each attracts a different level of capital.  Overall, the level of capital should remain the same but the capital will shift to where it is needed, making a more efficient market, which should lead to lower prices for the consumer with the increase in competition.</p>

          <p eId="para_300">The Chairman referred to SMEs.  This may have been confused with comments about one size fits all.  We have put forward the case for proportional treatment of SMEs.  We must work through this but it means some simplification of calculations and internal models by which companies calculate capital requirements and simplification of the qualitative reassurances that must be given.  Within that, there may be limitations to the simplifications and we are examining this further.  We seek to ensure that this is not the one size fits all approach and that the directive is flexible enough to accommodate small companies as well as large companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">Regarding Solvency II and the rest of the world, the feedback we receive in Brussels is that the scheme is seen by the rest of the world as a potential world leader.

          <p eId="para_311">Building on what Mr. Brady said, given the current level of capitalisation and the requirements under Solvency I rules, the overall level of capital is intended to be stable but reallocated at a European level.  In Ireland, because of the level of available reserves, it should be possible for the domestic market to reduce the capital devoted to meeting solvency requirements.  On that basis it should be possible to reduce the cost to the consumer.  There is a long way to go and much detail must be addressed first but, in theory, there should be a positive effect form this point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">From a competitive point of view, there are bigger commercial considerations that influence whether a company enters this market.  Ireland is a small market in the European context and most European groups are already established here.  One must always underwrite for the conditions of the market in which one is operating, rather than the conditions in the home market, because costs are incurred in that market.  This has always been an issue in high liability insurance and motor insurance costs in Ireland.  Although there is a single market, a prudent underwriter will examine the cost conditions in the market he or she is entering.  Issues such as this and the size of the market outweigh some of these considerations.  On the basis that there will be greater harmonisation of the supervisory arrangements, this should facilitate competition, allowing greater transparency and general awareness of market conditions, more akin to what pertains in other territories.  The measure is positive but only marginally so.</p>

Different tax rates and laws apply in member states — I am not referring to corporate tax — and this can work against insurers operating across borders.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">One of the elements that stops foreign companies entering Ireland is the size of the insurance market.  There are 15 players in the Irish motor insurance market, which is a lot given the size of the market.  Another hindering factor is the need for local knowledge.  To get into the motor insurance market in Ireland, a company must know the average cost of claims, how to deal with claims, the length of time it takes to pay them, the view of the courts and so on.  The longer the Personal Injuries Assessment Board is in business and producing data the more companies will receive more information on the market that may attract them to it.

Does Mr. Brady agree there is a vacuum relating to information on how this should operate?  Information should be accessible to allow people venture down this route if they so wish.</p>

          <p eId="para_321">In Ireland the information is accessible.  We publish an insurance statistical review every year; not one other jurisdiction in Europe does likewise.  We make information available to Irish insurers and foreign insurers operating here on premium income, claims income, the performance of assets and liabilities.  A great deal of information is available but a lack of local knowledge of handling claims can put companies off.</p>

          <from>Mr. Michael Kemp</from>
          <p eId="para_322">In amplification of that point, commercial considerations include the size of the market, language and law.  This is particularly the case with motor insurance because it is a compulsory class and local requirements must be complied with such as, in Ireland, the form of the certificate and windscreen disc.  There are variations from country to country.  If a company is to enter a market, it must be serious about overcoming these start-up issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">While the European Union has done all it can to facilitate legal access to the market, the Commission tends to measure success by the volume of cross-border business done.  In the insurance business the method of choice when entering another market is to acquire a subsidiary or an existing business or set up a branch, rather than conduct cross-border business.  One needs a local presence, even from the point of view of handling claims and apart from underwriting issues.  Sometimes the Commission gives the impression that the Single Market has not been as successful as it has been.  For commercial reasons operators choose to enter markets in the ways mentioned, rather than conduct cross-border business.</p>

          <p eId="para_326">Many people change from one insurance company to another but it has been brought to my attention that some companies request they be informed of any claims a person might have made in the preceding three years before switching to them.  I came across a case where a person was not aware of this on switching insurance companies and was consequentially not covered when making a claim with the new company.  This was obviously mentioned somewhere in the small print but people should be made aware of rules, whereby claims made with one's former insurer in the preceding three years can influence claims made with one's new insurer.  People might reconsider changing companies if they were made aware of such rules.</p>

          <p eId="para_327">It is a general principle of law that the insurance contract is a contract of utmost good faith on both sides.  It is incumbent on the proposer to disclose anything that is material but it was recognised some years ago that this might impose too great a duty in cases where people were not aware of details relating to what was expected of them.  A code of practice is in place in the market that sees companies undertake to ask specific questions on proposal forms about issues relevant to the assessment of risk.  The issue mentioned by Senator Burke forms part of this.  In every case there should be a specific question on the proposal form seeking details of previous claims.  It depends on the type of policy, but assuming it to be motor insurance, there would invariably be a question about-----</p>

          <p eId="para_330">Obviously it is sometimes in the small print, but it should be highlighted.  People now move from one company to another more often than in the past.  There was previously a greater reliance on brokers but now people are doing business directly with companies via the Internet and so on.  They may think there is no such responsibility or they might not read all the small print.  This is something that should be pointed out to them.</p>

          <p eId="para_331">Part of the remit of the Financial Regulator is to help consumers make informed decisions in a market that is safe and fair.  One way in which we go about doing that is to set rules with which companies must comply in terms of how they interact with clients.  This is the consumer protection code, which has been fully enforceable since July of this year.  This includes general principles with regard to providing information about pertinent facts in a way that seeks to inform customers.  This is relevant to the issue of information on material facts being placed in the small print.  Under the code there are also specific requirements for insurance companies with regard to quotations, policy documentation, premium handling, premium rebates and claims handling.  There is a regime in place with which insurance companies must comply.</p>

          <p eId="para_333">I thank Ms Drinan, the head of consumer protection at the Financial Regulator, for that clarification.  This has been a very informative session.  It is a complex area, but much good work is being done by the Financial Regulator.  The whole industry is at a very high level and the fact that our expertise is recognised in Europe augurs very well for the role of the Department, the industry itself, and the Financial Regulator.  We have the required controls in place.  The fact that we are attracting considerable foreign investment to the IFSC, which is a great base for companies and is one of the largest such centres in the world, is a good indication of the success of our economy.  All concerned deserve congratulations for attracting these major players.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I thank Mr. Aidan Carrigan and Mr. Cathal Sheridan of the Department of Finance, Mr. Michael Kemp and Mr. Paul McDonagh of the Irish Insurance Federation, Mr. Patrick Brady and Ms Colette Drinan of the Office of the Financial Regulator, and Ms Sarah Goddard and Mr. Scott McIntosh of the Dublin International Insurance and Management Association for being here today.  It is much appreciated.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">European scrutiny is very important.  The major role of this committee is to address the perceived democratic deficit in Europe.  We are to consider issues that have an impact on the consumers of Ireland.  It is important that we create a context for the debate.  In addition, the introduction of the Solvency II directive is a long overdue update of the Solvency I regime.  All we have heard today augurs well in terms of value for money for consumers in the future.  I thank the representatives and wish them all a happy Christmas and prosperous 2008.</p>
