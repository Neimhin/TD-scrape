          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_13">I indicated yesterday that I wanted to study the amendment tabled by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. I recognised the number of instances his amendment includes references similar to the definition of a premises in a recent statute. It was to extend the concept of premises to include vehicles, planes and the like that the draftsman made particular provision of the kind in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">I then reconsidered the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 which provides for a search warrant in respect of a place. The definition of "place" in the Act includes a "dwelling". Having examined the 1997 Act, I looked again at section 4 of the Bill, which is what we are concerned with here and which provides for the preservation of crime scenes. In section 4(4), it is quite clear that if a place is a crime scene, a vehicle such as a hovercraft or plane which is in the middle of it cannot be interfered with or removed if directions are given.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">Section 4(4)(<i>g</i>) prevents a person from removing anything which is or may be evidence or otherwise interfering with a crime scene or anything at the scene. If a murder has taken place on a bus, caravan or helicopter and the Garda has designated that a crime scene, it is comprehended in the concept of “place” and cannot be interfered with. I am happier with my own definition than Deputy Jim O’Keeffe’s which sets out an artificial extension of the term “premises” and gives it an unnatural meaning which includes vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">One would not typically refer to a premises as including a car or a hovercraft. The draftsman and I are happier with the word "place" as originally put forward. While I am nevertheless grateful to the Deputy for raising the matter, it is clear from the context in which the term "place" is used that a crime scene to be preserved may include a ship, plane, caravan or bus.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_17">If the Minister is happy with the definition, I am happy. The advice I received suggested it would be helpful if "place" were defined with regard to other statutory definitions of "place" to include vehicles, vessels, aircraft and methods of transportation generally. If the Minister is satisfied the Bill, as drafted, is watertight, that is fine. I will withdraw the proposal and if it proves necessary, the matter can be reconsidered on Report Stage.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_19">We wanted the provision to be clear to avoid it being suggested that a constitutional construction of "place" should exclude a dwelling. There are constitutional protections for the dwelling of a citizen which is to be inviolable save in accordance with law. We wished to make it clear that the mere fact that a crime scene is a person's dwelling will not prevent the Garda from preserving it and using the powers set out in the Bill in relation to it. We do not want someone to be able to say that the absence of a specific mention in the legislation leads to a constitutional presumption that the provisions do not apply to dwellings.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_27">(2) Every regulation under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.".</p>
          <p eId="para_28">Amendment No. 10 proposes the insertion of a new section to make provision for power to make regulations. It is a standard provision and provision is made at several points in the Bill for matters to be dealt with by regulations. This amendment relates to all instances in which regulations are proposed and simplifies the arrangements. It is proposed to have a simple regulation-making power and to insert it in the Bill at section 3.</p>

          <p eId="para_29">I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 10:<entity refersTo="#bill.2004.34.dail.3.amd_10.amd_1" name="amendment"/>
                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_30">In subsection (1), after "prescribed" where it secondly occurs to insert "in doing so the Minister shall have regard to the provisions contained in <i>Schedule 1*</i>, human rights standards and international evidence indicating the likely effectiveness and social and economic costs of all potential regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">This is simple enough. It is a binding requirement on the Minister that any regulations he considers producing under this Act are based on the best evidence and international practice and are human-rights compliant. The Minister has the duty if not necessarily to adopt, but at least to take on board comments from the Human Rights Commission. Of late he has taken some of those on board but not always. I do not say the Human Rights Commission is always correct but it has a job to do and has been good at raising issues and areas where it believes legislation breaches our requirements on protecting human rights and at trying to ensure we have the best possible legislation. The first amendment to amendment No. 10 does not take away from the Minister's intention but inserts legislation that any future Minister has that requirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">My second amendment to amendment No. 10 is to ensure that resolutions are not just laid before the House but that we have greater democratic accountability because it requires the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. That allows for discussion. When a Minister puts down regulations he or she is usually assured the support of the Government parties and the outcome might be predetermined. However, this amendment allows the House to regularly debate these important regulations that would be laid down by the Minister on occasion, though hopefully not too often.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">Perhaps when the Bill is initially enacted we will have a rush of regulation but thereafter it will settle down. This amendment will provide a mechanism to review the operations of this section. Given that such a vast range of areas are covered by this Bill, the finances required would need to be examined and we need to ensure all such expenditure and regulations comply with best possible practice.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_34">Mine is a technical amendment. One of my advisers has been fine-tooth combing the Bill and suggested it is grammatically correct to express the new subsection (2) as proposed to be amended so that it would read "Every regulation under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it has been made". This seems to be the correct way to express the notion of laying it before the House after it has been made. I put it forward with a view to making the Bill as perfect as possible. If the Minister accepts it that is fine, if not I will not go to the wall on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">Amendment No. 10 states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_43">"3.—(1) The Minister may make regulations prescribing any matter or thing which is referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed.".</p>
          <p eId="para_44">That is all encompassing. Will the Minister, at his convenience, give us the benefit of his fine-combing of the sections and provide advice on the corpus of regulations to be made under the legislation so that we will have an understanding of the breadth of power in respect of secondary legislation vested in the Minister? Effectively, most of the documentation laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas passes after 21 days. It would be useful to know what important regulations will be made under this provision. What comes to mind are regulations relating to the volunteer Garda force, which will be drafted by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and then approved by the Minister without reference to members. However, because the matter will be brought before this committee, members will have an opportunity to tease it out with the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">Deputy Ó Snodaigh raised an important point because the Minister would have the power to legislate under regulation. It would be useful to know the extent of the areas of regulation.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">Although the other phraseology is just as good, to get us off to a positive start, I will accept Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">On the question of the general regulatory power, it will be wide-ranging and encompass fixed penalty notices, the calibre of weapons, firearms safety arrangements, etc. A substantial range of issues will be covered. If I were to go down Deputy Ó Snodaigh's route that everything must be approved in advance, it would be unusual. Should the Deputies opposite wish to seek a derogation from the general rule that regulations can be made on the basis of negative clearance, which is what is prescribed, a positive clearance provision should be related to a particular area. Many aspects must be changed from time to time such as the calibre of weapons and so on and if I was obliged to come before the Dáil on each occasion on which I made or varied a regulation, some committee of the House would have a full-time job dealing with me. I suggest that my amendment be accepted and if the Deputies opposite see points where a positive clearance arrangement is required, they should raise them in the context of the individual power.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">I do not disagree with the Minister. One of the reasons I tabled the amendment was on the basis of the extent of regulations. Yesterday, I made the argument that, in effect, we are debating not just one but several Bills at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">I accept the Minister's suggestion that it might be preferable that motions regarding derogations for specific items be put before the Houses of the Oireachtas, though such motions are often taken without debate in the House and forwarded to the relevant committee. If there is no controversy or opposition, they are dealt with in a speedy manner. One need only consider the speed with which many EU regulations, directives and motions move through the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">Much of what was contained in the Garda Síochána Act — I do not wish to enter a debate on the Garda reserve at this stage — was dealt with by way of regulation rather than through including broad parameters in the legislation. In hindsight, that may perhaps have been better, although perhaps not.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">I will withdraw amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 10 on the basis that, as we proceed with the Bill, other members and I may identify areas in which we need to ensure that the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas should be sought rather than simply providing that matters be laid before them. Many items laid before both Houses never again see the light of day. Acceptance of amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 10 would serve as a reminder to future Ministers that they——</p>

          <p eId="para_52">I should have addressed the first amendment tabled by Deputy Ó Snodaigh in a more comprehensive manner. In making a regulation under the Act, the Minister must behave constitutionally and is, under the European Convention on Human Rights legislation, required to act in a conventional and compliant way. In addition, it is the practice of my Department to lay before the Human Rights Commission matters which it believes could reasonably be of interest to it and to give it notice of any regulations being made. The Human Rights Commission has acknowledged the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform's diligent compliance in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">Every regulation must be mandated by the Act and the latter, as a matter of law, must to be interpreted in a manner that is European convention-friendly. I, as Minister, in doing anything pursuant to the Act must act in a manner that is compliant with the European convention unless the Act requires me to do something else. I do not believe that the latter is the case in regard to this legislation. Where issues of a human rights nature arise, it is the practice of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to forward regulations to the Human Rights Commission whenever practicable.</p>

If a Garda car collided with, knocked down and killed somebody, it could be interpreted as a negative measure that the Garda should have the exclusive right to record the scene. It could effectively mean giving the Garda the right to prevent other people from recording matters that might be of relevance to their innocence or to the guilt of other people. If we were to go down the road of providing that only the Garda could record anything at a crime scene, we would be obliged to include many more additional protections. If, for example, there was a fracas between a number of gardaí and a number of other persons and if the gardaí insisted that only they were entitled to preserve the scene and prevented anybody else from taking photographs of the state of play, it might be perceived as having a slightly sinister and overbearing tone.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">I suppose I should not single out the tabloids. However, if a family loses a member as a result of a grizzly murder, greater pain and hardship that has nothing to do with discovering who committed the crime could be caused by publishing photographs of a salacious nature in the media. It was to highlight that issue that I tabled the amendment. Is that what we want to happen? I appreciate the point that we are in an age when we encourage the freedom of the press within reasonable limits. That leads to the question of whether the issue I raise could be more properly dealt with in the context of a complaints procedure under a press council or whatever ultimately emerges in that regard. That was the main motivation for tabling the amendment. I cannot see how the taking of photographs which might be published could impinge on the trial of an action. While this may or may not be the appropriate place to include the proposal, it is appropriate at least to discuss the matter at this time. That is why I tabled the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_99">While much of the discussion has centred on use of gruesome photographs by the press, there are other issues involved. Parents may not want their children to see photographs of a murder victim but find such pictures all over the newspapers. We can address their desire to protect their children through the application of certain standards or by requesting the media to observe certain codes of practice. In recent times we have moved from traditional standards to a dispensation, whereby the portrayal of persons killed in gruesome circumstances is the norm. Nevertheless, my support for the provisions derives from another perspective. The Garda probably has powers to ensure there is no contamination of a crime scene, but we must consider the increasingly prevalent problem experienced in other jurisdictions of media helicopters arriving at the scene to take photographs. This intrusion immediately distracts gardaí who are working, while the blast from the helicopter's rotors——</p>

However, there is another concern, on which Deputy O'Keeffe has reflected. I support his remarks on the basis that the public is concerned about the manner in which sections of the media regularly abuse their position. Amendment No. 21 addresses the taking of photographs which, as we have seen in many instances, has damaged the integrity of due process in the justice system. The recent record of certain media representatives is very poor. There is a great deal of anger among the public at the way in which the media have handled the murder of a young woman in north Dublin, in particular. Questions have been raised as to what will transpire if a trial ever takes place. I will not go into detail, but there is a great deal of anger among the public about media damage to the integrity of a potential or future trial. Amendment No. 21 refers to "photographing or otherwise recording the crime scene". I have referred previously to the need for freedom for the public to facilitate the justice system, but there is a great deal of anger about the way in which the tabloids especially have behaved in the past four or five years in addressing crimes and intruding into people's private lives. Many are upset.</p>

Where a crime scene is a public place, I imagine that gardaí will tape it off and erect bollards and a sign and that the public will remain outside of these. Where a house is involved, hardly anybody would be entering. I do not know if there have been problems in that regard. Provision already exists in the Garda Síochána Act in respect of people providing information to the media with regard to ongoing investigations.

          <p eId="para_114">As Deputy Costello said, it is odd that such powers as the Garda Síochána possesses are either common law in nature or come about by necessary implication. Since the force has a function in investigating crime, it might be implied that it has collateral entitlement to preserve scenes. It is important to put this on a proper statutory footing because it is not simply a matter of having a murder scene in a domestic house and respecting the wishes of the occupants. Crimes are frequently committee at places of profitable economic activity and the owners of, for example, supermarkets are reluctant to close down their operations for three days. This statutory provision is designed to give rights and protections to property owners and to give the Garda elbow room to do its work. It is also aimed at providing a means of resolving any conflict between property owners and the Garda.</p>

          <p eId="para_116">Let me explain. Amendment No. 27 deals with a point mentioned yesterday by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe in another context that he proposed to deal with under the Offences Against the State Act. The amendment reads:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_117">"A direction ... shall be deemed to continue in force until the determination of an application under <i>subsection (9) </i>or <i>(11) </i>if—</p>

The Bill provides that he or she must do so "as soon as reasonably practicable" and should not arrive in court without having done so. We aspire to the Garda Síochana approaching all investigations in as professional a manner as possible. I do not know how they are conducted but presume it uses check-lists and standard forms for various crime scenes. Perhaps such forms are drawn up by superintendents. I presume a review is conducted following closure of an investigation. That may be the time for the Garda to confirm particular directions in writing before sending a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Such documentation should be included in the file forwarded. It is this type of incidence about which we are speaking. During the collection of evidence a superintendent has ample opportunity to close off any loopholes on which an accused might be able to rely to collapse a case. I await the Minister's response.</p>

My amendment would require that the garda shall describe the place and state the date and time that the direction was given, the name and rank of the member giving it and that he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that the direction is necessary. As a garda's signature would not be necessary, although his or her name and rank must be stated, this amendment represents a better formulation when dealing with a written record and will address the issues raised by Deputy Costello.</p>

          <p eId="para_182">It is simpler for a garda to take handwritten notes at a crime scene. Problems may arise in terms of specific descriptions of scenes and, possibly, a person's dwelling. In the past, gardaí risked trespassing on property when preserving crime scenes without the statutory entitlement to do so. Now that we are putting such an entitlement in place, specific provisions will need to be made with regard to describing a scene, particularly where a dwelling is concerned. It seems that the best place to describe a crime scene is at the scene itself. Court challenges may ensue if a garda returns to his or her station before jotting down his or her memories of the scene.</p>

The Law Society stated the process would be as transparent and as fair as possible and might prevent later challenges to orders. In applying to the District Court the Garda should be required to specify the arrestable offence, of which the presiding judge should take note. This is reasonable in that anybody applying to a judge at that stage should have some idea of the specific arrestable offence for he or she needs a warrant.</p>

          <p eId="para_251">Amendment No. 31<i>a</i> seeks to insert a subsection after subsection proposing that where a judge of the District Court issues a search warrant, he or she should endorse, or cause to be endorsed, on such a warrant the time and date of the issue of the warrant; the time and date on which the warrant would expire, the period of validity of any warrant not to exceed one week; the named member to whom the warrant would apply and the maximum number of other members or persons who may accompany the named member, where a limit on such members or members would apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">There are two issues involved, one of which relates to the expiry time of the warrant. I need not highlight the problems that can arise if that is not clear. It would be helpful if the expiry date was clearly stated on the warrant as it would obviate the confusion and difficulties that arose in a recent and celebrated case. The other issue touched on relates to who may or may not accompany the member to whom the warrant is issued. If a warrant is issued, the person concerned should execute it, but it may not be possible for him or her to do so alone. It might not be possible at the time of issue of the warrant for the member to specify exactly who would accompany him or her. It is a question of clarifying to whom the warrant is issued and the number of persons who may accompany that person in executing the warrant. These are questions that have been raised on the execution of warrants and my amendment is an effort to clarify and close off any loopholes.</p>

          <p eId="para_253">There is a certain validity in having the details of warrants as suggested in the amendments, a written record of the grounds in Deputy Ó Snodaigh's and the specifics in Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's. Warrants seem to be vague. It is important, therefore, that there be a record of the precise areas to be searched and the people identified. Warrants operate on a general basis in terms of the extent of an area that can be searched. It would be better to have a recorded statement of what the judge permitted rather than what tends to be the end result of a wider search that may not have been encompassed by the original request, particularly when we consider how easily warrants are granted.</p>

          <p eId="para_254">Although Deputy Ó Snodaigh's proposal has the backing of the Law Society which claims it would make proceedings more transparent, it would not make matters more practicable. District Court judges have much work to do. In the course of an afternoon detectives request warrants and set out their information under oath. If the judge has to write out the reasons and get them correct to a level at which they cannot be unpicked afterwards due to words being omitted, errors or the failure to state the glaringly obvious, it will slow the process of granting warrants. We must be practical. Judges are conscientious and require evidence. However, if they grant a search warrant, they should not have to write out their reasons when they have just heard evidence on the matter. They do not have to state their reasons for many other steps they take.</p>

          <p eId="para_256">They are supposed to give reasons sufficient for the people in court who are making the contrary argument to understand why their case has been beaten, but this is usually an <i>ex parte</i> procedure. To require a judge to record his or her reasons in writing would make the system less workable and create more loopholes than it would close. Although Deputy Ó Snodaigh has made the point that the Law Society has argued that it would prevent later challenges to documents, that is an optimistic view. If a tired District Court judge has to write down the eight reasons for granting a warrant and the warrant fails because one is omitted, he or she will not feel happy about it. This is not a point of high principle, but having seen the system operate it is more likely to give rise to snafus than if it was not done. Deputy O’Keeffe has seen detectives come into the District Court many times. If the judge has to clear the decks and write out a legal essay on why he or she agrees to the issuing of a warrant, he or she will probably have to retire to his or her chamber to take careful note of the evidence and ensure the warrant will match exactly what some clever senior counsel will later say——</p>

I will think further about the Deputy's suggestion, that a warrant should show the time at which it would expire. Although it is desirable that a garda should have easy access to this information, I must re-examine the matter. This matter was discussed at considerable length during the Judge Curtin case. If a warrant is issued on the first day of the month and is valid for seven days, we must determine, under the Interpretation Act, whether it expires at midnight on the sixth day or at midnight on the seventh.</p>

I do not want to accept an amendment on the hoof which will push me down a particular route. I accept the Deputy's point. In my view, a standard warrant should set out the date on which it expires. This would ensure that everybody, namely the garda and person to whom the warrant is presented, is aware of the day of expiration. I agree with the Deputy that it is a bit rich to expect ordinary people to have knowledge of the common law rules of counting time and the Interpretation Act in terms of whether the whole of a day on which the warrant is granted is included in the seven days.

Would it be workable if, instead of stating the grounds on which the power has been exercised — which would require the provision of an explanation in terms of which detective or superintendent applied for the warrant — we were to state the arrestable offence on which the power has been exercised? Obviously, a specific offence must be committed in order for the warrant to be issued and it is on the basis of such offence that the judge issues it. I do not know if that has implications for what occurs during the search. Is a search warrant rendered invalid if the Garda discovers that some other offence has occurred on the premises being searched? I am seeking to ensure that warrants will be granted where the Garda suspects that a crime or offence has been committed rather than to facilitate fishing expeditions.

It would normally be the case that a judge appointed to District 18 in Cork would be from outside that district and would often reside in Cork city, which is located in a different district. A situation might arise when that judge might be attending a social occasion in Killarney at a particular weekend, which is located in another district entirely. We must clarify and simplify the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> judges issuing search warrants. The Bill provides for exceptional powers for superintendents in particular circumstances. I would prefer that search warrants should, as far as possible, be issued by judges. We must, therefore, clarify and simplify the basis on which they can do so. We appear to be placing too much of an onus on gardaí to track down judges in districts in which the latter may not reside. In other words, we are placing an undue number of obstacles in the way of officers seeking search warrants. We also appear to be placing undue obstacles in the way of these officers. At the same time, however, we must take into account the decision in the Dylan Creaven case.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">A case could also be made — I will pre-empt a point that may be raised by the Minister in this regard — that a District Court judge is appointed to a particular district and, therefore, he or she only has jurisdiction within that district. It is, as I see it, a matter of statute and legislation. Judges of the superior courts have certain constitutional privileges, particularly in light of the fact, and as provided in legislation, that they are constitutionally recognised judges of the District Court. We can, therefore, legislate in respect of the nature of their powers, as is the case in terms of limits of jurisdiction in the context of criminal and civil matters, and with regard to how they exercise those powers in the context of search warrants. We have jurisdiction to deal with this issue and should do so in the context of the Bill. Of all the issues relating to criminal justice raised with me, this is the most frequently mentioned by members of the Garda Síochána as causing them problems in carrying out their duties in the detection of crimes and in arresting those they suspect of having committed such crimes.</p>

          <p eId="para_292">I support Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's valuable point on this. We are all aware of the issues raised in the context of District Court judges operating outside their jurisdiction. Addressing this issue would provide an extra facility in terms of allowing District Court judges to execute search warrants. The Minister is proposing that, where the alternative is not practical or in matters of urgency, a superintendent may make the necessary decision but, in such situations, it would be better that a third party rather than a member of the Garda be responsible for adjudicating on a warrant. In the legislation as presented, there is no requirement that the deciding superintendent be the superintendent for the district concerned. Any member at or above the rank of superintendent appears to be entitled to issue a search warrant, irrespective of whether he or she has jurisdiction over the area in which the crime is committed. This amendment would be of benefit in terms of increasing the number of opportunities for putting the case for a search warrant to a third party rather than asking members of the gardaí to issue themselves a search warrant.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_293">I thank Deputy Jim O'Keeffe for raising this important matter, which arises from the decision in the Dylan Creaven case. It seems to me that the Constitution provides for the High and Supreme Courts and for courts of local and limited jurisdiction. The phrase "local and limited" has some meaning but, subject to the views of the Attorney General, the mere fact that the District and Circuit Courts are courts with local jurisdiction does not mean orders can be made in those courts by judges who are not assigned to them at any given time. With regard to procedural steps such as search warrants, there is no constitutional obligation that a judge must be exclusively attached to a specific court of local and limited jurisdiction. Provided he or she is exercising local and limited jurisdiction, any judge may make the relevant decisions. I do not see a constitutional argument against this issue, although the Attorney General may be of a different opinion. Just as it is not specified, as Deputy Costello noted, that a local superintendent is responsible for the decision on a warrant, I do not see how the Constitution can be offended if a judge in Tipperary makes a decision for Killarney District Court on a warrant for Killarney. However, it is obviously desirable that local judges, where practicable, should exercise their own jurisdiction because, for all sorts of reasons, it may be undesirable that a warrant is issued by someone in the opposite corner of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">However, the problem that arises with Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment is that it merely changes one warrant procedure under one Act, whereas the decision in the Dylan Creaven case circumscribes the jurisdiction of District Court judges in many areas. The issue will have to be addressed on a comprehensive and systematic basis. I have been told the drafting process with regard to amending legislation on a general basis is almost complete and on a later Stage I may be able to bring an amendment of a generic kind.</p>

The Garda Síochána is restricted in its operations because of the regime that ensued from the Dylan Creaven case. The response to this matter, provided it is prompt, will not have to be within the terms I framed in this amendment. Although subsection (1) of the 1997 Act covers arrestable offences, I have no problem if the Minister thinks the provision should be broad in nature. I am conscious of the possible constitutional ramifications but do not believe there will be any constitutional restrictions in following the course we suggest.</p>

          <p eId="para_303">Now that the Minister is disposed to accept Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment to provide for a mechanism for the issuance of search warrants by other District Court judges, perhaps he will accept my amendment to delete the remainder of the section.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">We have been making efforts to ensure checks and balances exist in legislation and, in our determination to prevent any hint of impropriety in the work of the Garda, have agreed to replace the old Garda Síochána complaints body with an ombudsman commission in order that gardaí are not seen to be investigating themselves. We daily learn more about the saga in Donegal from the Morris tribunal. If we establish in principle that it is improper for the Garda to investigate itself in matters of misbehaviour, it is important that we similarly provide a preventative measure so that gardaí cannot issue search warrants. We should make use of the alternative mechanism for the issuance of search warrants by a third party, which Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment sets out.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">Is there evidence to the effect that the courts are not adequate to the task of providing search warrants? The Garda representative associations have not been knocking at my door to raise the matter. As a search warrant can have dramatic effects on a person's home, it should be treated with circumspection. The traditional degree of circumspection meant a garda could not obtain a search warrant without recourse to the courts. The District Court, having heard evidence on oath as to why and where it was required, issued the warrant. We are departing considerably from that approach. The legislation states the warrant must be necessary for the proper investigation of an offence — that goes without saying — and that the circumstances of urgency giving rise to the need for the immediate issue of the warrant render it impracticable to apply to a judge of the District Court. That must be questioned. We need solid information on whether in such circumstances there is an impediment to the issuing of warrants and, therefore, to the investigation of criminal activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">The course upon which we are embarking is a dangerous one. It is a step backwards in terms of what we have done in the Garda Síochána legislation. It provides for ease of opportunity. It will be much easier for a garda to go to a superintendent to seek a warrant as a matter of urgency as all crime has a certain urgency about it. Under the legislation there is no obligation to put in writing the reason for the urgency. Inevitably gardaí will increasingly bypass the courts, perhaps not initially, but as time passes, they will realise it is easier to obtain a warrant from the superintendent than to go to court. Simply for practical reasons they will take that option. It then becomes a dangerous option. We saw what happened in Donegal, how shortcuts had been taken and unauthorised activities engaged in. If we provide a shortcut, it will be availed of more often than is intended in the legislation. In line with the principle of the Ombudsman that gardaí should not investigate gardaí, the Garda should not issue search warrants which can have a very intrusive effect on people's lives without recourse to a third party. That third party is the District Court.</p>

          <p eId="para_309">I understand that. However, my amendment does not make sense because it does not cover the next 16 lines which could not stand if the amendment was accepted.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">In line with Deputy Costello, my objection is based on the fact that there should be judicial warrants and that we should stick to this approach as much as possible with limited exceptions. We should not go down this road. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's last amendment dealt with the fact that District Court judges could be found to issue a warrant and that should cover every eventuality.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">A number of submissions were made on this issue by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Human Rights Commission. The Law Society has also commented on it. The Human Rights Commission has stated the European Court of Human Rights has noted that it will be particularly vigilant where the authorities are empowered under national law to order and effect search warrants without judicial warrant. The court has stated that in the case of any law authorising searches without judicial supervision, a legal framework must be in place with strict limits that provide for adequate and effective safeguards for that law to be regarded as proportionate. We do not have those safeguards.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">I am concerned that we are going down this road, given what happened in County Donegal, and we have looked only at that county. Detective Sergeant John White mentioned what had occurred in other Garda stations in which he had operated. Perhaps there will be an investigation of the allegations he made to the effect that there had been bad practice and abuse of power in other areas. A number of gardaí at various levels within the Garda Síochána have been accused at the Morris tribunal. Obviously, gardaí in County Donegal not only abused their powers but also took short cuts in order to obtain promotion and move up the ladder. Although I hope it is not the case, given what has emerged at the Morris tribunal, it is conceivable that there are persons with the rank of superintendent within the Garda Síochána who abused their position in the past and we are proposing to give them a power which they could abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">District Court judges are now more freely available. However, consideration could be given to the possibility of a District Court judge having the option of faxing a search warrant to a garda if he or she cannot be in the judge's presence. We must retain judicial control in the issuing of search warrants. Otherwise we create the possibility of significant interference with the personal rights of citizens which are protected under Article 40 of the Constitution. There are other international instruments which also protect the right to private life. A search warrant interferes with this, even if it is used for a proper purpose. We must ensure that when a search warrant is sought, every protection is given in order that there is no abuse of power and that action is correctly taken. As Deputy Costello said, it would be easy for a garda to knock on a superintendent's door and ask for a warrant and for the superintendent to issue a warrant without the oversight and independence from the Garda that a District Court judge gives to the process of issuing search warrants.</p>

        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_211">
          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_314">There are a number of amendments being discussed together. I will make a few general points before dealing with each of them in detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">I want an effective search warrant system that will allow members of the Garda Síochána to do their job of preventing and detecting crime. As I am cognisant that we must respect the rights of individuals, particularly in their own homes, we must devise an effective system that will take into account the constitutional and other rights of the people. My preference is a system under the jurisdiction of judges. As far as possible, I want search warrants to be under the jurisdiction of and issued by judges. That means dealing with the Dylan Creaven case and freeing the system in order that at weekends and out of hours District Court judges can be located and presented with an application and that a warrant will not be found to be technically deficient because that location is not within their district or that a warrant was not signed by the judge who normally sits in that District Court area.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">The third prong of my approach is that we must provide for exceptional circumstances. That is why I am prepared to accept that a warrant can be issued by a superintendent; however, it must be limited to exceptional circumstances. I would go further than what is provided for in the Bill. One of the amendments proposed seeks a monitoring of that exceptional circumstance to ensure we would not have a situation similar to the one where one seeks the "chief's permission" to drive a Garda car, introduced to cover exceptional circumstances where a person had not completed the necessary advanced driving course. We now find that thousands of gardaí are driving Garda cars with "chief's permission" without having done the necessary course. What was introduced to cover exceptional circumstances has moved towards becoming the norm. I would not want this to happen in the case of search warrants. That is why amendment No. 35 proposes a monitoring provision, whereby a schedule of such warrants——</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_318">I mention it in passing. This would form part of the monitoring of such exceptional circumstances in the issuing of warrants. Although it need not be the one I have provided for, we all agree that it should be done only in exceptional circumstances. Monitoring, control or recording of warrants issued in such circumstances might be one way to ensure the intent of the legislators would translate into practice and continue to be practice in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">I want simplicity and clarity on the expiry date of search warrants. Although we mentioned a period of seven days — less in the case of a superintendent's warrant — it need not be that number in all cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">My last point relates to the possibility of a carry-over. If the search was under way at the end of the warrant period, provided the member had commenced the search before the time of expiry and within the limits of my amendment, it would not be aborted. If a member has to leave without completing a search, vital evidence could be lost or destroyed. It is analogous to the application to a judge for the continuation of a detention order. That is the approach adopted in my proposals on section 5. I am not sure if we have time to go into detail——</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_322">I will respond briefly. I share the Deputy's concerns. There must be judicial control in the substantial interference with people's rights in the making and execution of search warrants. The only issue is whether it is legitimate to depart from them in an emergency. In the case of the DPP <i>v.</i> Peter Byrne, the Court of Criminal Appeal has been strong on the issue of judicial control in the granting and execution of search warrants, a point on which I need no persuasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">I have considerable sympathy for the point that the emergency measure being advanced on foot of the report of the group chaired by the late Mr. Eamon Leahy should not become the norm. The crucial question is how we can prevent that from happening. To put the matter in context, subsection (5) of the section to be inserted reduces the life of an emergency warrant to 24 hours. I also take the point that if we make a judge eligible to grant a warrant by modifying the outcome of the Dylan Creaven case, the number of emergencies should be significantly less. If at the weekend a person who has just committed a murder returns to his or her house and it is believed he or she will wash his or her clothes and have a shower, to return to the search point gardaí will have to locate the relevant judge — perhaps he or she might be on the golf course — to arrange an emergency sitting. With the best will in the world, this could take two or three hours. In most cases such a period will not be relevant but in some it is vital that gardaí act faster. We must also remember that under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking), Criminal Assets Bureau and Offences Against the State Acts, there are exceptions that allow for garda-issued warrants to operate in the context of the proportionality of the seriousness of the offences involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Deputies are asking me to address the question of whether, where this is brought forward as an exception, it will become the norm. I note that Deputy Jim O'Keeffe is proposing in later amendments that we somehow retrospectively investigate each case but I am not sure for what purpose.</p>

It would not be practicable if one was keeping a suspected drug trafficker or pusher under surveillance, had reason to believe he or she was located in a particular house and in possession of a large quantity of cocaine which was about to be handed over for cash, to contact a judge at that stage.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_220">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_329">I take on board what the Minister said. I am not sure that he is convinced of the need for the very dramatic change proposed in the issuing of search warrants which will allow a Garda superintendent to issue a warrant in circumstances where there is a sense of urgency and a need for its immediate issue. One reason is I have seen no figures or statistics that show that a change is warranted. Neither am I aware of any demand from sectors of the Garda Síochána. Naturally, there is a general wish in the Garda to make life as simple as possible for gardaí. However, there is no evidence that they have been impeded to a great degree in carrying out their duties because they have lacked the facility we are now proposing.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment which I hope can be taken on board would provide for extra flexibility. The drug trafficking legislation to which the Minister referred provides for such a facility in the context of drug barons and the Criminal Assets Bureau, as does the Offences Against the State Act in the context of subversion. Nevertheless, there is a requirement on the Garda to justify this course of action and show why it has had to dispense with the normal procedure and avail of a search warrant issued by a superintendent rather than going to the District Court. Under this legislation, a Garda superintendent is free to issue a warrant and it is necessary only that he or she is satisfied that it is necessary for a proper investigation and that there is a sense of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">The nub of the issue is the danger that unless there is judicial control or third party scrutiny, this process will be open to abuse. In a Garda station where only gardaí are in charge and they effectively deal only with suspects, the situation is very much an adversarial one. It was for this reason that provision was made for video and audio recording of interviews.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I commended the Minister yesterday on his efforts to ensure that recording equipment is installed in stations throughout the country and I am delighted to see that Dundalk is on the verge of formally receiving its equipment. However, the danger remains that, if safeguards are not put in place, corners will be cut for the sake of pursuing successful investigations. I cannot identify the safeguards in this instance. Anybody at or above the rank of superintendent may issue a warrant upon deciding that one is needed immediately. That is the context in which we are providing this substantial power. A warrant will be limited to a period of 24 hours but a similar limitation applies in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act. In other legislation, provisions are made specific to the offence but the provision in this instance operates across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">As we close one Pandora's box with the appointment of the Garda Ombudsman Commission, we do not want to open another. We allowed the Garda to investigate complaints against its members in the belief that the power would not be abused, only to witness a wholesale abuse of the system. Even gardaí acknowledge that there is no credibility in the Garda complaints system as it stands. Now we are about to allow gardaí to issue themselves search warrants. The measure is couched in language that seems to ensure that warrants will only be issued where they are necessary or urgent. What, however, is one superintendent's sense of urgency? Every investigation has a sense of urgency about it and every search warrant issued could easily be justified as being urgent. Gardaí will argue that a criminal could not be allowed to remain free or that an investigation had to be hotly pursued. There is a danger that this could become such a valuable tool to the Garda that its use will become the norm rather than the exception. Will the Minister indicate how the measure can be worded so that it will remain the exception? Will he provide statistics to indicate whether the pursuit of crimes was delayed to a significant extent by the issuance of warrants by District Court judges, other than in circumstances that are specifically exempted in this regard?</p>

          <p eId="para_334">Most Garda stations can make rapid contact with a District Court judge when warrants are required. I remain to be persuaded that the law as it stands does not cover the eventuality of an inaccessible judge. The Minister referred to the example of a murderer taking a shower to clean off evidence but, while I am not an officer of the court, I understand that common law provides that a premises can be searched without a warrant in the event of interference with evidence of a crime. Where legislation provides that a superintendent may issue a warrant, the power to do so is usually granted in circumstances in which it is impracticable to apply to a District Court judge. Even that is not covered in this section because it is left to the superintendent to make the decision. The preference of various groups that made submissions in this regard is that there should be judicial control over the issuance of search warrants. Concerns were also expressed with regard to the provisions in other legislation, such as the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act and the Offences Against the State Act, as amended, for the issuance of search warrants by Garda superintendents.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">A situation could arise in which a superintendent issues and executes a search warrant because there is no restriction in this regard. Some members of the Garda Síochána have been involved in that type of skullduggery in the past and, although the Judiciary is not infallible, it is at least a separate and independent mechanism which can provide a degree of scrutiny. We should be more careful in our consideration of this matter. I would prefer that the Bill be withdrawn but, if it is to be passed, the legal framework suggested by the Human Rights Commission should be developed so that adequate safeguards will be put in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_338">This has been a valuable discussion, on which I want to reflect. There could be circumstances where a hearing before a District Court judge would be impracticable, but because such circumstances occur infrequently, this should not mean there should be a general licence to circumvent the need to secure judicial authority for a warrant. If we are widening the number of judges who would be capable of making an order, I will consider the idea of whether oral authority may be given to a superintendent which would be confirmed later by a district justice; in other words, the superintendent could contact a judge stating that, as it would not be practical to wait two or three hours to raid a premises, he or she be given oral authority to proceed with the raid and that the hearing would take place after the event. That is a possibility.</p>

It is one possible way of reinforcing that on which we are all agreed, namely, that warrants may only be issued by a superintendent in exceptional circumstances.

A warrant issued under the Misuse of Drugs Act by a superintendent must be executed within 24 hours. Under the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, a warrant is valid for one week. A warrant issued by a bureau officer not below the rank of superintendent is valid for 24 hours. Warrants issued under the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act and the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997, with which we are dealing, are valid for one week. A warrant issued under the Child Trafficking and Pornography and Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Acts is valid for seven days. While a warrant issued under the Prevention of Corruption Act is valid for seven days, a warrant issued by a superintendent under the Act is valid for only 24 hours. A warrant issued under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act is valid for seven days.</p>

          <p eId="para_411">It is no wonder the Garda Síochána is often confused. There is a need to tidy up this area. A good starting point would be ensuring a warrant expressed an expiry time.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Amendment No. 36<i>a</i> touches on an issue which has not been mentioned. I am concerned that there could be a situation where a warrant could expire prior to the completion of a search and the evidence not recovered at that point might be disposed of before the obtaining of a new warrant. This is analogous to the case I made as regards court applications for an extension of the period of detention. We should provide that where a search commences prior to the expiration of the warrant and, provided the member who obtains it remains at the scene, any evidence seized will not be deemed to be contaminated. It is a practical effort to address the possibility that useful Garda work might be spoiled for want of a half an hour.</p>

If the Minister adds the issue into the pot for further discussion, I will not press it on this Stage. One will need to assess fully what is happening. The issue is whether we should allow the Garda to continue a search beyond the time limit specified by a judge. That can only be permitted under the most stringent controls and in the most extraordinary circumstances. I am not even sure there have been instances in which the Garda has been short-taken in its searches. The matter only arose in the context of the general examination of search warrants rather than as a consequence of a case having been made to me by a member of the force, unlike the matter of District Court judges.</p>

          <p eId="para_451">I have a general query. Would material seized under the Police Property Act 1897 be retained? Can its owners apply to the court for its return? Is there a specific timeframe for materials which have been seized and will not be used in court proceedings to be returned to their owners in the state in which they were discovered? There have been cases where property was seized and when eventually returned, was not in the same state as when it was taken. Property sometimes goes missing. I was involved in a court case in which evidence, the murder weapon, went missing in the Garda station. The State had to present the evidence in evidence bags. The weapon involved had disappeared from wherever it was being held by the police. It may not be relevant to this section, but if gardaí take the time and make the effort to put a case together, the material should be available when it comes to trial. Equally, where a decision is made that there will not be a prosecution, those who own the material should be able to recover it.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">The Law Society of Ireland raised an issue relating to legal documentation which is covered in section 6(2). The society raised a concern about such documents being seized by the Garda. The issue is not fully covered in the subsection. A legal document which offers legal advice might partially be covered by privilege. The rest of it might be used by the Garda. It is important that the part covered by legal privilege does not appear in the book of evidence and is not used in court. A document may not be cut up into pieces, but the Law Society of Ireland has raised concerns about documents being seized. It believes there is not enough clarity about privilege. Its letter of advice covers a number of issues. Will the Minister clarify section 6(2) for the committee?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_310" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_453">I fully accept the Deputy's point. A number of difficulties arise in trials. In some cases an excessively conservative view is taken about the necessity to keep material pending a trial. If someone's car is the subject of a criminal incident and there are scratches on it, the owner can be told that his or her car is being taken away while a prosecution is pending. That is very unreasonable, given the inconvenience caused in depriving the person concerned of his or her property for that period. Deputy Ó Snodaigh mentioned cases where exhibits in evidence bags go missing. That happened in the Ludlow case. There is no sign of anything seized at the time and nobody can account for this. It would be reasonable for someone to think it may not be right to hold onto bags and bags of clothes in lockers for 15 to 30 years after an event. There is the question of whether we have adequate repositories to keep evidence save because, to be kind, there have been cases where drugs and drug money have gone astray in circumstance where they should not have been vulnerable to such occurrences. There are issues involved but we cannot solve them in a criminal justice Bill as they are procedural issues for the Garda Síochána. The Police Property Act 1897 applies to evidence seized, as provided for in section 6(1).</p>
          <p eId="para_454">I understand the point made by the Law Society on section 6(2) but it may not be easy to extract legal advice from — or blacken — a letter which is criminal in intent or evidence of the commission of a crime. While I understand the Law Society's point of view, I am not sure what the solution to the problem is. If a crooked solicitor writes a letter to a client with mixed advice and a criminal exhortation, indicating that one sentence amounts to advice and another amounts to incitement to commit crime is not as easily done sometimes as might be thought.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_455">There are two points, one of which concerns the secure storage of materials ceased. I am not familiar with the procedures in place. While I presume all materials are signed in by the desk sergeant, is there an independent person who is responsible for ensuring the secure storage of evidence in order that it cannot either be contaminated or go missing? It seems a lax approach is adopted in stations. In County Donegal explosives were left outside the back door of a particular Garda station for months on end. In a Garda station in my constituency €40,000 in drugs money, as well as the drugs, have gone missing. We have not heard a word about the latter case but presumably the evidence was to be used in a prosecution and its disappearance may compromise it. The safe storage of evidence is important. The Ludlow case which the Minister mentioned is also relevant.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">The second point concerns evidence in connection with a coroner's inquest, for example, where somebody dies in a fatal accident while in the custody of the State; where clothes, belongings and documents are seized and retained by the Garda and the family must go to court to get them back. That is going a step too far because the family may want to have the evidence tested forensically. There is a need to introduce regulations and guidelines providing for the release of documents seized by the Garda without the need to go to court. It may be different where the evidence sought is essential for a prosecution but where no prosecution is envisaged, it seems strange the Garda would retain it for extended periods of time and refuse any request to release it.</p>

          <p eId="para_459">On the other hand, there are such rooms in some of the more modern stations. I presume the process of deciding what should be kept is not an exact science. There may be cases where, for example, inquests are delayed and it may not be apparent to the Garda that an inquest of any significance will take place. While the killing of Mr. Séamus Ludlow was clearly a homicide, one can have cases where a person is knocked down by a car in which there are arguments about whether it was dangerous driving causing death, whether the driver deliberately drove over the person concerned, or whether the driver was simply drunk and never even noticed the person concerned. The question of whether one should keep the clothes of all those knocked down for years on end is a difficult one.

For instance, in the case of a computer, subsequent interference would be an issue. While it is all very well to see this from the point of view of a busy Garda station in Dublin, the position is slightly different in, say, Bantry Garda station where one cannot send exhibits to Dublin halfway through an investigation to be stored in a big warehouse and then send somebody up to bring the computer back down to look at it a second time.

Simpson type event, where it was kept, sealed and identified would be a live issue. Time wasting is a feature of many criminal trials. For example, proof must be provided that Garda Costello had the evidence in his possession until he gave it to Garda O'Keeffe who, in turn, gave to it to the forensic science laboratory which returned it on a particular date. Therefore, the trial must go through the chain. Frequently, books of evidence provide for elaborate chains of evidence. As somebody who has drafted such books, one can get a headache at 3 a.m. trying to work out where exhibit 37 has gone.</p>

There are two aspects to this: time wasting in preparation of the proofs such as bringing a garda from Ballydehob to the Central Criminal Court in Dublin to prove a box was handed over to him or her on such and such a day and that he or she handed it to another garda on another date. It is costly and a waste of time. It also could lead to the public becoming incensed at the notion that somebody charged with a serious crime could get away it because the proof was not immediately available of the existence of an exhibit between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. on a specified date.

This period has been extended to 24 hours, or 32 hours where there is a rest period. We have made progress on video and audio recording and recognised the necessity therefor. We referred yesterday to the report by Judge Barra Ó Briain, which recommended that all Garda stations should be equipped with audio and video equipment. We must ensure that witness statements are recorded so that, in the event of later retraction, there is evidence that they were given freely. Recording would also protect a suspect from making a statement under duress and it would further protect the Garda Síochána from allegations relating to ill-treatment of people in custody, which are common. It would introduce a degree of transparency to the interview procedure in Garda custody. The Garda Síochána prefers to refer to "interview" rather than "interrogation". A mandatory video and audio record is required to be presented in court at any time. The Minister prides himself on introducing such equipment. He stated that 96% of Garda stations possess this equipment.</p>

          <p eId="para_519">Can the Minister state the percentage of Garda stations that are equipped with recording facilities? Certain Garda stations are seldom used for interviews but those with designated interview rooms should have recording equipment installed. What is the purpose of installing this equipment if we have no clear policy on its use? Judges are now enunciating policy and stating that they will not accept statements as evidence unless video recording shows they were made under certain conditions. Why should we, as legislators, not make it known to members of the Judiciary what we think of the procedure rather than letting it come second hand from them? Amendment No. 61 goes down that road where it states, "...only if the exceptional circumstances of the case so require, a statement by a person during a formal interview in Garda custody shall not be admitted in any prosecution against that person unless the interview is videorecorded and such videorecording is produced at the trial". That is the last step. All interview rooms should be equipped, all interviews should be video recorded and evidence should be accepted only when it has been video recorded, except in exceptional circumstances. We should include this in the legislation and this is the appropriate time to do so now that the Minister has produced the Garda Síochána Bill and included some safeguards such as the inspectorate, the ombudsman and certain managerial structures. The Criminal Justice Bill is part of the overall work of the Minister. It is the other side of the coin. While the powers of the Garda are being concentrated on, there is no statutory safeguard in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">In the past the Garda has relied too much on the interview as a way of making progress in an investigation. In the past few days of the Morris tribunal we have read about the procedures used by Detective Sergeant John White, how the results were expected to be got and what was required to get them. There has not been enough emphasis on the forensic side of investigation. With the new laboratory, the forensic side of an investigation must be critical. With the level of forensic evidence that can be ascertained on a crime, we can do virtually anything. It would be more professional to emphasise forensics and not the traditional style of confessions and interviews, which resulted in the Judge Barra O'Briain committee 25 years ago and the current Donegal saga of the abuse alleged by Ms Róisín McConnell and Ms Katrina Brolly in the conduct of an interview. A frightening approach was taken and it was admitted that a certain type of language is part of the Garda interview system. We should not encourage that but should have proper interviews and use the interview process to its best advantage without its being questioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">We have often seen a trial within a trial, when the defendant questions a statement and two weeks are taken up while the jury waits for a decision on whether the evidence taken in an interview will be allowed in court. These issues must be dealt with and one of the ways to do this is to accept my amendments on mandatory audio and video recording and to have that as the means by which evidence will be accepted in court.</p>

          <p eId="para_522">A number of my amendments also relate to video recording. Does video recording cover other visual recording such as DVD and digital recording? It is strange that while this type of equipment is becoming cheaper, an older system is being implemented in the Garda stations. The newer systems might be more appropriate. While I welcome the fact that 96% of interviews are recorded, we need to record more than the interviews. If we want a system that would protect the Garda from allegations of mistreatment, we should have some type of recording or camera system in Garda stations so that allegations of brutality in the corridor leading to the cells or interview rooms cannot be made. In this building there are cameras in the ceiling. These can be set to record and be overwritten over a week. In some cases they are not recorded onto a hard tape but onto digital files. Some security companies sell devices that allow people to monitor their businesses from their home computers. Technology has advanced since video recording was first mooted and we should continue to update to ensure the best technology is available, in particular for the interviewing of suspects.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">This section deals with increases in the periods of detention and I will return to that. If we are guided by some of the allegations that have emerged, particularly in Donegal, about how suspects were treated, everybody agrees we must ensure that type of abuse of suspects and witnesses no longer happens. Prosecutions and detection rates are based on good Garda work, hard slog and forensic evidence. I welcome the Minister's announcement of the forthcoming forensic laboratory. More Garda resources should be diverted that way to ensure we do not lose convictions due to the lack of proper forensic laboratories. It is welcome that we are getting a new modern laboratory and I hope it will be big enough to accommodate whatever expansion is required in the future because this is a developing science. While I do not believe everything I see on television shows such as "Cold Case", forensic science has taken leaps forward and we must do everything possible to ensure the Garda has the resources. One of the resources is video and audio recording. My preference would be that every part of a Garda station should be monitored, given there have been proven cases of abuse in Garda stations. Members of the public who have not been convicted of anything have been assaulted by rogue elements in the Garda and too often those bad apples seem to be concentrated in certain Garda stations. It would be in the interests of gardaí if more of the station were monitored.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The purpose of amendment No. 86 is to ensure provisions are made by providing that the Minister shall make provisions rather than that he may make provisions. Providing that the Minister may make provisions allows for the possibility of the Minister not bothering to make regulations in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">Subsection (c) in amendment No. 88 covers the deletion of subsection (2) which is sought in amendment No. 89 and provides for sanctions in the regulations for any breach of these provisions. It is to ensure that gardaí who do not comply with the regulations will not get off scot free, that there will be a series of sanctions and that gardaí will understand from day one that they will not get away with the type of activity, sloppiness and abuse that some were involved in when interrogating suspects up and down the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_526">The amendments refer to the taking of statements, the amount of time a person can be detained, the extension of such time, and the equipment available in Garda stations, in particular video and audio recording equipment for interviews. Deputy Costello rightly pointed out that the Ó Briain report focused on this many years ago. It is only now we are catching up, and we have caught up substantially.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">To give a rural viewpoint, it might not make much sense to put video recording equipment into small Garda stations. The Garda headquarters where I live is in Bandon and there is a ring of small stations around it, including Innishannon, Kilbrittain and others. We are a very law abiding people down there, but if there are serious crimes they are brought into the district headquarters. Intensive interviewing does not take place in small stations. I assume all divisional and district headquarters are now fully equipped.</p>

          <p eId="para_529">That puts a hole in that argument. It would be helpful if we knew how many divisional and district headquarters have yet to be fitted with recording equipment. If we are talking about legislating for video recording we need to know where the gaps are. I like the idea behind the amendment but I am fearful that the lack of practical arrangements on the ground might cause problems with interviews. Extra information would be useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">In regard to the length of time for which people can be detained and the extension of that time, I understand questioning of a suspect must be suspended at midnight unless the suspect waives this entitlement. Does that have any implications in terms of extending the time a person can be detained?</p>
          <p eId="para_531">Trial judges obviously examine carefully the statements given by those in detention. There is a concern that trial judges should exclude statements in respect of which there is the slightest doubt as to their voluntary nature. How do we take on board that from the point of view of legislating to have as watertight a situation as possible?</p>

          <p eId="para_533">The proposal to extend 12 hours to 24 hours under section 4 of the 1984 Act and excluding the period from 12 midnight to 8 a.m. means in effect that the 24 hour proposal may not be so different from the 48 hour recommendation that the late Eamon Leahy originally proposed. Under the 24 hour proposal, depending on the time of day one is brought in, one could, with two eight hour sessions for sleep, end up being in the station for 40 hours in total, given that the clock stops for the eight hour rest periods. That is why I thought the 48 hour proposal could be brought down to 24 hours.</p>

          <p eId="para_537">I make the point that one could spend that amount of time in custody and the rest periods that are provided for are excluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">In regard to mandatory video and audio recording, Deputy Ó Snodaigh used the term "video" in the sense in which I would use it, as different from DVD. However, video includes DVD for the purpose of this legislation. The Deputy is right that at the moment the tendency is to use old-fashioned tapes, the reason being that they are like negatives and photographs, considered to be more secure from alteration than a digital record. That is an issue. One can do things with DVDs that one cannot do with tapes. From the point of view of storage, replication and so on, DVDs clearly have a huge advantage. Perhaps in the future technical advances will make it possible to tamper-proof DVDs which are more practical in that they can be communicated from a distance, and if a judge wants to put certain portions of a recording to a jury they can be cut and edited in a satisfactory way.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">In a jury trial, if, at the 11th hour, the accused admits his or her guilt and makes a confession, unless someone contests the fact that a statement was made, there should not be a need for members of the jury to listen to 11 hours of testimony relating to matters such as the weather, sports, a person's background, etc., and watch someone stonewalling.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">I am anxious about this matter and I intend to consult the Judiciary in the coming weeks in respect of the Judges' rules. The latter were laid down in 1912 by a committee of judges at the request of the British Home Secretary. The committee attempted to put in place a system based on the technology that then existed so that information provided in interviews could be rendered in writing and in a form which people could sign or refuse to sign. Accused persons were also warned that they were not obliged to say anything unless they wished to do so but that anything they said would be taken down in writing and might be given in evidence. With long detention periods, it was never really the case that information relating to the team with which someone used to play football, etc., was recorded. What emerged were cursory notes, recorded by gardaí on half-sheets of paper, relating to information provided during long interviews. Gardaí were often asked what happened during interviews because three pages of information were not much to show following eight hours of interrogation and they would state that the rest of what occurred involved general conversation. Everyone was left wondering what the latter meant.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">As a safeguard to accused persons, it is important that an audio-visual record of everything that happens should be kept. However, this does not mean that, during a trial, all recorded material must be considered or viewed at length by a jury. That simply does not follow. The purpose of a book of evidence is to state that in the course of an interview Joe Bloggs admitted that he did A, B and C, that there is a video recording of what he said and that there is also a record of the words he used at the relevant period. One can put down an excerpt in a book of evidence as long as the person has the option of stating that he or she wants to see more of that in order to prove that he or she was coerced or that an improper threat or inducement was offered to him or her to make a statement. At that point, one can go back over the material and check the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">It is clear that the Judges' rules must be revised because it makes a nonsense of the law to proceed with two parallel systems, one in which what actually happens is recorded in minute detail and the other in which gardaí are obliged to act as stenographers and keep track of conversations in which cut-and-thrust discussion occurs in respect of what did or did not happen on the occasion of an offence being committed. As regards the latter, gardaí are supposed to give a fair and truthful account, in written form, of what a person stated.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">If one took the view that the Judges' rules represent guidance from the Judiciary as to what constitutes admissible evidence of voluntary statements for the purposes of trial and due course of law, one might say that is a judicial issue. One might also say that the Judges' rules exist only because a consultative process took place in 1912 and that the matter could have been dealt with through legislation. One could take a third view, that it is an area of mixed confidence between the Judiciary and the Legislature to decide what are the rules of admissibility and what are the guidelines for the taking of statements, the preparation of books of evidence, etc. I want to consult with the Judiciary. I do not want to trespass on its territory but if it is of the view that it is a matter for the Houses to draw up the law as regards admissibility and to lay it down in statute form, I will be quite happy to accept its advice. Alternatively, there may be mixed issues on which consultation would equally be helpful.</p>

          <p eId="para_546">I presume that gardaí in Dundalk went to Ardee or some other nearby station with a machine. I do not know how they managed in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">There was a small minority of cases where people stated that they did not want their statements to be the subject of a video record. Whereas some might be cynical about that, there are cases where, for good reason, a person making a statement might not want a video recording of it to be in existence because he or she could be put under pressure later to produce that recording to other people who are their associates or who think they can exert pressure on him or her. If there is an in-depth interview into the background of the investigation of a crime and if a detained person is asked questions such as who he or she thinks committed that crime, there are circumstances where the person being questioned would not want, in effect, to be in a position to be blackmailed into producing it to other people who would use it or hold it against him or her. Whereas we must be slightly sceptical of a situation in which a person states that he or she does not want this safeguard to be in place for his or her interview, we must nonetheless allow that in certain circumstances a person, in good faith, might not want there to be a video record of his or her interview. Where such situations arise, however, it must be clear that the person making a statement off video is doing so at his or her own request and that he or she has not been cajoled into making it by the Garda.</p>

          <p eId="para_563">Is any training on interview techniques available to gardaí? Newspaper articles suggest that there is very little training for senior gardaí involved in serious interviews. Such officers seem to rely on practices they learned during their careers. Interviewing should be a major part of the training of gardaí at Templemore. Serious questions have been raised about the methods used.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">A maximum of 40 hours' detention is considered the norm, The period runs from 12 to 24 hours and can be increased further when a rest period is included, which means that a person could be held for 40 hours. Depending on when one is arrested, one could be isolated in a Garda station without access to a lawyer for that period. Although one is entitled to a phone call, one may not be able to contact the individual one is seeking. This could be tantamount to duress and is another reason that interviews should be recorded and that CCTV should be installed in public areas of stations.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">At present, the suspect has the option of refusing to have an interview recorded. It has taken a long time for interview rooms to be equipped with video recording equipment. I asked a question of the Minister's predecessor in 2001 and received a phenomenal response stating that either 8% or eight Garda stations were equipped with recording equipment. One of the reasons given for not equipping more stations was that suspects preferred not to have interviews recorded. It seems strange that suspects would be given that choice when the Garda Síochána has no such choice. The Minister suggests one of the reasons for this is that some suspects might be afraid to reveal information because, if recorded, it could be shown in the local pub after a prosecution. If we introduce this measure on retracted witness statements, the only way such statements will be admissible is if they have been video recorded. However, those who have declined the recording option are likely to have been intimidated because that is the only reason they would retract their statements.</p>

If the person was fully frank, the recorded statement might get into the hands of an untrustworthy garda and the information could go further than intended.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_590">You raised an issue relating to the availability of audiovisual equipment in interview rooms, with specific reference to Dundalk Garda station.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_591">Firstly, the Garda authorities assure me that where a Garda station is not equipped with an audiovisual system, the person detained is taken to the nearest Garda station where equipment is available. That said, I have made inquiries with the Garda authorities with regard to Dundalk station and I am informed that a new tender is being prepared to acquire new audiovisual units to equip additional Garda interview rooms and that Dundalk Garda station is included in this plan. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that, as an interim measure, it was decided to move a recording unit from another area to Dundalk Garda station. This equipment has been installed and commissioned on Thursday 30 March last.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">I raised the issue in the Dáil on 28 March. No doubt the Minister contacted Dundalk Garda station in the meantime and, by 30 March, they had installed a recording unit in the station. This is real action.</p>

          <p eId="para_638">No. Between midnight and 8 a.m. is always time out unless there are special reasons. At present, there is only one rest period because 12 hours' detention can never bring one fully into a second day. If the detention period is increased to 24 hours, there could be two eight-hour rest periods.</p>

          <p eId="para_639">It is good to have clarity because even some of the groups that made submissions did not understand that there could be 40 hours' of detention. The Human Rights Commission mentioned that there could be 32 hours but the period is actually 40 hours. It emerged at the Morris tribunal that a solicitor encouraged one of the women to waive her right to the eight-hour rest period. A person is obviously right to try to get out of detention as quickly as possible, particularly if he or she has no case to answer or believes that to be the case. The people in Donegal believed that and ended up suffering as a result. I have not heard of any case where there was a need for an extended period of questioning. The cases involved are those in which people are being questioned for arrestable offences and obviously the emphasis should be on those. I am not alone in raising this issue. The Human Rights Commission has raised it. The Law Society, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and a number of other practitioners have asked me directly to discover from where this is coming. Is the period of detention being extended in the hope of obtaining a few extra convictions or is it just that as laws are being amended the opportunity is being taken to crank up the hours? The case for doing so has not been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">Prolonged periods of detention are contrary to the basic premise of the right to liberty as set out in the Constitution. They are also contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated in a number of cases that prolonged periods of detention often lead to duress and, on many occasions, this resulted in unsafe convictions that were overturned on appeal. In some cases they are never overturned but there has always been a question mark that the detention had been coercive. There were also the practices by Detective Sergeant John White and others with whom he worked where he said they ignored the manual for interrogation techniques when it was updated and used whatever force or ignorance they had used in the past and that this was not just in Donegal. We need to be careful not to extend the hours of detention to allow those who have abused their power in respect of those in their custody to abuse them further. That is the reason I am adamant about CCTV in Garda stations and their perimeter and the video taping of interviews. All of these measures will ensure people are not abused in custody. In other jurisdictions, people have the right to have their solicitor present for the duration of the interview. We do not have that right here but we have the right to consult. Anybody who has been in custody will know that often the solicitor arrives but is in a rush to leave, following a quick consultation and advice to say nothing that might incriminate one. He advises one to answer whatever questions one can. After that one is back at the custody suite to put up with whatever is thrown at one.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">Can the Minister produce credible research or evidence to suggest the current Garda powers are inadequate and that there is a need for the 12 hours? Why not six hours or four hours which would allow for a 24 hour period of detention, with nobody being held for longer than that? If it were for four hours, why bother to increase the time? Is the present limit of 12 hours restrictive and does it prevent cases being brought to successful prosecutions? My information is that the majority of court cases are based on evidence gleaned outside the interview or on statements made quickly following an arrest rather than when a person has been detained for a longer period.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_642">The whole section deals with the extra powers of detention. That is another issue we have referred to in terms of the mandatory recording. In its own right the substance of what is proposed here is very substantial and moves the goalposts down the road considerably. In 1984 the period of detention was six hours which could be doubled to 12 hours, for the purpose of questioning. We are proposing to double the time again. If there are two arrest periods, the detention time may possibly be extended to 40 hours. It is hard to avoid the possibility of duress striking in almost automatically if a person is isolated in a Garda station for that period. Irrespective of whether 16 hours happens to be a rest period, the person is still put into a cell for that period and in the other period could be subject to interview.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">The European Convention on Human Rights and the Constitution make specific reference to a person's privacy and his or her entitlement to a prompt hearing. As Deputy Ó Snodaigh has said the Human Rights Commission, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Law Society have all expressed concerns on this matter. We do not have the safeguard of the matter being video recorded or of CCTV. Will there be CCTV in the cell where people will spend a substantial part of the time? If a person is in a cell for eight hours or 16 hours this is time when he or she is alone and could be put under duress. There is no safeguard there. What about access to a solicitor? What assurances can the Minister give that a legal adviser would be contacted for the person detained? It is difficult to give those powers straightaway without any safeguard. The safeguard in 1984 — it is hard to believe this — was that there would be a complaints mechanism for the Garda Síochána. The complaints mechanism was set up in 1987 and is the one that operates today. This was the <i>quid pro quo. </i>They were allowing a period of 12 hours of detention for questioning in the pursuit of an investigation and the <i>quid pro quo</i> was that there would be a mechanism to investigate any complaints against the Garda. We are more than doubling that time now. We are moving from six to 12 hours to 24 to 40 hours without, as far as I can see, any inbuilt mechanism to ensure abuse does not take place in those circumstances. That is a major concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">On modern interview techniques, perhaps the Minister will come back to us on what training is available to the Garda as distinct from the old style techniques we read about daily in the newspapers from the Morris tribunal.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_455" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_645">To answer the question raised by Deputy Ó Snodaigh, the Garda SMI report carried out some years ago suggested fairly radical changes to Garda powers of detention as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_646">Certain anomalies exist under present legal arrangements in relation to detention which inhibit the proper investigation of serious offences and which should be removed. In addition to the present powers under the Offences Against the State Act and the Drug Trafficking Act, the Steering Group recommends that the Criminal Justice Act 1984 should be amended to allow for:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_647">—An initial period of detention of 12 hours authorised by the member in charge.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_648">—A further period of 12 hours authorised by a Superintendent.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_649">—A further period of 24 hours authorised by a Judge of the District Court.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_650">—A Judge of the District Court should be able to authorise an additional period of time up to a maximum of 48 hours in relation to serious and aggravated crimes such as a grave offence involving death or grievous bodily harm or sexual assault, an offence involving kidnapping or similar extraordinary circumstances or where there are a multiplicity of complicated cases, e.g. complex fraud cases.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_651">The reckoning period of detention should be suspended for sleep, waiting period for solicitor, reasonable consultation with a solicitor, for medical attention, or for court appearance. This procedure should not apply to detention under the Offences Against the State Act 1939 or the Drug Trafficking Act 1996.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_652">If a person is in custody on remand or serving a sentence for other offences, it should not preclude a proper investigation of a particular crime and there should be a procedure whereby such person can be arrested or detained and the crime investigated as if he or she were not already in custody.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">That recommendation was considered by the expert group chaired by the late Eamon Leahy, senior counsel.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">The expert group stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_655">We accept that there is a case for increasing the available period of detention of suspects to allow for the proper investigation of serious offences and we think that it is desirable that existing anomalies of the kind we mentioned are, as far as possible, removed. On balance, taking into account the requirement of the common good and the proper investigation of offences, and balancing that against the rights of suspected persons, we feel the proposed new period of detention up to 48 hours is about right, subject to our views on the offences to which it might apply, the suspension of the reckoning period and the authorisation required for the second period of 24 hours. However, having regard to the same balance of Garda needs and suspects' rights, we are not inclined to favour the extra detention period of 48 hours which is proposed, even though it would be available only on judicial authority. Any such proposal should, in our view, be supported by clear evidence of operational need to an extent which outweighs its effect on the rights of suspects and we are not persuaded that this is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">That was Eamon Leahy's position on the 96 hour proposal with which he was dealing at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">The Leahy committee also wanted to extend the 48 hour rule to a series of offences, which were illustrative only and included murder; manslaughter; kidnapping; false imprisonment; rape; robbery; aggravated burglary; burglary; defilement of young girls under 15 years; various sexual offences; offences under the Explosive Substances Act involving possession or causing explosions; offences under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, including causing serious bodily harm, threats to kill, syringe attacks, endangerment and false imprisonment; offences under section 15 of the Firearms Act, including possessing a firearm or ammunition with intent to endanger life or to cause serious injury to persons. These are more serious offences than the five year category to which I have applied the 24 period.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">We started with the SMI making the claim for a period of 48 hours, followed by a judicially controlled period of 48 hours. The Leahy committee diluted that proposal to a period of 48 hours in total but stated it should apply only to serious offences. I am now suggesting a period of 24 hours for arrestable offences. That is the progression of departmental policy on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">The real question is whether 12 hours is enough. Deputy Ó Snodaigh has said evidence should be produced as to why this is necessary. People who are arrested for serious crimes, on which reports are given to me, frequently refuse to answer questions. Hours pass. While it is their right not to incriminate themselves, they clearly do so on the basis that they know they will be out in 12 hours. Therefore, they stonewall for that period. I do not know if it is right to have a system under which people feel they can simply stare at gardaí asking them questions or at a wall and say absolutely nothing for that length of time when serious offences are being investigated. However, if it is the constitutional position that they have the right to say nothing and cannot be compelled to say anything, we are in a situation where with a significant number of serious offences on which I have had to be briefed as Minister — drug offences, gangland shootings and so forth — the persons detained do not co-operate with gardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">The treatment of persons in custody regulations were made in 1987 under the 1984 Act. That was when the complaints mechanism was introduced. There was a three year lead-in period to the Act becoming operational. The regulations provide that an arrested person shall have reasonable access to a solicitor of his or her choice and be able to communicate with him or her privately. Where an arrested person has not had access to a solicitor in accordance with the regulations and a solicitor whose presence has not been requested by the arrested person presents himself or herself at the station and informs the member in charge that he or she wishes to visit the person concerned, the person concerned shall be asked if he or she wishes to consult a solicitor and if he or she does so wish, the provision will apply accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">A consultation with a solicitor may take place in the sight of but out of the hearing of a member of the Garda. An arrested person may receive a visit from a relative, friend or other person with an interest in his or her welfare, provided that he or she so wishes and the garda in charge is satisfied that the visit can be adequately supervised and that it will not hinder or delay the investigation of a crime. An arrested person may make a telephone call of reasonable duration free of charge to a person reasonably named by him or her or send a letter, for which purpose writing material and, where necessary, postage stamps shall be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">There is a statutory right to a solicitor, for relatives to send a solicitor and for the solicitor to have access to a person who wants to be represented by him or her.</p>

          <p eId="para_663">He or she will not be present during interrogation or interview, as in other jurisdictions. If it is proposed to extend the period by 12 hours, I doubt that it will upset unduly most of the persons who stonewall. We were talking about video recording. They would love to be able to wave a video around showing them stonewalling for that long.</p>

          <p eId="para_664">The Deputy is correct that some would regard it as an extra challenge. However, I should have also pointed out that where an arrested person asks for a solicitor under the regulations, he or she shall not be asked to make a written statement on an offence until a reasonable time for the attendance of the solicitor has elapsed. This applies in the case of written statements.</p>

          <p eId="para_704">The purpose of the amendment is to make the section understandable. On a preliminary reading of this section one would not have a clue as to what it is all about. The amendment seeks to give some degree of clarity to the section. It refers to the fact that we are talking about a member of the Garda Síochána arresting a prisoner on the authority of a judge of the District Court, and the conditions that are to be fulfilled. It is not a technical amendment but one that fits into my approach that these provisions should be understandable.</p>
