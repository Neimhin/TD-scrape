          <p eId="para_47">This is an opportunity to insert a provision which I hope would improve the situation with regard to the Offences against the State Act. It has always surprised me that in the 1974 legislation regarding the post of Director of Public Prosecutions, the DPP did not have to give an account or explanation as to why or how he prosecuted. He is a servant of the State who is not answerable to anybody. When the DPP decides that the ordinary courts are inadequate for the trial of an offence and that offences under the Offences against the State Act go to the special courts, that matter is of a special nature and should be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">An explanation should be required, but the DPP does not have to explain why he moves from the ordinary courts to the Special Criminal Court. That was criticised under international law in the case of Kavanagh <i>v.</i> Ireland 2001. The United Nations Human Rights Committee said that this exceptional power should not operate in that unfettered fashion. Accordingly, I seek to introduce an amendment because this is the section which deals with the interaction between this legislation dealing with terrorism and the Offences against the State Act.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_23" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_49">This issue was the subject of examination by the Hederman committee with regard to the Offences against the State Act and in particular the case of Kavanagh <i>v.</i> Ireland. The applicant, Mr. Kavanagh, was charged with false imprisonment, robbery and firearms offences and the DPP gave the appropriate certificate in respect of those non-scheduled offences so that the applicant was charged directly before the Special Criminal Court. Mr. Kavanagh challenged the decision of the DPP to grant the appropriate certificate contending that the offences in respect of which he stood charged were ordinary crimes with no political or subversive connection. The Supreme Court rejected that application on the basis that the issue involved was not the nature of the offences but the adequacy, in the opinion of the Government or the Director of Public Prosecution, of the ordinary courts to secure the effective administration of justice with regard to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">Mr. Kavanagh then applied to the UN Human Rights Committee and complained that the procedure adopted in the reference of his case to the Special Criminal Court violated his entitlement to equality before the law as guaranteed by Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The judicial review of the DPP's position was effectively restricted to the most exceptional and virtually undemonstrable circumstances. The UN considered that the State had failed to demonstrate that its decision to try Mr. Kavanagh before the Special Criminal Court was based on reasonable and objective grounds. It was further noted by the Hederman committee that a decision by the DPP to direct a trial in the Special Criminal Court was effectively unreviewable, something that has been the subject of criticism from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Amnesty International and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">In considering those matters, a majority of the Hederman committee recommended that, although the present arrangements have worked reasonably well in practice, review by a serving Supreme Court judge, perhaps in conjunction with an independent counsel, should be considered. The word is "should" rather than anything else. Such a review would involve the DPP within 28 days of the charging of an accused before the Special Criminal Court submitting to a serving member of the Supreme Court both the decision to refer the case to the Special Criminal Court and the reason that has given rise to that decision. If the judge were so satisfied, he or she could then issue a certificate indicating that the decision had been reviewed and that the Director of Public Prosecution's decision to try the accused before the Special Criminal Court was based on reasonable and objective grounds. The certificate would be produced in the Special Criminal Court for the date fixed for trial.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">In making such a recommendation, the Hederman committee considered other options, including review by the High Court following an <i>inter partes</i> hearing. That option was rejected on the basis that such an approach might lead the prosecution into being coerced to reveal sensitive security information to the accused, his counsel and the wider public, and, moreover, many of the prosecution’s concerns might not be susceptible of exact legal proof. In light of the foregoing, it was recommended that the amendment tabled by Deputy Costello should not be accepted on the basis that the Hederman committee, which considered the issue, did not recommend that approach being advocated by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">It would be correct to note that the recommendations of the Hederman committee are still being examined in the Department. It is not apposite to make such a decision now. However, I will draw Deputy Costello's proposed amendment to the attention of the Director of Public Prosecutions between now and Report Stage and elicit any comment as to whether he might consider it an advantage or disadvantage and what problems he might envisage in taking the approach suggested by the Deputy.</p>

The first concerns the person who knowingly renders assistance to an unlawful organisation. I am making it clear by saying "financial or otherwise".

          <p eId="para_65">Regarding all these sections, a committee met to deal with the Offences Against the State Act. It made recommendations that I might like, but that the Minister probably does not. It is a pity that we are not using the opportunity to amend the Offences Against the State Act in line with the Hederman committee and the major recommendations that it made. There are quite a number, and some of these sections are contrary to the recommendations made by that committee. It is a pity at this stage that we have not taken them on board. It would also be in line with commitments given under the Good Friday Agreement not only that we review emergency legislation but that we consider alterations. That was what most people thought would happen with the Hederman committee. It is an opportunity, since the Minister is already amending the Offences Against the State Act. He is strengthening it by these sections rather than taking on board the concerns raised. The main sections of concern regarding the committee's report are 50 to 54, inclusive.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">The sooner that they end, the better this community will be able to deal with the review of the emergency legislation that was enacted to counter terrorism. The underlying fact coming out of today's report is that the IRA is stated by the IMC to be a heavily armed, strong paramilitary organisation well capable of engaging in further paramilitary and terrorist activity. In those circumstances, today is not the right time to start reminding others of obligations arising under the Good Friday Agreement. Paramilitarism must end, and parties linked with paramilitaries must wind down those organisations emphatically and unambiguously. That is the situation at which we have now arrived.</p>

          <p eId="para_71">Perhaps I might respond, since the Minister did not respond to the specific issues raised. He knows the work Sinn Féin has done in trying to reach that situation. We too want an end to paramilitarism, but as part of that we are working to our commitments. The Minister is obviously not working to his, some of which are included in the Hederman committee's recommendations. Those are changes that can take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">The suggestions were made by esteemed people. While the circumstances here outlined were recognised by them, they also recognised that the workings of the Offences Against the State Act and the Special Criminal Court were wrong and that changes needed to be made. Not all the changes would weaken the legislation; some would strengthen it. However, we should have taken the opportunity not simply to strengthen the legislation as the Minister is doing in these circumstances but to address the other concerns raised by the Hederman committee, for example, in section 54, bringing back legislation which was allowed to lapse extremely quickly because it was unjust and should not have been enacted in the first place and bringing in and strengthening sections 52 and 53 of this Bill.</p>

I propose that a new Part 7 should be added to this Bill to accommodate these amendments. The amendments I now propose are necessary to deal with issues that have arisen in the administration and implementation of the European Arrest Warrant 2003, since its passage. They do not alter the basic features of the arrangements as set out in the European Arrest Warrant Act.</p>

          <p eId="para_105">This can be done quickly. I will deal with amendment No. 43 and its purpose and then the committee will understand what I am doing. It is for the purpose of substituting a new and revised section 10 to the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003. Section 10 of the 2003 Act establishes a general obligation to surrender persons who come within certain categories. These categories include a person against whom theissuing state intends to bring proceedings or who has been sentenced and convicted for an offence in the issuing state to which the Act applies. This general obligation to surrender wanted persons is made, subject to compliance with the Act and the framework decision, including all of its safeguards. Amendment No. 43 is for the purpose of clarifying who may be subject to surrender under a European arrest warrant. In particular, it makes it clear that persons who have been convicted but not yet sentenced in respect of an offence to which the European arrest warrant relates, can be subject to surrender. The present section 10 did not include an explicit provision, although we would have thought it was implicit, in respect of that category for people who have been convicted but have not yet been sentenced. The proposed changes are designed to overcome any doubt that might arise from the present wording of section 10.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">Amendment No. 44 introduces new section 63, with a view to amending section 11 of the European Arrest Warrant Act. Section 11 of the Act reflects the detail specified in Article 8 of the framework decision and sets out the information that the arrest warrant must contain such as the name and nationality of the wanted persons, details of the judicial authority that issued the warrant, the offence to which it relates, details of the offence and the like. The present subsection (1) deals with both the form and content of a European arrest warrant. The amendment separates these two issues. As a result, the new subsection (1) deals with the form of the European arrest warrant and provides that in so far as is practicable, it must be set out as per the form laid down in the annex to the framework decision. That ensures that a European arrest warrant that does not follow the form in every detail may still be accepted. There is therefore some minor departure from the form of the warrant and it can still be accepted.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">The new subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) deals with the content and sets out the information to be provided in the European arrest warrant. It addresses in particular the issue arising from Article 8 of the framework decision. That article appears to provide that the inclusion of details such as the e-mail address is mandatory and must have the same status as other details, say, relating to the identity of the wanted person or the offence. It is possible that some judicial authorities may not have an e-mail address and if Article 8 were to be applied strictly, that could result in the arrest warrant being rejected on that relatively minor ground. The amendment seeks to alleviate that potential problem. The new subsection identifiesthe matters about which details must be provided, while also providing that details about e-mail addresses and the like may be given where they are available. A new subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) is being added to provide that information required by subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) may be supplied in an additional document. That will avoid the need to ask the issuing state to reissue European arrest warrants every time it requests additional information.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">We have had a few court cases in which some of these issues have been signalled. Rather than allow the Irish State to come up against adverse court decisions that trip us and require us to introduce separate legislation, my advisers consulted me and I decided we should get this right before matters began to go wrong. If there are ambiguities in the legislation, they should be tidied up. One court case, which we are coming to just now, has caused significant difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">Amendment No. 45 inserts a new section 64 in the Bill. Its purpose is to amend section 12 of the 2003 Act. Section 12 deals with arrangements for the transmission of European arrest warrants and related undertakings. I propose to deal with the amendments according to their subject matter. Dealing first with subsections (2), (5), (6) and (8)(<i>b</i>), the words “or issuing state” are being added after “judicial authority”. This will allow the issuing judicial authority or other relevant authority in the issuing state, that is a prosecutor or the executive of that state, to supply any undertakings required. Why did this happen? It derives from the fact that in some countries all prosecutions are carried out by judicial figures. Judicial figures are, therefore, given the function in civil law countries of giving requisite undertakings. In common law countries, in particular the United Kingdom and Ireland, the request is made by a judge, but a judge is not in a position to start issuing undertakings. We came across a case where there was considerable doubt about whether a UK judge was in a position to give the Irish State undertakings. It is much more appropriate that the UK Executive or Director of Public Prosecutions gives such undertakings rather than a judge who is not in a position to do so.</p>

They never seem to understand there is a different system in at least four or five jurisdictions of the European Union where the judges are arbitral and not investigating magistrates. The arrest warrant procedure implied that the judge issuing the warrant was in a position to give undertakings on behalf of the requesting state. Irish and English judges are not in a position to issue undertakings on behalf of the state. Their function is independent of the state and they do not give undertakings. In the common law system judges are arbitral and independent of the state. They are not bound to do anything except administer justice. They do not give undertakings to other systems. That is where the problem arose. We are doing it now in order that we can say——</p>

          <p eId="para_116">This is not the appropriate place, especially since the Minister has indicated there will be additional amendments on Report Stage. We all know what happens to amendments on Report Stage. In the run up to Christmas we usually do not get to them because of the use of the guillotine. I hope the Minister will be able to persuade the Chief Whip that there will be no guillotine on Report Stage. We can then reach this section which should have been the subject of a stand-alone Bill. It is a source of concern that only one year after passing the European Arrest Warrant Bill 2003 we are back substantially changing it with seven pages of amendments. Most spokespersons have shown a willingness to work with the Minister when required on Bills, even though we may not necessarily agree with him.</p>

The least the Minister should do in the circumstances is present us with an explanatory memorandum on the new items forming a package of proposals. I have a difficulty with the European arrest warrant being incorporated into terrorist legislation, with which it is out of kilter, even though there is a common element. However, that is not what the European arrest warrant is all about. It is about the pursuit of offences across territories, not specifically terrorist offences. Where the Minister is seeking to be facilitated with a miscellaneous provisions element, it is appropriate that we should have an explanatory memorandum.</p>

          <p eId="para_121">Section 46 provides for arrest on the grounds of urgency based on an alert on the Schengen information system. Subsection (10) defines what is a Schengen alert. It is being reorganised to overcome certain discrepancies in the drafting of the section. However, the main issue being addressed arises in the context of the new paragraph (<i>a</i>)(ii) of subsection (10) which refers to a statement being made in writing under section 11(3) by the judicial authority. Like previous amendments to section 11, it will now be possible to request such statements from either the issuing judicial authority or another agency of the issuing state. In the case of the United Kingdom, in particular, the judicial authority will not have to provide this material.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">Section 66 deals with section 15 of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, cases where the person consents to being surrendered. In such cases the High Court makes a surrender order, but subsection (3) provides that execution of the order must be delayed for ten days. This provision was inserted to allow for the possibility of revocation of consent by the requested person. However, a recent case demonstrated that some persons who consent to surrender may wish to return to the issuing state immediately without having to wait ten days in custody in the State. Effectively, we want to allow people to waive the mandatory waiting period provided for, where they are so advised.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">Section 48 concerns section 16 of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003. Subsections (1) and (2) of section 16 provide for the making of an order by the High Court that the person be surrendered on such date as is fixed by section 13 or section 14, as the case may be. The reference to the fixingof a date was intended to refer to the provisions of section 13(5)(<i>b</i>) and section 14(7)(<i>b</i>). These subsections provide that, on his or her first court appearance after arrest, the High Court must fix a date for the surrender hearing. This date must be not later than 21 days after the date of the person’s arrest. While the hearing should begin by that date, it may not necessarily be concluded on that day. However, it is felt that the references to the hearing date in subsections (1) and (2) of section 16 could be construed as meaning that the hearing must be concluded on day 21. It is, therefore, proposed to remove any doubt about the powers of the court to adjourn a hearing. This effectively allows the High Court to adjourn a surrender hearing in order to take its time on the issue, as appropriate, and to remove the possibility that someone will state it must do so on the day or not at all. Amendment No. 49 relates to section 20, which provides that the High Court or the central authority if they are of the opinion that documentation is not provided by the requesting state or is not sufficient, may require the issuing judicial authority to provide it with additional information within specified time frames.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">The same problem arises in Britain, whereby the issuing judicial authority, for example a magistrate in Bermondsey, might not be in a position to provide additional material. In that case, it must be the prosecuting authority. Either the British Government or the DPP in Britain, or whoever, appoints the competent authority. This also applies to Scotland, Malta, Cyprus and other countries with gradations of common law judiciary. We must bear these in mind.</p>

          <p eId="para_238">I asked the Attorney General to consider whether we could qualify some of the offences in Schedule 2 by reference to their potential outcomes. I suggested that in keeping with the aims and provenance of the Bill, it might be appropriate to include a provision to ensure that relatively minor offences against property should not be deemed terrorist offences, namely those which did not endanger human life or cause extensive destruction resulting in major economic loss. The office of the Attorney General doubted whether minor acts would be prosecuted as a terrorist offence. For an act to be offence under the Bill, terrorist intent must be involved. The view was that it was not worth the effort trying to create gradations of seriousness, because in reality such prosecutions would not happen. The Attorney General will have a function in respect of offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">The phrase "significant or widespread damage" is vague. What constitutes significant damage? Is breaking a window significant? Is breaking a plate glass window in a shop significant? Is breaking all the windows in an office block significant?</p>
