            <p eId="para_2">1. <b>Deputy Dara Calleary</b> asked the <b>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</b> his views on whether budget changes to illness benefit will increase the burden on business, cost jobs and is contrary to the spirit of the Action Plan on Jobs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  [50552/13]</p>

          <speech by="#RichardBruton" as="#Minister_for_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">As the Deputy is aware, responsibility for the illness benefit scheme rests with the Minister for Social Protection. The benefit is paid to employees who are unable to work due to illness and who meet certain qualifying conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> Changes to the illness benefit scheme announced in budget 2014 mean that the number of days that a person must wait before receiving illness benefit from the Department of Social Protection is being increased from three days to six days. This change will come into effect from 6 January 2014. There will be no reduction in the basic rate of illness benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> It is of course open to business to offer sick pay cover which exceeds that provided by the Department of Social Protection, and some employers do. It is a matter for employers and workers in these companies as to how they will alter cover in their schemes in response to this change.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> Social Protection expenditure remains the largest single area of public spending, accounting for almost 40% of gross current expenditure. As the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform pointed out in his budget speech, this area of expenditure cannot be excluded from savings in the context of the need to balance public expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_7"> The change being introduced to the illness benefit scheme represents a small adjustment that was considered appropriate to contribute to the social welfare savings that have to be found in 2014. The change must also be seen in the context of a reforming budget that included a €500 million stimulus package to support enterprise growth and job creation. This package includes a capital stimulus plan, the retention of the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector, the introduction of a home renovations tax incentive, a new start your own business scheme for the unemployed, and an increase in the cash receipts threshold for VAT which will improve cashflow for businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_8"> The pro-jobs measures in budget 2014 will allow us to continue to deliver the Action Plan for Jobs process. From my own Department’s perspective, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are targeting the creation of a total of 24,000 gross new jobs during 2014.</p>

            <p eId="para_9">I thank the Minister for his reply. I am well aware that this scheme is the responsibility of Minister, Deputy Burton, as are small businesses throughout the country because this is the third budget in a row in which she has specifically gone after small businesses. We have had redundancy rebate changes, the change to the sick pay scheme and the increase in employer's PRSI with the so-called jobs budget rate increasing from 4.5% to 8.5%. Collectively, they have been a huge hit on small businesses. We had very successful Central Statistics Office figures published yesterday, which I acknowledged at a committee last night, but they are coming from small businesses that are creating the jobs on the ground. They are using the chances that have been given to them. The Minister, Deputy Burton, in particular, seems determined to be some sort of Dick Turpin-type character in that she keeps coming at them and imposing more charges on them. This is an additional cost to an employer. If an employee who earns €300 a week is off sick for a week, this measure alone will impose an extra €94 on the employer, without touching the employer's PRSI, which will impose a huge burden on employers, and meanwhile the Minister continues to let her do that. We need the Minister to stand up to the Minister, Deputy Burton, in the interests of small business and tell her to get her charities elsewhere.</p>

            <p eId="para_11">I acknowledge the appointment of the Minister of State with responsibility for small business and all the work that has been done, but there is no sense in having a dog that does not bark. The Minister knew that the employers' PRSI rate was going to change and yet this change to sick pay was brought in. The fact that the Minister knew that rate was going to change was another excuse to postpone the change to the sick pack scheme or to find the money from somewhere else because it is a double whammy for small businesses who are still in a very fragile position and do not have the money. There needs to be a whole of Government approach. There will be two major increases on 6 January for small businesses. They are in a very fragile position but nobody seems to be alert to it within government. The Minister needs to be able to stand up to the Minister, Deputy Burton, in particular, and in cases such as this one to defend small businesses against such charges and against her using them to pay for her budget.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_12">The Deputy is wrong about this. The increase from three to six days in this measure is an increase that affects the worker who has to wait six days before he or she can assess social protection benefit. The vast majority of small businesses do not have sick pay schemes of the sort that some larger employers provide.</p>

            <p eId="para_14">Therefore, they will not be affected at all by this scheme, and that should be pointed out. This is not a measure directed in any way at small businesses. It is unfortunate that we have had to reduce sick cover for workers in the way that it has occurred but, against a background of a very difficult economic situation and a need to balance to balance our public books, this is a measure that was the least bad of a range of measures.</p>

            <p eId="para_18">Young people have been the group most seriously affected by the collapse of employment following Ireland’s economic crash. However, youth employment has stabilised in the past year and appears set to start growing as the economic recovery continues. Recent labour market figures published by the CSO indicate that the number of young people under 25 years of age in employment increased by 3,200 in the year to quarter three 2013. The number of young people who are unemployed fell by 13,600 in the past 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> The Government is working to tackle the issue of youth opportunities in the labour market through the combined efforts of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work strategies. The Action Plan for Jobs has sought to bring about a transition in the jobs and enterprise sectors to develop new job opportunities in sustainable sectors and to create 100,000 jobs by 2016. This work will continue vigorously in the coming years. However, it is encouraging to see record growth of jobs in our exporting sectors and signs of progress across a range of sectors. It will be vital to sustain this growth in employment in order to deliver job opportunities to young entrants.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> Through Pathways to Work, the Government has brought in a range of new initiatives to support young people looking for employment such as JobsPlus, JobBridge, Springboard, Momentum, and the ICT action plan, which are delivered by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills. The Government is taking steps to increase the numbers of places and make other enhancements to those schemes where possible. For example, JobBridge has increased from 5,000 places initially to 8,500 places being currently available. The JobsPlus initiative, which is currently available to those who are unemployed for 12 months or more, is being extended from 1 January next to those under the age of 26 who have been unemployed for six months or more.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> My Department, together with Enterprise Ireland, is also examining options for CEB-led initiatives aimed at promoting youth entrepreneurship, including a mix of financial supports for business start-ups, feasibility studies and mentoring. It is also working with the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills to develop the Youth Guarantee, in line with the agreement reached under the Irish Presidency earlier this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_22">I note yesterday's CSO figures, which are encouraging and welcome, but the reality remains that since the Government took up office, 50,000 fewer people are in employment. In the 24 to 35 year old bracket, approximately 19,000 fewer are in employment, although many of them have emigrated. Last year's Action Plan for Jobs contained 333 recommendations but only five related to youth unemployment. Next year's action plan has seven themes, none of which targets youth unemployment. How big a part will the youth guarantee play in next year's action plan? I acknowledge the plan has not been ironed out and the details have not been published, but a significant pot of money is available from Europe to help our young people back into employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_23">The youth guarantee was negotiated under the Irish Presidency. A sum of €3 billion will be provided by the European Social Fund and a new budget line of €3 billion will also be provided. We will submit our plan to the EU by the end of 2013. An interdepartmental group has been set up in this regard comprising the Departments of Social Protection, Education and Skills, Public Expenditure and Reform, Children and Youth Affairs, Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Taoiseach and our Department, and they are all working on the plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> It is important, though, to acknowledge 1,600 jobs a week were being lost in the three years before we took office but now the economy is creating 1,200 jobs per week. Those jobs are being taken up by young people as well. There has been a positive change in employment over the past 12 months.</p>

            <p eId="para_25">The Minister for Social and Protection and the Taoiseach were in Paris recently to discuss the youth guarantee scheme. The Government has mentioned the provision of approximately €200 million for the scheme, but the National Youth Council of Ireland and the International Labour Organization reckon the State needs to invest between €400 million and €435 million to adequately tackle youth unemployment. Approximately €14 million has been set aside next year to target job creation for young people. I do not know what the plan will be because it has not been worked out yet, but there has to be a change in policy when it comes to youth unemployment. The Minister of State mentioned JobBridge. The Minister for Social Protection often refers to a 60% progression rate from the scheme into employment but the progression rate for young teachers is less than 30%. It may be working in some areas but JobBridge and other schemes are not resulting in full-time employment for young people in other areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_28">JobBridge is not the panacea for the teaching profession, but the evidence is that we are creating more teaching jobs through the Department of Education and Skills by virtue of demographic changes with an increase in the birth rate, and the Deputy will acknowledge that many projects are under way to reflect that in our own county of Cork. JobBridge is a labour activation measure, which is having a positive effect on getting people into work. Approximately 500 job matches have been taken up as a result of the JobsPlus scheme. MOMENTUM comprises a €20 million package offering 6,500 training places through 36 education providers in 87 locations. We are conducting a review of apprenticeships because if one looks at where jobs were lost, young people were last in, first out. We need to examine, in particular, how we can upskill those who lost jobs in the construction industry, and that is why have introduced Springboard, the start your own business initiative, and the home renovation scheme, which will have a positive knock-on effect in getting young people back into the workplace. There is a vigorous and robust response to this issue, but I take the Deputy's point about the youth guarantee. The plan is being formulated and we can discuss that when it comes to fruition.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_30">The total value of grants paid by agencies of my Department in the years 2011 to 2013 is €641 million. This comprises €268 million by IDA Ireland, €313 million by Enterprise Ireland, €42 million by the county enterprise boards, and €18 million by InterTradeIreland.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> The total gross number of jobs created in those years assisted by IDA Ireland and EI comes to an estimated 90,000 jobs between 2011 and to date in 2013. The cost per job for IDA Ireland and EI is based on the cost per job sustained over a seven year period. They currently stand at €13,475 for IDA Ireland and €12,597 for EI. The cost per job for the CEBs in 2012 was €6,181, while the cost per job for InterTradeIreland in 2012 was €12,251, although in the latter two cases the calculation is on a different basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> The agencies in my Department are performing very well in a challenging environment. They are driving a vital transition from an economy founded on property to one built on enterprise, exports and innovation. Their impact is measured by the gross job creation in enterprises supported by them, the net job movements across their portfolio as well as numerous agency-specific key performance indicators which are regularly published. I am encouraged by the progress across almost all of these indicators at a time of declining staff in these agencies. </p>
            <p eId="para_33"> These agencies are an integral part of the development and delivery of Action Plan for Jobs. They are driving an export-led recovery through work in the marketplace and an increased number of trade and investment missions. The boards of the agencies have put in significant effort in steering these agencies through this transition. They bring insights from relevant backgrounds and, in replacing members, I seek people who will supplement the capacity of the respective agency.</p>

            <p eId="para_34">I thank the Minister for his reply. I would like to say "Well done" on yesterday's CSO figures. While they are a photograph of a point in time, they are an improvement and that should be acknowledged.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> The reason I asked for these data is I am doubtful about the role played by these State agencies and it is difficult to say whether the assistance they give creates jobs. We know they exist and the jobs are created, but the cause and effect are difficult to prove and the cost per job is still high.</p>
            <p eId="para_36">I accept the figures the Minister has given and I am grateful for them. Some years ago when the Minister was in opposition he made a most perceptive speech at the MacGill summer school saying that when Fine Gael came to power it would get rid of the boards of all the quangos. I do not make a political point; it is more of a political plea. It was a very good idea. I no longer expect, in the light of what has happened and following statements made by Ministers, any Minister to keep a promise but I would like to know if the Minister still holds that view. He said that significant insights have been made on the performance of the semi-State bodies of which he is in charge.</p>

            <p eId="para_37">I thank Deputy Ross for acknowledging the progress made on the employment front. It is always difficult to discern cause and effect but there is no doubt that IDA Ireland, for example, is deemed internationally to be one of the most effective agencies at delivering employment opportunities in a very competitive environment for foreign direct investment. Equally, following the collapse the challenge for Enterprise Ireland was significant in terms of picking up small Irish-owned businesses and bringing them into export markets. Against that background, at a cost per job of €13,000, we know that each year a person is taken off the live register the Exchequer gets €20,000. If those jobs are sustained there is a clear benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> The paper to which the Deputy referred was one in which I spoke about virtually all of government and how public service reform could be introduced. I suggested that over time new governments should consider replacing boards after a period had elapsed. I did not in any way indicate a promise on behalf of Fine Gael. If the Deputy reads the speech he will see there are many other suggestions about how we could improve. As Deputy Ross is aware, statutes set out the way in which boards are replaced, which is typically two per year, and that is the basis on which I work.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">I can understand why he has interpreted it in that way at this stage of his career. The Minister inherited quangos with State-appointed boards and directors from the previous Government. To be charitable, the Minister promised a great deal of reform of the boards. That has not happened. The boards are large. The average number of directors on the boards of which the Minister is in charge is more than ten by my latest count, nearly all of whom are paid. There are some extraordinary anomalies. Why in the name of God does the board of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, for instance, have 15 people when the board of IDA Ireland, for which the Minister has so much praise has, perhaps rightly, only 11?</p>

The boards are quality boards delivering a quality service. One could equally say that of various other boards. By and large board members are there for the right reasons. Perhaps that is not the case all the time but we are very careful. We advertise board vacancies and try to get the best talent available.</p>

            <p eId="para_49">The establishment of the development capital scheme is an innovative initiative under the Action Plan for Jobs and has the objective of increasing the availability of risk capital and closing the ‘equity gap’ experienced by SMEs seeking risk capital in the region of €2 million to €12 million. That has been identified by Enterprise Ireland as an obstacle to Irish companies growing to scale, which is a central aim of enterprise policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> A total of €75 million in funding has been made available through my Department for the development capital scheme with the aim of leveraging a minimum total of €150 million in additional funding from the private sector. Enterprise Ireland has arranged competitive calls for partners in three separate funds. The funding partners are selected based on sectoral expertise, track record and supporting networks which they bring to the funds. Under the scheme, commitments were made to the three funds that will provide equity, quasi equity or debt of between €2 million and €12 million to established investee companies. On 4 November 2013 I announced the establishment of the first of those funds of €125 million which will be managed by MML Growth Capital Partners Ireland. The leverage of private sector moneys at €100 million is very encouraging. A further two funds will be announced in the near term.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> Each of the funds established under the development capital scheme is aimed at providing funding for the mid-sized, mostly export-oriented businesses with clear growth and development prospects. The MML fund is a general fund which has no particular sectoral focus. It will target investment opportunities in a wide variety of growth-orientated sectors including manufacturing, technology, engineering, food, life sciences, services and electronics. Enterprise Ireland invests in these funds on the same terms as the private sector. The investment managers are responsible for making investment decisions within a clearly defined investment strategy over the lifetime of the fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> I look forward to seeing investment in Irish companies in the near term. I am confident the State’s investment in the development capital scheme will be fully utilised, given Enterprise Ireland’s engagement with the seed and venture capital sector which goes back almost two decades and has been very successful in assisting the growth of high potential start-ups, HPSUs, attracting leveraged funds, bringing top level managers to Ireland and attracting interesting first-time international money to the Irish SME market.</p>

            <p eId="para_53">The difficulty I have with the scheme is that the rationale and rhetoric sounds great but when will it hit the street? When will companies that need the finance get it from the development capital scheme? All of the initiatives the Minister has taken are announced in a blaze of glory but the practicalities on the street are minimal. In the first year of its existence the microenterprise loan fund has lent just €1.62 million. The target the Minister has set is that it will create 7,500 jobs by 2022. We have just dealt with the seed and venture capital fund. The credit guarantee scheme is way under target, as is the SME credit fund. ISME’s survey indicated that up to the end of September 57% of respondents had been turned down. We will later discuss source funding as a potential alternative option. There is still huge difficulty for SMEs to get money to ride the wave of growth that exists. If the Minister wants to continue with the figures we saw yesterday this has to be his No. 1 priority in terms of resolving the issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_54">To reassure the Deputy, the MML fund is fully subscribed. The fund has a total of €125 million. Two managers have been appointed in this country who are now in a position to enter into agreements with companies who have ambitious growth plans. The need for such investment has been identified by Enterprise Ireland. Companies that are not in the gazelle league favoured by venture capitalists, that are solid companies with growth markets, have found it difficult to get funding. The fund will fulfil the need they have. The fund has hit the street and is available to be drawn down. These are the very sectors in which we are seeing significant performance. The food sector is doing exceptionally well. Technology is doing very well. Life sciences are doing well. This is a good opportunity as the fund has real management expertise as well as money. That is the benefit of the fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> To outline Enterprise Ireland’s track record, last year the seed and venture capital scheme funded 140 new companies at a cost of €80 million. There is a track record of the funds delivering for companies.</p>

            <p eId="para_56">I do not doubt Enterprise Ireland’s track record. It is superb. Microfinance Ireland, MFI, attended the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation a few weeks ago. Every Member should look at the presentation it gave and the information it has for companies. It has a difficulty in terms of getting its message out. I suggested to the Minister previously that it would use the Revenue database as it has the best database for business in the country for whatever reason. The database must be used to get information. What happens in the case of companies that are not in one of the growth areas?</p>
            <p eId="para_57">That is the difficulty. There are many solid companies trading in the domestic market that do not fit into the areas for which the measures are being announced and they cannot get finance. They are the respondents to the ISME survey who still, in September 2013, five years into the crisis, cannot get credit for viable businesses. As well as focusing on the sexy, gazelle type companies, we need to focus our efforts on the day to day companies that employ people and keep their local economies going. They need help too.</p>

            <p eId="para_58">Enterprise Ireland has a mandate that is focused on export oriented companies. The skill we bring in for these companies, for example, is in people who have the capacity to enter new markets. The scheme is aimed predominantly at export oriented companies. We have large numbers of companies with great growth capacity and these are well spread throughout the regions, in the areas of food, engineering, manufacturing and so on. These are the backbone of our industrial base and this is a gap that needs to be filled. I believe the view of manufacturing, which has been dismissive in recent years, has been misplaced. There are opportunities now as Ireland is more competitive. This is a fund that will help bridge a gap which has been well identified by research. I am optimistic this scheme will hit its target and we will closely monitor it. I accept the points made and there will be initiatives to improve information flow. I have met with both the banks and there will be a communications initiative around the various financial options for SMEs.</p>

            <p eId="para_60">I am informed by IDA Ireland that the agency does not have any units or warehouses, which are vacant in County Kerry. Enterprise Ireland does not have a property portfolio as IDA Ireland provides property solutions to Enterprise Ireland clients when required. The responsibility for local authority properties lies with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> The property to which the Deputy refers is not in the ownership of IDA Ireland. I understand from IDA Ireland that the premises itself was formerly a manufacturing facility and the options for the building in its current format are limited. I am informed that Killarney Town Council is assessing what options may be available for the building, including converting it into an enterprise centre. Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have assured me that they are available to provide any assistance that may be required. </p>
            <p eId="para_62"> IDA Ireland owns approximately ten acres of land at the IDA business and technology park, Killarney, which is available for marketing to both overseas and indigenous industry. In addition, the agency has approximately two acres of land at the IDA estate in Killorglin and 1.41 acres in Annascaul, which is also available for marketing.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and client companies employ in excess of 4,900 people across County Kerry, while Kerry county enterprise board has processed 37 projects during 2013 which have the capacity to generate 116 full-time and 53 part-time jobs by 2015. Enterprise Ireland activity in Kerry is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs to set up new high potential start-up companies. There are 132 Enterprise Ireland client companies in the county, employing 3,318 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_64">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_65">There are 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry with total employment of approximately 1,600<b>
							</b>people.<i>
							</i>IDA Ireland engages with these companies on an ongoing basis and the key areas of focus are to encourage operational sustainability, job retention and, in certain cases, expansion. IDA Ireland also endorses and supports the initiatives driven under the Succeed in Ireland agenda which also engages key stakeholders in the regions regarding opportunities for investment. Additionally, the existing base of overseas companies located in Kerry brings spin off benefits right across the south-west region through direct and indirect employment, for example, indigenous suppliers, logistics, security, catering companies, etc. The Action Plan for Jobs can benefit enterprises in Kerry. For example, the county would particularly benefit from initiatives that have been targeted at supporting the tourism and agrifood sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> Many of the initiatives in the Action Plan for Jobs will also be very relevant to enterprise in Kerry. These include the introduction of new financing models for SMEs, such as the microfinance fund for start-ups and the temporary partial credit guarantee scheme; the development of an integrated first stop shop for small enterprises through local enterprise offices; new schemes to help small businesses recruit via JobBridge, Springboard and MOMENTUM and the introduction of the JobsPlus scheme that provides an employment subsidy of over €70 per week to employers who recruit a person who has been unemployed for 12 months; the appointment of business development managers to 37 community enterprise centres across the country as part of a €2 million programme aimed at protecting and growing businesses in the community; and expanded support from Enterprise Ireland for start-ups, first time exporters and the establishment of a first time exporters division.</p>

            <p eId="para_67">I thank the Minister of State for his response. However, the statistics demonstrate that Kerry is the poor relation in the south-west region in regard to job creation by both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in particular. IDA Ireland created almost 4,000 jobs in Cork in 2011 and 2012. In those two years, IDA Ireland created just 163 jobs in County Kerry in 2011 and 74 jobs in 2012, a total of 237 jobs. In those two years, Enterprise Ireland created almost 2,000 jobs in Cork in 2011 and 1,700 jobs in 2012. In comparison, it created 232 jobs in County Kerry in 2011 and 194 jobs in 2012. This is a ludicrous position for a peripheral county in comparison to the neighbouring counties in the region. How does the Minister of State intend to address this.</p>

            <p eId="para_68">The Deputy mentioned County Cork. From the intercounty perspective, there are strong pharmaceutical and ICT sectors in Cork. The Deputy said IDA Ireland had created 163 jobs in 2011 in Kerry. However, it is not IDA Ireland but the companies that come in and conduct site visits which make the final decision as to where they will locate their business. Perhaps we could explore further the dynamic that exists in regard to the number of prospective companies or creators of employment, the number of site visits that take place and the analysis of the visits in terms of the decisions they make as to where to locate their business.</p>

            <p eId="para_69">Over the past two years in particular we could count on one hand the number of IDA Ireland-led investment visits to County Kerry. Such visitors to the county are almost as scarce as the corncrake, which is almost extinct. This is a ridiculous record. IDA Ireland has utterly failed County Kerry. I believe it is time for the Government to step in. We are basically on a par with the south east, where there is a jobs plan in place to deal with the crisis situation there. We have an unemployment rate of almost 20% in County Kerry and but for the tourism industry, much of which involves part-time jobs, it would be higher. I compliment all of those involved in the retention of the VAT rate for that sector. We need sustainable jobs and I call on the Minister and Minister of State to promote some activity to help the county.</p>

            <p eId="para_70">The Deputy mentioned the tourism sector and there has been significant investment by State agencies, such as Fáilte Ireland, to ensure the tourism package in County Kerry is maintained. This supports and creates jobs. The recent decision by the Government to retain the VAT rate for the sector has had a significant impact in terms of job creation and the maintenance of the sector in the Kerry region.</p>
            <p eId="para_71"> The story is not all bleak in County Kerry. The IT in Tralee has a major competence centre and there has been serious investment in companies like Dairymaster, which is seen as an exemplar for the agrifood and business sector. Also, through the centre for intelligent mechatronics and sensors at the Institute of Technology Tralee, ITT, and through the Kerry technology park, there is a strong emphasis and mood towards supporting high potential start-ups and towards ensuring we can concentrate on areas where Kerry has strong sectoral comparative advantages, particularly in the dairy or machinery sector. We will continue those investments. Enterprise Ireland, through the Department, is investing in the competence centre in ITT and that will create jobs in the long term.</p>

            <p eId="para_74">Crowdfunding, in respect of enterprise and other activities, is becoming an ever more popular alternative mechanism for businesses and promoters across the globe to access finance in a difficult financial market. In its various forms, crowdfunding allows individuals, businesses and promoters to solicit capital from funders, using social networks and crowdfunding platforms to finance projects. It appears to be affording real opportunities in the area of alternative finance for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs. Use of the mechanism appears to have seen substantial growth globally in the recent past, and it is seen by many sponsors as a means of democratising access to funds and supply of capital while moving the model away from venture capitalists and angel investors.</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has met a crowdfunding company, Linked Finance, to explore the potential for this new source of funding in an Irish context. In addition, as part of a process of exploring new approaches for improving access to finance, departmental officials have engaged at EU level and the small business advisory group has considered crowdfunding and alternative access to finance models.</p>
            <p eId="para_76"> Crowdfunding is in its infancy and financial returns on capital will dictate its overall success. Data are not readily available domestically, at EU level or internationally with which to analyse its impact to date, although moves are afoot at EU level to consider methods to address this data deficiency. The issues of consumer protection and regulation also exercise many countries operating in this space. Decisions are only beginning to be taken in respect of these key elements of this novel way of funding enterprises. The Government, through the State bodies group chaired by the Department of Finance, is keeping the issue under review as to how best to utilise crowdfunding benefits to promote business development.</p>
            <p eId="para_77">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_78"> In terms of supporting access to various forms of financing, substantial funding has been provided by the Government and my Department is actively engaged in various initiatives. For example, my Department provides funding for the HALO business angel partnership, HBAP, through Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland. This partnership provides investment for start-ups and has recently broken a €55 million total investment milestone in 128 deals since the organisation was founded six years ago. In total, €23 million has been invested by angel investors brought to the table by the national HBAP organisation over the past six years. The balance of €32.5 million was committed by seed funds, Enterprise Ireland and other private investors. HALO also works to develop business angel syndicates. Up to 60% of all angel funding in Ireland is coming through individuals, with syndicate groups making up a healthy 40%.</p>
            <p eId="para_79"> My Department has also funded the seed and venture capital scheme 2013-2017 through Enterprise Ireland, which will make commitments totalling €175 million to business during the operation of the scheme. This commitment is expected to leverage a further €525 million in private sector funding. Considerable effort has been put into addressing the seed and early stage funding gap indirectly through commitments to venture capital funds and directly through Enterprise Ireland's investment in the early stage competitive start fund and high potential start-up companies in 2012. Further Government supports include the seed capital scheme, SCS, and the employment and investment incentive scheme, EIIS, which are tax relief incentives for businesses provided by the Revenue Commissioners.</p>

            <p eId="para_80">Linked Finance has brokered €1 million in lending after just six months. The UK Government has pledged to give £20 million to the UK's Funding Circle. It is willing to take a punt and has put necessary regulation in place for this sector. Crowdfunding is a solution for new start-up companies in areas where traditional lending methods have failed or will not take a risk. We discussed this last night with the Minister. The problem is we will be waiting for the EU to respond to this matter while companies looking for this kind of funding will give up and move to the UK where the funding is available. It must be remembered that funding is available in the northern part of this island. Will the Minister take a punt on crowdfunding and put regulations in place to ensure investment is protected rather than wait for an EU response in 2016 when the ship will have sailed?</p>

            <p eId="para_81">I take the Deputy’s point. Linked Finance has made presentations to the State bodies group. We are aware of the possibilities of this potential source of funding. We are also aware of the UK initiative through Funding Circle and its £20 million pot. As it is a lending and investment model, we need to examine the tax implications, returns on investment and regulation. We have the seed and venture capital scheme, the HALO business angel partnership. These are other sources of funding which the State provides through its agencies. We are tracking this issue and will be proactive on the matter.</p>

It is a live issue as a way of providing new forms of financing for enterprises and start-up companies. It is necessary to examine the regulatory and taxation regime as well as the permutations for the people taking the punt, as Deputy Calleary said, to ensure it is robust and they will not be caught out by this. An exemption on profits is also being examined.</p>

            <p eId="para_85">According to the bodies concerned, the main objective of the TTIP is to remove as many trade barriers as possible to ensure the freedom of movement of trade and investment, the argument being that there are too many regulatory systems on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Commission claims the agreement will lead to savings of moneys and jobs. One concerning aspect of the agreement is the power it will give to transnational corporations to sue national governments for what they see as potential infringements of their intellectual property, effectively overriding the laws of nations in the interests of capital.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T10:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_86">The Deputy introduced a new matter that was not in his original question. The mandate given to the European Commission, the negotiator for the EU in the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, negotiations is a broad-ranging one. It builds on the outcome of the work of the EU-US high level group that recommended that negotiations on a comprehensive trade and investment agreement between the EU and the US should aim to achieve ambitious outcomes in three broad areas, namely, market access, tariffs and quotas, regulatory and non-tariff barriers, and rules addressing shared global trade challenges and opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_87"> Regulatory differences can represent unnecessary barriers to trade. Reducing such barriers to trade will be one of the most important ways TTIP will help to achieve the expected economic benefits from an agreement. Studies suggest that between two thirds and four fifths of the gains would come from reducing unnecessary administrative burdens, as well as having more co-ordination between regulators. A simple example would be a pharmaceutical product having to be clinically trialed in both the EU and the US, creating an unnecessary cost. Mutual recognition would be a significant gain in this regard. Closer co-operation between EU and US regulators should make regulation more effective and efficient and, for example, should reduce costs for business and regulators by eliminating unnecessary duplication of inspections.</p>
            <p eId="para_88"> Agreeing common standards may encourage other countries to bring their standards up too. This has the potential to lessen trade barriers internationally and increase the opportunities for greater international trade and investment, just what the world economy needs right now. Reducing barriers does not mean reducing standards, rather it means finding ways to achieve our legitimate public policy objectives, be they food safety, product safety, chemicals usage, environmental or worker health and safety, without maintaining or creating artificial and unnecessary trade barriers.</p>
            <p eId="para_89"> According to assessments made by the European Commission and other European bodies, a comprehensive partnership could, over time, boost EU gross domestic product, GDP, by 0.5% per annum and help create approximately 400,000 jobs in the EU. Based on those assessments, if Ireland simply benefited in proportion to the size of our economy, a comprehensive trade and investment partnership could, over time, provide gains to Ireland in excess of €800 million per annum in increased GDP and 4,000 new jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_90">While I do not have a problem with free trade or the free movement of goods and people, there is a bit more to this agreement than that. For example, it will allow corporations to sue governments when they are trying to protect their citizens from their activities. It allows a secretive panel of corporate lawyers to overrule the will of national parliaments and the legal protections in place through the mechanism of the investor-state dispute settlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">Before this agreement is settled, will there be a vote on it in the European Parliament or will it come to this House before we sign up to it? It has serious implications for citizens.</p>

            <p eId="para_92">Agreements of this nature have to come back for ratification. The European Commission is mandated to negotiate on behalf of the governments but the deal must be agreed in the end by the governments. We have a common market in the EU so if we are negotiating rules with other markets, it is appropriate that the Commission would conduct the negotiation. If legally binding agreements are put in place and some institution refuses to respect them a company would have a right of redress against a failure to honour an agreement that has been signed. The investor-state dispute settlement is a separate issue, and if Deputy Wallace tables a separate parliamentary question one I could give him chapter and verse on it. We do not have these investor dispute settlements in Ireland and we have not used them.</p>

            <p eId="para_93">Recently WikiLeaks leaked information on the trans-Pacific trade agreement, which has much of the same mechanism involved in it. That agreement was found to be as much about extending monopoly rights of companies such as Monsanto rather than free trade. Of 29 chapters in that agreement, only five related to trade. There was much more concentration on patents, copyrights, trade marks and industrial design, which has serious implications for Internet service, civil liberties, publishing rights and accessibility to medicine. This idea that we may create a forum where corporations have the ability to sue states is a bad direction in which to go and should not be tolerated. It gives far too much power to corporations, undermines democracy and significantly erodes citizens rights.</p>

            <p eId="para_94">Corporations always have the right to sue states. There is nothing innovative about that. If an international agreement gives certain terms of access, a corporation is entitled to see that parties which have contracted to that agreement would respect that. As I said in my reply, this in no way seeks to change the legal protections the EU has in any area, whether in food, intellectual property or data rights protection. Those will be issues of considerable difference in negotiation on intellectual property rights. The US has a different approach from the EU. This does not seek for the EU to give up its approach but to remove unnecessary trade barriers that, given the agreed approaches to food safety or intellectual property, would interfere with trade, while respecting the rules in each country. This is not to try to harmonise rules. It is to respect rules but not to have barriers to prevent trade given the rules that exist in other countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_99">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 22 together. </p>
            <p eId="para_100"> Enterprise Ireland runs many initiatives to help sustain existing jobs and to create new jobs in the county and provides funding to the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny to build research capabilities in County Donegal and the north west region. There are 180 Enterprise Ireland client companies in County Donegal employing 2,655 people on a full-time basis and 706 people on a contract or part-time basis. Donegal’s industry base is transforming from the clothing and textile industry to high-tech, high-skill activity and IDA Ireland actively promotes County Donegal as a successful location for high-end manufacturing.</p>
            <p eId="para_101"> There are 14 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Donegal employing 2,228 people in full- and part-time employment in software development, systems development and medical technology. IDA Ireland also actively engages with its existing base of companies in County Donegal, highlighting the ongoing importance of upskilling and reskilling and the need to add high-value activities to ensure sustainability and ongoing development.</p>
            <p eId="para_102"> Donegal County Enterprise Board, CEB, aims to develop indigenous enterprise potential, with the provision of financial and non-financial assistance such as priming grants, business expansion and development grants and feasibility or innovation study grants together with business advice and information services. In 2012, projects supported by Donegal CEB employed 1,578 people on a full-time basis and 856 on a contract or part-time basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_103"> As regards future plans, the new local enterprise offices, LEOs, will draw and build on the successful CEB model. They will be the first-stop-shop through which all information on State supports for small and micro businesses can be accessed and where businesses with clear high-growth potential can be fast-tracked to the next level of support from Enterprise Ireland. This enhanced model is designed to harness the best elements of the enterprise agencies and local government and to support local business and contribute to local development. For the first time, the skills, experience and resources of Enterprise Ireland, the CEBs and the local authorities will be combined in a structured and coherent manner to benefit micro and small businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_104">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_105"> I am currently preparing the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government and we will continue, through that process, to build on the success of the actions we have taken in the past two years. At a macro level the Government’s strategy is to re-build the economy and accelerate the transition to a sustainable, jobs-rich economy based on enterprise, innovation and exports. Thus will we create the environment in which sustainable jobs will be created, living standards will be raised and Ireland will be regarded as an attractive location in which to live and work.</p>
            <p eId="para_106"> My Department’s focus is primarily on employment creation in the enterprise sector. We are doing this through the action plan for jobs and have already seen the positive results of the action being taken across the whole of Government to support the enterprise sector to sustain existing jobs and create new ones. The enterprise development agencies, under my Department, are at the forefront of implementing the action plan for jobs.</p>

            <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_107">I asked the Minister specifically for the specific projects he has planned for County Donegal under Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016. The Minister is spending approximately €500 million in capital under that programme in the coming years. He made no reference to any project in his answer. He barely referred to the capital investment plan. With due respect, all I got was a load of waffle on the specifics of the question I asked. Could the Minister give me clear answers to my question? What specific projects, if any, does he plan for Donegal under the capital investment plan for 2012 to 2016? If he cannot tell me of any, am I to take it that there are none planned?</p>
            <p eId="para_108"> There are three projects in particular on which I want an answer: the Letterkenny to Lifford link and the A5 dual carriageway; the Bunnagee link in Letterkenny, linking the east side of the town to the Milford area; and the Corkhill bridge in Buncrana. Those three projects are ready to go. Are there any plans on those? Does the Minister propose to spend any of the budget in County Donegal?</p>

            <p eId="para_109">Deputy McConalogue has a total misunderstanding of the purpose of the capital budget allocated to my Department. It is to support enterprises that are growing. It is not available for road projects, which would have to be funded by other Departments. Perhaps the Deputy would direct his question to those Departments. We support Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland companies and micro-companies in their development. Last year we saw a 25% increase in two years in the number of people employed in IDA Ireland companies in County Donegal. That is a very significant commitment of additional resource by my Department to expand employment opportunities in IDA Ireland-sponsored companies. The proposals for enterprise development come from companies visiting and choosing to locate or grow, or Irish-owned companies starting up or developing. Those are the main vehicles for capital allocation spending from my Department. A significant portion will go to Donegal.</p>

            <p eId="para_110">The Minister has a plan for 2012 to 2016. It is the capital infrastructure development plan. I am well aware that other Departments are involved in road projects but I am putting those as three specific projects that could help create jobs. I have asked the Minister if there is anything in his plan that could assist the county.</p>
            <p eId="para_111">So far, all we have got from the Minister is generalities. Apart from generalities, what specifically does he plan to do to aid job creation in the county? </p>

            <p eId="para_112">The truth is I cannot build roads. I do not have the authority to do so nor can I fund the building of roads. While I am sure there is great merit in the Deputy's proposal, I am not the Minister to do it but I can support enterprises. We have 14 IDA Ireland and 180 Enterprise Ireland companies in County Donegal. We will approach those companies in the coming year to see what their plans are for development. IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will work to help those companies to develop business plans which can realise employment growth in the future. That is what the money we will allocate will be used for.</p>
            <p eId="para_113"> We will also set up the local enterprise network in County Donegal. It is a new collaborative approach between Donegal County Council, the existing enterprise board and Enterprise Ireland. Those are initiatives we will take to help grow new businesses in County Donegal. That is what my capital allocation is used for, and yesterday's results show the impact of that. We have 58,000 extra people working in this country which includes a substantial increase of almost 10,000 in the north west. The work we are doing is having an impact on the Deputy's region as well as on every other region in this country. He must, however, address infrastructural issues of a wider nature to the Ministers responsible.</p>

          <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_60" as="#Minister_for_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation">
            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_116">The Forfás annual employment survey reports on job gains and losses in companies supported by the industrial development agencies. Data are compiled on an annualised basis and is aggregated at county level. Figures for 2013 will not be available until the end of the year. In the two-year period, 2010 to 2012, inclusive, the total employment numbers in IDA Ireland client companies in Donegal increased from 1,633 in 2010 to 2,228 in 2012, an increase of more than 25%. Increasing the FDI employment level over the period against the current global economic climate reflects positively on the importance and resilience of IDA Ireland's client companies in Donegal.</p>
            <p eId="para_117"> In 2013, IDA Ireland has had a good flow of site visits to the county by prospective investors. There are 14 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Donegal employing 2,228 people in full-time and part-time employment in software development, systems development and medical technology. Companies, such as Pramerica and UnitedHealth - PacifiCare - which have located in County Donegal are continuously growing and recruiting. Current full-time employment for the three largest employers in Letterkenny, namely Pramerica, UnitedHealth - PacifiCare - and Zeus is 1,495 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_118"> County Donegal's industry base is transforming and it is a successful location for high-end manufacturing, mainly to companies in the medical technologies sector. IDA Ireland actively engages with its existing base of companies in Donegal, highlighting the ongoing importance of upskilling and reskilling and the need to add high value activities in order to ensure sustainability and ongoing development. </p>
            <p eId="para_119"> Another focus for IDA Ireland in County Donegal is the designated linked gateway of Letterkenny-Derry. This focus involves developing stronger economic links with Invest Northern Ireland, which includes initiatives like the north west business and technology zone, NWBTZ. This zone is aimed at promoting the linked gateway of Letterkenny-Derry in line with the Northern Ireland regional development strategy 2025.</p>
            <p eId="para_120"> Northern Ireland Science Park's plans to establish a satellite campus in the linked Letterkenny-Derry gateway at Letterkenny Institute of Technology CoLab and Fort George in Derry is a further positive development and will assist in the marketing of the location.</p>

            </p>
            <p eId="para_122"> Other positive developments include the delivery of project Kelvin to Letterkenny. Project Kelvin is a joint initiative between the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation in Northern Ireland to supply a direct international telecoms connectivity project under the INTERREG IV programme 2007-2013. The project provides a direct international telecoms link from the north west of Ireland to North America via an onshore link to the existing transatlantic submarine telecoms cable. This service enables Letterkenny to have access to the same international services as found in major cities worldwide. Prices are commercially attractive and are benchmarked against international locations with 20% reductions. The pricing mechanism will remain in place until 2018.</p>

            <p eId="para_123">I welcome the fact we are seeing an increase in the number of jobs created at national level. The 58,000 jobs created in the past year are very welcome. That is the way we all want to see our country move. We want to see more people getting back to work but since 2011, we have seen unemployment grow in the Border region. The figures out yesterday show that in the Border region, unemployment has gone from 14.6% to 15.2%.</p>
            <p eId="para_124"> In regard to the jobs created last year, is the Minister in a position to give a breakdown of how many of them were in County Donegal? The Minister indicated in his reply that the jobs created in County Donegal were in existing IDA Ireland companies. That shows the potential of County Donegal and of companies which have set up there to grow. However, under this Government the story of new IDA Ireland companies coming to County Donegal has been very poor. We are not getting our share of the new investments. In regard to new investments, what has been the performance of the Government since it took office?</p>

            <p eId="para_125">As I said, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland numbers are collected by way of a survey of those companies and they will not be available until later in the year. The survey results from the CSO, which has nothing to do with my Department but which were published yesterday, cover groups of counties. It does not break it down by county. However, the Border region, which includes County Donegal, saw an increase of 9,500 people at work, which is a considerable reversal of previous trends. In the previous 12 months, figures showed a decline of more than 12,000. The trend in the Border region has been very significantly turned around in the past 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_126"> IDA Ireland seeks to continuously develop new and existing business. Approximately 70% of all IDA projects come from expansions. The Letterkenny Institute of Technology has been particularly successful in building an interconnection with those companies I mentioned, namely, Pramerica, UnitedHealth and Zeus, and they have been continually expanding, which is encouraging. </p>
            <p eId="para_127"> There has also been an encouraging flow of site visits which is the lead indicator of new projects coming to County Donegal. It is an area which has considerable potential and I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to work on it. It has been helped by project Kelvin which, effectively, gives not only competitive but international telecom links which are as good as anywhere in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_128">The encouraging stream of site visits by IDA Ireland to the county, to which the Minister referred, was a total of one in 2012. There have been four visits this year. Unfortunately, under his leadership, there have been very few site visits and little new investment in the county. The Minister pointed out that companies there continue to expand but those companies are already there. We need to get our share new investment. The Government committed to 50% of that being outside the Dublin and Cork areas but we are not seeing it in our county.</p>
            <p eId="para_129"> The one key thing the Minister has done since coming to office is that the Letterkenny IDA Ireland office, which used to be the hub for the north west in terms of attracting new investments, has been moved from there, which has been detrimental. Will the Minister up the performance? We need to see a fair share of new investments coming to the county as well as depending on those 14 IDA companies to expand their job numbers.</p>

            <p eId="para_130">The Deputy was a member of the party which was in government previously. We have secured a 25% increase in the number of people working in IDA Ireland companies in the past two years. That contrasts with the situation under the previous regime of a reduction of approximately 33%. This is a strong performance and the Deputy needs to recognise that. I do not think he should be bad-mouthing the efforts of IDA Ireland or the county because the county is doing well and it has a strong infrastructure which we vigorously promote.

            <p eId="para_135">Arising from Budget 2014, the 2014 Exchequer allocation to my Department and the agencies under its aegis has been set by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at €781 million. This allocation comprises a current allocation of €339 million and a capital allocation of €442 million. Individual allocations across my Department and its agencies will be presented in early December as part of the Revised Estimates Volume. It is expected that Exchequer capital allocations, together with capital carryover and reinvestment of income generated by agencies, will maintain job and enterprise creation agency allocations broadly in line with 2013 expenditure. This will facilitate the continued delivery of a range of enterprise and research and innovation programmes, which are crucial in achieving a return to economic growth and the generation of sustainable jobs across the enterprise base, from micro-scale enterprise to the largest multinational.</p>
            <p eId="para_136"> These measures will deliver a range of improvements in 2014. The House has been given details of the IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland targets, the investment in mentoring and the establishment of the local enterprise offices. Two new large and internationally visible research centres are being funded by Science Foundation Ireland in sectors of national strategic importance. Continued support is being given to more then 20 world-class Science Foundation Ireland research centres and to a cohort of 3,000 researchers to maintain and drive Ireland’s job creation strategy. I will not go through all the details. Budget 2014 will also enable the continued delivery of almost €2.5 billion in new non-bank credit schemes, some of which we discussed earlier. These schemes will target the full range of businesses from micro-enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises to mid-sized Irish exporting businesses and high-growth technology firms.</p>

            <p eId="para_137">I would like to ask the Minister about two areas. I will focus on the first of them in this part of my supplementary questioning. The Minister mentioned IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in his reply. He said earlier that those agencies will be aiming to create approximately 24,000 net jobs next year. A report published in October was critical of the loss of a number of key personnel from Enterprise Ireland. It has been unable to replace them because of the ban on recruitment. The Minister is aware of the importance of Enterprise Ireland, which is being given extra roles and responsibilities as part of the roll-out of the local enterprise offices. It is being given that additional workload at a time when key personnel who have departed are not being replaced. How confident is the Minister that Enterprise Ireland can continue to play a vital role in job creation, in light of the enhanced roles and responsibilities I have mentioned and the departure of a number of key personnel from the organisation?</p>

            <p eId="para_138">Unfortunately, the agencies operating under the remit of my Department and every other Department are being reduced in size. That is the reality within which we are working. There have been reductions of approximately 15% in staff numbers. Departments and agencies have been required to seek to work in a smarter way by reorganising their activities. Enterprise Ireland has been particularly flexible in seeking to reallocate staff resources to areas of priority and responding to the changed environment in which it must operate. Obviously, there is pressure to continue to operate with the reduced staff numbers. Enterprise Ireland's performance in recent years is testimony to its success in doing that. The approach we are pursuing, which involves building collaboration between the local enterprise offices, Enterprise Ireland and the local authorities, is helping to extend the reach of all agencies at a time of diminishing staff resources for all of them. We have to think outside the box as we try to deliver with a reduced staff resource.</p>

            <p eId="para_139">I thank the Minister for his reply. Has he discussed with the Minister, Deputy Howlin, the possibility of lifting the embargo on recruitment to allow Enterprise Ireland to fill the key positions that are currently vacant? I am led to believe that the budget of InterTradeIreland will be reduced by approximately 4% per annum over the next three years. This means there will be a cumulative 12% reduction. As the Minister is aware, InterTradeIreland plays a key role in cross-Border trade. There should be a focus on the potential for job creation and increased co-operation between North and South regarding business start-ups and enterprise. In fairness, the Department has done that. Obviously, this type of budgetary reduction will have an impact on its activities. In a reply to a recent parliamentary question, the Minister said he was confident that InterTradeIreland could continue to fulfil its role. It is increasingly difficult to see how that might happen, however, in light of the level of budgetary reduction being faced by the organisation.</p>

            <p eId="para_142"> I am confident that InterTradeIreland can continue to deliver. It has been very successful. I think it will be able to continue to manage its well-established programmes within the resources available to it. There is a good level of take-up of these successful programmes, which are having an impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_143"> Under the service level agreement between Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices, I will be funding the offices' activities that fall into the enterprise sphere. We will continue to fund the existing staff, the grants and the initiatives being taken by the local enterprise offices under their mandate. As the Deputy knows, we are bringing the local authority business units into those offices. They will deliver services together. The local authority business units will deal with planning and other service issues that are of concern to businesses. Under the service level agreement, we will be part-funding the delivery of services through the local authority network. That is the funding mechanism that will be used.</p>

          <p eId="para_148">I apologise for being late. I was at a committee with a European agenda. I do not know why the timetabling was so tight.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> We are dealing with some amendments from the Seanad to conclude the passage of the Gas Regulation Bill. Having regard to developments this morning, I felt it would not be appropriate in my dealings with the Opposition if I did not make some brief opening remarks in advance of discussing the outstanding amendments to the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> As Deputies may be aware, this morning I made an important announcement on the Bord Gáis Energy sale, which is also the subject of this Bill. I have confirmed to Bord Gáis Energy that none of the final bids received for the Bord Gáis Energy business is at an acceptable value at the present time. The sale process attracted significant interest from a broad range of potential international acquirers, reflecting positive international sentiment towards Ireland. However, current conditions in the power and commodity markets are not favourable and based on clear advice I have determined that the current bids are not a fair reflection of the strength and potential of the Bord Gáis Energy business. Therefore, while I had introduced this Bill with a view to underpinning the sale of Bord Gáis Energy within 2013, the sale will not now go ahead within this timeframe. The Government will instead consider its options for the Bord Gáis Energy business and the enactment of this Bill keeps all options open to the Government, including a future sale of the company which would require this enabling legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> In the course of the debates on the Bill, several Deputies questioned whether the State should proceed with the sale of the Bord Gáis Energy business and whether the sale would amount to a fire sale of assets. On several occasions I reiterated to this House that there would be no fire sale and that disposals would be undertaken only when market conditions are right. This decision underlines my commitment and reflects my resolve to ensure the State achieves value from the State asset disposal process.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> My Department, along with NewERA, will now work with Bord Gáis Energy to ensure continued investment in and development of the Bord Gáis Energy business, while also completing the separation of Bord Gáis Networks and Bord Gáis Energy, as required by the EU gas market directive.</p>

          <p eId="para_153">I will give the Minister a chance to catch his breath. I apologise on behalf of Deputy Moynihan who has been delayed elsewhere. The Minister's comments on the lack of a sale this morning are welcome. It was always a concern that in the current market this company might have been sold undervalued. I ask him to clarify that this legislation gives him the power to proceed at any stage without coming back to the Dáil regarding any potential future offer for Bord Gáis Energy. Has the Government decided to postpone the sale entirely or if another bid were to come in and another process were to get under way, what is the Government's plan B?</p>

          <p eId="para_154">As part of the assets-disposal process required by the troika as part of the programme we are now about to exit, the Government decided on the disposal of the energy business of Bord Gáis and the retention in State ownership of the distributive networks. The legislation before the House is to enable that to happen. It is not that the Government has taken any decision not to sell the energy business of Bord Gáis at some point in the future, but rather that there is a necessity to put the legislation in place by completing the enactment of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> The future will look after itself because this is a thriving business. Even if the marketplace may not be so congenial at the moment, it is a thriving business that is continuing to develop and is essential in our energy infrastructure. We will continue to develop it and assist the company in every way we can. If a fair price is on offer at some stage in the future, the Government will consider that at the time. I give an undertaking to the Deputy and the House that in those circumstances, of course, I would come back into the House and advise it of that decision.</p>

          <p eId="para_157">The reference to section 46 in amendment No. 1 is a reference to the new section 46 proposed to be inserted by amendment No. 15. These amendments are considered necessary because at present there is no provision in primary legislation to provide for ministerial approval for the making of a pension scheme by Irish Water. The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary of the Bord Gáis Energy group and registered under the Companies Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> Irish Water was formally incorporated in July 2013. Irish Water has assumed responsibility for the domestic metering programme. In July, the Government also approved the general scheme of a water services (No. 2) Bill which is being drafted by the Office of the Attorney General. The No. 2 Bill will provide for the transfer of responsibility for the provision of water services from the 34 county and city councils to Irish Water. It was originally intended to include provision for ministerial approval of a pension scheme within the second water services Bill. However, Irish Water has commenced recruiting staff to manage the delivery of the metering programme and in preparation for its future role as the water services utility it is proposed to bring forward the Irish Water superannuation provisions and include them as an amendment within this Gas Regulation Bill 2013. This will ensure we establish at the earliest possible date a statutory basis for ministerial approval of any pension scheme established by Irish Water.</p>

          <p eId="para_160">No. I can certainly give the assurance he seeks. This is a very calculated and deliberate decision by the Government to establish a water utility in State ownership, and to grow it and maintain it in State ownership in order to deal with some of the acute problems we have in water provision and water wastage.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">The purpose here is to enable it to get on with its business because key critical engineering and technical staff are being transferred from the local authorities to Irish Water as well as recruitment from the live register and outside. The intention here is that the conditions that people enjoyed in their present posts would be transferred. There is no intention to do anything but retain Irish Water in State ownership. </p>

          <p eId="para_166">This amendment relates to a taxation matter and is designed to avoid a potential anomaly in the treatment of capital gains tax on the proceeds from any future sale of Bord Gáis Energy. Under existing tax rules the pre-sale transfer of the energy assets by BGE into a subsidiary known as the energy company, as provided for in the Gas Regulation Bill 2013 will automatically be subject to relief from capital gains tax under section 617, the group relief provision of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. However, when the subsidiary is subsequently sold a de-grouping charge is automatically triggered under section 623 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 with the capital gains tax liability falling on the subsidiary at the point of sale completion rather than on BGE. This essentially means that the capital gains liability would fall on the purchaser rather than on the seller, which would be unusual. This amendment is structured specifically to dis-apply the group relief provision for any pre-sale restructuring to provide absolute clarity that BGE will be liable for all capital gains tax relating to the restructuring of the energy business. This would provide clarity for all parties to any future sale and ensure that the appropriate capital gains tax is paid to the Revenue Commissioners. My Department consulted with the Department of Finance and the Office of the Attorney General on the drafting of this amendment and I am satisfied that this ensures the best outcome for the Exchequer.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_168">The figures published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund last Friday show that waiting lists for hospital procedures and treatments have increased by about 18.6% year on year, that is, an increase of about 7,764. The various categories show that the number of people waiting more than three months has increased by 32%, from close to 20,000 up to 26,200; the numbers waiting more than six months has almost doubled from about 6,000 to close to 12,000; and for the numbers waiting nine months and more there has been an incredible increase of about 4,000%, from 107 in December 2012 to 4,400 in September 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> Equally, for children there has been an astonishing increase in waiting lists of 50%, up from 2,900 to 4,448. The list for children is compounded by the number of children waiting for outpatient appointments. There are now 40,000 children waiting for outpatient appointments in the country, 33,000 of whom are in Temple Street Children's Hospital and Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin. We know that a letter has issued from the CEO of Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, and other CEOs stating that patient safety is compromised and will be further compromised if the scale of budget cuts announced on budget day materialises. In essence, what has happened was that when the Minister came to office there was much fanfare, spin and change. He repeatedly undermined the National Treatment Purchase Fund and essentially pulled the rug from under it. He set up the special delivery unit, appointed an independent CEO, who left the job a year early and the figures have become much worse. Does the Taoiseach agree that these figures are unacceptable, particularly for children, and what does the Government propose to do to reverse significantly the trends that have emerged in the past 12 months?</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_170">This is always a matter of concern and a topical debate. Since the special delivery unit was initiated in July 2011, significant progress has been made in a range of areas resulting in reducing the number of patients on hospital trolleys and on waiting lists. By the end of last year there was a 98% decrease in patient day case waiting lists over nine months, a 95% decrease for children waiting 20 weeks and a 99% decrease for routine endoscopes more than 13 weeks over the year. For a number of reasons, the early months of the year have always brought exceptional pressure on these lists, not the least of which was referred to by the Minister, after some analysis, that this was due to a failure to provide cover when people are away on holidays. The Minister for Health set a target to eliminate the waiting list for all inpatients over eight months by the end of this year. As a result, the increase in 2013 was certainly much greater than expected, with a 16% increase in total numbers waiting between December 2012 and December 2013. However, through the sustained intervention of the special delivery unit this trend is now reversed with a 5% reduction in total numbers waiting and a 42% reduction in the numbers waiting more than eight months since the end of July 2013. As of 21 November 2013, 3,393 people are waiting more than eight months.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> A range of responses are being taken, such as using an €18 million intervention fund to meet the targets; developing and monitoring a number of special plans with hospitals where the elective waiting lists are under pressure; identifying increased capacity and capability across hospital groups - some surgeons and consultants tell me they have got spare capacity in their hospitals and said they can take some off the long waiting lists; increased operating theatre lists; a national analysis of risks impacted on hospitals; speciality level performance and so on. The electronic data collection commenced in March 2013. Material provided by the HSE indicates that between 28 March 2013 and 21 November 2013, there was a 5% reduction in total numbers waiting, a 41% reduction in numbers waiting more than 12 months, a 34% reduction in numbers waiting between 12 and 24 months, a 40% reduction in numbers waiting between 24 and 36 months, a 56% reduction in numbers waiting between 36 and 48 months and an 87% reduction in numbers waiting 48 months plus. The direction given by the Minister was to deal as a priority with the cases that are waiting longest. The Deputy may shake his head. If he wants to dispute the evidence, he may do so, but this is the electronic data collection commenced by the Minister in March 2013. If it is wrong, please prove it.</p>

That is not my figure, it is the figure from the National Treatment Purchase Fund. There has been a 97% increase in the number of people waiting nine months and more, according to the National Treatment Purchase Fund. The position regarding children is shocking in terms of inpatient and outpatient lists for Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, and Temple Street Children's Hospital. The National Treatment Purchase Fund figures show that the numbers of children on waiting lists has increased by 50% and there are more than 40,000 waiting-----</p>

          <p eId="para_184">What is the Taoiseach going to do to change tack, stop all he spin and the presentation, and the undermining of the National Treatment Purchase Fund that has happened in the past two years?

          <p eId="para_185">Of course, the Deputy ran a mile from it himself when he had responsibility for this area. At least the Minister, Deputy Reilly, has faced up to the challenge and is doing something about it. For 2013, as set out in the HSE service plan, the target maximum wait for inpatient and day case procedures is eight months for adults and 20 weeks for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">The waiting time for a routine GI endoscopy procedure was 13 weeks at the end of September. The figures have now been published on the website. The total number of people waiting is 49,496. A total of 11,939 people or 24.1% are waiting over six months. Of those waiting over six months, 4,473 are waiting over nine months. Of those waiting over nine months, 934 are waiting over a period of 12 months. This is not satisfactory but it is an improvement on the situation that applied before.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> In respect of emergency department trolley waiting times from 2011 to 2013, an analysis demonstrates there was a reduction in the number of patients waiting on trolleys for admissions. There was a 22% reduction between 2011 and 2012, a 12% reduction between 2012 and 2013 and a 32% reduction in the number of emergency department patients between 2011 and 2013. For the year 2012-13, the analysis demonstrates that for the week of 18 to 24 November this year, which was a reference week identified by the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on health, the reduction in the number of patients waiting on trolleys for admission for 2012 was 1,139. Between then and 2013, the figure was 950. The week of 18 to 24 November represented an overall reduction of 20%. These are things that obviously change depending on the nature of the health business. The national trolley count average value is based on the INMO trolley count undertaken five days a week with one measurement a day at 8 a.m. I have given Deputy Martin the inpatient and outpatient figures. We want to continue to improve them. As Deputy Martin well knows because he failed to do so, this is not something that will be sorted out overnight but I am glad to say that the people who work on the front line of these services do an extraordinary job and continue to do so. The Government will continue to work with the Minister for Health to see that these waiting lists are reduced. As I pointed out to Deputy Martin, they have started with those left lingering on waiting lists for three, five or seven years in some cases because the previous Government ran away from it and did not touch it. </p>

          <p eId="para_190">This is not a simple matter to sort out either. I spoke to somebody on the street the other night from a county outside Dublin who had had a row with his spouse, was on the streets and, according to himself, will be on them for a couple of weeks. At this time of the year, this issue becomes much more of a focus both for agencies dealing with it and because of the time of the year when the weather is deteriorating. I understand that one figure referred to recently relates to the number of unique individuals in contact with the regional contact and outreach service over a six-month period who were sleeping rough for one night. It is not a measurement of the number of people sleeping rough on a given night. Rather, it is an assessment of those who are entering rough sleeping over a six-month period or who may for a number of reasons have left an emergency accommodation bed.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> I also understand that what is known as the rough sleeper count, which is twice-yearly, was last conducted in April 2013 and revealed 94 rough sleepers in the Dublin region. I understand that the figures from the recent November rough sleeper count will be available in a short period of time. I notice that many of the people commenting who work for the agencies indicate serious increases in people who are homeless or on the streets. I understand that some of these are based on telephone calls to some of the agencies. I am not sure how accurate this is. I am not decrying the figures they put out but there is a requirement to get an accurate focus on what is happening in Dublin. Some of them indicate to me that the numbers go up by five or six per day. If that is the case, there is clearly a spiralling element of homelessness. </p>
          <p eId="para_192"> The Minister of State with responsibility for housing is obviously interested in dealing with the housing situation and shortage in so far as we can. A Deputy from Dublin pointed out to me a number of vacant and derelict houses and units in her constituency which have not been attended to for quite a long time by Dublin City Council for one reason or another. The homeless policy statement published this year outlines the Government's intention to end long-term homelessness by 2016. That statement emphasises a housing-led policy that is about accessing permanent housing as a primary response to all forms of homelessness. That is the focus of Government policy. In 2012, in the Dublin region alone, 879 people moved from homelessness to independent living. I recently visited the unit at Merchant's Quay and spoke to some of these people who have moved to independent living and have been very happy with the move they have been able to make despite all the personal difficulties they have had. </p>
          <p eId="para_193"> I agree that economic circumstances placed huge pressure on so many individuals and families. The Government supports this with a budget of approximately €45 million in 2013. That funding maintains services across the country. It is matched by local authorities with a contribution of at least a further 10%. The bulk of the funding provided by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government goes to funding services by voluntary providers such as Focus Ireland, the Simon Community, Crosscare and the day care drop-in centres and outreach services. They all do very intensive and committed work. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is committed to implementing the homeless policy statement and is determined to work closely with other State and voluntary organisations. We discussed this the other day here in one of the committees I chair so I am interested to see verification of the real numbers and how quickly we can make an impact on this. Based on the rough sleeper count I have given the Deputy, they are the figures I have. The figures from the second rough sleeper count conducted in November will be available very shortly. I agree that it is not a situation that anybody wants to stand over. I asked a homeless person the other evening about what he does with all the gear he was carrying. He told me he leaves it in a particular spot during the course of day and goes around to his usual haunts to see if he can make ends meet. That is not a satisfactory situation. Some people with whom I speak have a range of problems, as the Deputy is aware. Despite the best intentions of many voluntary organisations, some of them do not want to go into housing or emergency housing. Some people want to stay on the street for their own very specific reasons. That is a difficult situation. When I was first elected here in the 1970s, there was a lady across the road who did not want to into permanent accommodation despite all the efforts that were made. </p>

          <p eId="para_198">Families are left in bed and breakfast accommodation or hotel rooms, some of them for years. They do not want to be there. They want proper accommodation. The thousands of people on housing lists want their own homes. They want that basic security. This is not just an issue of rough sleepers, although that is the sharpest end of the homeless crisis. I accept that parts of homelessness are complex issues for the person in question, but in policy terms all of this is quite simple. There is nothing complicated about a 200% increase in rough sleepers in 12 months. It should shout "Crisis" at the Taoiseach. The €233 million the Government has cut from the social housing budget since taking up office is not complex. It was a simple decision on the Government's part.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> What the Taoiseach needs to resolve today with his colleagues is to tackle this issue and to recognise that one cannot solve a housing or homeless crisis without houses. One cannot end an accommodation crisis without accommodation. This requires the Government to invest. Tea and sympathy will not cut it. Yarns about meeting individuals on the streets, as enlightening as that clearly was for the Taoiseach, will not cut it. When will the Government invest? When will it release funds to local authorities in Dublin and elsewhere to ensure people in bed and breakfast accommodation or hotel rooms or sleeping on the streets will have a place to call home?</p>

          <p eId="para_308">Up to 30,000 families face eviction due to the Government's failure to protect them. Mortgage holders will not qualify for the insolvency procedures because they have no disposable incomes or disposable assets. They have fully engaged with their lenders. They are not strategic defaulters. Their only assets are their family homes. They hold modest mortgages, many of less than €100,000 and almost all of less than €200,000. They are all low-income families, many headed by unemployed people.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> They are in this position through no fault of their own. They took out mortgages when employed to put roofs over their heads and to provide for their families. Now, they are unemployed because of the reckless activity of the entire Irish establishment, including the Central Bank, the banks, the Government, their cheerleaders in the media and the State research bodies that predicted a soft landing.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> The same banks that destroyed society and that we bailed out are threatening these genuine mortgage holders with eviction. I have a letter from one of the pillar banks to such a mortgage holder. It outlines the options available to the person, including voluntary sale and voluntary surrender. In the event of a shortfall, the person would remain liable under all of the options for the outstanding debt, including accrued interest, charges and legal, selling and related costs. The bank would always seek the gross sale proceeds.</p>

The Governor of the Central Bank has been very clear about the targets set by the Central Bank for banks and lending institutions to work out solutions in each and every case. It is perfectly obvious that the people who are applying for mortgages and who are in a position to purchase houses are not going to get caught in the same trap as those who have gone before them.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Despite much cynicism, the Government has acted responsibly to put in place codes of practice, targets and legislation to help the very people Deputy Healy spoke about. If they took out a mortgage and found that because of unemployment or other changed circumstances they are unable to pay, there is now a solution for every case. It means, however, that in every case those concerned must work out what solution is in their best interests. We do not want to see anybody lose their homes.</p>

          <p eId="para_333">While the Taoiseach continues to put his head in the sand and washes his hands like a Pontius Pilate act, many of the people I am talking about will end up on the streets, as Focus Ireland said this morning. It is certain that families evicted from their homes will end up on the huge local authority housing waiting lists. Some 110,000 families are already on those lists and more will join the end of that queue. It is also certain that they will be entitled to rent supplement at a significant cost to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> The mortgage to rent scheme would allow these families to stay in their homes on a rental basis and also give them an option of repurchasing in future if their financial circumstances improve. Surely that scheme would be both socially and financially beneficial to families, the State and even to the banks. However, even though we bailed out the banks they are resisting this scheme. The Government seems to have abandoned the scheme. There have only been 60 approvals in that scheme since it was introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> Will the Taoiseach personally intervene with the banks to ensure that they fully operate the mortgage to rent scheme? That would give some hope to the 30,000 families involved who are facing eviction. This is a huge problem.</p>

Evidence of the much decried personal insolvency legislation is now becoming clear from the initial cases going through, that the banks do not have a veto. If the banks decide not to deal through the personal insolvency agency, they may get nothing at all if the person follows a bankruptcy route. That has been changed from 12 years to three.</p>

I do not have a date for the publication of this Bill, but the budget contained a further series of measures for small and medium enterprises to access credit. The Government is focusing on this matter. In addition, as regards the expected end of the bailout on 15 December, Department of Finance officials are working with their German counterparts in respect of having access to credit through the KfW Bank which is a triple AAA-rated German institution. That will present an opportunity.</p>

He referred me to the Minister for Justice and Equality who has written to me today. He has confirmed that the legislation will be in place by early 2014. However, I am concerned that the medical cover will only apply to women who are resident in the State. There is an issue concerning services for women who endured the Magdalen laundries in other jurisdictions, including Britain and the United States. Can the Taoiseach confirm that we will see this legislation early in 2014 to facilitate medical services for those women? Can he also reassure us that all the survivors - that is, everyone who has applied to the redress scheme and who is entitled to medical services - will have access to them, even if they are resident outside the State?</p>

          <p eId="para_359">The Bill is listed for publication next year. Earlier this morning, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources reported the Seanad amendments to the Gas Regulation Bill 2013 to the Dáil, which legislation separates the gas networks and gas generation entities. As already stated publicly by the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, Bord Gáis Energy was and is still for sale. While bids in respect of the sale of Bord Gáis Energy have been received they were not acceptable to Government. In the case of the sale of Irish Life, the first offers received were not acceptable but the second offers were accepted. It is hoped the same will apply in respect of the sale of Bord Gáis Energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> As stated, the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, earlier put through the House the Gas Regulation Bill 2013 which deals with the separation of the two entities. This forms part of the Government's commitment in this area. In answer to the Deputy's question, the Government remains committed to the sale of Bord Gáis Energy but it will be sold not in a fire sale but only following receipt of a proper offer, taking into account the intrinsic value of the entity. This has always been the case.</p>

Everybody has a responsibility in this matter, from local authorities, through the Department, Government and the various agencies. The Minister of State is overseeing all of that and when she reports to Cabinet, we will decide how we can act most effectively to address the challenges. Had we unlimited resources and a thriving construction sector, the problem might not be as great as it is. Nobody wants to see families living in one-bedroom apartments or in bed and breakfast or hotel accommodation, as happened in the Deputy's constituency when residents of Priory Hall had to be evacuated as a matter of urgency.

            <from>Deputy Niall Collins<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_409">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch for taking this issue. It is a matter that has been widely reported, including in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> yesterday and today and in many other publications in recent months, including the <i>Daily Mail</i> and the <i>Sunday Independent</i>. Families throughout this country are struggling with the heavy burden of mortgage debt and, as we know, desperate times provoke desperate measures. Under the weight of severe financial pressure, many people are facing the grim prospect of having their family home repossessed. We have debated these issues on several occasions in the Chamber. The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act, for instance, strengthened the banks in terms of their ability to instigate repossessions. We have seen reportage in recent days of the first cases coming through under the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act. It remains a problem, however, that the banks are at the centre of that process and effectively have a veto on debt resolution proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_410"> As a consequence of the desperate circumstances in which people find themselves, a highly dubious property trust has emerged claiming to be able to save people's homes on the basis of a lacuna in the law of which, apparently, only the people operating the trust are aware. They have consistently refused to enlighten anybody as to how it works. In the year to date, it has been reported, up to 2,000 people, many of them high-profile business people, came into contact with the trust and, in a last-ditch attempt to remain in control of their debt-laden properties, have engaged with it. They put their faith in this mysterious property trust, known as the Rodolphus Allen Trust, which claimed it had found a way to split mortgages from properties. In exchange for this promise of protecting people's properties, the trust is charging an administration fee in the order of €200 to €250 and a per folio charge of up to €100. There have been reports of up to 200 people turning up at signing-on sessions.</p>
            <p eId="para_411">These were aided and facilitated by a notary public, who has since seen the light of day and desisted from being involved. As the Minister of State is aware, the trust has also made claims of up to hundreds of millions of euro from receivers and banks, which are working through some of these distressed properties. The trust has also written to people claiming the rent rolls on commercial properties.</p>
            <p eId="para_412"> In August a mob - that is the best way of describing it - was led by the trust to a stud farm in County Kildare and took over the property. The people involved then withdrew from the property and it was eventually taken into possession by the receivers. All of this has been high profile and widely reported. The individuals at the centre of the trust are highly mobile, moving from one end of the country to the other and moving out of the jurisdiction. While it is not our business, it is a fact that similar organisations have been operating outside the jurisdiction, in the North in particular.</p>
            <p eId="para_413"> It was reported yesterday that the head of the trust was arrested and this brings the matter into sharp focus. There are several questions which I am keen to put to the Minister of State and I will follow them with supplementary questions. What action has the Government taken to inform vulnerable debtors of the activities of this trust and similar trusts? Has the Government reviewed the Consumer Protection Act 2007? Is the Act capable of dealing with this type of activity? Has the Department of Justice and Equality or any other Department been in touch with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners, two relevant agencies in this matter, given the high profile nature and the sums of money involved. In the case of at least one of these trusts it is estimated that in excess of €600,000 has been taken from people in cash payments; there are no cheques and there is no traceability, it is all cash and there is no accountability.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#KathleenLynch" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_254">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T13:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_414">The Deputy should note that the Minister for Justice and Equality was keen to take this issue himself but he is in the Middle East in his capacity as Minister for Defence. The Deputy will accept that as legitimate. I will go through the reply as quickly as I can but before I do I wish to point out that people who find themselves in desperate situations are inclined to resort to sometimes desperate solutions. We should not forget that.</p>
            <p eId="para_415"> I thank Deputy Collins for raising the issue. The Government has brought forward significant modernisation of the law to address the problem of over-indebtedness, primarily through the enactment of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 and reform of the Bankruptcy Act 1988. The Personal Insolvency Act established three new debt resolution mechanisms: the debt relief notice, the debt settlement arrangement and the personal insolvency arrangement.</p>
            <p eId="para_416"> In the context of today's debate, the personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, has been the most significant development. The PIA will enable the agreed settlement of all unsecured debt and secured debt up to €3 million, a cap which may be increased with the consent of all secured creditors. The PIA provides for the negotiated resolution of secured debt in a court-sanctioned process that provides for certainty for creditors and hope and relief for debtors. The PIA does not only cover mortgage debt; it is effectively a form of personal examinership that can comprehend debt arising from trading or business activities, including agricultural activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_417"> To protect the constitutional rights of all concerned and to prevent potential actions for judicial review, the Act provides for enhanced oversight by the court of the new debt resolution procedures. This court involvement has the significant benefit to the debtor of providing protection from enforcement actions by creditors, either through the negotiation period or during the lifetime of the arrangement. Trust law allows for the legal title of land to be held by trustees not for their benefit but rather for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust, a point that relates specifically to Deputy Collins's question. The beneficiaries are said to be the beneficial owners and the property must be used for their benefit rather than for the benefit of the trustees. The trust mechanism may be used in family situations where, for example, the intended beneficiary is a minor or is otherwise incapable of managing the property. Trusts are also commonly created in the context of wills where the testator may leave property to his or her spouse for life and afterwards to his or her children. The creation of trusts for charitable purposes is also common.</p>
            <p eId="para_418"> The Property Registration Authority is the State authority which manages and controls the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds. I am advised by the authority that in recent months over 500 applications for the registration of notices of certificates of acknowledgement of the living man's claim of right were received in the Land Registry. Based on the third party witness common to all these documents, it appears they originated in the trust in question. The notices of certificates of acknowledgement appear to be applications to record on a State register the acknowledgement of the living man. Freemen on the Land is one of several groups, originating in Canada and the USA which advances the notion that the legal person and living person are two distinct entities. Under the belief system, the living person is not bound by law or court rulings unless and until the living person or freeman contracts to accept such law. Obtaining an entry on a State register of the recognition of the living man or freeman on the land is often a first tactical step within these groups. These applications were all rejected by the Property Registration Authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_420">I will finish presently but this is a matter of concern to us and, as Deputy Collins said rightly, people who are desperate are being sucked into this.</p>
            <p eId="para_421"> In so far as the Registry of Deeds is concerned, the documents presented for registration were not deeds within the meaning of section 32(1) of the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006. Therefore, no registration could be made in the office. In so far as the Land Registry is concerned, the registers, which are maintained in that office, must consist of information required to be recorded under the Registration of Deeds and Title Acts 1964 to 2006 and be authorised by the land registration rules 2012. The applications received in these particular cases did not constitute applications for an authorised entry on the folios of the register and were not in a form prescribed by the land registration rules 2012. I gather the Property Registration Authority has not received any applications from any other trust of this nature.</p>

            <p eId="para_422">We are all agreed that at the heart of this issue there are vulnerable people and, basically, they are being exploited. It is a major fraud and a scam being perpetrated throughout the country. By any yardstick, given the amount of reportage on the matter, there seems to be no oversight whatsoever from any State agencies, an issue of major public concern and one we should be concerned about in the House. Since some of these people are vulnerable they want to remain private. None of them is coming forward to make complaints to An Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_423"> It is noteworthy that some of the individuals operating these trusts - I have no wish to call them trusts - tried to align themselves to the political establishment. They contacted people in the Houses of the Oireachtas and sought meetings. One such person was my colleague, Senator Thomas Byrne, who met them. As a result of meeting them he was so alarmed that he wrote to An Garda Síochána and made an official complaint. Regrettably, he got back a reply, a copy of which I have, stating that it was not a formal complaint. However, he put a complaint in writing and it is high time that paper stopped shuffling around the desks of An Garda Síochána at a high level and that the force took the issue seriously.</p>
            <p eId="para_424"> The Minister of State has outlined in clear terms what trust law provides for. She stated that these people are trading on the notion of a distinction between the living man and the freeman. It does not stack up. We need to hear from our agencies of State but above all we need to hear from the Government. What exactly is the Government going to do in this regard? How many other operations exist? Are there up to half a dozen similar entities operating in the country? At the heart of this is mass fraud and misrepresentation. Vulnerable people are being targeted and are effectively being taken for a financial scam but no one seems to be concerning themselves about it.</p>
            <p eId="para_425">As I stated, Senator Thomas Byrne wrote officially to the Garda Síochána-----</p>

            <p eId="para_430">No, I understand that perfectly but the Deputy must admit it did bring a degree of attention to the particular issue. I do not believe one can ever enact laws that will protect people who are quite desperate from making decisions for themselves and clearly, this is what is happening. A debate like this one today will alert people to the fact that this is not a viable option. I believe that is as far as one can go. However, I do not believe that other so-called trusts are operating in the country to the same extent as is this particular one. As the Property Registration Authority has noted, no applications have been made other than through this living man and freeman testimonial. This should provide some degree of comfort but that said, the Minister for Justice and Equality has a meeting on a monthly basis with the Commissioner. I am sure this is a subject that will arise in their discussions and I also will ensure it is drawn to his attention. While I do not believe he needs this, I will ensure it happens, as there is a real need to start telling people they are throwing good money after bad in this respect.</p>

            <p eId="para_431">I welcome the presence of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, to take this Topical Issue. Last week, a Circuit Court judge voiced strong criticism of the conduct of the head of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's special investigation unit, SIU, urging that his conduct and that of the SIU in the case before the court be properly investigated. I will cite from reports of the case in question, in which Judge Leonie Reynolds stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_432">it seems to me there was a very heavy-handed approach adopted here and as to how matters were handled thereafter, they were handled in a less than fair manner. I hope those comments will be taken on board in the Department and matters will be looked into.</p>
            <p eId="para_433">I speak of the case that was brought against Mr. Douglas Fannin, a farmer in County Cavan. In her closing remarks, Judge Reynolds stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_434">I want to be very clear, Mr. Fannin leaves this court here to-day with his reputation fully intact and without any question mark hanging over his integrity.</p>
            <p eId="para_435">What has taken place in this regard? What step is the Minister now taking to address this serious and now publicly-exposed misconduct of members of his Department's special investigation unit? There are questions, namely, what has taken place and why and these questions must be answered fully. This is the reason a thorough Garda investigation is needed. I ask the Minister to advise Members today if this is how he expects matters to progress. The Garda should be fully involved. There is a need to establish what is the full truth behind this particular case and the series of visits to the farm and home of Mr. Fannin over the period in question. Whatever is the truth, there is no doubt but that there has been a blatant misleading of the courts by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine through its representatives. That is clear from the transcripts of the case, as reported in several publications, including in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>, <i>The Sunday Times</i> and several other popular daily newspapers.</p>
            <p eId="para_436"> It is critically important that the Minister now outlines the steps he intends to take and that he will confirm a thorough Garda investigation either is pending or already is under way. He also should advise Members as to the steps he will now take to restore domestic and international confidence in Ireland's beef sector, given that animals which officials of his Department believed were contaminated were allowed into the food chain through a European Union-licensed meat plant. These are serious matters, huge matters, that go far beyond the situation that maintained and presented for the unfortunate Mr. Fannin and his family.</p>
            <p eId="para_437"> I wish to put on record that this issue has continued for four to five years. During 2009 and 2010, I continually sought to properly advise the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, my constituency colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, of the seriousness of what was unfolding. After consistent lobbying of the Minister, Deputy Smith, including at least one direct one-to-one meeting, I subsequently secured a meeting with the then Minister and the chief veterinary officer of the day, in the offices of the Minister at Agriculture House. I outlined to them both my serious concerns in respect of the conduct of the named head of the special investigation unit at that time. I implored them both to ensure there was an investigation of his alleged activities at that time. Had that been proceeded with and explored properly, I doubt whether the debacle that presented to the courts last week in the name of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and on behalf of the people would have taken place.</p>

            <p eId="para_439">I do not accept the broader accusation that this issue has somehow undermined confidence in the food safety control systems in Ireland. The special investigation unit, SIU, by its very nature, must be robust in dealing with very difficult cases and, in some cases, with very difficult people. The job involves difficult relationships and investigations. In this case, if the SIU got it wrong, that needs to be reviewed and exposed and we need to ensure systems are in place to prevent a recurrence. It has nothing to do with undermining the credibility or the robustness of the food safety systems.</p>

            <p eId="para_440">I am deeply disappointed with the Minister's response. It appears he is relying on an internal departmental review to deal with the matters I have sought to address. That is not what is required. Internal reviews will not suffice by a long shot. In the case in question, a man's life was not only put into suspension for several years but he faded before my eyes, month after month, as I met him in consultations about his situation. His family have suffered immeasurably. The Minister should not put his head in the sand to ignore the fact that he is not unique and isolated. There are many such people and families involved in farming who have equally suffered because of the very questionable approach and engagement of the SIU. I assure the Minister I have no doubt of the importance and necessity of the role of the SIU to ensure the highest standards of practice, but there is no question in my mind on the evidence that I have seen that there is behaviour beyond acceptance being employed by a certain individual or certain individuals within the SIU, including currently, and it is not acceptable. I am deeply disappointed that the Minister has suggested in his response that the prosecution's case was not sustainable. The subtext of that is open to the interpretation that it was unable to prove its case and there is the very overt suggestion that in some way Mr. Fannin was other than wholly innocent.</p>
            <p eId="para_441"> I will repeat for the Minister what the judge said at the conclusion of the case:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_442">I want to be very clear. Mr. Fannin leaves this court here today with his reputation fully intact and without any question mark hanging over his integrity.</p>
            <p eId="para_443">That was my understanding of Mr. Fannin all along and that is why I took the very appropriate steps of bringing his case to the attention of the highest office in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, that of the former Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith and the chief veterinary officer of the day.</p>

            <p eId="para_455">I can only answer for my own tenure in office. The Deputy will know that when he has brought other issues to my attention, I have always given him a fair hearing and we have tried to get to the bottom of issues about which the Deputy has concerns. I would have taken the same approach had he expressed significant concerns about this case. The first I knew of this case was what I read in the media. Since reading those reports, I have asked for a full and comprehensive review to be carried out quickly by the Department and we will draw conclusions from that review. If further investigation is required as a result of the review, we will consider it.</p>
            <p eId="para_456"> The SIU is an integral part of my Department and it has a very difficult job. The unit deals with the most difficult cases and it is expected to get to the bottom of those cases. This case was such a case. I accept absolutely what the judge said at the end of the court case. So far as I am concerned this case is concluded and the individual against whom the Director of Public Prosecutions took a case is completely absolved of any wrongdoing. That is the judgment. However, it is my task to examine how the role of the SIU and my Department functioned in this case. If that role was inappropriate or unacceptable, I need to deal with the consequences. It would be very wrong of me to draw conclusions before a review takes place.</p>

            <p eId="para_457">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this extremely important issue which is the need to open the stroke unit in Cork University Hospital. I have been following up progress on the CUH stroke unit for more than two years, since November 2011. During this time I have been in contact with Chris Macey of the Irish Heart Foundation. I am pleased that one of its representatives, Emma Jane Morrissey, is in the Public Gallery.</p>
            <p eId="para_458"> The HSE's 2012 national stroke programme provided for the opening of 28 dedicated stroke units in acute hospitals throughout the country to care for patients admitted through accident and emergency departments The aim is to have 90% of acute hospitals operating a stroke unit to cover 90% of all stroke admissions. I acknowledge the Minister is very dedicated to this project. A total of 27 of the 28 units have been open and operational for the past 12 to 18 months. The only unit not yet open is the unit in Cork University Hospital. It is only one of two locations in the country that has the potential to operate as a centre of excellence in stroke care. I understand that to date, a considerable amount of funding has been allocated approximately for the recruitment of additional staff for the stroke unit but it is still not in operation. Why is it not open and when will it be opened? I understand that the Mercy University Hospital was not allocated additional resources but despite this, its stroke unit has been open for two years. The Bantry hospital stroke unit was opened in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_459"> It is widely accepted that general access to properly staffed stroke units will not only greatly improve stroke outcomes but could cut by 20% to 25% the annual death toll in Ireland of more than 2,000 people. This is a life and death issue. Stroke units save money as well as lives. The development of stroke units will reduce the number of stroke survivors requiring nursing home care. Figures from the Irish Heart Foundation indicate that as much as €414 million out of an annual cost of stroke of €557 million is spent on nursing home care for stroke survivors. An ESRI report for the Irish Heart Foundation, The Cost of Stroke in Ireland, states that the wider availability of stroke units and thrombolysis can save at least an extra 750 people each year from death and lifelong dependency and disability, while also saving the health service an estimated €230 million over the next ten years.</p>
            <p eId="para_460"> Funding was allocated to the HSE for the CUH stroke unit under the 2012 national stroke programme. A stroke unit is essentially made up of people rather than equipment. It is a concentration of expertise that has a dramatic added impact on patient outcomes. Essential personnel include stroke consultants, specialist nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, dietitians, social workers, and psychologists.</p>
            <p eId="para_461"> In 2011, the chief executive officer of the HSE spoke at the joint committee on health about the development of stroke units at Cork University Hospital, Mercy University Hospital Cork, St Vincent's University Hospital Dublin, Limerick Regional Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda. He said they would be completed by the first six months of 2012. We are still waiting for the CUH unit. When I raised the issue by way of parliamentary question in June 2013, I was advised by the HSE that upgrading work has been completed on ward 3A for some time. This ward will contain 11 beds for the stroke service, 13 neurology beds and a four bed epilepsy monitoring unit and video telemetry. The HSE has also advised in June, August and September this year that recruitment is under way for the necessary posts to staff the unit, and it was envisaged that the CUH stroke unit will be fully operational in the third quarter of 2013. It is still unopened.</p>
            <p eId="para_462"> I have continued to follow up the matter with the HSE since the summer and I understand that delays in opening the unit have been due to difficulties in the recruitment of staff, specifically additional nursing staff, despite an extensive recruitment campaign. I received a further communication from the HSE today advising me that a further series of interviews for nursing posts commenced yesterday and it is hoped that these will yield sufficient nurses to allow the unit to open in January or February 2014.</p>

          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" as="#Minister_for_Health" eId="spk_279">
            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_463">I am very grateful to the Deputy for providing me with the opportunity to speak on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_464"> Improvements in stroke services were envisioned in the Changing Cardiovascular Health: Cardiovascular Health Policy 2010-2019, which was launched in 2010. The policy establishes a framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, including stroke, which seeks to ensure an integrated and quality assured approach in their management to reduce the burden of these conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_465"> The Health Service Executive has advised my Department that the situation with Cork University Hospital, CUH, is that it provides a full and comprehensive range of services for the victims of stroke. These services include neuro-radiology, including intra-arterial thrombolysis, acute neurology and elderly care medicine, which, when taken together, designate CUH as providing a comprehensive range of stroke related services.</p>
            <p eId="para_466"> To enhance this service delivery further and to provide a dedicated facility for stroke services, the executive management board at CUH allocated ward 3A as a suitable location for a stroke unit to be shared with the epilepsy and neurology services. When fully operational, ward 3A will comprise 11 stroke beds, 13 neurology beds and a four-bed epilepsy monitoring unit with video telemetry.</p>
            <p eId="para_467"> Funding of €25,000 was provided by the national stroke programme to enable some infrastructural upgrading of the ward. This work has been completed for some time, and Cork University Hospital has been working on progressing the staffing of the unit. The stroke unit will be staffed by relocating some existing staff from within the hospital and the recruitment of additional staff. The stroke unit includes a four-bed high dependency unit, HDU, which requires higher staffing levels. The HDU is where stroke patients who meet clear clinical criteria will receive thrombolysis. Currently, in many cases, this is provided in the emergency department. The new stroke unit will lead to this treatment being provided in a safer, more appropriate environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_468"> The delay in opening the unit is primarily attributed to difficulties in the recruitment of the additional staff required for the unit. Cork University Hospital has put in place a staffing plan based on training up a number of more experienced nurses who work in the hospital to allow them to work in the high dependency unit, but their current positions must be backfilled before they can be released.</p>
            <p eId="para_469"> Over recent months Cork University Hospital has engaged in a number of extensive recruitment campaigns with a view to recruiting additional nurses for the hospital. These nurses are required to replace those nurses who have left the hospital through resignation or retirement, and to staff new developments such as the stroke unit. While these recruitment campaigns have made progress in the recruitment of nurses for Cork University Hospital, the hospital has not yet reached the level of staffing required to allow the stroke unit to open.</p>
            <p eId="para_470"> A further series of interviews for nursing posts in Cork University Hospital commenced this week on 26 November. It is anticipated that these interviews will yield a sufficient number of nurses to allow the unit to open. The opening date for the unit will depend on how soon the new nurses can commence, but management in Cork University Hospital are confident they will have adequate nurse staffing levels to open the unit in late January or early February of next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_471"> Cork University Hospital provides an excellent service to stroke patients and the opening of the stroke unit later this year will further enhance the service available.</p>

            <from>Deputy David Stanton<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_472">I thank the Minister for his response and I am hopeful this unit will open soon. There is new information in the Minister's response, namely, that experienced nurses working in the hospital will be transferred to the high dependency unit and that other nurses will then be recruited to fill their positions. I take it from that information that the hospital will be recruiting nurses who may not be as experienced or who are general registered nurses. The country is full of nurses who are unemployed so why is that process taking so long? We are talking about late January or early February before these positions are filled. As this is November, we are talking about another three months.</p>
            <p eId="para_473"> I do not know what is going on but we have had this false start on more than one occasion. I agree with the Minister that the hospital provides an excellent service and that this additional service will enhance what is in place. It is a shame the ward is available but is not being used. The Minister might find out, if not now then later, the reason it is taking so long to recruit ordinary nurses, and I use the word "ordinary" in a careful way, who are not as experienced, according to what the Minister has just said, to backfill the positions that will allow people move from their current posts to the high dependency unit. What is going on? I may be missing something but I cannot understand why nurses cannot be recruited when there are so many nurses looking for work. A series of interviews started only yesterday. I was led to believe that process was ongoing for months. Somebody must answer questions in that regard because, as I said at the outset, this is a matter of life and death for people, and these units make a huge difference. Something is wrong and it is not good enough that it has reached this stage. I know the Minister is committed to this issue. He works very hard on the anti-smoking campaign, which is related to stroke in that we know smoking causes stroke. It is important, therefore, that we get this done as quickly as possible, preferably before Christmas.</p>

          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_281" as="#Minister_for_Health">
            <from>Deputy James Reilly<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_474">I thank the Deputy again for raising this issue because it is unacceptable that it has taken two years to open this unit. Every other unit in the country has opened. The consequence of that is that we have gone from the bottom of the league in Europe to the top regarding the administration of thrombolysis, the blood clot busting drug that has saved so many lives. Moreover, the current statistics show we are saving virtually a life a day and saving three people from going into long-term care.</p>
            <p eId="para_475"> There has been an extraordinary improvement in outcomes for people with stroke as a consequence of these stroke units, and the Deputy is correct that it is not just about the presence of a CT scan or of thrombolysis. Having a dedicated unit with dedicated staff who become very experienced in the various nuances of dealing with people with stroke improves the outcomes also. I am aware that President Obama's health spokesman mentioned this, at an international conference in Oregon last year, as one of the areas where significant improvement has been achieved despite that country being in the face of a serious economic recession.</p>
            <p eId="para_476"> The people who work in our stroke units have done a phenomenal job in an extraordinarily short period, improving outcomes for people, and the people of Cork are entitled to the same service. As the Deputy rightly pointed out, I fail to understand why it is that the Mercy University Hospital has its unit in place and Cork University Hospital still does not. I will be meeting Mr. Ian Carter, the new director of hospital services, today and I will raise this subject with him. It is unacceptable it could take this length of time, when we know a large number of nurses have said they are leaving this country because they cannot get work, to recruit nurses for Cork University Hospital. It will be dealt with.</p>

          <speech by="#RobertDowds" eId="spk_282">
            <from>Deputy Robert Dowds<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_477">I thank the Minister for being in the Chamber to respond to this Topical Issue matter. I wish we did not have to discuss tobacco at all because it is a killer which does not have any beneficial effects for anybody, but it will come as no surprise to the Minister that there is a significant level of illegal tobacco sales in Ireland. The estimates fluctuate from 30% down to 15%, with the truth being somewhere in between. I understand the Revenue Commissioners estimate that in 2011, some €707 million worth of illegal cigarettes were sold, which led to a loss of €258 million in excise duty and VAT to the State. That is particularly appalling given that so much of the work of hospitals and our health service is to do with tackling the ill-effects of tobacco. If ever there was a product that deserved to be taxed because of the cost to the State, tobacco is it.</p>
            <p eId="para_478"> One of my concerns is that in parts of my constituency there is a strong sense that approximately 30% of the sales are illegal, and that figure is growing. That appears to be the case in other parts of Dublin and in cities such as Waterford, according to anecdotal evidence.</p>
            <p eId="para_479">I will give the Minister a couple of examples. A small shopkeeper to whom I spoke in north Clondalkin told me he let two staff go recently because of a decline in the legal sales of tobacco. The reason is not that people have suddenly stopped smoking, although I wish it was, but the growth in the illegal tobacco business. A neighbouring shopkeeper told me approximately 30% of discarded tobacco packaging outside his shop is from illegal tobacco products. While it would be preferable if people gave up smoking all together, it is galling that businesses which pay their commercial rates and keep people in work are being undermined because of illegal tobacco.</p>
            <p eId="para_480"> The other side of this issue is that the illegal tobacco trade benefits the criminal fraternity. Retail Ireland believes criminals in Ireland make in the region of €3 million per week from illegal tobacco sales. The most insidious aspect of that is it sucks young people into crime and inevitably some of them go on to get involved in even worse things, such as heroin and cocaine. </p>
            <p eId="para_481"> There are several questions about this issue to which I require answers. What is being done by the Revenue Commissioners and customs officials to stop illegal trafficking of tobacco products? What is being done to stop illegal sales of tobacco on the street? What is being done to get at the crime lords behind the street sellers who are making big profits from these illegal sales? Are the criminal sanctions adequate? Is there evidence that legally produced tobacco products are making their way into Ireland as illegal products from another country, as has been alleged to me? Has the State investigated this? </p>
            <p eId="para_482"> Tourists can legally bring in 800 cigarettes per person into this country and retailers reckon it accounts for 7% of tobacco consumed in Ireland. By contrast, Finland allows only 200 per tourist. Is there any way we can take a leaf out of the Finnish book to discourage people from smoking?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_283">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_483">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners, who have responsibility for the collection of tobacco products tax and for tackling illicit trade in this area, that they are very aware of the threat that illegal tobacco products poses to the Exchequer and to the Government's health protection objective of discouraging smoking through high prices. Tackling this problem is a high priority for Revenue.</p>
            <p eId="para_484"> Cigarette smuggling is a world-wide problem and affects most EU member states. It is estimated that some 11% of the global cigarette trade is illicit. Given that tobacco tax rates and prices here are among the highest in the world, it is not surprising that there is a problem with illegal tobacco in Ireland. A survey conducted on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners and the National Tobacco Control Office of the HSE in 2012 indicates that 13% of cigarettes consumed here are illegal and that a further 6% of consumption is made up of legal cigarettes bought duty paid in another EU member state and brought in for personal consumption here.</p>
            <p eId="para_485"> In accordance with Article 32 of Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 concerning the general arrangements for excise duty, section 104(2) of the Finance Act 2001 provides that tobacco products tax is not chargeable on tobacco products that are bought tax paid by a private individual in another member state of the EU, provided that the products are for the individual's own personal use and not for commercial purposes. The tobacco products must be personally transported and accompanied into the State by that individual. This means that quantitative limits may not be imposed in these circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_486"> EU law provides for an indicative guide level which can be used solely as a form of evidence as to what constitutes a quantity consistent with personal use. The indicative guide levels are 800 cigarettes, 400 cigarillos, 200 cigars and 1 kg of smoking tobacco. Consequently, the quantity of tobacco products concerned can be taken into account only as one of a number of considerations used to determine whether the tobacco products are for an individual's own private use or for commercial purposes. This determination falls to be considered in accordance with criteria set out in Part 4 of the Control of Excisable Products Regulations 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_487"> The only exception to this is where EU law permits the imposition of quantitative restrictions where member states have been allowed a transitional period to apply a rate of tobacco products tax that is lower than that required under EU excise law. Consideration is currently being given as to whether quantitative restrictions may be imposed in 2014 on cigarettes brought in from those member states that are subject to transitional arrangements and which have not achieved the minimum rate of tax required, in accordance with Council Directive 2011/64/EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_488"> Quantitative restrictions apply to tobacco products brought into the State from outside the EU or from territories where EU rules on VAT and excise duties do not apply, such as the US or the Canary Islands. Where passengers arriving in Ireland have travelled from these areas, they may bring a maximum of 200 cigarettes or 100 cigarillos or 50 cigars or 250 g of tobacco into the State tax free.</p>
            <p eId="para_489"> Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, personal baggage and postal packages. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade after importation by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises. In line with best practice in tax administration worldwide, Revenue regards the development of information and intelligence as critical to the detection of evasion and smuggling.</p>
            <p eId="para_490"> In the period from January to 25 November 2013, more than 38.6 million cigarettes and more than 4,000 tonnes of tobacco were seized, which represents a reduction on volumes seized in earlier years. In 2012, seizures amounted to 95.6 million cigarettes and 5,276 kg of other tobacco while in 2011, 109 million cigarettes and almost 11,200 kg of other tobacco were seized. The reduction in volumes is believed to indicate a change in the operating patterns of smugglers who are moving away from large consignments towards smaller, more frequent consignments which are less easy to detect and which yield lower a volume on seizure.</p>
            <p eId="para_491"> There has also been success in detecting and prosecuting those involved in the illicit trade. In 2012, there were 132 convictions, which resulted in 47 custodial sentences, some suspended, and fines of €246,600. This year to 25 November, prosecution of those involved in tobacco smuggling and the illegal sale of tobacco has led to 87 convictions, with 32 custodial sentences, some suspended, and €147,750 in fines. The high level of seizures over recent years reflects ongoing enforcement action by Revenue. </p>

            <p eId="para_492">I thank the Minister for his reply. I wish to put on record my absolute condemnation of the threat by Philip Morris, the tobacco producer, to the Minister, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly and, by extension, the State in terms of pursuing plain packaging. It is absolutely disgraceful given it is purveying a product which kills people. I fully support the Minister's efforts to bring in plain packaging.</p>
            <p eId="para_493"> Is there any possibility of following the Finnish example in terms of reducing the number of tobacco products brought in by tourists? It is disappointing to see the decline in the figures. Clearly the Revenue Commissioners and customs officials are aware of that and are, presumably, trying to come up with a better way to deal with this whole issue. Will the Minister comment on the sentencing of people caught selling illegal tobacco, in particular the people behind those on the street because they are the ones at which we need to get? They need to be hit very hard in their pockets and, preferably, with prison sentences as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_496">There is a real problem with tobacco. Much of it arises from the fact that ordinary decent citizens are buying illicit cigarettes and illicit tobacco, mainly for price reasons. As we continue to use price to discourage people from smoking, I think we will divert more and more of the trade to the illicit trade. It sounds like a cliché to say that if people stopped buying illicit cigarettes, the trade would stop very quickly. The incentive to buy is related to price. Much of the illicit trade is driven by people posing as tourists to go abroad to buy cigarettes to bring into Ireland. People can check the Internet to find very cheap flights. They can use these low-priced flights to go to countries where cigarettes are much cheaper than they are in this country. I have a suspicion that the legitimate trade is involved in the production of illicit cigarettes as well. People are able to buy very cheap cigarettes in other countries and bring them to Ireland. As they pass through the airports, nobody checks whether they are carrying more than 800 cigarettes. I accept that there are some spot checks and spot searches. Large amounts of illicit tobacco are being brought into this country by individual travellers who purport to be carrying cigarettes for personal use. If one examines the prices of some flights, one will appreciate how quickly a profit can be made, especially by those who are prepared to travel a couple of times a week. The crackdown will continue. The Revenue Commissioners are chasing this up. The major price incentive associated with buying illicit tobacco makes it difficult to stop this activity.</p>

          <p eId="para_497">It is good to have the opportunity to talk on the Forestry Bill. The forestry industry is essential to the country and has massive potential to create extra jobs. Relative to some of the other things going on in the industry, what is covered in the Bill is basically moving the deckchairs around on the <i>Titanic</i>, sadly. We can move them around all we want but the <i>Titanic</i> is sinking. While the passengers might be sitting in a different place, it will not make any difference when they are drowning with water in their lungs.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> As the Minister of State is aware, I, along with members of the industry, have been trying to get some sort of investigation into alleged weight volume irregularities at Coillte. By tomorrow this will have gone on for a year. I do not have much faith in the Fine Gael Party. I do not believe in much of what it stands for, nor do I believe much of what its members say. In line with what many people say about the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, Deputy Coveney, I had some little bit of hope for him. That hope is fading fast. I hope he will prove me wrong. I have been trying to get him to respond for a year. I thought I had cynicism beaten into me at this stage, but it has gone up another level. My scepticism about whether the State is acting in the best interests of the people has increased further.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> Nearly a year ago I asked the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine if he was aware that Coillte had been defrauded by certain sawmills, if he was aware that by interfering in the sampling system used to quantify deliveries to sawmills the country was systematically defrauded, if he would direct an investigation into the facts of this fraud - alleged fraud - and if he would make a statement on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_506">We will respect the Chair. It might be a bit highfalutin to talk about how the country was systematically defrauded, but let us take it back to basics. My children, my neighbours' children and the future generations of this country are being defrauded and something needs to be done about it. I thought we had left the years of Haughey, Lawlor <i>et al</i> behind us. I hope we have.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> As nothing had happened by February, I asked the Minister for Justice and Equality if there was a Garda investigation into ongoing systematic weight volume fraud at Coillte Teoranta, and if he would make a statement. His answer stated he had requested a report from the Garda authorities on the matter and would contact me directly when the report came to hand. Before I outline what he said, it is important to point out that the people in the industry asked the Garda Síochána directly, as I did, and we were told there was an investigation ongoing. Let us not dance around the issue. The fact is our children are having money robbed from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> I received the following letter from the Minister:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_509">Dear Luke,</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_510"> I refer to Parliamentary Question No. 151 of 13 February 2013 asking if there is a Garda Síochána investigation ongoing into systemic weight to volume fraud at Coillte Teo, and if I would make a statement on the matter.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_511"> As you will recall, the information you requested could not be obtained in the time available, and I undertook to contact you again when a Garda report was to hand.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_512"> I have now received the Garda report and I am informed that the Garda authorities are not aware of any ongoing investigation into systematic weight volume fraud at Coillte Teo.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">The Minister, who is the boss of the Garda Síochána, told us he is not aware of any investigation and a member of the Garda Síochána told us there is an investigation. I wonder why the Minister of State present is wary of me talking about this, because I understood the Minister of State in question was looking forward to me coming in to talk on the Forestry Bill. Anyway that is what the Minister told us.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> One of the reasons the investigation would not be proceeding is that Coillte has not reported a problem. If someone came around to my house and robbed my television, I would certainly go to the Garda Síochána and report it. If someone robbed my forestry, I would certainly report it.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">On foot of this, Coillte contacted me and said, further to my contribution to the debate in the Dáil during the week about weight volume fraud in Coillte it would be very interested in and grateful for any information that I might have regarding same. I find that remarkable given that it had all the evidence. I wrote back and said any information it needed regarding weight volume fraud in Coillte was available within the organisation, as it knew. I suggested that the officials talk to their colleagues in senior management at Coillte Forests, the forestry arm of Coillte, who were well aware of this issue and that they ask why this had never been investigated by the Garda Síochána. I have not heard from them in response to that e-mail.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> Where did it go from there? I brought this matter up during a Private Members' debate on a motion tabled by Deputy Boyd Barrett. It was an excellent motion. I believe he played a very big part in stopping the sale of Coillte. In my speech I mentioned what the industry had brought to me. As a result, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, said he would try to do something about it. I wrote to him saying that during my contribution to the Private Members' debate tabled by the Technical Group on 26 and 27 February of this year I mentioned that Coillte had been systematically defrauded by certain sawmills. At the time the Minister commented that this was new information, although I had asked a Minister about it previously but we will let that slide, and that I should furnish him with the information. Given the complexity of this matter I told him that it would make far more sense to discuss this with him in person and also requested that he meet one of the affected parties, a particular sawmill.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> In the reply, which I received on 24 April, the Minister thanked me for my request regarding Coillte and said that he was making inquiries into the matter and would contact me shortly. As a result I and the industry people who had contacted me met with the Department. Unfortunately, the Minister was not present. He was busy. I can understand that because it is a very busy job and I will not criticise him for that. We left with the officials, including the assistant secretary to the Minister and we met a Coillte liaison officer from the Department. I will not name the people as there would be no benefit in that and it would not be fair to them. It is the Minister's job to ensure accountability. We met with these people, as well as with a legal team representing the people who had come to me with this information and we were told that an investigation would take place. In July of that year Coillte requested that we provide it with further information. We went to Wexford and met with Coillte officials. Slowly but surely we were getting a bit of hope that something would be done. At that stage this had been going on for seven months. That is a long time to be looking for justice. We met with them and provided further information and waited, and waited, and waited.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> A couple of weeks ago my office received a telephone call as a result of which my secretary wrote to the Minister to the effect that, further to a telephone conversation between my constituency office secretary and the Minister's office that morning, I looked forward to meeting the Minister the week after that to discuss the report on frauds in Coillte. I wished the Minister success in his trade mission because he had gone away. The industry representatives and I met with the Department. It was the most shocking meeting I have ever attended in my life. That is probably an understatement. It was probably the most shocking meeting anyone in politics could ever have attended in their life. GUBU would not describe it. We were met with stonewalling. People who have put decades of their life into developing this industry were shocked. One of those present said that until then he had been sorry to see people leave the country and pitied the families of those who were leaving but after that meeting he concluded that those who leave are right and that even more would leave because we live in a hellhole. That was the view of a very conservative, calm person after what he saw. We were looking for a serious investigation but we have not got it.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> We were pleased that the Minister gave a commitment to investigate this thoroughly in the first case as all other attempts to get Coillte to act on this complaint had failed. We had expected that the Minister would use his position as a shareholder in Coillte on behalf of the citizens of Ireland to get to the bottom of this issue. We were told that one of the reasons for his not being able to get information was that Coillte fobbed off the investigators by saying that the information needed was commercially sensitive and could not be given to the Minister, who effectively owns Coillte on behalf of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> I could have been shocked by that but I had met a similar obstacle when I was chair of an environment group, and a member of the corporate policy group. I was one of the people who should have been running Roscommon but when I looked for information it was refused on the grounds that it was commercially sensitive. At a local level I was told that something was too commercially sensitive to tell the people who run an organisation about it. Now the Minister is told that he cannot get information because it is commercially sensitive. How on earth are we supposed to swallow that? How on earth can it be true? The investigators were also very reliably informed that CCTV evidence existed of the alleged fraud yet they chose to accept Coillte’s reply that no evidence existed. The investigators did not even talk to the CCTV company. The investigators said they did not need to talk to the CCTV company because it is employed by Coillte. If someone robbed my house and the gardaí found the person they thought did it and asked that person did he or she rob my house and that person said "No" would they accept that? They would not. It would be ridiculous to accept that but that is the level of the investigation yet we are talking about tens of millions of euro, not my €359 television. We are talking about my children's money and that of future generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> To judge by the very lame investigation undertaken by Department officials there is a conflict of interest that can be remedied only by the Minister's appointing an independent third party outside the Civil Service, a senior counsel or equivalent, to conduct a proper investigation. The Department officials have even refused to report this to the AGS. People who have worked for years in the industry and have developed and driven it did not even have a report to take away from the meeting. That is an insult. These people, who should be running Coillte, not taking orders from it, are being told that they do not understand how it works. No civil servant could understand how the forestry industry should work better than those who work at the coalface.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> There may be tens of millions of euro at stake here. Apparently it is a commercial company. This same commercial company is coming to the State with a begging bowl looking for tens of millions of euro to subsidise its board plant. I suggest that the Department carry out an independent investigation into what it is doing with our money and our resources and then there will be plenty of money to invest in the board plant. Something has to be done about this. The Minister of State might say this has nothing to do with the Forestry Bill but there will be no point in the Forestry Bill if the industry goes down the tubes because no industry can be sustained on the basis of the facts being wrong. Something must be done about this. The media has ignored it. Is that a surprise? No it is not because we know who owns them bugles and who they stand for. The media can ignore it but believe me they are chattering about it as we speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">The anger is bubbling up about it. I ask the Minister to do something about it. </p>
          <p eId="para_524"> I have another two years left in the House, maybe no more. In the next two years I will do my damnedest every time the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, rises to his feet to make sure he does something about this issue. If I am given an opportunity to take part in Leaders' Questions next year, every week it will be mentioned. Why is this money being robbed from the State? Why is the right thing not being done? Why is the Government not accountable? Why is the Government not doing what it said it would do and why is it acting no better than former members Lawlor, Haughey, Burke<i> et al</i>?</p>

          <p eId="para_526">I congratulate the Government on being able to remove Coillte from the list of State assets that the previous Government agreed were to be sold. This decision was not only welcomed by me but by the thousands of my constituents who wanted our forests and their lands to remain in the ownership of the State and its citizens. Our forests do not only provide wood but immense pleasure to millions of people. More than 18 million visits are made to our forests every year which, incidentally, is almost two thirds the number who take a Luas journey every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> I welcome this long promised Bill which will replace the Forestry Act 1946 but I must express my concern that it has taken so long. I understand that consultation with the stakeholders first started on this Bill in 1998, 15 years ago. In 2005 a consultative group was set up to consider the 26 submissions made. After eight years of further consultation we now have this Bill before us. I hope that the new Oireachtas procedures for tabling a Bill can do better than this. I wish to acknowledge the efforts of our former colleague Shane McEntee in bringing the consultation process to a conclusion and I congratulate the current Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, on bringing his first Bill to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> Towards the end of the 19th century Ireland's forests had been reduced to about 1.5% of the total land cover or 125,000 ha. State involvement in forestry began in 1903 when the then Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction acquired Avondale Estate in County Wicklow and established a forestry training unit. Forestry growth has been a stop-start progression since with two world wars taking a heavy toll on our forests. The Forestry Act 1928 that empowered the Minister to compel the replanting of felled areas was a significant step in stopping the slide of forestry into oblivion. At that stage in the late 1920s there were only 89,000 ha, less than 1%, of forestry left. However, during the Second World War when timber and fuel were again scarce, planting levels fell and subsequent planting was mostly to replace trees felled during the war.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> The Forestry Act 1946<i>
						</i>remains the primary forestry legislation. To complement that Act the Government introduced an afforestation policy of planting 4,000 ha of trees per year and the first long-term afforestation programme was adopted in 1948. Happily, annual rates of afforestation continued to rise up to and through the 1970s but this level could not be maintained due to difficulties in acquiring suitable acreage. By the 1980s the rate of afforestation began to fall with the annual average rate of afforestation dropping to 5,700 ha.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> In the late 1980s the Government changed the way it managed its land portfolios and the Forestry Act 1988<i>
						</i>created Coillte Teoranta, the much-maligned Coillte as we have heard from the previous speaker. In his contribution in which he mentioned fraud, robbery, TVs being stolen and people breaking into houses I do not think he ever mention reporting it to the Garda. A commercial private body with a number of functions including timber production, provision of forestry amenities, protection of the forestry environment and community engagement, Coillte is the largest landowner in Ireland in that it now owns and manages more than a million acres. The purpose of setting up Coillte was to improve efficiency in the forestry industry while allowing for critical monitoring by Coillte.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> The Forest Service is responsible for setting national forest policy, control of tree felling, protection of the national forest estate from pests and disease, promotion of forest research and development, promotion of private forestry and administration of the State forestry grant.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> Under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Forest Service promotes sustainable forest management, SFM, as a central principle of Irish forest policy, whereby forests are managed in a way which maximises their potential and which is economically, socially and environmentally sustainable for present and future generations. The Council for Forest Research and Development, COFORD, was established in 1992 and its role is to co-ordinate forest and forest-product research in Ireland. COFORD achieves this with financial support provided by the Forest Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> Although an afforestation grant scheme has existed in Ireland since 1930, private afforestation was very limited until 1981 when the European Union set up and funded a special grant-aided afforestation programme. By the mid-1980s private afforestation started to increase. With financial assistance from the European Union, the State introduced further afforestation programmes and private afforestation increased rapidly to a peak of 17,353 ha planted in 1995 with a total of 23,710 ha of private and public forestry planted. Unfortunately, we have again witnessed a significant decline in new forest plantings since, with almost all new plantings being undertaken by private growers.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> Ireland has a target of covering 17% of the land mass in forestry by 2030 but we need to move quickly and efficiently to reach that target given that we are not even reaching 50% of our annual targets. If we were on target we should have 870,000 ha of forestry but we have only 744,000 ha. We need to create an additional 20,000 ha per year while we are planting only about 6,500 ha which means we will not reach our 2030 target until 2070 or 2080.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> We are all aware that the decision by the European Commission in 1999 and subsequently upheld by the European Court of Justice that debarred Coillte from claiming afforestation grants has stagnated growth in the forestry sector and that private landowners have been trying to make up the shortfall. We need a new impetus to promote growth in the forestry sector. To remedy the situation we must create a new investment vehicle that can attract European Union grants and match that with the management expertise of Coillte. Today I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of the State creating a special purpose vehicle or entity to allow citizens to invest in a forestry development company managed by Coillte. This could be a very productive partnership for all concerned in that it would allow for European funding through grant aid again to allow the expansion of the forestry land cover, increase employment and reduce carbon emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> I pay tribute to the work of Coillte in expanding the business by taking over some of the manufacturing plants for wood products and creating new markets for Irish wood products.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> Much greater consideration needs to be given to the neighbours of our forests. We need to consult with those living beside forests particularly when areas are about to be planted or about to be felled. As I stated earlier over 18 million people visit our forests every year but I would like to see that figure multiply many times in the coming years. We need to encourage more people to visit these wonderful and spectacular areas and encourage a greater sense of ownership in order that our forests are never again under threat of being taken over by foreign investment cabals. We do not need to see those who caused many of our economic problems profiting by it.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> We need to create more designated and signposted walks and cycleways. We should encourage and allow for more adventure parks to be created in our forests. They attract millions of extra visitors to the forests in England, Scotland and Wales. We should also ask the Forestry Service in conjunction with the National Parks and Wildlife Service to examine the facilities provided by the National Parks Service in the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> I call on people to consider visiting their millennium forests. These trees were planted in the 17 designated areas right around the country at the turn of the century. These trees are now taking shape. It would be a good idea if the Minister was to update the millennium trees website with up-to-date photographs of these now maturing forests and encourage all our citizens to visit their millennium forests and trees.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> I hope the forestry sector will grow dramatically in the coming decades similar to our millennium forests. I believe the Bill is a step in the right direction.</p>

          <p eId="para_542"> It is worth putting on record that in 2012, the forestry sector contributed some €2.2 billion to the Irish economy. Overall, afforestation levels are about 10.5%. While that is low compared to many of our European counterparts, it is increasing and is a good deal higher than it was before. This is important and positive. It is an indigenous commodity and a rural-based industry providing jobs for rural Ireland. It is an export-led industry with some 78% of products being exported. That is very positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> Regarding my area, I acknowledge the role of ECC Timber Products Limited in Corr na Mona in Connemara in County Galway and the importance of that company to the local economy in bringing in and processing timber from long distances. The industry has good projections into the future, which is positive. Some 731,650 hectares of land are afforested. The State owns about 54% and private plantations own 46%. It contributes 1.3% of GDP and employs some 12,000 people. As Deputy Harrington said, some 18 million recreational visits are made to Irish forests, which is a huge industry in its own right and relates to the use people make of our forests in rural areas, particularly broad-leaf plantations. It is good to see that since the revised support scheme was put in place in 1996, broad-leaf plantations have increased and some 38% of new plantings in 2010 were broad leaf. </p>
          <p eId="para_544"> Forests play a huge role not just in respect of the industry and the importance of exports but also in terms of the landscape of our rural society. Our hedgerows also play a role. A treeless landscape would be a lesser landscape for locals and visitors alike. One of the most common landscape trees is our ash tree. It is also very important to the broad-leaf sector because it is the most important broad-leaf tree in Ireland. I commend the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Tom Hayes; the previous Minister of State, Shane McEntee; and Department officials on the very positive measures and engagement they have had on this issue, which can still have very serious consequences for our ash trees, indigenous industry and forestry industry. As an island, Ireland is possibly in a unique position regarding the ability to eradicate this disease where other countries only have the possibility of containing it. I commend those involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> One issue that has been brought to my attention concerns the EU national renewable energy action plan. The welcome targets include one of 16% of Ireland's energy to be met from renewable sources and another that all peat-fired power generation stations would be 30% co-fired with wood biomass by 2020. Some concerns have been raised within the sector regarding its ability to meet this target without using some of the more valuable timber products as distinct from the biomass <i>per se</i>. It would be a matter of concern if in order to meet these targets in our peat-fired stations, they would have to burn timber that was more valuable as a commodity in terms of further processing. That is a something to keep an eye in the future as those targets are raised. </p>
          <p eId="para_546"> Section 6(<i>a</i>)(ii) refers to the aerial fertilisation of forests. I am not sure how much of that goes on anymore. To the best of my knowledge, it has ceased in my area in Connemara following much concern about the pollution of our streams, rivers and lakes. Obviously, the use of high levels of rock phosphate in forestry plantations can lead to it leaching into lakes following aerial application and cause eutrophication or algal blooms in our waterways. I am not sure how much of that is going on at the moment. If it is, I am sure there are stringent plans in terms of applications, rates, timing of applications, weather conditions when applications are made and proximity of applications to existing streams, rivers and lakes. I am sure that is in the plan and if not, it should be. </p>
          <p eId="para_547"> Section 6(<i>b</i>) talks about forest management plans and conditions that could be attached to these plans. It is a requirement that is laid down in the functions the Minister of State has in terms of the environmental responsibility that will ensue with this Bill and that is important. I hope the costs that might be associated with those will not be prohibitive. </p>
          <p eId="para_548"> Section 6(<i>e</i>) talks about powers regarding compulsory purchase of lands that would be deemed suitable. That could be contentious if those powers are pursued. I appreciate that there is much land that is very much suited to forestry. When I prepared REPS plans in the past, I was obliged to declare those plots which were most suited to forestry plantations. Powers as outlined in section 6(<i>e</i>) could be contentious.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> Section 14 relates to the risk of fires from uncultivated land. It is somewhat similar to the discussion we had on other issues regarding land abandonment and under-utilisation of large tracts of land, particularly commonage land. Again, instead of penalising farmers, it would be better if the Department was more focused on making sure under-utilised and commonage lands were utilised to their full potential, which would reduce the possibility of fires coming from those areas. I agree that under-utilised and under-grazed land is a significant risk to our forests. Rather than penalising farmers, perhaps the way to go is for the Department to put in place policies to ensure those lands are better utilised. </p>
          <p eId="para_550"> I welcome the description of exempted trees in section 18 and definitions and understandings contained therein such as invasive trees, scrub trees or willow, which will be utilised for fuel. I have concerns about the plight of the native holly tree. Could any protection be put in place for this tree? I am not talking about people taking a sprig or branch of holly for decorations coming up to Christmas. Cutting the full tree and the full berries would be of concern to me in respect of rural Ireland because they are scarce and unfortunately, there have been cases of people cutting a full tree to sell on the markets in various places.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> I could not find where it was stipulated in the Bill but I see in the explanatory memorandum that the Minister has discretion to set conditions for the felling licence which will include the waiving of the requirement to replant following clear felling. I understand the requirements to replant, which are based on the fact that the State is putting huge resources into forestry and that when land is forested and clear felled, it wants to mandate people to replant. However, we must take note of certain situations, particularly in SACs or forested lands in close proximity to SACs, which would be lakes and rivers in my area. Anglers have raised concerns with me about that and how it should be easier to receive a derogation in those cases. No more than aerial fertilisation, certain types of trees such as Sitka spruce and certain types of pine can be damaging to our waterways because of needles falling into the water and causing acidification. This is possibly under the management plans and I know there is certification that certain bodies have in respect of realistic mandatory riparian zones along lakes and waterways and that peatlands should not be planted down to the edge of lakes, streams or rivers. That was something that was looked for as well. There has been a change with regard to clear felling which is now more piecemeal than before. Again, there were concerns about large-scale clear felling on peatlands which would lead to leaching of nutrients into streams, rivers and lakes in high-rainfall areas in the west, which would have a negative impact. That is not to overemphasise those concerns. </p>
          <p eId="para_552"> Forestry has huge potential for our economy and is very important to the rural economy and job creation. I welcome the positive increases in broad-leaf tree planting over the years in terms of aesthetics and the very welcome and important environmental benefits that come from those types of trees. I commend the Minister and his officials for the work they have done on this Bill and hope it will lay the foundations for a further increase in levels and hectarage of commercial forestry planted in this country.</p>

        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_299">
          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_553">I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this legislation. I wish the Minister of State the best of luck with steering it through the House. This is his maiden legislation as an Aire Stáit and I am sure that it is the first of many Bills that he will handle. We all need to remember our former colleague in the House, Shane McEntee, particularly at this time of the year. Our thoughts are with the McEntee family on the difficult anniversary that is approaching and with the many families in similar circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> I welcome the Government's decision earlier this year on the sale of Coillte. Quite a number of complex issues were raised on foot of the potential disposal of Coillte lands. I am glad that the Government listened to contributions made within and without the Houses, took those concerns on board and made its decision. It is important that we acknowledge this fact. Far too often, Ministers are not prepared to listen to other opinions and bull-headedly proceed with particular decisions. One of the main issues that arose was that of public access. It was also raised in the UK in respect of the potential disposal of its state forestry.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> Now that a decision has been taken, we cannot ignore the forestry sector's considerable potential. Many of the contributions in the House have been focused on the forestry industry and the Minister of State's focus is on the commercial aspects, but there is considerable tourism and recreational potential. In fairness to Coillte, it has made efforts in this regard. The example that springs to mind is Lough Key Forest Park in my constituency. Ballyhoura is another great example of where Coillte has opened up forestry. That said, much more can be done to expand the tourism sector. According to a study conducted by the Irish Forestry and Forest Products Association, IFFPA, tourism activity in forests is valued at approximately €97 million and generates downstream activity of €268 million per annum. We have an ideal climate for this type of outdoor activity. Coillte owns a large landbank. While it has been proactive in developing some of its forest assets, others have been ignored. The sector needs additional focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> I tabled a proposal to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, on establishing a national wetland park in the midlands. There will be greater co-ordination and co-operation between Coillte and Bord na Móna, which together have a massive landbank. Bord na Móna's large cutaway bog in the Mountdillon complex in west Longford-east Roscommon is surplus to requirements. If that bog of approximately 18,000 acres was allowed to be flooded naturally, it would make for a large bio-park in the midlands and would be a major amenity to a part of the country that did not see a significant amount of economic development during the boom except for housing developments. We have plenty of houses and no one to live in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> There is no other purpose for the 18,000 acres of cutaway bog. One has not even been suggested. Many of the villages around that landbank have a large number of vacant houses that were developed under the Shannon tax corridor scheme. These could easily be marked as part of a tourism package involving outdoor activities, for example, walking, cycling, horse riding, etc. This would help to unlock many of the completed ghost estates while developing a major international tourism asset in the middle of the country on either side of the River Shannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> I make this proposal in the context of our debate because Coillte's Slieve Bawn adjoins the 18,000 acres of cutaway bog. It is the only significant hill or mountain in the middle of County Roscommon. There has been a great deal of controversy recently, though, as Coillte has sought planning permission to develop wind turbines on Slieve Bawn. Since it is an exposed site in the middle of the country, there would be a visual impact on the entire region. We need greater co-operation between Coillte and Bord na Móna in the development of the site as a strategic tourism asset, one that could help to ensure that people occupy those vacant houses, at least on a seasonal basis. Walking tourism is a growing market internationally. We have a perfect climate to attract people. With a bit of co-ordination, we could also have plenty of accommodation for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> It would not take a significant investment to open up the landbank, as there is a network of old roads and cart tracks across bogs, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows well. There is also the old permanent rail track that was used to service the power station at Lanesborough. Interestingly, UCD worked with the local communities on both sides of the River Shannon to conduct a feasibility study. The proposal has the support of both local authorities. I hope that someone in government will take ownership of it and drive it forward, but no one seems to be prepared to do so. No other purpose is available to that landbank and it could act as a major tourism asset that would attract people to a part of the country that has not seen its tourism sector developed to its full potential. This would also be of significant benefit to the rest of the country, as people who visit the midlands also visit the north, south, east and west of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> I have encountered an issue. We have a fabulous asset in Mote Park outside Roscommon town, where Coillte has developed a number of walks. It is a great public amenity. However, I have a concern about obligatory replanting. I understand the Government's logic and the merit of including this provision in the legislation, particularly where people have private lands that they do not want to commit to a particular land use in perpetuity. Regarding State lands controlled by Coillte, though, I do not see why there should not continue to be obligatory replanting. There has been no effort to replant in my part of the country where clear felling took place a number of years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">My fear is that Coillte is looking at this as an opt-out clause in order that it does not have to undertake replanting. Coillte should at least ensure that where clear felling has taken place on State lands, they should be replanted without delay in the interests of developing such areas as public amenities and long-term strategic assets. There are economic benefits to be gained from forestry and it is to be hoped this legislation will provide an incentive for further plantation because we have hit less than 50% of our targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> Many forest areas are in parts of the country that have been designated as disadvantaged areas where lands are marginal. Forestry can provide a guaranteed income stream to many farming families in such areas. We should encourage such developments to take place. Not only does forestry contribute directly to the economic survival of some rural families but it can stimulate employment. It is estimated that employment could be increased by about 38,000 by 2025 if the private forestry sector is supported in attaining the Government's afforestation and timber targets. It is imperative for us to ensure that happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> Many farmers are wondering if funding will remain in place in the long term, which is a concern. Negotiations are taking place on how to allocate the cake for the single farm payment and Pillar 1 funding. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has made submissions concerning Pillar 2 funding to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin. I would be concerned if we were looking at anything less than an equal 50-50 split for the Government's co-financing of Pillar 2.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> The Government is to be commended on the creation of new jobs. Yesterday's CEO figures show that of the 58,000 new jobs created, some 25,000 or 43% of them have been in the agricultural sector. No other economic sector provides a 3:1 return on investment. Because we are a small open economy, much expenditure is lost abroad, but the agri-sector creates an economic stimulus without any such leakage outside the country. In addition, such expenditure in the agrifood area remains largely in rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> The vast bulk of jobs created outside the agricultural areas have been in the Dublin area. Dublin is a different world from the rest of the country at the moment because it is thriving, but many rural towns have been decimated. The ones that are surviving best are those based on a surrounding agricultural hinterland. If State funding is reduced in Pillar 2 and co-financing is on a 30% or 35% basis rather than 50%, we will be taking about €1 billion out of the rural economy over the next seven years. That will have a devastating impact on many rural businesses, including the agrifood trade that relies on such expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> In my part of the country there is a lot of Pillar 2 funding from the rural environment protection and suckler cow welfare schemes. Many businesses rely on that money coming in. We have seen a significant fall-off in that funding this year and I fear that, in the longer term, we will see a levelling out of funding based on a 2013 benchmark rather than a maximising of the amount of money that could potentially be spent under Pillar 2 funding. There is a significant economic dividend involved in that process. I hope the Minister's proposal will be for 50-50 funding. Given yesterday's CSO figures, it is imperative to maximise this opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> In my part of the country we do not have a large amount of tillage but where it does occur, bees are very important. There is a major problem with the decline of the bee population, not just in Ireland but elsewhere in Europe also. The economic significance of bees in the agricultural sphere cannot be underestimated. We are facing challenges from that decline but Coillte has a widespread land bank. Forests are ideal locations for beehives, so the Minister of State should actively encourage them throughout Coillte's land. This is not happening in the private sector and I cannot see us introducing grants for beehives. Perhaps in a few years time we will have a ten and 22-month premium for beehives. I would love to see the departmental officials punching the bees for that one.</p>

          <p eId="para_569">Yes. There are a few inspectors I would like to see carrying out that inspection regime. We have a significant problem concerning our bee population, while there is a significant landbank. Therefore, the two sectors could dovetail with Coillte to establish beehives. I am not saying that in jest because this major issue needs to be addressed. Coillte could carry the can in that regard and it would improve the overall bee population.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> We have not sufficiently examined the economic potential of biodiversity in our forests. It concerns not only the tourism aspect but the medical side as well. Multinational companies travel the world to identify rare botanical species in the Amazon that may be used to create new medicinal products, yet we have them on our doorstep. Those endeavours may be seen as somewhat airy-fairy but they are not because there is much economic advantage to be gained. Sometimes in this country we fail to see the potential available in mundane things that could create new industries.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> The Bill provides for more authorised officers. We have seen a fall-off in funds that are being drawn down through the Department under various agricultural schemes, yet we still have a large number of inspectors. I suggest the special investigations unit should be seconded to the Revenue Commissioners to examine fuel laundering and other cross-Border black market activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">There is huge potential for savings to the Exchequer of €40 million to €50 million per annum from unidentified black market trading. It would be far more useful to focus this skill set on identifying this type of trading rather than on prosecuting farmers who make over-declarations in relation to agricultural roads going through their farms.</p>

          <p eId="para_574">I welcome this Bill, which has been long awaited. I understand this is the first time the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, has brought a Bill through the House. I wish him well. It is a good Bill to start with given its goal is the development of a modern forestry sector which reflects good forestry practices and protects the environment. At long last, we are starting to concentrate in this country on the things we do best and are part of our natural resources. In this regard, I welcome the tourism initiative of The Gathering which it is estimated resulted in an additional 250,000 people coming to Ireland this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> Statistics released yesterday by the Central Statistics Office indicate a significant increase in the past two years in the number of people in primary production in agriculture, fisheries and forestry. We are back to basics. In the most recent two Budget Statements reference was made in the first and second paragraphs to agriculture and the agri-sector. The forestry sector is a hugely important part of who we are. As stated by others, Coillte owns 7% of the land mass here and almost 300,000 hectares are currently in private ownership. Thanks to the afforestation programme, this is increasing by 7,000 to 7,500 hectares per annum year on year. As this is a growing sector, it is only fitting that it would have legislation to reflect its current importance to the economy and environment and, in particular, rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> A forest has many attributes and provides many assets for communities, including raw material for the timber processing sector. Coillte and the private processors have turned an industry previously 80% domestic based during the building boom years into a 20% domestic based industry, with 80% of all processed wood product now being exported. This took some effort and a lot of product development. The Department forest service and Coillte have an important role to play in the development with the private sector of new technology in this area. </p>
          <p eId="para_577"> I welcome the reversal of the decision to sell the harvest rights of Coillte. I note consideration is currently being given to a merger of Coillte with Bord na Móna. I urge that this be proceeded with cautiously and that all of the implications of a full or part merger be considered. I welcomed the Minister's statement some weeks ago that he proposed to engage with the stakeholders in regard to the Forestry Bill. It is important there is engagement with these stakeholders in respect of any proposed merger. If it goes ahead, it must be in the best interests of land use. Between them, Coillte and Bord na Móna own approximately 12% of total land in this country. This land is publicly owned and has a myriad of potential in terms of timber production, biofuel production, recreational use, carbon sink and so on. It is important all these factors, in terms of what is the best fit for the two entities, are taken into account. I would have preferred if that had been developed further at this stage. However, these things take time. </p>
          <p eId="para_578"> Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify when replying that this Bill has implications for forestry, in particular replanting and felling, in the public and private sector. There appears to be some doubt in this regard. I come from Wicklow, where more than 20% of the land is covered by forestry. It is the most afforested county in the country. The first forestry school was established at the home of Charles Stewart Parnell in 1903. My son is currently doing a degree in forestry. While forestry education is now mainstreamed in our universities, there is still a role for forest bases such as Avondale in the practical training of undergraduates. The practical experience gained by young students in working with foresters and forestry technicians, which students we need to develop this industry into the future, is invaluable. I have seen this work first-hand. </p>
          <p eId="para_579"> There are a couple of other issues that might be considered as part of this Bill, perhaps by way of amendment on Committee Stage. One such issue is that of fires and upland vegetation, in particular in Wicklow where the burning control regulations are stricter than in Northern Ireland and Scotland. This is leading to a greater risk of sporadic fire outbreaks. The topography of the land in Wicklow is such that Coillte and private operators often touch on national parks where these restrictive burning practices are currently in place. This does nothing for the vegetation, other than allow it to get to the stage whereby it is neither suitable for grazing, hill walking or proper fire containment.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> Another issue is the definition of unenclosed land for the purposes of grant aid. I am not sure whether the forestry division of the Department has already looked at this. The definition of unenclosed land is too restrictive and grants in respect of this land are not good. I believe that land that is eminently suitable for plantation is being ruled out because it is too expensive to plant and because unenclosed land has a lower grant aid rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> I agree with Deputy Naughten's remarks in regard to bio-diversity and the value of forests. We do not always calculate how important the trees and woodland are from a bio-diversity point of view. There are also a carbon sink. During the last Dáil I was rapporteur for the climate change and energy security and agriculture committees on research on the use of forestry as a carbon sink in meeting our climate change targets. There is no doubt that of the order of 80% of all the carbons sequestered over the lifetime of a forest plantation could be used as a saving with the other 20% being used in the establishment of harvesting. This is an important issue that should be considered in the context of our meeting our obligations. We are in the irreconcilable position of having to drive Food Harvest 2020 output targets at the same time as trying to meet our climate change obligations. Unless we make the case that we be allowed to meet those targets by counting every use of land, we face the imposition of a fine from Europe. It is important we make that case.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> I am sure the Minister of State would not expect me to end my contribution without reference to deer. In this regard, I would like to raise two issues and will reference in a minute an article in the media yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">I hope to plant more land and was not surprised to be told it would have to be fenced for deer. There has been a difficulty in obtaining approval for plantations in Wicklow because of the numbers of deer. Non-native invasive species such as the Sitka deer have become a scourge, as both private owners and Coillte will confirm. Part of the reason is that upland vegetation is not conducive to grazing. In addition, hybrid vigour has increased the population significantly. We need a management plan that will bring such species to sustainable levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> It is important that we have a measured debate in the context of a broad-ranging review of these issues. I look forward to the Minister of State bringing the Bill to committee where we will have an opportunity for the finer tuning that is required. I commend the Government on its efforts thus far to open the issue up to further consultation.</p>

          <p eId="para_585">As a Deputy representing Sligo-North Leitrim I am well aware of the importance of the forestry industry in Ireland. Our forests are a vital natural resource which, at the same time, can present a challenge within communities. Forestry accounts for 11% of Ireland's land use, which compares unfavourably with a figure of 30% globally and up to 40% in Europe. In Leitrim, 16% of land is under afforestation, with the figure for Sligo being 12%. These percentages are above the national average and are, in part, a reflection of the rural character of both counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> The introduction of this Bill is timely. It includes several proposals dealing with existing inadequacies that require to be addressed. Issues regarding the felling of mature forests have implications under many headings. For example, the blight it causes on our scenic environment can be immense. More than three years ago an area of forestry was felled at a beautiful location just outside Drumshanbo in County Leitrim which was known locally as the Acres amenity. The forestry site overlooks Acres Lake, which sees cruise traffic along the Shannon-Erne navigation waterway and is beside an outdoor swimming pool and playground operated by Leitrim County Council. The tree felling was undertaken legally by the private owner and had to be done as the trees had matured. However, locals were perturbed at what they saw as the blight on the landscape when the trees were removed, leaving behind a barren landscape. This is a situation that will be addressed under the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> Another key provision is the introduction of changes to the felling licence system. A single licence will now be required as opposed to the two separate licences required under the 1946 Act, namely, a general licence and a limited licence. In addition, applications will no longer have to go before the Garda Síochána and will instead go through the Minister of the day. In the past 30 years we have seen an enormous increase in the number of private forestry owners and a corresponding increase in the number of felling licence applications. The view among the private sector is that the current system is not fit for purpose. The proposals in the Bill will reduce the amount of red tape and expedite the processing of felling applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> The protection of the environment is always an important consideration and I welcome measures contained within the Bill to address this issue. Section 11 provides that the Minister must consider whether specific impact assessments should be carried out, including a screening for an environmental impact assessment and the submission of an environmental impact statement. Such impact studies are common in respect of other planning applications and are necessary in a context where felling decisions can have a significant impact on communities. There have been several stand-offs in this regard with local authorities in recent years. Engineers representing county councils have expressed the view that the level of financial deposits or payment does not adequately compensate the local authority for the damage done to small local roads. That is a major issue. The Minister might address these concerns in his reply and outline the input of the Minister of the day in respect of the consideration of a felling licence by the relevant local authority. I understand some councils adopt different approaches to tree-felling contractors by insisting on more in the way of regulations such as a limitation on the size of vehicular access to a felling site, thus reducing the amount of timber that can be brought out at any one time. We must adopt universal regulations in consultation with the timber industry, haulage contractors and local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> The decision of the Government not to proceed with the sale of Coillte is very welcome considering the work the company does and the resources it offers communities, such as Lough Key Forrest and Activity Park in Boyle, County Roscommon. Forest walks maintained by Coillte in my own county of Sligo are a wonderful amenity. There is work to be done, in tandem with Fáilte Ireland, Coillte and the local authorities, in examining how we can further develop our forests as walking and leisure trails.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> I welcome the proposals on replanting and ask the Minister to enforce a timeframe of replanting within the felling licence to ensure the eyesore of recently harvested land can be quickly turned around, especially in the vicinity of lakes and other scenic areas. I take this opportunity to recall the important work of our late colleague and Minister of State, Shane McEntee, in preparing the ground for these proposals. Many of us remember him and his contribution to the betterment of the forestry industry in Ireland as we contribute to this debate.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_591">This Bill updates existing forestry law in several ways. It gives the Minister the power to make regulations for the effective management of the forestry sector and the protection of trees. It introduces a revised felling licence system and assigns powers to authorised officers to enforce the Forestry Acts. The introduction of the legislation follows consultation and reviews of the forestry industry in recent years. The conclusion of this process was that the existing regulatory framework for forestry is inadequate to deal with the complexities of a modern and sustainable forestry sector which places greater emphasis on protection of the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> In 2012 a report by Teagasc entitled Situation and Outlook for Forestry 2011-2012 indicated that in 2010, the overall value of forestry to the Irish economy was €673 million. It also stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_593">Direct output in the wood products sectors (i.e. panel board mills, sawmills and other wood products sector) was €1.3 billion. The total value (direct and indirect) to the economy of the three wood processing sectors was €2.2 billion. The aggregate employment figure for the forest sector as a whole is estimated at close to 12,000 persons, the majority of whom are employed in rural Ireland. The aggregate employment figure for the forest sector as a whole is estimated at close to 16,000, the majority of whom are employed in rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">These jobs are provided across the sector, in activities such as growing, harvesting and processing of forest products. There is a significant demand for timber as a raw material at present, and that demand is expected to increase in the next 20 years where, in addition to the traditional outlets in the wood processing sectors, the wood energy sector is also developing into a substantial market.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> Ireland predominantly exports wood products to the United Kingdom. In fact, we have a 5% share of the overall UK timber market. Irish saw mills also export limited volumes of mostly low-category timber, mainly to markets in France, Belgium and Holland. Overall timber demand is expected to increase. To avoid medium-term shortfalls in wood fibre and meet the demands of our export-driven timber processing sector, mobilisation of private timber resources is necessary. The State has made a significant investment in the development of forestry over the years in order to ensure there is a critical mass of timber coming on stream to sustain the timber and timber products sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> Forest cover nationally stands at almost 11%. Privately owned forest accounts for some 46% of this, most of which is in the ownership of farmers. Forest cover is good for the environment. It has the capacity to enhance the rural landscape and, when managed sensitively, can play an important role in the protection of river catchment. Forestry-related tourism contributes to the economy and benefits society in general. More than 20 million visits are made annually to Irish forests, with over 200,000 people using forest trails for exercise. Trekking through forests is an important aspect of walking tourism, a sector which attracts 500,000 visitors who spend €128 million annually. These benefits represent a return on the investment by the State in the development of Irish forestry and the forestry industry in recent decades through the provision of forest grants and premiums to landowners.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> Forestry is also an important aspect of national policies such as the climate change strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Forests contribute to reducing Ireland's carbon emissions through the use of wood fuels and wood products that replace imported fossil fuels and energy intensive products such as steel, plastic and aluminium. The use of wood to produce heat and electricity in Ireland resulted in an estimated reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 560,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2012. The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the subsequent impact on global warming is clearly an important environmental benefit of forests and forest products. The Bill recognises the important contribution forests can make in mitigating the adverse effects of climate change.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelColreavy" eId="spk_306">
          <from>Deputy Michael Colreavy<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_599">My colleagues, Deputies Martin Ferris and Seán Crowe, have spoken previously on the Bill and have referred to many of the important aspects of the proposed legislation and to the general policy relating to forestry. I echo their welcome of the news that there is to be no sale of Coillte or its forestry assets. That is in the best interests of the forestry sector. Maintaining Coillte lands and forestry in State ownership provides the potential for the development of these assets in the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> Perhaps the decision with regard to Coillte has set a precedent. I was pleased to welcome today the decision by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, to reject the offers received to date for Bord Gáis Energy. I hope the Government will forget about any sale and proceed with the development of the energy sector in public ownership and in the best interests of citizens. At the committee meeting today I offered to work actively with the Minister and the Department in that venture.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> Last week I was pleased to meet representatives of Coillte and the Irish Wind Energy Association to discuss the future use of Coillte lands. It is clear the people in Coillte envisage the company as a significant operator in the wind energy area. That Coillte owns such a large proportion of the land area suitable for wind farms means this makes sense. I see merit in the proposal from the wind energy sector that the Bill be amended in Part 2, section 5 to refer specifically and directly to the encouragement of wind energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> There are many issues relating to the use of forestry land for the purpose of developing wind energy. Some parts of the forestry estate are eminently suitable, especially where there are no trees or where the trees are of low value in terms of timber quality. At the same time, we have no wish for a situation resulting in the large-scale clearance of trees to build wind farms. Areas harvested ought to be replaced by replanted forests of the same area. Nor is it desirable that other uses of forests, including commercial harvesting, should be set aside in favour of wind farms. Striking the balance is of the utmost importance and can be furthered through the Bill, if necessary, by incorporating amendments reflecting the different interests involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> Another issue regarding the possible expansion of Coillte's role in promoting wind energy is whether the company should retain a direct interest in wind farms or lease land to be used by private companies for that purpose. Where this has occurred, it has caused public disquiet because it is believed the process of leasing such lands and the people to whom it has been leased is not transparent. There is a suspicion that the ownership of proposed wind farms is not apparent when the projects are approved. It is important also that a caveat would be included in the legislation and title documents to the effect that the owners of Coillte lands are expressly forbidden to lease, sublet or sell land for activities connected with hydraulic fracturing.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> Renewable energy, of which wind power will continue to be a significant contributor in this country, is highly desirable. It is all the more important, therefore, that local communities and individuals living in the vicinity of wind farms are not made hostile to the sector through the perception or the reality that the sector appears to take little cognisance of local concerns. This raises the issue of choices and options having been decided before consultation begins, an issue to which I referred at the committee meeting today. Addressing the concerns communities and bringing them along will be crucial if publicly owned lands are to be used and if Coillte, as a publicly owned body, is to be directly involved in the development of wind power. The preference of my party is that if public lands are used, the wind farms should either be leased to local community projects with the possibility of directly meeting local energy requirements or maintained in the ownership of Coillte and, therefore, of the public. Significant investment costs would arise in this case but, as I understand it, Coillte is well-financed and in a sound position.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> Coillte lands are central to the current plans to develop extensive wind farms in the midlands, currently leased to Element Power. The energy generated is to be exported to Britain, some 3,000 MW by 2018. When one considers that the current capacity in the State is a little over two thirds of the proposed export, one can envisage the scale of what is proposed. While I agree that energy exports could realise a significant economic benefit to the country in future, especially when we begin to develop tidal and wave generation fully, I am concerned that such a large-scale project has been agreed prior to the State achieving its own targets and becoming self-sufficient in electricity generation from wind power. I suggest that until these targets are attained, we should not consider energy exports. We need a cohesive comprehensive strategy covering energy, natural resources and, crucially, landscape management, irrespective of whether the energy is for use at home or abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> We are considering the Bill with regard to the use of Coillte lands and the ownership of the energy to be generated with a view to determining whether these issues might be addressed in a certain way. Our aim is to ensure that if the forestry lands are used for renewable energy projects, it would be as part of a co-ordinated State strategy to push ahead with the achievement of electricity self-sufficiency and to balance the use of the public forestry with other commercial and public environmental issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> There are concerns regarding felling licences and the thinning of forests and a belief among some stakeholders that extra delays and bureaucracy are being proposed. Again, these issues can be addressed through amendments. Another issue which might be addressed is the question of replanting. As the Bill stands, the Minister has discretion regarding replanting. Others argue that where an area of public forestry is harvested, it ought to be mandatory for a similar area to be replanted. This would apply to the commercial use of forestry for timber but it would also be relevant in situations where wind farms are installed on forestry lands.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> I have received representations from constituents regarding the fact that a townland is currently 80% forestry but is proposed to be totally planted, that is, 100% forested, a change which would have an impact on the area. No consultation or planning occurred in that case. A local farmer in the same area was refused a loan to expand his farming operation but was offered a loan to plant trees. I realise this does not come under the legislation but it is something that should be considered. It is wrong to have inducements to plant trees in areas where it might be perfectly possible to carry out a decent agriculture industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> I recognise the need to update the legislation governing forestry but I believe there are aspects of the use of the public forestry, including those to which I have referred, which are not fully, explicitly or sufficiently addressed in the proposed legislation. I hope these issues can be addressed through various amendments as the Bill proceeds, and I hope the Minister will take on board some of the issues involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> When the Gas Regulation Bill was being debated in the Dáil today, an important meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications was taking place. The Minister had to rush from that meeting to address the Dáil on the Gas Regulation Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">It makes no sense that a committee meeting would be scheduled for the same time as an important debate in the Dáil. Important debates were scheduled both in the committee rooms and in the Chamber and I for one cannot be in two places at one time. Surely, it is not beyond the planners and diary managers in this place to ensure that if a committee meeting is scheduled in respect of communications, energy and natural resources, the debate on the Bill would be held in the Dáil Chamber at a different time, thereby avoiding conflicts. This made no sense.</p>

          <p eId="para_613">Yes. I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on this Bill and wish the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, all the best on the passage through the House of his first Bill in his new portfolio.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> As a people, we can take trees for granted and perhaps Members remember the poem by Joyce Kilmer from their school days that states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_615">I think I will never see</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_616">A poem as lovely as a tree.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">This is true and highly apt for this debate. There of course is another side in respect of trees and forestry, which is that they are a valuable asset to us as a people. As a member of the Labour Party and a Government Member, I am glad that forestry has been held within the ownership of the country and for its people. As an industry, Irish forestry is estimated to be worth more than €673 million to the economy and in 2010, it is estimated that the industry employed 12,000 people throughout Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> Forestry is extremely important in my native county of Waterford and at present, Coillte manages forests in Dungarvan, Kilmacthomas, Portlaw, Melleray, the beautiful Vee, Ballyduff, Knockanore and in Tramore, where I grew up. A total of 300 people are employed directly in forestry in the south-east area between the Port of Waterford and in Clonmel. A further 500 people are estimated to be employed indirectly by activities in these two sites alone between haulage, harvesting and logistics. Given my knowledge of employment and access thereto in Waterford and the south east, these are important statistics for my constituency and those who live and work there.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> I recently visited SmartPly, a factory based in the Port of Waterford, which makes an alternative to plywood with which it is easy to work. It uses the trees from across the south east, which are brought to Waterford and used in the production process. I understand that SmartPly has sought and hopes to attract significant investment to further its future, thereby enhancing further people's employability and ensuring it is a sustainable business in Waterford and the south east. It is vital that companies such as SmartPly have a reliable and sustainable supply of good quality wood to ensure their future and I for one am glad this debate is being held and that the legislation before Members will do just that.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> This is the reason that providing the requisite updating to legislation in respect of managing forestry and the plants it has produced are to be welcomed. As this Bill proposes to update legislation, will promote good practice and will protect and develop the forestry industry, it is to be hoped that no other arm of Government will try to do anything that would put forestry in harm's way through the erection of pylons across some of the most beautiful forestry - in particular across the Comeragh Mountains - to which I would object most vigorously.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> Yesterday, the IFA held a conference in Athlone focusing on forestry and the message from it was that farmers in County Waterford and throughout Ireland must have the confidence in the sector they require to convert their land to forestry. I hope this Bill will assist in that and will go some way towards giving them such assurances. Only 11% of the country is under forest, whereas the national strategic target for forestry is to increase that coverage to approximately 17%. Therefore, it is clear we have some way to go in this regard. The various interest groups call for continued Government investment in the area, which I support.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> The Bill also pertains to a matter that is in focus, namely, the environment. It is vital to protect both the trees and the wildlife that depends on them. At present, for example, there is a concern regarding the threat from ash dieback, which is of particular interest to County Waterford and its hurlers. Vigilance is required to make sure it does not take hold here and I acknowledge this is a matter of concern to everyone present, because it is an important sector for the economy. While I welcome the updates contained in this legislation, I must also stress it is important that the forests remain accessible to citizens. I recently encountered a situation in the Passage East area of County Waterford in which local residents were extremely concerned about the possibility of losing a right of way through Coillte's forestry. While the issue was resolved, the matter brought into focus for me how valued and important are local areas and local woodlands to citizens. They are important for recreation, for health and for communities and Members must keep a focus on this point. Although forestry is an important strategic and economic resource, trees have tourism value and woods have a recreational value. In this context, Members must welcome the decision to which I referred earlier not to sell Coillte. As a Labour Party Deputy, I welcome this move and commend the Minister, Deputy Howlin, on his work in this area. I again thank the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, for the opportunity to speak on this Bill and wish him well as it passes through the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_626">I thank the Acting Chairman. I join with my colleague, Deputy Conway, in welcoming the decision not to sell Coillte. It was part of a large shopping list compiled by the previous Government to be put up for sale to whomsoever wished to buy it. Thankfully, the Government has not been obliged to resort to doing that. However, the question still remains as to what is to be done with Coillte and how will it be managed in a way that will provide a return for the State. It is a question the present Administration will be obliged to answer. The current model clearly has not worked and as a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I have attended various meetings at which representatives of the timber industry in Ireland have spoken, as have representatives of Coillte. The acting chief executive officer of Coillte gave the joint committee a highly effective presentation last week, in which he indicated clearly they are finally getting a grip on an organisation that, in respect of management pay in particular, effectively had been out of control for some years under the previous Government. Thankfully, that has been reined in.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> I will turn my focus to the Bill before Members. It is timely and certainly is not before its time, as if anything it is extremely late in being brought before Members. Nevertheless, it provides many of the protections called for by my colleague, Deputy Conway, with regard to protecting the forests and trees in particular and in ensuring they are not felled unnecessarily, while at the same time striking a balance and making sure farmers can fell individual small trees if they are less than ten years old, if they are in a hedgerow and if the trunk does not exceed 20 cm in diameter. Effectively, farmers can go about hedgerow cutting.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> This, however, brings me to a particular matter, which is that about this time of year, every year, Clare County Council sends out a lot of warnings to farmers across the county but it primarily affects east County Clare, where most of the trees are situated. The council warns farmers, in a highly threatening letter, as Clare County Council generally is not in the habit of issuing non-threatening letters, that particular trees pose a danger. It is a county council that specialises in threatening letters and if one does not take seriously the threat, it follows up more quickly than do most county councils with legal action, as a result of which it has a very large legal bill each year. However, that is an issue on which I do not wish to dwell. I do wish to focus on the aforementioned letters, which in my view unnecessarily are sent to farmers, frightening them. As a result of this, a large number of trees from which a branch or something similar could be lopped off are felled instead. It is distressing to many people, farmers included, in County Clare, who drive down roads and see a whole row of beech trees cut down. For example, in Killaloe, which is a very scenic town, Waterways Ireland took it upon itself to fell an entire row of beech trees that were planted around the time of the foundation of the State. There was a housing estate behind them but they now are gone. I travel through other countries - I visited County Wicklow recently - and always take great pleasure in driving to Thurles. As one drives from Clare to Thurles, one travels along a road with a row of beautiful oak trees right beside the road and I think that were this road in County Clare, the county council would have had those trees down a long time ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">I have raised this matter with Clare County Council and I have been informed it is motivated by concerns for the safety of road-users because the trees pose a risk. Do the trees of Clare pose a unique risk in Ireland or in the world? Is it that Clare County Council has a particular attitude to trees? The number of tree-felling notices issued by the council is alarming to farmers as much as to everyone else. I am very much in favour of devolving power to county councils but sometimes one wonders that if this is the result of devolving power, then maybe devolving power is not a very good thing. What is happening in Clare is in marked contrast to what is happening in the Minister of State's county or in other counties. </p>
          <p eId="para_630"> I am not against the felling of trees. Trees are sown for a purpose, they grow naturally for a purpose, and they are often felled for a purpose. However, I am against the needless felling of trees and, in particular, the threatening of landowners who then feel forced to cut trees unnecessarily. This is an issue of grave concern to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> I wish to raise a second issue related to the felling of trees. A large part of County Clare is afforested and the county is the third most afforested county in Ireland in terms of the size of the forest estate and the proportion of the county afforested. Large tracts of land were afforested in good faith by Coillte in the 1950s and 1960s when experiments were being conducted in the development of a new industry. Areas which were unsuited to forestry were also afforested. If Coillte wishes to fell those areas and allow them to return to nature, it is obliged to reforest them. The felling of the trees is not economically viable, much less the reforestation. For that reason I welcome the proposal in this Bill that the Minister can vary from the requirement to reforest areas. This is very necessary in some areas. It is very useful to be able to consider individual tracts of lands on their own merits.</p>

        <speech by="#ReginaDoherty" eId="spk_313">
          <from>Deputy Regina Doherty<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_632">I join with my colleague, Deputy Conway, in congratulating the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, as this is the first occasion he has introduced a Bill as Minister of State. The Bill is timely, given that this is the first Forestry Bill since 1954. I acknowledge the Minister of State's interest in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> The main aim of the Bill is to support the development of a modern forestry sector while taking note of good forest practice and required environmental protection. The legislation takes into consideration the progress that has been achieved in the sector in the 67 years since the first Forestry Bill was introduced. The current working regulations are nearly 70 years old with the result that an understaffed forestry service is unable to cope with administering the rising tide of applications from a rapidly maturing private forestry sector. The current regulatory regime, underpinned by the Forestry Act 1946, has been in place for over 60 years. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is of the view that a new Forestry Bill is now required to update existing legislative provisions and to introduce a regulatory framework that will support the development of a modern, multi­functional, sustainable and high quality forestry sector which enshrines the principles of sustainable forest management and the protection of the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> There have been some attempts over the past 15 years to update the legislation. It must be noted that there have been many technological, scientific and regulatory developments in the intervening period. Key among these has been the recognition that forests are a multi-functional resource with economic, social and environmental benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> Consultation with key stakeholders has recognised the need to ensure there is an appropriate balance between the various interests. I am satisfied that the new Bill will provide a more flexible system for regulating forestry activities, including felling licences and will better serve the interests of all stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> The Bill provides for the promotion and facilitation of the growth and sustainability of forests while having regard to the protection of this precious resource. The Bill's provisions include enhanced ministerial functions in areas such as the promotion, regulation and monitoring of forest operations. The Bill also provides for the protection of the environment when any forestry activity is being planned. It caters for forestry protection specifically relating to forest fires and it allows the Minister to require a landowner to remove vegetation from uncultivated land that poses a threat to an adjoining forest or to authorise persons to enter the land to remove the vegetation. It is crucial to develop forestry to a scale and in a manner which maximises its contribution to national economic and social well-being on a sustainable basis and which is compatible with the protection of the environment. It will be necessary to have a series of long-term strategic actions for a wide range of forestry activities to define how the overall strategy can be achieved on a sustainable basis and in a manner compatible with the protection of the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> There are 20,000 private forest-owners - of whom more than 17,000 are farmers - who have invested heavily over the past 30 years. The private forestry sector now accounts for nearly 50% of the national forest estate. The Government must continue to directly invest in the sector to ensure it realises its full potential. The national forest estate is now just over 730,000 ha or nearly 11% of the total land area. While this has expanded significantly since the early 1980s, it is still relatively low compared with our EU counterparts, given that nearly 40% of total land in the EU is under forest cover. Over 54% of the national forest estate is in public ownership, mainly through Coillte, with the remaining 46% in private ownership. This contrasts with the position 20 years ago when 70% was in public ownership with 30% in private ownership. This proves the extent of the private sector in growing and developing this industry. The intention of the new Forestry Bill is not to add to the administrative burden on landowners or other stakeholders in the sector, but to streamline and simplify the various processes. The systems put in place will be as user-friendly as possible and no unreasonable demands will be placed on anyone. The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, has also given assurances that there will be a period of consultation prior to the introduction of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> The introduction of this Bill has generated a renewed level of public debate on forestry. I drive from County Meath to Leinster House four days a week and I have been doing so for nearly three years. Today was the first day I noticed there is only one tree in D'Olier Street, even though I have been driving down that street for three years. The legislation has raised my awareness of forestry and trees. I also note a renewed public interest in our national asset. We all love the landscape of forests and it is good for our health to walk among trees.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> The forestry sector is an important aspect of the economy and it has contributed more than €700 million. Exports of wood products in 2012 accounted for €303 million and the total employment in forestry is estimated at 12,000. The forestry sector is made up of growing, processing, harvesting and transporting forestry products. It generates considerable economic wealth. The sector benefits the wider economy and more so in rural areas. I welcome the announcement yesterday regarding better employment statistics. The Bill ensures the development of a forestry sector in a manner and to a scale that maximises its contribution to our national socioeconomic well-being with a sustainable basis compatible with the protection of the environment.</p>

          <p eId="para_641">Yes, who is at a Whips' meeting but I will waffle on until she joins us.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> This is a hugely important issue and I am happy to contribute to the debate on it. The Bill is modest but it gives us the opportunity to discuss the importance of forestry to the economy currently but also in terms of its potential in the future. The Bill contains some worthwhile measures but we need to do much more.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> Nine thousand years ago, before the first settlers came to Ireland, the entire island was practically covered in forests. That situation deteriorated dramatically to such an extent that 110 years ago our forestry coverage was reduced to approximately 1%, although we have built it up somewhat since then. In terms of the figures it depends on who one reads but it is between 7% and 10% or 11%, which is welcome. It is far better than 1% but it is a long way from where we should be and falls far short of sustainable and desirable levels that a country like Ireland could support. We need to examine some measures in that regard. We have acknowledged that our aim is to have 17% coverage by 2030 covering a land mass of about 1.2 million ha but the way we are going we will fall well short of that. There must be dramatic intervention to improve that situation but the Bill, on its own, does not do enough in that regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_644"> The idea of mandatory replanting is welcome. I note that the rates of planting and replanting have been falling. They rose in the mid-1990s but at a significantly lower rate than the target. In essence, we are falling behind on that even though the amount we are replanting is growing.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> The levels of afforestation being conducted in the private sector is a matter of deep concern. Like the other Deputies and most citizens in the State, we very much welcome that Coillte was not sold off and that the forestry was kept in public ownership but that masks a situation where in recent years Coillte was responsible for selling off acres of our national forests to private hands. That is regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> I support the measures on mandatory replanting in the Bill. I support also the measures increasing the fines on those who do not do that but we must examine how that will be implemented because we must see this against the backdrop of cutbacks in local authority recruitment, public sector recruitment and so on. Are the local authorities, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or whoever inspecting this area? Can they be staffed to adequate levels to ensure that those who break the law will be punished and that those who do not replant will be made to do so? I am not sure that question has been answered fully, and it must be examined further.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> I would be interested to know whether any analysis has been conducted into the area of fuel poverty, and the Minister's view on that. There is anecdotal evidence of people cutting down trees to heat their homes or whatever as a result of fuel poverty. Has the Department examined that? One can understand the reason people would do it in these times of austerity but if it were to catch on we would have a huge problem and our afforestation policy would be significantly undermined.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> I am aware also that in a number of areas the local authorities have been engaged in cutting down trees, including in my area in Fingal, often without the permission of residents, which is another story. What happens to those trees? Timber is a valuable crop be it for fuel or other purposes. What happens to the trees cut down by the local authorities and where do they factor into our reforestation policies? Is that an issue the Minister can comment on? It is important to the overall debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> We underachieve in terms of what could be possible with afforestation. My understanding is that in recent years we sold off harvesting rights on tens of thousands of acres and that the moneys from that sale were used to shore up bad pension fund decisions made by Coillte rather than reinvesting in a genuine way. I am aware that organisations such as the Woodland League and others have called for a public inquiry into Coillte regarding a number of its operations. It has been suggested also that Coillte should be prevented from holding any sales until the matter of it selling off our crop and reinvesting it poorly has been fully investigated. That is something I would support. We must remember that Coillte is a commercial semi-State company; it is not a private commercial company. The role of the chief executive and others in that organisation must be examined and the organisation held to account. The decision to sell off land or trees in counties like Donegal caused a great outcry.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> We are underachieving in this area. I support the Bill. The measures are quite good but they do not go far enough. We have to harp back to the potential in this area. Switzerland, which is half the size of Ireland but has twice the area of our forests, employs ten times more people that we do here. We crow about the fact that we employ 12,000 people, which I believe is welcome, but a country half the size of Ireland employs 120,000 people. We must have a vision and a direction in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> Over the weekend I had the privilege of travelling to Mayo to meet some of the people still battling against the Shell Corrib gas project. On the way we passed through many of the counties that are significantly under-populated and could do with a lot of tree growing, which would be a boost to the economy. It also brought home the fact that in the west of Ireland we handed over our natural resources to Shell without any dividend for the Irish population and undervalued our indigenous industry. We have an economic policy which is based solely on slavishly following multinationals and incentivising them to come to this country to the detriment of our indigenous industry. If we invested a fraction of the resources we give in handouts to multinationals in areas like forestry, which have huge potential to create employment and generate economic growth, the country would be far better off.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> I have just come from a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, where companies that were enticed into this country and got years of loyal service from the aviation maintenance sector, including grants and benefits, are now talking about pulling out not because of anything the Irish workforce did, which is recognised internationally as one of the best and the leanest, but because in the overall scale of things, Ireland is too small to fit into the plans of that global multinational. </p>
          <p eId="para_653"> We need to come back to base and start looking at developing our own strengths, and key to that is our land mass and our potential growth areas in a country previously covered in forests. We must see areas of land that are completely underdeveloped as having the potential to make an enormous contribution to economic growth not just in terms of employment numbers, but also in terms of economic sustainability because forestry and so on negates the impacts of CO2 emissions and so on. It is a win-win scenario. </p>
          <p eId="para_654"> I welcome the minor measures in the Bill, which will help if we put in the resources to ensure they are implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">However, they do not go far enough in terms of scratching the surface of the potential that exists in this area.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_316">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_656">I welcome the advancement of the Bill, which most speakers did. It is time the legislation was updated and modernised. We are very conscious that the work started under the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes's predecessor, the late Shane McEntee, who, along with his family, we all think about at this time. Recently, a decision was made not to proceed with the sale of Coillte's harvesting rights. That is an issue on which I campaigned. The sale would have done irreparable damage to a key public resource not only for this generation, but for future generations. Any income gained from that sale could never have been hoped to match the amount which would have been lost, so that certainty about the future is very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> Now that it has been established that Coillte forests and harvesting rights will remain exclusively in State hands, we must look at the poor record in regard to how we have approached afforestation in this country. Despite the fact the island was completely covered by forests, we have had a poor record of afforestation for centuries. Current afforestation policy calls for 17% forestry coverage by 2035 and yearly afforestation rates of 20,000 ha per annum by 2048. Current afforestation coverage is 11% which does not compare favourably with the European average which is 35%. When one considers the population density of Ireland, one might wonder why it is so low but, of course, there are historical reasons for that. During the Industrial Revolution in Britain, a lot of timber was required. The Irish population has a very unique dispersal pattern, which continues today. Very often farmers with very small holdings wanted a quick return on crops because some of the farms were very marginal. There would also have been an element of short-term thinking in terms of returns. </p>
          <p eId="para_658"> I am happy to see there are a number of improvements in the Bill in regard to the responsible management of our forests within the ecosystem, which is welcome. However, the Bill only mildly touches on the area of carbon sequestration. I would like to see that further developed, although I know there are sectoral plans and that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will have a really important role to play in those plans because that is where our targets for climate change will be set and this area will be vitally important in that regard. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht just completed a report, which involved a number of hearings over the summer on the proposed carbon legislation. It was a very useful forerunner to the Bill because much expertise was gained by committee members who will be involved in the legislation. It is clear there are substantial issues with which we must deal. There are three areas in particular, namely, transport, agriculture and the built environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> We are not allowed to use carbon sinks towards the 2020 targets but that is almost certain to change by 2015, so we must think ahead. It is estimated that Coillte forests store 10.5 million tonnes of CO2 and that the current stock of trees can store up to 1.1 million extra tonnes per year. That represents a clear opportunity to use our natural resource wisely. When one considers that we might end up paying fines in hard cash if we do not meet our obligations, this whole sector is really important.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> We need to encourage the use of our forests and wood industry by-products as a source of renewable energy. Wood biomass is underutilised. We must look at examples like Scandinavia, which has been referred to several times. We have the wood craft industry and we cannot ignore the role Coillte plays as an employer in rural areas. These are areas where alternative sources of employment might be found now and in the future. The forestry sector is one of the few indigenous industries and Coillte accounts for more than 80% of the timber sold on the market. It supplies a whole range of wood processing facilities and it is a significant employer outside the larger urban centres. This helps to address employment imbalances from region to region where there are no natural assets and where this would be a natural asset in rural areas. Saw mills and panel board mills employ approximately 1,800 people. If we consider Coillte's liabilities, we must really focus on making the sector generate a value for the State, whether through increased employment, income through tourism, forest amenities or through carbon off-setting, which will be quite important.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> Another area where we need some direct ministerial intervention is the use of forests as a public amenity. This kind of tourism is well developed in other countries, in particular in the United States. The public amenity value of Coillte forests cannot be over-stated. Some 54% of Coillte forests are on public land - in fact, it has grown quite a bit in recent years. Projects like the Dublin Mountains partnership and Donadea forest park in my constituency demonstrate the popularity of Coillte lands and another area of diversification that could be encouraged. While Coillte operates an open forestry policy, there is not a similar policy in private forests. Substantial grants are often paid to landowners and if grant assistance is provided, there could be a new condition to provide reasonable access to those lands. That might be something about which the Minister might think. </p>
          <p eId="para_662"> In terms of the visual landscape, it is very noticeable that much of County Wicklow has been planted with Sitka spruce, which has matured. The landscape can often resemble a bit of a war zone when it is stripped away at the one time. Wicklow is the garden of Ireland and that is not the best way to present such a vital tourism resource. Broad leaves need to be planted in locations and these forests should be regulated primarily as amenity forests, in particular, where there is a high level of tourism, and they should be managed accordingly. I would go as far as to say that the National Parks and Wildlife Service should have a remit in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> I wish to deal with sub-thresholds and the rules and regulations in regard to planting. There is a really serious problem here. For example, an environmental impact assessment, EIA, is required if it is more than 50 ha. If it is under 50 ha, essentially, an EIA is not required but the local authority might ask for an environmental impact statement, EIS. In all the years I have been looking at planning applications, I have never seen an EIS argue against a proposed development. They are supposed to be independent but I have never seen anything independent about them in that they find a way to argue for the development. What happens is one gets 49 ha, 49 ha beside that and another 49 ha beside that. What one has is a large area developed without the EIA.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">We need to find a way of dealing with that. I would like to think we could do so in this legislation. It is a real frustration for local authorities that are trying to have a positive impact, visually and otherwise, on the landscape.</p>

          <p eId="para_667">I welcome the opportunity to speak. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, who is responsible for this area. I wish him well with this legislation. It is the first Bill he has brought before the House. His remit covers a broad spectrum within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I appreciate the level of engagement he has taken on, including in my constituency of Limerick, which borders the Minister of State's constituency of Tipperary South. The Minister of State comes from a rural background and has spent many years in the Dáil, which means he has a good grasp of the issues in areas like horticulture, food safety and forestry. I wish him well in dealing with those aspects of the Department's activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> Consultation has been mentioned frequently during this debate. I have personal experience in this regard as I have met many people to discuss this issue. As late as last week, I discussed it with people who are actively engaged in creating real jobs in the real economy. Opposition Deputies who often rail about this are feeling a bit sore this week because of the Government's success in creating 58,000 real jobs in the real economy. It is not a good week for the Opposition to give out. The section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that we are discussing is making a real contribution to the creation of those real jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> It is nobody's fault that the journey of this legislation through the House has inadvertently been delayed. I welcome the Minister of State's statement that there will be further opportunities for consultation with the industry. That is very important. The Minister of State will be aware that timber of the finest quality is produced in the eastern and western ends of my constituency. Some of the largest forested areas in the State are to be found in County Limerick. Having spoken to people who are working with landowners and farmers on afforestation, I know there are legitimate concerns. The Minister of State represents a rural constituency. Places like the beautiful Glen of Aherlow and the eastern slopes of the Galtee Mountains are in his back yard. There is a considerable amount of forestry in his constituency. Those who have spoken to him know he is open to consultation and I welcome that. I am glad that positive consultation will take place when the Bill is considered on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> This industry has been untapped in recent years. For too long, when trees were felled there was a temptation to view the material that was left after the timber was taken by the sawmill as a substandard waste material that should be left there. This was especially true in my area of west Limerick. Having spoken last week to a company in County Limerick, the Minister of State will know there is no such thing as waste forestry material anymore. It is important that absolutely everything can be used. It helps to build confidence among people who are looking at afforestation as an alternative land use.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> The previous two speakers do not understand this issue because they represent urban constituencies. They spoke about the amount of forestry in Ireland before the Ice Age or after the Ice Age or something like that. They kind of bemoaned the fact that it is no longer the case that 99% of the country is covered in forestry. They seem to have forgotten that most land is in private ownership. Deputy Clare Daly might be anxious to cover everywhere with forestry. She is on a journey to make sure the gas does not come ashore, which would lead to more fuel poverty. She might be anxious to scatter trees all over the place. She has failed to acknowledge that this land is in private ownership. Much of it is agricultural land that is used to produce food. I know the Deputy is removed from rural Ireland and from the agricultural base that some of us represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> When we talk about afforestation, it is important to recognise that most, if not all, of the land we are talking about is in private ownership. One should not talk about the achievement of afforestation targets unless one has spoken to landowners individually. One must recognise that some land is not suitable for forestry. Some land is more suitable for growing crops that can be used in food products. There is a need for a proper overall land management use policy that encompasses all of our land and encourages farmers and landowners to go in particular directions. That is a critical aspect of how we look at this issue, which I have discussed with the Minister of State at length.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is to the fore in building the capability of people to grow biomass materials, energy crops and forestry. It needs to engage in joined-up thinking with other Departments, especially the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, on how those materials are used. If we are going to have an overall policy on forestry, biomass materials and energy crops, we must ensure all Departments and State agencies can buy into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> My constituency is fortunate to have the only strategic port in the west of Ireland. I refer to Foynes Port, which is a real testament to the development of the forestry industry. The industry has the potential to create many more jobs in the counties served by this harbour, which is used to export timber and timber products out of this country. I am sure other Deputies heard this morning's debate on "Morning Ireland" about the potential for those who grow Christmas trees. This lucrative export business, which is creating many jobs in the real economy, might not have been mentioned in this debate up to now. Perhaps Opposition speakers are not in favour of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> I have spoken to the Minister of State about land use management plans, with particular reference to the National Parks and Wildlife Service. He is aware that there are many special areas of conservation and Natura areas in west Limerick. Other Deputies have spoken about this aspect of the matter. We have a particular relationship with a bird - the hen harrier. I would like the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which is designing the second pillar of the new rural development programme, to sit down and look at this in an holistic way. There is no doubt that there is an element of frustration out there.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> The three bodies I have mentioned need to bang heads together to ensure a more strategic long-term plan is put in place for the use of special protection areas. Much of the land I am talking about might have potential for forestry to be grown on it. Perhaps it could be used much better than it is being used at the moment. Equally, it might not have this potential. We need an overall plan. I am aware that a threat response plan is being currently considered by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the National Parks and Wildlife Service in respect of the hen harrier. I implore the Minister of State with responsibility for forestry to engage with his colleagues on this important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> I would like to mention two other aspects of this issue briefly. The two Deputies who spoke before me have left the Chamber. They might not understand this anyway. As a person who represents a part of the country where there is a great deal of forestry, I suggest that a greater level of engagement with local authorities is needed. The Minister of State will be aware that when trees are being felled and cultivation is taking place, many articulated lorries have to pass through small rural communities that are served by substandard roads. In some instances, this lends itself to damage being done. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine had a scheme in this respect in the past. If it could be enhanced, that would be great. The Minister of State is working with county councils as part of his efforts to achieve an overall level of afforestation. Perhaps he could provide direct financial assistance or grant aid to them so that they can repair the damage that is done to roads during the planting and harvesting processes. It would be very welcome if that could be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> The other aspect of this matter I want to discuss is its tourism and recreation potential. The Minister of State will be familiar with the Ballyhoura region of my county because it is not too far away from his local area. One of the finest forests in the country, in terms of mixing the commercial end of forestry with a tourism amenity, is located near Ardpatrick in that region. It has developed into a fantastic product. When the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport visited it recently, he was able to take a spin on one of the mountain bike trails. There is huge potential for rural-based initiatives which involve, for example, the production of biofuels, the creation of real jobs in tourism and the use of land in a credible way to develop an existing product.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> I will go back to one of the original points I made.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">We have a commitment under Food Harvest 2020 that we will become one of the largest milk and beef producers, and everything else. We need to be realistic in terms of our forestry targets. While we are exceptionally low at the moment, we must realise that not every acre in the country can be planted with forestry, nor should it. Some land is not suitable for it because it can be of much greater value to the overall economy by not planting trees on it. On the other hand, with some land that is being farmed at the moment it might be better if the farmer was encouraged to consider forestry as an alternative.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> I welcome the tenet of the Bill. I wish the Minister of State well in the role he has taken on. I know that many previous speakers paid tribute to his predecessor in the Department. I know that at this time of year, in particular, we are all thinking of him.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Deputy Paudie Coffey<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_682">I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, the very best with the forestry portfolio. It is a very important role to have and I know there is a considerable amount of forestry in his constituency, as there is in mine. It is an area of much interest to him and he will do exceptionally well in the Department. I also acknowledge and remember our late colleague, Shane McEntee, the former Minister of State, who had a deep commitment to Irish forestry. I have no doubt that the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, will carry on the work of our late colleague, Mr. McEntee.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> Forestry is a great natural resource with 40% of the land covered with forestry. I welcome that 46% of that is privately owned because we should encourage as many forestry growers as possible. I acknowledge the Government's continued support for forestry schemes, which have not been cut in recent budgets despite the financial and economic pressure. I recognise the roles of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, in protecting the forestry schemes for farmers and the many others who are involved in the private sector. This support shows the long-term commitment of farmers who set aside land to plant forestry and ensure it grows to maximise its full potential. This is a very labour-intensive industry. I am told that 16,000 are employed in the sector not only in the protection and growing of forests, but also in the related production sector such as the sawmills and other production plants.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> Forestry is a wonderful natural and renewable resource that will contribute to us reaching our climate-change targets. The role of forestry cannot be underestimated in this regard. Most important are the income and revenue streams that forestry brings to the country. The Bill will provide a modernised regulatory framework to manage all the forestry related activities. As we have been operating under 1946 legislation up to now, the Bill is welcome and timely. It will streamline the whole felling and licensing area of forestry management, and will provide powers to the authorised officials who deal with any illegal activity that might threaten our forestry.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> I acknowledge the role Coillte has played and continues to play in growing, protecting and maintaining our forestry and the lands under forestry. It plays an important role in commercial harvesting, protecting our environment and the new growing areas of amenity and recreation, which could be exploited even further by Coillte and private forests with the growing recreational activities such as orienteering, mountain biking and leisure walking. It is important that all those areas are open. One of the oldest oak forests is privately owned in the Curraghmore estate in Portlaw, County Waterford. That fabulous old oak forest has been preserved over many generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> The export of timber and timber products, such as wood-based panels, sawn timber, pulp and paper, is valued at approximately €280 million. Medite in south Tipperary and SmartPly in Waterford Port are two subsidiaries of Coillte which employ almost 900 people between direct and indirect jobs. It is important that the Government continues to support these plants. There are 146 jobs in Medite and 160 in SmartPly. When all the associated growers and services are included, it is an incredibly important industry for the south east.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> SmartPly needs to upgrade its plant and machinery. It is exporting versatile board for structural use to the UK, Norway, Germany and Russia. I know it has sought Government permission to renew its plant and machinery at an estimated cost of €60 million. While this is a very large investment, it would be worthwhile primarily because of the jobs. In addition, it is producing innovative wood products that will increase our export revenues and help us in our recovery. I understand the Government is recommending this investment, which I welcome. I have been involved with the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and our colleagues in the south east. We saw at first hand the good work done in the SmartPly plant in Waterford Port. I welcome the investment, which will protect the existing jobs. It secures the future of the plant and will create new job opportunities as these new innovative wood products are exported throughout the world. I hope this investment can get under way as soon as possible. I understand it is conditional on some restructuring within Coillte. I know Coillte and SmartPly will meet those challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> It is essential the forestry management and associated assets of our country are sweated to the maximum of their potential. We need to maximise production and utilise the sector to create employment opportunities and bring in revenue through exports. I support the Bill and wish the Minister of State well with it.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Paul Kehoe)<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_689">I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, the best of luck in his new portfolio, even though he has had it for quite some time. I commend his predecessor as Minister of State, the late Shane McEntee. I have no doubt he would have greatly enjoyed bringing the Bill through the House. I commend the work of both Ministers of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> I come from a background very much involved in the forestry sector, and was involved with it before my election to this House. I know and understand the importance of the industry. The previous speakers, Deputies Coffey and O'Donovan, spoke about the importance of the sector. I do not believe people understand the investment that goes into the forestry industry. I was very much involved in the nursery side. I was employed by the None-So-Hardy nursery forestry comprising 660 acres in County Wexford. I got to see the process from the seed being sown right up to the tree being planted on some hillside in places including Wexford, Donegal, Kerry and Cork. It is amazing to see the different stages in that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> Some 16,000 people are involved in the niche forestry sector with considerable additional indirect employment. During the housing boom from the late 1990s up to 2008, we did not have enough timber products in Ireland to keep the construction industry going. I would have thought we would have learned from that. A number of years ago, a farmer who set aside ten, 15 or 20 acres of his land for forestry was frowned upon by his farming counterparts. We have seen a sea change in that in recent years because we have seen the importance of the forestry sector for greenhouse gas reduction to assist the climate as well as what it contributes to the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> Today, I heard a farmer from County Wicklow speak on "Morning Ireland" about the export of Christmas trees from Ireland to Britain, France and other European markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Little did that small farmer think when he was planting those Christmas trees 15 or 20 years ago that he would export them to Britain or France or some other European market. That shows the high regard in which the Irish forestry sector is held in Europe and its importance to the local economy in Wicklow or wherever. It provides a significant amount of intensive employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> I commend the former Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the late Deputy Shane McEntee, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the current Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes. I have sat at the Cabinet table for the past three years when every budget has brought in cuts and every Minister has been under real pressure to hold budgets in his or her Department and I have seen this sector hold its budget. That shows its potential. </p>
          <p eId="para_695"> None-So-Hardy in Wexford has 660 acres between Ballymurn outside Enniscorthy and outside Carnew in Wicklow. The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, has seen it from start to finish and was very impressed. Deputy Coffey spoke about SmartPly. I was brought on a tour of SmartPly approximately 18 months ago. It is very important to Waterford and in Clonmel too. Ire-Wel Pallets outside Kilmuckridge exports pallets not alone in Europe, but to Coca-Cola and Pfizer and so on. The pallets are delivered worldwide. When one sees a company in Wexford so dependent on wood products, manufacturing pallets, and there are many other pallet manufacturers around the country, one sees the indirect opportunities offered by this sector. I encourage the Minister of State and other farmers to get involved in the forestry industry and consider it differently from how it was considered in the past.</p>

          <p eId="para_696">I, too, am delighted to have some time to speak on this very important Bill this evening. Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Tom Hayes, a thagann ón Dáilcheantar Tiobraid Árann Theas. I congratulate Deputy Tom Hayes and wish him well as a Minister of State. I have done so many times but must keep reiterating it in case he worries about me. I do wish him well with his portfolio. I am delighted that a man from South Tipperary is in charge of that portfolio because it is a very important industry to South Tipperary for many reasons on which I will expand later. I also join many colleagues in complimenting the work of his immediate predecessor, the late Deputy Shane McEntee, who so sadly left us, and who threw his full weight and enthusiasm into that sector too. He toured South Tipperary and Kerry where he had a peculiar incident on a forestry road in my colleague Deputy Healy Rae's car, but sin scéal eile. He looked forward to introducing this Bill and probably did much of the earlier work as did the former Minister of State, Deputy Connick, in the last Government. We all acknowledge that these things do not happen overnight. I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, well.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> I cannot talk about forestry and the Minister of State without thinking of Dundrum, his home, and Dundrum Sawmills, and his colleague, Councillor Jack Crowe, who is soon to retire. The Crowe family has given a great deal of employment. One thinks too of the unique setting of the wooded environs of Dundrum House Hotel where there are some fine specimens of trees. Dundrum Sawmills gives employment, as do many other smaller sawmills such as Sheehan's in Burncourt. I could name half a dozen in that area which have survived over the decades, have given valuable employment and worked very hard in a tough business in tough conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> It is no mean achievement that 46% of planting in Ireland is privately owned. I was not aware that the figure was so high. In the past I have supported small farming communities when the finest of land was taken over for plantation. I may be speaking out of both sides of my mouth when I say that any good land planted with forestry never becomes reasonable farmland again. I support forestry and planting and accept the farmer's right to do what he likes with the land, but it is a pity to see really good land that can grow wheat or the finest of any crop, potatoes or sugar beet in the Golden Vale under plantation, all the more so if it is not maintained or nurtured and used to its full potential. When we think of the Famine and other times when there have been food shortages, we realise that good land is needed. There is potential in forestry too. It is a question of balance. The Minister of State, Deputy Hayes faces the challenge of balancing the productive farm land and growing timber for construction, fuel, green energy and to reduce our carbon footprint. It is a very fine balance and difficult to achieve. I, too, am delighted that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, protected the budget this year, as did his predecessor.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> In recent years forestry has encompassed much more than trees. One can see what has been done in the majestic Aherlow House nestling in a mature wood and the Minister of State knows better than I do the work done by Aherlow Fáilte with walks, cycle paths, recreation, tours and the co-operation it gets. These are mainly Coillte forests, although some are private. The same is true of Lake Muskry and the other lakes in the Galtees which receive help from their partners, mainly in Coillte. They have recreational and amenity value and there is potential there for more development and exploitation. The Minister of State will be open to that suggestion and to the work of voluntary groups such as Aherlow Fáilte and Knockmealdown Active in South Tipperary, and Tipperary Tourism. If one wants a quiet place to reflect before or after the budget, there is no better place to go than into the woods where one meets no one other than the odd deer or other wildlife, not that one would not see the wood for the trees. It is a nice place to reflect in one's own space and time, especially when the woods are well maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> There are between 15,000 and 16,000 people employed in this sector and that is not to be sniffed at in these challenging times. We are operating under very old legislation that goes back 50 or 60 years. It needs to be brought forward and updated. The continued support of successive governments for the sector needs to be maintained. Medite is a technically advanced MDF plant that I toured in the company of the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, two years ago. I knew what it did but did not realise the finesse and sheer size and quality of its product which now features in hotel receptions, theatres and other areas. When Medite was first set up, it produced 8ft. x 4ft. sheets. Now it produces the finest veneer and has a magnificent processing plant employing 150 or 160 people and does a tremendous job. It needs a continuous supply and our support, which it will have. It is amazing what can be done with ply board, which was once used only for attics and partitions but now has many and varied uses. Transition year students and others have done projects to show the kind of creative work and quality product that comes from Medite and that can be used and adapted to many situations such as front-of-house furniture that we see in the queerest of places. One would never imagine it was MDF because it is so well finished.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">It was so well manufactured in the first place and then developed and used by craftsmen. It is so pliable and so adaptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> In Waterford, we have SmartPly Limited and many smaller sawmills.<b>
						</b>There were some in my area, in Lismore and Patrick Sheehan Sawmills, Burncourt. It is wonderful to see the skills and the craft work, which may not be in the bigger sawmills, of people such as Pat Sheehan. It is wonderful to see the old mill wheels that had rotted in certain old bakeries, including the bakery in Cahir, the works in Tullamore and different distilleries, and the pride the people have in their work. </p>
          <p eId="para_703"> When we see trees bending during a storm, we regard them as a threat as they might fall or may be too near a house or building. I have happy memories of seeing people with two horses pulling out the logs. Nowadays they have massive equipment such as the forwarders and the harvesters which are very expensive. In the past the horse and the chainsaw was used, although the chainsaw is still used. Certainly, it is dangerous and risky work but health and safety regulations ensure that the number of accidents has been minimised. That raw material is growing in Ireland and it provides an opportunity to crafts people such as Pat Sheehan to maintain our links with the past and our heritage and to ensure we have water mills or water wheels nestling and driven by water. If we did not have the raw material and the expertise to make and develop those, they would have long since gone, rusted and fallen into the water. It is wonderful to witness that type of work. I salute the Tipperary Development Company and other groups that have supported such projects. This is part of our heritage that if let slip we would not see again. It would be something we would only read about and not have the living experiences of those places as they work. </p>
          <p eId="para_704"> The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Paul Kehoe, mentioned the nursery industry. The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, will be aware more than others that it is huge in south Tipperary. I would go so far as to say, without fear of contradiction, the nursery in south Tipperary is probably the largest in the country. The Minister of State knows the nursery I am speaking about which has created many landscapes. With fertile land - I do not want to boast too much about it - specimen trees can be grown to a certain length. We can see much of it when travelling home on the N8 and now the M8. Those nurseries provide a huge amount of employment. While they have had a couple of lean years and are hanging in by the skin of their teeth, I hope the position will improve from an export point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> I know the Ceann Comhairle will soon light the Christmas tree here. For many years a Wexford man, Joe O'Flynn, living in Tipperary for many years, supplied the Christmas tree for this august building. I am proud of that because where Tipperary leads, Ireland follows. I note that the Ceann Comhairle came down to Tipperary for his wife some years ago. I admire his taste.</p>

          <p eId="para_707">Whatever way the twain shall meet, I am delighted he enjoyed his time in Cashel at the weekend. That is not to say I am keeping tabs on him but Tipperary is a small place. He knows a bit about Tipperary also. We make our mark on places.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> I did not mention the ash trees and the use to which we put them. In the main I am speaking to the Bill. I remember as a buachaill óg - I was about nine years of age - I had two neighbours who were brilliant carpenters. As I wanted a hurley, we got an ash butt out of the ditch. They had to cut it, take it home and cure it like a side of bacon. It had to be cured for a particular period of time. It was a work in progress for about two years. When I got it, we hit some balls with it and used it on more things than the ball. There were no penalty points or yellow cards at that time. In terms of the clash of ash, we have gone back a little but the Kilkenny lads are there now. It goes around, thank God, and I salute the men of Clare. Its sawmill in Scarriff has diminished somewhat, which is a pity. </p>
          <p eId="para_709"> I will return to the Bill rather than ramble through the woods like Patrick Kavanagh and his poetry. In regard to the export of Christmas trees, I heard the report on the radio this morning. I have witnessed it and have been involved in the removal of Christmas trees from the land in my own business, but one does not think of the impact and that they are going to far away places in Europe. Many private Christmas tree growers, including some from Coillte, export Christmas trees. I thank Coillte which usually provides two or three trees for our village, a community house and our school. We have always got them courtesy of Coillte. We got them legitimately in the past from the foresters for community gain. </p>
          <p eId="para_710"> I am delighted Coillte was not sold off, although in recent years it has been run down. I recall the Irish Forestry Service and the men who worked in it and the pride they had in their work. While driving on the road one could see its entrances, timber railings, styles and gates, all of which were painted. In due course it was transferred to Coillte. Like everything else, the fences have become run down. It is impossible to be a sheep farmer adjacent to a Coillte plantation. As with any plantation, whether a private plantation or a Coillte plantation, one has to depend on one's neighbours. Good neighbours are better than family. If one does not have good neighbours in terms of fencing, one is in trouble. Some years ago Coillte appeared to have adopted the attitude of just fencing until such time as the plant was established and then letting the place go to hell. If a farmer's sheep strayed, it was tough. In some cases they have been taken to the pound. That is not necessary and is not good for spirits. Farmers are needed to keep watch in the event of people wandering in and dropping a substance that might light and set fire to the forest. We have seen too many forest fires.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> We need good relationships and Coillte must be reminded to go back to its base. I know it is all about money but we must never forget that it is a community initiative and people have to live alongside forestry. It should respect that and keep back from the road and watercourses. We have had instances in the past where local authority watercourses were damaged by the carelessness of contractors operating for Coillte. Respect is a two-way street. While I have praised Coillte for what it does in engaging with communities, in some areas they do not and just go in and out. There are some contractors who work for Coillte - I have met this in this building and elsewhere - who have very sad tales of not getting their pound of flesh and not being properly dealt with over the years. </p>
          <p eId="para_712"> I saw the document, serving those who serve the public, in which a merger of Coillte and Bord na Móna has been mooted. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, is more <i>au fait</i> with this than me. Following a merger, pressure will immediately fall on Coillte to provide wood biomass for Bord na Móna's electricity generation operation, which is required by regulation to guarantee that biomass products make up 30% of 300,000 tonnes of its fuel by 2015. It would be impossible to meet the demands for biomass in Bord na Móna's peat burning power station without compromising more than 100 jobs in two Coillte panel board processing plants, one in Clonmel and one in Waterford. Timber from Coillte forests also supports many jobs in the private and wood products sectors and fulfil an ever increasing demand for firewood. We have to make haste slowly. Far be from me to lecture the Minister of State, but we have to be very careful that what we might do to meet our greener obligations does not adversely impact on supply to the other people I mentioned in my own county and elsewhere. There is no point in a merger of two large companies if it has a devastating impact on the town of Clonmel and Waterford City. Goodness know Waterford has suffered enough in the past. We must be mindful of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> The Bill is a reasonably modest attempt to regulate the area but as with all Bills we need to be mindful of the small print. The Minister of State would be well aware of flooding and, in fairness, flood defences have been put in place in Clonmel at enormous cost. They have not been tested but we think they are successful. </p>
          <p eId="para_714"> With the change to heavy machinery, roads can be impacted when private or Coillte harvesting takes place, but mainly Coillte.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">Whereas the horse could cross lines along the side of the hill, the tracks made by this machinery go up and down and when heavy rain occurs, there is enormous flooding onto the roads. Sector guidelines must be in place for the felling of large areas because it is doing untold damage to country roads and bridges. There is always lots of debris left in the wood after the extraction of trees and this debris flows along and blocks bridges. It has blocked bridges and done severe damage. In some case it has swept away bridges. I know we are expecting a new treatment plant any day. I hope the Minister of State will announce it for Burncourt which faces significant issues at the moment because it flows off the river, bushes and brambles. We must be very careful with the sprays that can be used and even the dyes with which they mark the trees because they are all going into the water courses. I am not apportioning blame to anyone. We must be very careful about the different types of contamination that may result from forestry products.</p>
          <p eId="para_716"> I welcome the Bill. I want good land and marginal land to be treated sensibly and for more to be planted on marginal land. The neighbours, and by that I mean the people in the community regardless of whether they live in cottages or ordinary houses or are landowners, must be respected. It is a two-way street. The environment and heritage projects must be front-loaded as being necessary for tourism. We must handle this with care. Implementation is the key. It must be sensitive and cater for all the needs of rural and urban Ireland in order that when urban people wish to use these amenities, they can do so, leave them as they found them and get valuable recreational opportunities from them, while those of us who must live with them can appreciate them and have the respect of the forest owners, be they private or public.</p>

          <p eId="para_718">I congratulate the Minister of State on bringing forward his first piece of legislation as Minister of State. I congratulate him not only on it being his first piece of legislation, but also on its contents. I acknowledge, as we all do today, the input into this legislation and the great background work of the former Minister of State, Shane McEntee, work that is being continued by the Minister of State. I wish the Minister of State many happy and fruitful years in that role.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> I applaud the decision of the Government not to sell Coillte. It is among the myriad achievements of this Government in breaking free from the shackles of the initial bailout deal agreed by the previous Government. One of the most important ways in which we have broken free from the shackles of that deal was the decision not to sell Coillte. Our forestry and woodlands are a huge resource from tourism, recreational, quality of life, climate change and, notably, commercial perspectives. For many landowners, forestry is an attractive option, providing a steady annual income and from a practical point of view, making very good use of marginal land. That is the important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> Many farms have ten, 15 or 20 acres of marginal land which should be planted. That is happening to a greater extent than was previously the case. There are many young farmers in my constituency who work outside the farm and, for them, forestry is a cost-effective and less stressful way to continue farming than intensive cattle farming. It is worth noting that more than 19,000 farmers are private forest owners, covering 10% of Ireland in woodland. I congratulate the Minister of State and the Government on the fact we have managed, in the most straitened of circumstances, to preserve the forestry premia and the income of those farmers involved in private forestry. That is a great achievement that merits applause and I strongly recommend that this remains the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> Approximately 12,000 people are employed either directly or indirectly through the forestry sector amounting to an annual return of €673 million to the Exchequer. This is an extraordinary contribution. We have a 5% share of the UK timber market and every indication shows that demand for timber is set to rise over the next ten years, especially as we are beginning to see a move towards renewable indigenous sources of energy such as biomass. Wood harvesting for energy purposes is driving the production end of forestry and this is a trend that can only increase as time goes on. Energy demand increases by approximately 5% per year in this country while we continue to import more than 90% of our energy. This cannot be a healthy balance and it is for that reason we must work on our forestry among other things. Wood energy is seen as a sustainable, carbon-neutral and secure source of heat, electricity and biofuel. We have excellent wood growing conditions in this country as our soil and climatic conditions are satisfactory.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> This legislation is very welcome, especially in the context of the need to increase wood mobility and encourage future afforestation. The importance of forestry in the context of the climate change agenda cannot be emphasised enough. The fact that trees absorb carbon dioxide and are involved in the sequestration of, and are a sink for, carbon makes them critical infrastructure. Even if other countries offend in these areas, it is important that Ireland, which has always played a very important moral role at an international level, continues to perform at this level. That is an added attraction and achieves our objectives in terms of carbon emissions control from an economic perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> As it stands, 11% of our country is covered by forest, which is 24% short of the EU recommendation of 35%. We have great potential to develop this. This is also the first time in 67 years that the current forestry regulatory regime has been updated and reformed. We have come a long way from 1946 when the majority of our forests were under State ownership. There is an almost 50-50 split between privately owned forests and State-owned forests, and I am glad to see the legislation is responsive to this change. I know of many beautiful forests in my constituency which play their part in the generation of tourism related revenue. I invite Members of the House to visit any of these very beautiful and scenic places. We have Bellamont in Cootehill, which is a beautiful and historic location that contains many elements of our heritage, built and otherwise, in Bellamont Castle on the forest grounds around the lake. It is an extraordinarily beautiful place. We also have Dun a Rí in Kingscourt and Killykeen in west Cavan. In Bailieborough, where I live, we have the forest at Castle Lake which is a great resource for the quality of life of people and is extensively used by walkers. I commend the work done in recent years by Coillte in developing these forest areas, walks and amenities.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> I urge the Minister of State to prioritise the continuing development of our forests for tourism because the modern tourist wants to walk, to have a healthy experience and to have the heritage experience. Invariably they are coming from an urban environment and want to get out into the wild.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">For this reason, increasing the development of forest amenities, walks, seating around lakes, picnic areas, entryways to lakes and platforms for fishing is crucial. I hope that the Minister of State continues this important work, as it matters. The forests that I cited in my constituency, including a beautiful area in Virginia, attract a high volume of tourists and revenue to the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> I welcome section 10 in Part 2, which ensures the proper regulation and monitoring of the management of forests. There will be rules for forest owners about harmful pests, diseases and invasive species. The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, has been working hard to deal with the ash dieback disease. It is important that the wrong type of tree not be imported and placed alongside our trees to the detriment of our forests. In light of the lessons that we are learning as a result of our experience with ash dieback, it is important that we safeguard our existing and future forests.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> This Part of the Bill introduces the concept of the farm management plan. It is a good principle. The Minister of State is connected to people and will understand what I am saying - we must not make this an administrative albatross around the necks of forest owners. The plan should contain simple objectives, for example, on when to fell, what will be done to maintain forests and what will be planted. It should not contain anything nasty. The last thing we need is a large, cumbersome form to be filled, a complex plan or the introduction of middle people, all of which will cost forest owners a great deal of money. I appeal to the Minister of State to keep these factors to a minimum and to ensure there are no difficulties, as they could act as a disincentive to afforestation. He is well aware of these issues and I hope that he will respond to them. I am sure that my concerns in this regard are shared by others.</p>

          <p eId="para_729">I thank the Minister of State. I understand that issues pertaining to section 24 in Part 5 have arisen. Under this Part, the Minister of the day has the power to charge and recover fees for licensing approval and registration purposes. My understanding is that this is only a declaration in principle, in that, while it can happen, the Minister has no plans to make it happen in the short term. A ministerial reassurance on the record of the House would help the industry. It is important that the Minister be able to do what is necessary in the interests of forestry policy, but it should not be a disincentive to converting land into forestry, particularly for smaller producers, as that would be a worst case scenario and would impact on our EU target of 35% afforestation. There is no charge currently and the Minister has explained that it will not be done, but that merits repeating.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> In terms of felling licences, a vital exemption clause is built into section 18. Landowners and-or farmers will be allowed to use up to 15 cu. m of wood deemed to be outside of forest or historical fort per year for personal use. It is important that farmers be allowed to do this. In my experience, which I suspect is also the Minister of State's experience, farmers generally do the right thing, be it with their livestock or forestry, and have a great sense of responsibility and ownership and a consciousness of the fact that they are preserving something important for future generations. Those who do the wrong thing are rare, sad exceptions who sometimes cause the need for unnecessary legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> The wood that farmers may use for personal purposes can be used for fencing and the maintenance of the natural landscape. Where there is evidence that illegal felling has occurred, it is important that the Minister of the day have the power necessary to impose an order on the offender. Section 25 in Part 6 gives the Minister the power to compel such a forest owner to replant the area or an equivalent area within his or her ownership and makes it an offence if the offender fails to do so. In extreme situations, the fines range up to a maximum of €1 million or imprisonment of five years. This type of penalty may seem excessive at first glance. From a conservation point of view, however, I have no doubt but that it will be a dissuasive and necessary inclusion. A minority make such measures necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> We need to strike a balance between promoting afforestation, ensuring that we reap the financial benefits generated and maintaining our collective responsibility for environmental protection. It is a tough balance to strike, but I am convinced that the Minister of State has introduced comprehensive and responsive legislation to the House. It ensures that the heritage of which we are proud is protected for future generations. The multifaceted benefit of our forests to the tourism industry, climate change, health and quality of life is incalculable. Their potential commercial value is also incalculable, given the fact that the sector's output is already €673 million per year.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> All in all, this is an important element of Irish life and the economy and a vital debate. I am honoured to be a part of it. I wish the Minister of State and the legislation well. I hope that we will look back on this as a good day's work.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_329">
          <from>Deputy John Paul Phelan<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_734">I am unsure as to whether I have had the opportunity to do so in the House since the Minister of State was appointed, but I wish him the best in his job.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> I will make a couple of points. I come from a part of the world where there is a great deal of forestry. In south Kilkenny in particular, there has traditionally been a large amount of State forestry. In recent years, much private woodland has joined that. The Minister of State visited some of those areas recently. The importance of the sector to the local economy is significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> I was interested in the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe's reference to SmartPly being in Waterford. Of course, it is not - it is in Kilkenny. It plays an obvious employment role that I hope will continue. As we all know, demand for timber will increase during the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> This Bill is primarily designed to update current legislation. Under its provisions, the two separate felling licence processes that can be followed today will be streamlined into a single process. This makes sense. I am interested in the exemptions from felling licences. Perhaps the Minister of State will refer to them in his closing remarks. Under one exemption that does not make much sense to me - perhaps there is a simple explanation - all woodland in urban areas will be exempted from requiring a felling licence. Perhaps I am misreading the legislation. Why has this provision been included? If trees needed to be removed for safety reasons, etc., I would have no issue, but people would be concerned if a blanket exemption for felling were applied to the pockets of woodland in various urban centres around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> While I do not wish to go into specific cases, I want to mention the requirement for replanting which involves a large degree of bureaucracy. In particular, where people are felling small areas of private woodland there is an existing requirement for them to replant. However, if it is under five acres it is often difficult to get a quote from contractors to replant. I have come across one instance where an individual undertook to do the replanting himself. That was because it was impossible for him to get a quotation to replant such a small area which he felled due to farm consolidation. The individual was a dairy farmer who had no problem with replanting but he could not get anyone to quote for the work. It dragged on for a long time and eventually common sense prevailed.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> I am glad that the Bill allows for more discretion in this regard, because the existing system was somewhat cumbersome. The forestry sector is important across the country. I grew up in a rural part of Kilkenny when there were over 1,000 acres of State forest at the back of the house in which I was reared. By and large, Coillte has done a good job in managing that area. However, Coillte faces many difficult issues, including indiscriminate dumping in some woodland areas. The company has endeavoured to do its best over the years to protect such areas. </p>
          <p eId="para_740"> The Woodstock Gardens in Inistioge has been a great development involving the local authority and Coillte, as well as others who live on the grounds of the old estate. Therefore, there are good examples of how our forests are being managed. On balance, I welcome the legislation and, hopefully, the Minister of State will have some news for me. </p>

          <p eId="para_741">I wish to join with others in congratulating the Minister of State on his elevation to his new position. I wish him every success in the future. I now call on him to respond to the Second Stage debate.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Tom Hayes)<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_742">At the outset, I would like to thank the many Deputies, including the Ceann Comhairle, who wished me well. All one needs in life is luck and, hopefully, things will go well in carrying out my tasks on behalf of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> I also thank the many Deputies on both sides of the House for their contributions to the Second Stage debate on this significant Bill. Their contributions have been both useful and informed. The range and extent of the comments provide evidence of the huge interest that forestry generates for so many people. The comments of the Deputies focused not just on the economic value of the forest industry, but also the importance of forestry from the environmental and recreational perspectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> Tourism was mentioned in the context of forest walkways and roadways. I was struck by the link between tourism and forestry, and the importance of forest walkways in bringing overseas visitors to our country. As we emerge from our economic difficulties, we must try to encourage more tourists to come here. The forest sector will play a major role in that respect. </p>
          <p eId="para_745"> It is important that a legislative framework be put in place for the future development of this important economic resource that recognises and reflects the objective of ensuring that such development is consistent with protecting the environment. I am confident that the Bill will make a significant contribution to that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> As I said in my opening remarks, this Bill is about forestry and good forest practices. Many people have spoken about Coillte but this Bill is not about that company. I acknowledge the many speakers who have praised the Government for making a difficult decision on the future of Coillte, which was good for the country. The Bill's provisions are applicable both to public and private forestry owners, which is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> I appreciate that this legislation has been a long time in preparation and I am conscious of the gap between the completion of the initial consultation process some time ago and the presentation of the Bill to the House. To address this, several meetings have taken place recently with interested parties. In addition, we have received a number of written submissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> In his contribution to the debate, Deputy Boyd Barrett made a strong call for further consultation on the Bill, as did my colleague Deputy Michael Creed. I noted their concerns and since the commencement of the Second Stage debate in early October, my officials and I have met with a number of stakeholder and representative groups spanning the range of forestry interests, including forest owners, forest companies, farm organisations, agricultural consultants and environmental groups. Even yesterday, at the IFA conference in Athlone I met with a group of forestry producers. In recent weeks, my door has been open for meaningful discussions on the Bill. I acknowledge the contribution of those who helped us to steer the Bill through the House. </p>
          <p eId="para_749"> I am satisfied that the Bill will provide a more flexible system for regulating forestry activities, including felling licensing and will better serve the interests of all stakeholders. Where regulations are to be introduced, I will also facilitate prior consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> I wish to acknowledge the contribution of the late Shane McEntee who began the work on this legislation. As I go around the country to meet with various groups, Shane McEntee's name has come up every time due to his input and commitment to the legislation. Like everyone else, I think of him today and I also think of his widow and family as they face into the first anniversary of his death.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> Deputies O'Reilly, Ferris, Ó Cuív and Halligan referred to the administrative burden associated with forestry. In my opening address I stressed that the intention of the Bill is not to add to the administrative burden on landowners or other stakeholders in the forest sector. It is important to repeat that message now. The intention is to streamline and simplify the various processes. The issue of red tape has been mentioned by many contributors, including one of my predecessors Deputy John Browne. I can reassure Deputies that the systems to be put in place by my Department will be as user-friendly as possible. It is neither in the Department's nor the applicant's interest that processes should be overly complex or difficult to deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> I acknowledge that people are considering working in the forestry sector, but there is also competition in the dairy industry where huge potential is developing following the developments regarding the quota. In addition, beef markets are opening up. With more profitability coming back into agriculture, forestry must be placed on a level playing field. It is in nobody's interest, therefore, to have a complex process operating in the sector. I look forward to working with everyone on Committee Stage to ensure that no administrative obstacles are placed in anyone's way.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> Deputy Browne mentioned that the Bill does not set targets for the supply of wood to the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">The setting of such targets is a matter of ongoing policy. It is not a matter appropriate to primary legislation dealing with regulation of the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> I remind the House of the Government's continued commitment to forestry, as evidenced by the maintenance of funding for the forestry sector in the recent budget. As acknowledged today, the maintenance of funding in this area over the past few years and, in particular, the past year was a difficult task. The Government has in this regard, to use an old phrase, "put its money where its mouth is". I hope it can continue to maintain this funding into the future. The argument that the investment has been already made by the taxpayer will support this. I am pleased to reiterate that commitment as announced in the recent budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> Deputies Creed, Ferris and others raised the issue of the Minister's ability to acquire land for afforestation. I am happy to clarify for the Deputies, farming organisations and forest owners concerned about this issue that based on the legal advice I have received on the matter, section 6(<i>e</i>) does not provide the Minister with the power to purchase land by compulsory order. </p>
          <p eId="para_757"> Another issue raised by Deputy Andrew Doyle and others is that of land availability. The Department has set up a working group comprising a wide range of stakeholders to examine the wide range of issues affecting existing afforestation levels, on which matter it will report to the Department. I hope this process will be successful and will result in the provision of a guideline or roadmap in this regard. One has only to drive the roads of Ireland to see the vast amount of marginal land that could potentially be used for forestry. It is important more land is made available. If this does not happen, the industry may run into trouble. </p>
          <p eId="para_758"> A number of Deputies, including Deputy Bannon, raised the issue of the requirement for felling licences and, in particular, for thinning operations. Thinning licences are needed to ensure protection of the environment, to prevent illegal deforestation and to facilitate timber certification and other traceability systems. This will provide forest owners with the necessary documentary evidence that trees have been felled and legally sourced. I have spoken to numerous forest owners and I acknowledge that thinning is good forest practice which needs to be encouraged. I also recognise that there is a need for thinning licences and that the licensing process needs to be user-friendly.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> One of the advantages of a forest management plan is that it allows forest owners to have a medium to long-term vision for the woodlands they manage. The submission of such plans will allow all scheduled felling, including thinning, to be licensed for a period of up to ten years. It will also allow greater flexibility for forest owners scheduling harvesting activities. I propose on Committee Stage to introduce a provision dealing with turnaround times for the processing of these licences, which I hope will clarify the situation for the many people and Deputies who raised this issue with me. I am committed to making the process as easy as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> A number of Deputies also raised the issue of replanting following felling. The Bill allows the Minister to set conditions and includes the replanting of trees. Unlike the 1946 Act under which replanting is mandatory in the case of a general felling licence, this Bill provides for an element of discretion in relation to the felling regime proposed therein. This is important. Forests provide a wide range of benefits and play an essential role in protecting our environment. They also provide a sustainable supply of timber and fuel for industry, act as an essential store of carbon and are important for mitigation against climate change. The State has invested heavily in the afforestation programme through payment of grants and premiums and generous tax arrangements to encourage land-use change.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> On the charging of fees, section 24 of the Bill gives the Minister the option to charge for the services of the Department into the future. This provision has given rise to some concerns among farmer and industry representatives and was also articulated by Deputy Joe Carey in the course of his contribution. It is a matter of policy whether the Minister should charge for such services. The inclusion of this provision in the Bill should not be interpreted as a statement of intent. I remind Deputies that the Department does not currently charge for forestry licences or scheme applications and this will remain the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> On the powers of authorised officers, concern was expressed by a number of Deputies about the powers afforded in the Bill to authorised officers, primarily forestry inspectors, in the exercise of their functions. These powers are essential to enable the Department and its officers to fully investigate the range of issues in relation to alleged illegal activities encountered by it in the exercise of its forestry remit. Authorised officers of the Department working in areas such as plant health, marketing of forest reproductive material and direct payments already have a wide range of powers under various Acts and regulations, which are in line with those listed in the Bill. These powers will be exercised within the law and in a proportionate and fair manner. It is my intention to ensure fairness in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> On the issue of penalties for offences such as illegal felling, forgery, etc., Deputies will be aware of the need for penalties to be dissuasive and proportionate. It is important to note that the penalties imposed will be a matter for the courts to decide following a conviction. The Bill also provides for fixed payment notices for minor<b>
						</b>offences relating to unlicensed felling, similar to those issued in respect of a speeding fine. These offences can be dealt with without the expense and utilisation of scarce resources that recourse to the courts entails. This is a very welcome development. It will ensure that illegally felled areas are replanted under the protection of the law without the offender being taken to court. It is a provision that should be made use of in other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> On the power of the Minister under section 20 to register felling conditions or replanting orders as a burden on the land, this power already exists in current legislation and is not new. It is a discretionary power which will serve to protect the interests of a potential purchaser of forestry land where, for example, there is a replanting condition.<b>
						</b>I will look again at the scope of this provision in the context of Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> Several speakers expressed concern regarding the provisions setting out the responsibilities of committee members appointed under the Bill and, in particular, the penalties for breaches of confidentiality. Again, I will review this provision on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> The power of the Minister to request further information was also raised. This power is important in order to collect statistics and information on the national forest estate, which will complement national and EU reporting requirements. Collection of information on forests will also provide information to the Minister on how forests are being managed and may determine the direction of future policy. I have listened to the concerns expressed by Deputies in this regard and will consider the matter further on Committee Stage. I assure Members that the intention under this provision is nothing other than the compiling of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> The issue of the damage caused by deer and vermin was raised by Deputy Andrew Doyle and others. I recognise that this is a serious problem in certain parts of the country, particularly in Wicklow. The Bill provides for the carrying out of deer control measures and the making of regulations in the areas of forest protection. Such regulations will be provided subject to consultation with all relevant stakeholders. I intend to commence that consultation process as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> Deputies Mattie McGrath, Patrick O'Donovan, Tony McLoughlin and others referred to the impact of timber haulage on local roads. It is an issue that is raised regularly with local authorities throughout the country and is a matter of serious concern for local residents. The Forest Industry Transport Group, which includes representatives of local authorities, the haulage industry and relevant State bodies, is currently developing a good practice guide to managing timber transport. I am hopeful this will address some of the issues that have arisen and alleviate people's concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> I reiterate my appreciation of the contributions made by Deputies on this important issue. The debate has been very useful in providing clarity on key provisions of the Bill and putting to rest a number of misunderstandings. It was put to me more than once by certain parties that the Bill should be torn up, but I was never going to do that. When I came to office I knew this legislation had to be dealt with and, moreover, I knew it was needed. The democratic consultation process was very helpful to our endeavours to produce the best possible legislation. I take this opportunity to commend my officials on their commitment to making the Bill amenable both to people in rural areas and the forestry industry. It is an exciting sector and one that is very important from an economic and tourism point of view. It is also hugely important in terms of the environment. Anybody associated with forestry will have enjoyed the beautiful colours of the trees and leaves in recent weeks. I look forward to working with Deputies on Committee Stage to move the Bill forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_773">I am not sure.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> Last week, during the course of statements on the decision not to seek an additional credit line I stated that, while welcome, the decision should not be considered to be a job done or anything approaching a certain return to times of prosperity. I took the view that amid the excitable reaction and triumphalism on the Government side there was a need for perspective. I believe this motion provides that perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> We are still a country carrying levels of debt which are utterly unsustainable. The word "unsustainable" has been used time and again in the Chamber, but what I mean is that our economy will continue to struggle to cope with these regular payments. More than any other fact, the reality of being forced to pay these debts will dictate Ireland's economic future for the next 30 to 40 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> We all know the origins of this debt. The Fianna Fáil mismanagement of the economy and its disastrous decision to guarantee those bonds will live in infamy. The mistakes of that period should never be forgotten. However, that does not allow the current Government off the hook. It has resolved on numerous occasions to pay the bondholders this odious debt, culminating in the decision in February to turn the remainder of the promissory notes into sovereign bonds. The Government may well condemn and criticise the previous Fianna Fáil Government, but it was the current Government which foolishly turned the notes into sovereign debt on the basis of a short-term publicity boost, long since forgotten, and on the basis of a broad aspirational statement at a European level. As things stand, a commitment does not look like coming to fruition.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> We need not go back over red cents and Frankfurt's way once again, but the mandate these parties received was clear. It is perfectly clear to me that the Government's strategy, which seems to be to remain as quiet, meek and accepting as possible, has failed. Time and again the Government has failed to raise the matter at European level. Where has that left us? It has left us with a debt that remains vast, at 124% of GDP and it is increasing.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> I commend those who have steadfastly campaigned against the payment of the toxic debt, including the Ballyhea group from north Cork. We stand with them and share their view that we have no obligation to honour the debts of these speculators and gamblers and that our children will deeply regret that failure. Our children will curse that decision. The Government traded the €28 billion promissory notes for a sovereign liability to the State which could, with interest, amount to €60 billion. If ever a decision were to be described as penny wise and pound foolish, that was it. Not one penny of that debt was caused by the public. We never needed to pay those debts, they were not our debts then and they are not our debts now. We have consistently pointed out that we did not need to pay the debt, that such a course of action would not damage confidence in Ireland and that it would be wrong to pay these bondholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> There is a bitter irony in the fact that now, as our Government has turned promissory notes into sovereign debt, burning the bondholders appears as though it might become European economic policy. Economists are fond of referring to Japan's so called lost decade in the 1990s as an example of continued economic stagnation. In Ireland we will not only have a lost decade but it will be compounded by a lost generation as we lose vast numbers of our young people. We had long trumpeted our young population as a major economic asset. Now we have a situation whereby of the 89,000 emigrants in 2013, a total of 34,800 were between 15 and 24 years and 41,000 were between 25 and 44 years. This will have a significant impact on our long-term ability to attract investment and create jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> Despite the Government's efforts to paint a rosy picture, the long-term outlook for the Irish economy is not so positive. If we are to return to real prosperity it is essential that the debt burden is lifted. It is not too late to tackle this. The consensus in Europe has shifted and generally there is an acceptance that the type of debt we have paid out on is odious and that the State should not be liable. There is an opportunity to be grasped. However, for that to take place the Government must change its approach and take a firmer line with the European Central Bank with regard to the debt. We should not simply hope that the bank will look kindly on Ireland, we should demand movement. I hope the Government backs the motion and acts on it, for the sake of our children's future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Colreavy<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T19:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_781">I have five minutes. I am not an economist. I suppose I am fortunate enough to have a resident economist at home. Otherwise, I would be insolvent at this stage. I do not intend to discuss economics, what the Government did or did not do in 2008 or the decisions it took. I would prefer for us to consider what is right and wrong, just and unjust, fair and unfair. I believe the Government mindset, articulated by the Taoiseach when he explained to the world media that we all partied during the so-called Celtic tiger years, is fundamentally inaccurate.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> It is bad enough to be inaccurate but that mindset has driven the Government's failure to ensure that those who created the economic crisis should be responsible for rectifying it. I am referring to the grasping bankers, the non-functioning regulators, the greedy and opportunistic bond purchasers, the incompetent politicians, the auditing companies which allowed the entire mess to build up under their noses, the developers whose greed for the quick hundred million bucks smothered their sense of what was right or sensible and most of the media, who slavishly passed on the messages about putting on the green jersey, about the fundamentals being sound and about there being a soft landing, if anything. These are the people and organisations who allowed us to reach the stage where the nation was left on the brink of abject bankruptcy.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> Who is paying for these failures? The answer is the people who did not party. Those who did the right thing are paying for it. Those who followed the advice of their so-called betters by buying or building homes for their families rather than depending on social housing are paying for it. Did the people and families who are now homeless party? Did the people dependent on social protection party? Did the young people who are leaving our schools and colleges and emigrating in their thousands party? Did the people on waiting lists for hospital services or those receiving a pittance for caring for their loved ones party? Did private and public service workers on low or average wages party? Did those who followed all the advice, who took out mortgages and who are now in default and serious negative equity party? None of these people, or few of them, partied. Yet they are paying the ransom for those who caused or permitted the crisis in the first place, the same people who continue to party.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> Many of the individuals and companies who bought out the bonds did so at bargain basement prices because there was a general market expectation that there would be significant losses on those investments. Did those who purchased at rock bottom prices have any inkling that this generation of Irish people would impoverish themselves and future generations to guarantee full profits for the bond purchasers and to save the European economy from collapse?</p>
          <p eId="para_785">How much did they know before buying those bonds at rock bottom prices? While the previous Government may have signed up to the so-called bailout and austerity, the current Government has continued this policy. It is the gift that keeps on giving, that is, giving to the bondholders, the bankers, the auditors and to politicians, as well as to those who now are retired but were up to their necks in causing or overseeing this disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> It would be wrong were a neighbour of mine to tell me he placed €10,000 on a bet with Paddy Power but the horse did not come in and furthermore, that the money should have been spent on preventing his house from going on fire - because if it did, my house also would go on fire - but in consequence, he was seeking from me both the €10,000 and what he would have won, had the bet come in. Would that be right, just or fair? One can argue the economics all one wishes but it is wrong and it should be changed immediately.</p>

          <p eId="para_788">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. All Members share the anger at the burden that has been placed on the backs of the people and at the banks' role in precipitating this crisis. The promissory note deal was another of the legacy arrangements the Government inherited from its predecessor. However, the Government has managed to renegotiate that deal, securing significant savings for the Exchequer in the future. The agreement was made possible because of the considerable work done by the Government to repair Ireland's international reputation. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are held in high esteem among their international colleagues, because they recognise the work they have done to bring sustainability to the public finances. Were this motion to pass in this House tonight, it would undo all of the good work that has been done in recent years. I note 15 December next is D-day for exiting the bailout. This decision has been met positively by the markets, which also are positive about Ireland's post-bailout prospects. However, such market sentiment would change very quickly if international investors thought Ireland was going to default on its debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> Members cannot afford to let this happen at a stage at which an economic recovery is gaining ground and there are continued signs of stabilisation in the jobs market. Members should consider the Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures published yesterday, which confirm that 5,000 jobs per month now are being created in the private sector, compared with the position inherited from the previous Government, when 8,000 jobs per month were being lost. Foreign direct investment is flowing back into the country and I believe the Opposition motion, if passed, would seriously jeopardise this flow of inward investment. Put simply, international companies would not choose Ireland. They would take their investment and, more importantly, their jobs somewhere else. The IDA perceives the competition from the United Kingdom and elsewhere to offer a considerable challenge to the goal of bringing jobs to Ireland. Moreover, I can vouch for this because as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, I regularly meet international investors. They view Ireland as a good place in which to do business because the economic situation has been stabilised, because competitiveness has been maintained, because of Ireland's attractive corporation tax rate and because of its position as a gateway to Europe and its access to a market of 500 million people in the European Union. If our reputation with Europe is seen to be damaged, I believe the incentive to invest here in the future would be greatly affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> The people will never forgive those who want to prevent jobs from coming into this country and if passed, this is what this motion would achieve. We certainly would have no credibility in Europe or anywhere in the world. At present, nine of the top ten pharmaceutical companies in the world are located here. We have the best-educated workforce and most of the social media companies have based their European headquarters here in Dublin. We certainly do not wish to renege on our obligations. Can the Opposition Members who support this motion tell me how they would propose to bring in further foreign direct investment were the House to approve it? Ireland certainly would not be in the position in which it has found itself this week. Like many Deputies in this House, I seek more foreign direct investment and not less. I of course seek a greater regional spread of these projects, which is extremely important. Everyone is aware that 80% of foreign direct investment is coming into Dublin, Cork and Galway but I certainly want the other regions to get more of that as well. At every opportunity I get when travelling abroad, I try to educate investors about the importance of access and of investing in the other regions as well. I talk of my home region of County Clare, which has an international airport at Shannon that is an engine for growth for foreign direct investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> If this motion is passed, all the work that has been done in recent years will unravel. To deviate from the Government's economic strategy now would have catastrophic consequences for the country and more especially for the people, who wish to work. Ireland would have no credibility with its EU partners and it would drive international investors out of the country. As Ireland is on the brink of exiting its bailout programme, access to the markets is critical for it. A vote for this motion is a vote to enter another bailout programme and for that reason, as well as to protect the level of foreign direct investment, I ask Members on the Opposition benches to reject this motion and to vote with the Government to continue the approach that is delivering recovery and job creation for the country.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOReilly" eId="spk_338">
          <from>Deputy Joe O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_792">The argument of Government Members against this motion is entirely strengthened and underlined by yesterday's news on employment and the revelation that over the past year, 58,000 new jobs have been created in the private sectors over four consecutive quarters. Moreover, 1,200 jobs per week are being created at present in the private sector, in contrast with the 1,600 jobs per week that were being lost under the previous Administration. That is the backdrop to the motion and the only way in which one can consider it.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> I accept fully that additional measures are required to improve further the jobs situation. Further stimuli are needed, as are better credit lines. Moreover, it is necessary to have the youth guarantee scheme up and running and to continue with prudential financial management and probity in the State's finances to give confidence to inward investors. I note all of this is taking place, and it merits, stating that as Ireland exits the bailout, Members should applaud the people for their fortitude and good sense, as well as the manner in which they have stayed with Members in the project. One cannot underestimate the pain people have suffered and that should never be understated. The people merit applause in this House for the manner in which they have coped. They must have felt justified in their forbearance by yesterday's outcome, the promissory note deal to which I will turn later and other issues. It was necessary to get the correct conditions to get job creation going and one must have full and independent access to the financial markets, which is pending. In addition, Ireland has had good outings in those markets in recent years and I note Moody's is upgrading Ireland's status considerably. Ireland needed to and has restored its international reputation. It also has reduced the State deficit to a point where the budget deficit will be 7.4% of GDP this year and is on target to reach 3% by 2015, which is an extraordinarily important aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> While it is all about job creation and that is the only agenda, everything the Government does is predicated around achieving that. No one can understate the horrendous youth unemployment problem but at least the number of young people at work has increased by 3,200 or more than 2% over the past year. In addition, long-term unemployment has dropped from 8.9% to 7.6%. The Government also has reduced the cost of State borrowing by €20 billion in the next ten years. This is due to the replacement of the promissory notes and the associated annual payment of €3.1 billion with long-term, low-interest Government bonds over a 25 to 40 year period, on which the State will pay a floating 3% to 3.5% interest rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_795"> We will borrow the money from the Central Bank which receives loans from the ECB at 1% or less, meaning our Central Bank stands to make 2.5% profit per year. The Exchequer will profit and the effective interest rate will be 1%.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> The difficulty with the motion and the proposition before the House is that it would destroy our prospects of getting funding from the international markets. It would undo almost three years of backbreaking work and great sacrifices by the Irish people. It would be silly to effectively do a U-turn at this critical juncture, having got so far. It would damage us on the international markets which would ultimately have implications for the financing of public services such as social welfare, health and education. Job creation would be jeopardised by this proposal and critically, it would affect inward investment which is vital for job creation. We are only a few weeks away from exiting the bailout. We are getting the public finances under control. We have achieved this while maintaining core social welfare rates and without increasing personal direct taxation and while maintaining direct payments to our farmers which supports the rural society affected by the imbalance in job creation. We are now creating jobs and there are signs that the economy is in recovery. It would be bizarre and crazy to change course at this point when we are winning. I urge the people proposing the motion to reflect and to modify it accordingly so that we can agree a revised motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_797">The sentiment of the motion might be correct in many aspects but the timing of such a motion is inappropriate, given that debt which was not originally a State debt became sovereign debt on the infamous night of the bank guarantee. Ironically, on that night, Sinn Féin secured the vote for the Government for the bank guarantee when the debts of private institutions became sovereign debt. The time for negotiation was then, but unfortunately, only a small number of people were privy to the information that led to the events that transpired on that night.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> We should negotiate with the European Central Bank, the IMF and the European Commission but we should do so on our terms. This view was opposed by many of those who have signed this motion. The ESM has put a mechanism in place whereby it was hoped we could recapitalise the banks retrospectively and also capitalise banks in the future. Some Opposition Members do not seem to see, feel, know or understand what the Irish people have gone through over recent years. Families, friends, associates, have all experienced what has been done to this country. The decision to pay off the debt that became a national debt has not been taken lightly. It is a question of the ability to meet the terms and conditions of all debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> I am not an Independent Deputy but I am most certainly of independent mind. I try to influence my party and my government colleagues but I obey the Whip because that is the system. However, I am also a member of a European political party, the Social Democrats, whose sister party today became part of the government in Germany. I am not an Independent in this House. However, there are benefits to being a member of a party and being part of a wider European organisation.</p>

          <p eId="para_801">There are many benefits other than electoral benefits to being part of an organisation. We should attempt to get the ESM to work to our benefit. This will be done by means of a diplomatic offensive by Christian democrats and social democrats and our own diplomatic corps as well as our academics who have spoken on our behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> I have colleagues in the Greek Parliament who are members of PASOK, a social democratic organisation. They regard us with envy. They ask how have we achieved such growth in our economy and in job creation. In Greece, civil servants have been sacked and the current Greek ten-year bond rate is 8.5%. The largest spike in their bond rate was when they got a write-down from the European Central Bank. Their inability to borrow was such that they went to 15% in the bond market. Every country needs to have access to the private bond markets in order to be a viable investment destination and to have a viable economy. Our recovery is happening in steps. I would like us to be able to write off large chunks of national debt but there is no pixie dust or magic wand. To suggest otherwise is not practical. </p>
          <p eId="para_803"> I supported an opposition colleague in a high-level meeting with the NTMA and the Department of Finance. The proposal was regarded as inconceivable and inappropriate. We will facilitate any realistic proposal. However, some people take a populist stand and do not speak to EU colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> The Government's objectives are to create jobs and to deal with our debt. Every step we take will be for the betterment of the people. Let no one have the cheek to say we are not doing something for the people of Ireland.</p>

In the past week the infamous €440 billion bank guarantee has come to an end and the Central Statistics Office statistics show that 58,000 jobs have been created in the past year. This is the strongest showing yet that we are on a road to recovery. However, there is still the issue of dealing with those that brought this country to its knees.

          <p eId="para_808">The dogs in the street know they are the people who destroyed our economy. They wrecked our banking system and were responsible for Ireland losing her hard fought independence. We need to activate the legislation to bring those to book and to see them punished. The ordinary people, the vulnerable, the sick and disabled, who are being targeted for cutbacks over the past six years, want to see those people prosecuted and punished. The people who led the Irish economy into this mess should not be let off the hook to retire on massive pension packages, bonuses and other types of payments. The people of my constituency and the public are not happy with the length of time it is taking to bring serious charges against those who knowingly destroyed our country's finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> I ask if the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is understaffed. What is the delay in bringing those people to justice? How can it be in our best interests to pay promissory notes and billions of euro to anonymous, nameless bondholders when the new poor and the vulnerable are suffering disproportionately while some people who bankrupted this State are not unduly suffering or affected?</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> Most Members of the House remember the chaos of September 2008 and the blanket €440 billion guarantee of Irish banks. This guarantee ruined Ireland's creditworthiness. There was a mistaken belief in Europe that no European bank must be allowed to fail. The European approach was that everything possible should be done to protect bank creditors. As part of that process the ECB extended a bottomless pit of emergency funding to Anglo Irish Bank in order to allow it repay its bondholders in full.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">Nothing in life is free. When this Government came to office the new Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, was met with a tap on the back from the European Central Bank asking for its bottomless pit of money back. The Minister was left with the job of having to restructure the promissory note arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> It is important to recognise the efforts made by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in dealing with our situation and the fundamental shift at European level in dealing with countries in trouble in comparison to when we were centre stage in late 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> In the wake of the troika leaving Cyprus, it is remarkable how the Cypriots represent a complete reversal of European policy from the approach adopted towards Ireland. Europe backed us into a corner on paying back the bondholders and now they say there is no sympathy for Ireland because we led ourselves into this mess. That is not the case. It was bad government, bad regulation and the golden circle of people like David Drumm who knowingly led us into this economic nightmare. They are the ones for whom Europe should have no sympathy. It is unfair to blame innocent Irish people for the doings of a reckless few.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> White collar crime among bankers and former politicians has impacted upon every taxpayer in the country, and it is important that we do not turn a blind eye to that. The general public are frustrated by the apparent inability to call those people to account. They should not be perceived to be above the law as it is an outrage and insult to our democracy. There are no legal or moral obligations on ordinary people to pay for private banking debt but the Minister knows best how to get our markets right, and I will not question his judgment.</p>

          <p eId="para_815">Words are important. Rhetoric is important. Considered words and thoughtful rhetoric are the stuff of ideas, discussion, debate argument, discovery and leadership. The institution that is this House is the rightful place for those of us who advocate ideas in the public space, argue differing philosophies, debate opinions and articulate public support for their validity but hollow words and empty rhetoric, dressed up as policy, with a thinly concealed pretence of validity, do not live up to that purpose. Instead, they mislead.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> I received a number of e-mails this week from individuals who told me that by voting in favour of the motion before the House tonight I will be burning the Anglo debt. That is untrue. Telling me that by voting in favour of tonight's motion I will be unburdening the State from unnecessary bank debt is untrue, and that by voting in favour of this motion I will be waving a magic wand undoing all the reality of the previous five years and ushering in a new era is untrue also. Those who have said that to people outside this House are not taking seriously their obligation to genuine debate and truthful exchange.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> I have lost count of the number of times slogans and empty rhetoric have been bombasted as the quick-fix solutions to all our country's very real ills. Populist, easy to chant slogans included "Austerity isn't working", "Default, default, default", "Bail out the worker" and so on. Those slogans are devoid of meaning and are not grounded in economics, finance or political reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> Tonight's motion purports to put lobbying the European Central Bank at the heart of our economic strategy. If we saunter into the lobby of the ECB, have a coffee with Mario Draghi, and whisper lightly in his ear he might do us a favour. Never mind that lobbying in itself is illegal; doing what the motion suggests is also illegal. The irony of a motion before a law-making body arguing for law breaking should not be lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> The greatest financial crisis this country has ever faced cannot be fixed by slogans. It could never be easy. It was always going to be difficult. Those of us on the Government side of the House have made difficult decisions, introduced difficult budgets and taken serious flak for political decisions we thought necessary. We put the country first, ahead of party and ahead of our own jobs. I am proud that we did that and that having lost 250,000 jobs, this country is now creating 1,200 jobs every week. I am proud that an economy that was choking and spluttering is back on its feet. I am proud that our country's reputation, which was in tatters, is now restored. I am glad that even though there is so much more to fix, the Irish people, who suffered so much, are once again confident that the future is not something to be feared but something that offers hope.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> That record of achievement, albeit modest and fragile, was not the product of a cheap slogan, empty words, hollow rhetoric or fairy tale economics but the result of hard work, tough decisions and words of meaning and genuine purpose. We renegotiated the IMF deal. We reduced interest rates. We restructured repayments and got rid of the promissory notes but, more importantly, we placed jobs at the centre of our economic thinking and at the heart of every decision we made.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> This remains an extremely difficult time for our people, and there is a long way to go, but as I walk down Shop Street or Eyre Square in Galway, look at the businesses and talk to the people on the street I can see that sense of hope starting to return. A recent survey I conducted of Galway businesses indicated that 70% of businesses have seen an improvement in their trading conditions in the past year, and 24% of businesses intend hiring within the next six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_822"> These are small beginnings, a return to normality and hope for people that they can return to work, earn a living and provide for themselves again. These results have been achieved through difficulty and perseverance, not by the political system but by those in our country who had to suffer the consequences of a massive international downturn and disgraceful politics which prevailed under the previous Government for over 14 years. It is not the time to risk that. It is not the time to put cheap motions and empty rhetoric at the heart of our economic policy. It is not right to betray people who suffered so much with easy and false hope. It is time to stick the course, which is the right way to proceed.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T20:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_823">I thank the Technical Group for putting down the motion, which is an attempt to revisit the past and re-write history. We all wish that things had been done differently but we cannot undo what has been done and what was put in place without consideration of the consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_824"> Last weekend was the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who. The Deputies who tabled this motion must have thought they had access to a Tardis. They confused reality with the fictional time travelling of Doctor Who. How else can they explain taking such a reckless step without realising the consequences for the Irish people? Talking about an ideology is one thing but being in government means one is responsible to all of the citizens all of the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> We have already had one Government that staked the future of the Irish people on a game of high-risk poker and lost. We are now seeing a different approach that is delivering results. The approach of this Government is to work with our partners, use constructive diplomacy to achieve results, and relieve the burden that was put on the shoulders of the Irish people. It is important to thank the Irish people for playing a responsible role in assisting this Government to recover our economic fortunes.</p>
          <p eId="para_826"> Last February, the Government reached an agreement with the ECB to restructure the former promissory note and to reduce the burden it placed on the shoulders of the Irish people. The effect of that was to reduce the State's cash borrowing requirement by €20 billion over the next ten years. It has reduced the budget deficit by approximately €1 billion per annum over the coming years. We were told it could not be renegotiated but it was renegotiated.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> Early in this Government's term we saw renegotiation of other elements of the bailout package including reducing the interest rates, which will save us €10 billion; extending the maturities of EFSF and EFSM loans to up to seven years has yielded significant savings; half of any proceeds from the sale of State assets can be retained and used for job creation; and the cost of bank recapitalisation was reduced by €18.5 billion, limited from an initial €35 billion as per the troika agreement, to €16.5 billion through junior bondholder burden-sharing and securing private capital investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> I pose a question to the Members opposite. Who are the bondholders they want to burn? They should name them in this House.</p>

          <p eId="para_830">The approach of this Government so far has yielded dividends for our people and our economy. It has resulted in the State being able to re-enter the international finance markets. In the first quarter of this year the National Treasury Management Agency raised €7.5 billion from two over-subscribed bond sales showing the strong international interest in investing in Ireland. Re-entering the markets has put us in a position where we have a cash buffer for 12 to 15 months, which means that we can exit the bailout on 15 December.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> The international confidence this Government has restored is not just about financing our country so that we can once again pay for essential services without the support of the our European colleagues. It is about job creation. That is why this week it is important that we recognise the story about job creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">Let me give the figures for October 2013 which show that for the first time since April 2009, the number of unemployed people in the city of Cork, which I represent and in which I live, has fallen below 39,000. In October, 38,449 people were on the live register in Cork. While this figure is still too high, it represents a fall of 19.6%, or more than 9,000, from a peak of almost 48,000 in July 2010. That is 9,000 Corkonians back at work because of this Government's policy, business investment and the ability of our country to rise above the difficulties it encountered.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> Many Members spoke about our economic sovereignty but let us look at the confidence our multinational companies bring in terms of cash injections and job creation. I want to focus on the Cork area where EMC, Apple and the large pharmaceutical companies in the harbour are creating jobs. Foreign direct investment creates and supports approximately 250,000 jobs directly and indirectly in our country. In the city and county of Cork, it will play a key role in the revitalisation of the local economy, although it also plays a significant role today in the local Cork economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> People want to tamper with our corporation tax. Do not tamper with the jobs of fellow citizens who require foreign direct investment in tandem with what this Government has done through its Action Plan for Jobs to create small enterprises and to give them assistance of which they were starved for so long by the previous Administration. To illustrate my point, I would ask where the Fianna Fáil Members are tonight. The reason they are not here is that they are running from their record. The record of this Government is about getting our country back to work, paying our way, being responsible in government and giving our people hope.</p>

          <p eId="para_835">In a Chamber noted for its brass necks, tonight's performance almost beat all. To have to listen to Deputy Spring, who is a former Anglo Irish Bank employee and who contested an election on a programme of Labour's way or Frankfurt's way, ridicule this motion takes some beating. This individual bragged about the Greek economy being on its knees and somehow thought that was something to crow about to his friends in PASOK but I can tell him there is nobody in Ireland who takes comfort from the situation in the Greek economy. We stand in solidarity with the ordinary people of Europe, whether in Greece or in Iceland, when they stand up and say "enough".</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> We have had correspondence from citizens all over the country in recent weeks about this motion. I want to put on the record some points made by one of those people because this young man, a 27 year old physiotherapist from Cork, actually sums up many of the issues about which we are talking. He told the story of how he treated an 84 year old lady who was very weak and tearful after her night in hospital earlier this year. She had spent a cold night on a trolley near the main door in Cork University Hospital and she asked why was this happening to her after everything she had contributed to this country. He said there were three wards on the fifth floor which were unopened due to staff and budgetary constraints and that accident and emergency nurses were run ragged with all the trolleys. He said this was not bad hospital management, that the rehab hospital was also full and that there were many patients waiting for eight weeks to go to nursing homes because of the cuts in home help hours. He said the issue was one of resources. </p>
          <p eId="para_837"> This young man went on to say he had worked in the NHS in Britain and in New Zealand and he felt working in Ireland was like working in a Third World country. He explained these issues to the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, who he said was trying hard but was missing the bigger picture. He posed a question to all of us, which I want to pose again. He spoke about our motion tonight and said we had the chance to do something about this situation for him and that we had the opportunity to decide on which side we stand. He asked whether we stand with the bankers or with the people of Ireland. That is, in essence, what we are debating.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> Last night, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy O'Dowd, when speaking against the motion said we follow through on our commitments and that this is the message we want to deliver to the international community. What commitments and to whom? What message do we want to deliver to the international community? Is it that it can hit us with whatever it likes and we will bend even lower and take it? That is not a message I want to deliver. That is not our commitment nor is it that of the people of Ballyhea, the student nurses, the 100,000 young people who are now in Australia, the 400,000 people who are still out of work, the secondary school teachers, the children with special needs, the survivors of symphysiotomy and all of the other people who have been shafted by this debt deal. It is not a message people want to deliver. </p>
          <p eId="para_839"> There are currently 32 unemployed people for every job in this State. What this side of the House is saying is that we should halt the payment of taxpayers' money to dead banks, banks which are not lending to small and medium businesses, the biggest employer in the country-----</p>

          <p eId="para_844"> Will the Government instruct our banks to invest our money not in dead banks, but in jobs because the only way in which this economy will recover is by putting people to work? Contrary to the claptrap from the some of the Government backbenchers, the people know jobs are not being created and that people are being driven out of this country in larger numbers than any of the jobs it is trying to deliver. Our hard earned cash should be invested to improve the lives of our citizens and to put people to work on a public works programme to turn around the situation and not given to the vultures who caused this problem in the first place.</p>

          <p eId="para_866">-----through the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank debt was certainly questionable and there is a strong case to be made for the cancellation of this debt, especially as the State was essentially defrauded by Anglo Irish Bank. The bank guarantee was illegitimate, undemocratic and probably the worst political decision made in the history of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> Why should the people of Ireland foot the bill for generations to come for debts which they had nothing to do with, debts incurred through the criminal or negligent activity of bankers, regulators and politicians? To date, the State has been reluctant to hold bankers to account for wrecking our economy despite the negative impact on every life on this island while on the other hand, the people and those not born have been and will be penalised for offences they did not commit.</p>
          <p eId="para_868"> Added to the moral argument of who should justifiably be held responsible for banking debt is the economic argument. Economic analysts, such as Micheal Taft, have highlighted the fact that the banking debt is a drain on our economy and counterproductive to economic recovery. Taft shows that Ireland is dangerously indebted with Government figures putting our debt at 124% as a percentage of GDP for this year, the highest it has been to date. </p>
          <p eId="para_869"> The Government's mantra is not to worry, all of this is sustainable and economic growth will reduce our deficit, as will austerity. Sadly, the truth of the matter is that there will be little or no economic growth in this country while the Government's policies are actively undermining same. The latest figure was 0.4% for the second quarter of 2013 and yet the Government's projections of reducing debt depend on economic growth of 1.8% next year, which was itself revised downwards from 2.4%. Added to this is the fact Government debt is actually higher than the already alarming rate of 124%. When measured as a percentage of GNP, as recommended by the ESRI, our debt is more than 150% this year, which highlights the fact this debt is not serviceable.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">However, if the Government is to be believed, the debt is perfectly serviceable. On whose backs can this be done? How much more is this Government prepared to sacrifice to pay off faceless institutional investors? How much more pain is it prepared to inflict on the people of Ireland? Will all of our public assets be sold off over the coming years? Will all services be privatised? Will the welfare state be further dismantled? Will young people continue to be evicted from this country? The level of influence the people of this country have in how it is run is continuing to dissipate. Austerity was not of their choosing. It was certainly not of their choosing that the weakest and most vulnerable should suffer most.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> Last weekend, I visited the Corrib site for the first time. I met a powerful group of people who dared to stand up to Shell and to the State in defence of their community and of the environment. They were battered for their efforts. It is a shocking story. I do not believe the community will get over it in the next 50 years. This State should be ashamed of what has happened in the Corrib case in the name of big business. It is disgraceful. I also salute the people of Ballyhea, who are refusing to accept the unfair burden that has been imposed on the Irish people. They have worn out their shoe leather, Sunday after Sunday, to show that this is not good enough, that it is not fair and that the Irish people deserve better. The onerous debt needs to be written off on moral or economic grounds as a matter of urgency. I support the motion before the House.</p>

Tá an rún atá os ár gcomhair an-simplí - níl i gceist ach ceist a chur. The motion is a very simple one. It is expressed in plain and non-threatening language. It is about putting a question, lobbying and asking for an exemption. It does not use the language of assertion or aggression. It is not threatening or demanding. It simply requests that we should look for something that, if granted, will be of substantial benefit to this country and its people. It is hard to understand the opposition to this simple request.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> The naive side of me wonders whether the reason for the Government amendment is that it is already in negotiations on this matter. I hope this is the case, but I have to be realistic when I see that the amendment uses language like "a fairer and more sustainable arrangement", "the best outcome" and "the best course of action". In its use of a phrase like "the implications of not making such payments, or raising the possibility of refusing to make these payments", the amendment misses the whole point of the motion. It makes something of it that is not appropriate. The amendment also refers to "our European partners". In my view, the term "partners" suggests an equality between people, but instead of that we have a hard task master.</p>

When the Central Bank sells that €25 billion worth of bonds, it will destroy the €25 billion it receives. Over the next 40 years, we will pay a total of €72 billion, when interest is included, to repay those billions which were originally used to bail out two insolvent banks. Apart from the injustice of this, it is ludicrous that we borrowed billions of euro in order to burn billions. Additional finances are necessary to deal with the health service, distressed mortgages, unemployment, emigration and housing problems. Some €15 million is being provided to local authorities to deal with housing voids. Dublin City Council could do with that full amount at the moment. I still do not think it would have enough money to cater for the housing needs in this city alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> I am all for paying my just debts. I believe Ireland should pay its just debts. Ireland is paying for the incompetence and negligence of European institutions in relation to the euro. This is crippling the economy and inhibiting real growth. It is not our debt. Democracy suffered a blow yesterday in the form of the High Court judgment on Deputy Joan Collins's challenge. That judgment seemed to hinge on Article 17.2 of the Constitution, which requires that "no law shall be enacted, for the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys unless the purpose of the appropriation shall have been recommended to Dáil Éireann by a message from the Government signed by the Taoiseach". That is not my view of parliamentary democracy. It certainly makes a farce of everybody here and what we are doing here. It is something for the Convention on the Constitution to look at.</p>
          <p eId="para_882"> The motion before the House tonight is a tribute to democracy and the democratic will of the people, particularly as exercised by the members of the Ballyhea group. We have to acknowledge their perseverance and tenacity in doing the right thing by their country. They are not going to accept the damage that has been done. I would like to conclude by quoting Pope Francis's interesting comment that "as long as the problems of the poor are not radically resolved by rejecting the absolute autonomy of markets and financial speculation and by attacking the structural causes of inequality, no solution will be found for the world's problems or, for that matter, to any problems".</p>

          <from>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T20:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_883">Some people have asked why we have tabled a motion on the promissory note bonds at this time. I will explain the reason. Every Sunday, in towns like Ballyhea and Charleville, people march to protest against Irish citizens being forced to pay the bad debts of private banks. We do not know to whom we are paying this money because neither this Government nor its predecessor has taken the simple steps required to find out. There are things we do know, however. We know the money was loaned by professional investors to private banks operating in Ireland. We know these loans were made in the full knowledge that they might not get repaid in full. We know many of these loans were sold on to speculators by the original investors. We know these speculators were gambling that the Government would impose a lower haircut on those loans than other people believed. We know this Government exceeded the speculators' wildest dreams by paying out in full in the end, thereby passing vast amounts of money from Irish households to foreign millionaires.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> Approximately half of this was done by means of promissory notes - an IOU that was given from the Irish people to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide. This IOU was not written for the benefit of Ireland; it was written for the benefit of Europe to prevent two eurozone banks from collapsing and to avoid the potential for contagion to other eurozone countries. When the Government restructured the promissory notes in February, it passed this IOU from Anglo Irish Bank to the Central Bank. Now we are paying interest to the Central Bank on this IOU. In time, we will have to pay the full €28 billion in capital. When the Central Bank gets that money, it will destroy it. It does not owe it on to anybody else. It will not put it to any productive use. That money will simply cease to exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_885"> A few months ago, a delegation from "Ballyhea Says No" met officials from the European Central Bank and the European Commission. They explained that the IOU was issued in a time of crisis to stabilise the European banking system. They explained that under the new eurozone banking rules, Ireland would not have to pick up this odious debt. They explained that no other European nation was being asked to bear the burden that Ireland is being asked to bear. They asked if the European Commission and the European Central Bank would consider changing the rules of monetary financing once to allow the Central Bank to destroy that €28 billion IOU. The officials sympathised with the plight of the Irish people, but they also said that they could not respond to such a request unless it came from the Irish Government and that no such request had ever been made. That is why we have tabled this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_886"> The motion before the House does not call for unilateral action or for default. It simply calls on the Government to ask and make the best case possible for an agreed destruction of that odious debt. The Government has said tonight that it will not even try. We have been told about the dangers of even asking. We have been told it would put 250,000 jobs at risk, lock us out of the money markets and make us look bad in Europe. What a load of rubbish.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">The Government claims it is doing a good job and claims to have lowered the interest rate on the troika debt, but it did not. It tried and failed. Portugal succeeded and then we got it. The Government claims to have burned the bondholders, but that is not really true given that €143 billion of senior debt has been paid out in full plus profits. Greece achieved a 50% write-down.</p>
          <p eId="para_888"> The Government claims Ireland no longer needs to borrow for the promissory notes, but we do and our children will pick up the tab. Yet, inexplicably, it seems the Government does not seem to want to make a fuss in Europe. I say it was elected to make a fuss. I commend the people of Ballyhea and I commend the motion to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T20:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_889">I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' motion on the needs for the destruction of the legacy bank debt. I commend and thank my Independent colleagues and the Ballyhea Says No group on all their magnificent work, research and consistent campaigning on this urgent and important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_890"> Before I go into the details of the debate on the motion, I add my support and deepest sympathy to the families of two great Irishmen, Fr. Alec Reid and Mr. Tom Gilmartin, who died in recent days. May they rest in peace, as they did their country a great service. Fr. Alec Reid made a huge contribution to our peace process and Mr. Tom Gilmartin stood up against corruption. Their families should be proud of them. May they rest in peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_891"> Will the Government acknowledge the massive burden these legacy debt issues are placing on society and remove the burden of bank debt that was unfairly placed on the shoulders of the people? The wording of the motion is very clear in stating:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_892">That Dáil Éireann:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_893">calls on the Government:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_894">— to immediately lobby the European Central Bank for a one-off exemption from the rules of monetary financing, to allow the Central Bank of Ireland to destroy the €25 billion in sovereign bonds issued in February of this year, in lieu of the remaining promissory notes, plus the €3.06 billion bond also being held by the Central Bank of Ireland in payment for the 2012 promissory note; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_895">— to cease any and all interest payments currently being made on those bonds.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">That is what this debate is about. It is time for the people and the Government to break free of this illegitimate debt. It is not our debt and that is the reality. In February, instead of insisting on a write-off of this illegitimate debt, the Anglo Irish Bank debt, the Government converted the Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society promissory notes into sovereign bonds with a longer repayment period but with no element of cancellation. Some €25 billion of these bonds are held by the Central Bank of Ireland and are scheduled to be traded on the markets. This deal was concluded only hours before a legal challenge to the promissory notes was due to be addressed in the Supreme Court. The Government chose to defend the promissory notes arrangement vigorously when the case was heard in the High Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_897"> It is time to stand up against the socialisation of private bank debt. These are not our debts and we refuse to pay or have our children pay. I call on the Minister of State in this debate to recognise this issue. When looking at this issue it is important to see the impact it has on our services. We have seen in recent days the crisis in our health service and the implications for the future of the country. The number of patients on surgery waiting lists has risen tenfold in recent months. There are 4,473 adults and children on public hospital waiting lists, whereas last year there were 433. That is the reality. This week there were 1,000 people on trolleys in hospitals throughout the country. How is the Government to tackle these issues if we have this debt on our shoulders? How are SMEs to make an impact?</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> I link this debate on the future of our country with the major crisis in our disability services. Services such as St. Michael's House had €12 million ripped away from it over the past three years. Some 490 families are now on priority residential waiting lists. Respite care services are being cut left, right and centre. I urge everyone in the Dáil to support the motion tabled by the Technical Group. Once again I commend the members of the Ballyhea group on their magnificent work against the odds and against the establishment in the country. The Independent Deputies are sticking with them on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_899">The deal on the promissory notes gives Ireland some restricted breathing space for economic growth. However, it still leaves the country with a mountain to climb. The reality is we will not begin to pay off the principal on the new bonds until 2038. We will continue to make the payments until 2053, thereby burdening future generations for years to come. The promissory notes payments, when taken with interest payments, will come to approximately €48 billion, which is a stupendous amount and it does not get us off the hook as we still have a colossal debt. To put it into context, our total national debt is approximately €190 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> The decision to provide a blanket guarantee was a grave error. Essentially an open cheque was given to the banks and the foreign bondholders on behalf of our citizens. If we had a rational and ethical national political system, we would have negotiated with the bondholders on the basis of our ability to pay some percentage of the value of subordinated and senior bonds. Many of the shareholders at that particular time were elderly people, pensioners by and large, who had invested small amounts to cover their expenses in their old age and have a bit of a nest egg. The value of their shares was practically wiped out overnight.</p>
          <p eId="para_901"> As a result of the guarantee, the State was shut out of the bond market, investors lost confidence in our ability to repay our debts and we were charged exorbitant interest rates. Because of the variable interest rates applied, we do not know what will happen ultimately. If the interest rates rise, we will be screwed, to put it mildly. We are well aware that there have been large periods in history when inflation was close to zero. We are very dependent, therefore, on inflation rates rising in the next 40 years to assist us in wiping out the capital sum we eventually have to pay. The theory that has been put to us is based on voodoo economics. It is a case of live horse and get grass.</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> In the current situation it is very clear that austerity budgets are here to stay for some time. In late 2012, Ms Christine Lagarde and the IMF concluded it might have got its basic economics wrong. It also conceded that not alone does austerity not work, but also that it is counterproductive. Ms Lagarde realised at the time that IMF's economic model was wrong which implies that the fiscal compact to which we had signed up at that time would eventually destroy the European economy. The European Central Bank and the EU have not acknowledged the flawed monetary and banking systems that made billions of euro available. The ECB's decision to allow the Central Bank of Ireland to print €30.6 billion to give to the zombie banks was disastrous. This continuation of printing money in a borrowed situation for billions of euro just to destroy the money again is certainly immoral, unethical and irresponsible. I support the motion that these payments should cease immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_903"> I commend members of the Ballyhea community on their perseverance and dedication both here at home and in Europe, which has achieved a colossal amount. I also commend the other groups present, including those from Killarney and Tralee - closer to home for me - on their dedication in giving up their time voluntarily to highlight this issue.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Mathews<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T20:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_904">I signed this motion, which is a simple one, and as Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said, it is civilised. I have a patience limit and it is coming near to the end. I am saddened by the absence of a senior Minister from the finance area or even the Taoiseach, because this is important for the people. There is a major disconnect between the phoniness of the words and discussions that are going on in a meaningless noise and the reality of what is happening on the ground in families and businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">There is a total disconnect.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> Yesterday on the Order of Business I asked the Taoiseach to inform himself by reading <i>The Price of Inequality </i>by Joseph E. Stiglitz and he dismissed it by saying that these economists are 100 to 1,000, that they are all the same. They are not. There are some people who are worth discovering because they have the authority of vast knowledge and study, contemporary and historical. They have something to offer and they are articulate. I bought the book for him today and by the kindness of the Government Chief Whip I hope it is now on his desk. I added an exhortation that while I know he carries heavy responsibilities I think he will find the book helpful. </p>
          <p eId="para_907"> Hedge fund managers could not believe what happened between 2008 and 2010 when we borrowed, as a nation, through the banking system to pay bond speculators. They said it was absurd. I was elected to this House after taking part in the analysis and research needed to find out what exactly the position was for the banks. There were losses of €100 billion in six Irish banks that was being denied and some people put their heads in the sand and did not want to know. For two years that cost us the ability to get a handle on the problem. Time went by, bondholders were paid and the ECB and the Central Bank of Ireland lent the money on foot of a contrived promissory note for a total of €31 billion. That is odious debt, the losses of the private banking system. We talk about money following the patient in the health service but in this instance private bank losses are made to follow the innocent citizens today and into the future. It is absurd. I am embarrassed by it. </p>
          <p eId="para_908"> I paid for myself to go as part of a parliamentary delegation to the finance committee in the Bundestag in Germany. I was embarrassed there by the deferential timidity of my colleagues here who were afraid to tell the truth. It was unbelievable. The Chairperson of the Bundestag finance committee was startled when I explained that if the German people were asked to bear the equivalent of €75 billion on the German scale, which would be €1.2 trillion, they would not believe it. The Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, asked me to tone down my comments and not to tell them because we are the good boys. It is pathetic. </p>
          <p eId="para_909"> I am not saying we should have a war. After World War Two, in 1953, Germany’s creditors said, without even being asked, that they must help these people because they are living in rubble, they are orphans and they are damaged. They helped the Germans. They do not want to see what is happening here. They do not want to see an Aviva Stadium full of elderly people with no medical cards, who cannot go to hospitals or doctors and get their medicine. One has to visualise the Aviva Stadium full of people rather than say 45,000. One has to visualise two Croke Parks full of young people who are in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and so on. It is embarrassing. I did not want to be among cowards when I joined this House. I want people to be authentic and passionate about the people of Ireland. Deputies should forget the jerseys of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or whatever, take the badges off and work for the people of Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_910">I thank the Technical Group for allowing me some of its speaking time. I also compliment Deputy Joan Collins and acknowledge her power in having the courage of her convictions and going to court in the past days and weeks. I compliment her in a special way for that and greatly appreciate and admire her for it. That should be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> I also thank the ordinariness of this Private Members’ motion because it is concerned with common sense. As I am privileged to have some speaking time tonight I want to think of the people who bought houses at the height of the boom, who borrowed hundreds of thousands of euros, on average from €280,000 to €400,000 to build their homes. They are saddled with that debt. They are trying to raise young families, send them out to school, to keep cars going, to pay their taxes, pay for the tax, insurance and petrol for the cars, their groceries and every week to keep aside this massive sum of money to pay off the mortgage on the house that is not worth a quarter of what they paid for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_912"> They are fine respectable people who have only so much time on this earth. They are being denied the smallest of luxuries, ordinary things like going away for a weekend or taking their children out for an evening or for a day away somewhere and spending a couple of euro. They do not have a couple of spare euro because they are saddled with a massive mortgage. Why for God’s sake will the banks not engage in a pro-active way? If a couple is struggling to pay €1,200 a month why will the bank not tell them €500 or €600 is a more acceptable sum of money, that they can manage to pay that amount and continue to live their life, and park the rest of the debt? I am not saying that it should be written off or forgotten about but there is debt forgiveness for everybody except the people who did not create the problem in the first place. They are the fine respectable people who are keeping this country going but their lives are being made a misery because of the banks’ total inability to deal with them humanely. That is all we are asking. </p>
          <p eId="para_913"> The Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy McGinley, is a decent, respectable man who has been in this House for a long time. I admire him, and the killing thing is that he knows that what I am saying and what Deputy Mathews and others have said is the truth. He knows we are not blackguards and neither is he but the banks are blackguarding the people. Who owns the banks? The Minister of State owns them. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle owns them. Everyone here owns them The people who work in factories, the county council worker who will go out tomorrow morning with his shovel, all own our banks but our banks are not treating the people with respect. They should and the Minister of State knows that. They are a disgrace. I compliment the people in Killarney, Tralee, Ballyhea and Charleville who, week in week out, in bad weather, came out and stood up for what they believe in. If a gambler takes a punt in a bookie’s shop and loses, he throws his slip on the ground but we are paying these unsecured bondholders, these faceless, nameless people. We are paying them back and they should be burnt before our own people are burnt.</p>

          <p eId="para_914">Ireland will exit from the troika programme without a precautionary credit line on 15 December. This Government has worked tirelessly to pave the way for a full return to funding from financial markets. Our ultimate objective is to exit the troika programme and regain our economic sovereignty. This will be achieved. Some of the debate over the course of last night and again tonight, has attempted to suggest that this Government has not made any attempt to alleviate the burden of the banking debt on the Irish taxpayer. That is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_915"> The Government has fought hard to ensure that the unfair burden of this debt, taken on by the people of Ireland, has been at the top of the agenda in our discussions with our European and international partners. It has been through this tireless pursuit that the Government has managed to achieve so many of the agreements that have delivered real savings and improvements for the taxpayer; agreements such as the promissory note arrangement, the reduction in the interest rates on our programme borrowings and the extension of maturities on our European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, and European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, EFSM, loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">Some Members have suggested that the Government did not push hard enough in the February agreement on the promissory notes but reaching such a solution was not easy. This solution took months of tough negotiations both at ministerial and official level. Every opportunity was taken by this Government to place the matter at the top of the agenda to alleviate the unfair burden imposed by the promissory notes.</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> It was clear to the Government in conducting these discussions that a write-off from our obligation to repay these debts was never a realistic possibility. The agreement reached represents the culmination of months of hard work and tough negotiations. We are certain that it represents the best deal that was achievable. This view is shared by many market commentators.</p>
          <p eId="para_918"> I would also like to address a comment made by Deputy Fleming last night. It was suggested that when the arrangements were entered into in February, this was the first time that the debt associated with the promissory notes was copper-fastened on the backs of the Irish people. This is a fantastical statement. The reality is that the commitments entered into by the Fianna Fáil-led Government through the promissory notes were immediately recorded onto the general Government debt of the State when they were issued in 2010 and became an obligation of the Irish State at that time. The burden this commitment placed on the Irish taxpayer was something that this Government had to address as soon as we took office.</p>
          <p eId="para_919"> The markets reacted positively to the restructuring and we witnessed an immediate decline in bond yields. Bonds yields are now as low as 3.5% on ten year bonds, enabling the State, banks and businesses to reduce their cost of borrowings. This has helped restore our economy and create jobs. The employment figures published yesterday showed that 58,000 new jobs were created in the State this year. Unemployment has fallen to 12.8%, the lowest figure since 2009. Our policies are beginning to show their positive effects on the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_920"> This motion would erase all the good work that has been done this year. Despite comments to the contrary, the simple fact is that a cessation of payment of interest on sovereign bonds is considered a default. It would undoubtedly bring with it substantial threats to our international reputation, a reputation which has taken an extraordinary amount of work to repair since we took office two-and-a-half years ago</p>
          <p eId="para_921"> Co-operation with our European partners has been instrumental in achieving the turnaround in the economy that we are finally seeing. Unemployment is down, consumer confidence is up and the cost of borrowing has been reduced. We have met all the targets set by the troika and successfully exited the programme. We will continue to work to get the best financing deal possible for Ireland. We believe in this approach. It has worked. It continues to work and it has put us back on the right track. Let us stay on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_923">I wish to point out something particularly significant in this motion, that is, that the entire Technical Group with its extraordinary differences of approach to the economy and to matters such as this has united behind this motion and it has attracted the support of other Independents as well. Their reasons may be very different but they believe that the taking on and the shouldering of this debt is wrong. Those on the left, I suspect, sincerely believe it is wrong for ideological reasons, that it has nothing to do with the Irish people. They rightly believe that it was incurred by a few people who had no responsibility and with whom they do not wish to associate and have never wished to associate. Those who believe in the free market - I was struck by what Deputy Peter Mathews said and he is right - also believe that it is crackers to be paying back this amount of money. As Deputy Mathews correctly said, they believe that those who live by the sword should die by the sword. I have said this before in the House. At the time that this was happening, I met a large number of fund managers, some of whom were bond holders, and they could not believe it. This was a sucker nation. They expected to be burnt. They expected us not to pay it back and they would not have given a hoot about it. They would have come back for more if they had thought it was good value several weeks later. That is the way the markets work.</p>
          <p eId="para_924"> Instead of listening to the people of Ireland and instead of adhering to what the fund managers expected, we listened to Mr. Trichet. I remember speaking, as did many others in this House, to the former Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, who made no secret of the fact that he suggested informally that we should not honour this so-called debt and he was told by Mr. Trichet to take that idea off the table or all bets would be off. That type of craven attitude, unfortunately, has left us in the situation we are in now because the bondholders would have accepted it. The capitalist markets understand that this is how things work but for some reason this and the last Government refused even to go to them and eyeball them and say they were not paying this or that they were not paying some of it. That was the wrong attitude. The markets would have understood and the bondholders would have expected to have been burnt. It was an appalling decision for several reasons. That is why left and right and centre, and market-led people, are united on that today.</p>
          <p eId="para_925"> We should ask the question that those great people from Ballyhea are asking tonight. Why is it not our debt? We accept that the Government and the last Government have some responsibility. We accept that our banks were not regulated properly. We accept that the regulator was at fault. We accept that the developers were at fault. We accept too, maybe, that the borrowers were at fault, the banks here who did it, but we do not accept that the lenders were blameless in this particular matter. The Government is negotiating or putting forward what it calls insolvency agreements on a micro scale to allow borrower and lender to come to a settlement on the basis that both parties in this particular operation have a shared responsibility for what happened. That is the same in this case because there was reckless borrowing. The activities of the banks here were unforgivable but the activities of those who lent to them were reckless too and they should pay a price. </p>
          <p eId="para_926"> As a result of this motion we should look as part of the recapitalisation and the stress test happening next year for an overall settlement. The motion does not say "default" - it calls on the Government to immediately lobby the ECB for a one-off exemption - and is careful in its wording. We should look for a final settlement when next year we will be forced to recapitalise the banks, regardless of what the Government says about legacy debt which will not happen, out of the ESM. We should go forward and say we want an overall settlement which will include those matters referred to in the motion. After the stress tests we should look for that settlement and take heed of what has been done today and we should applaud those people outside the gates this evening for the great service they have done to the Irish people and the example they have shown to us.</p>

          <p eId="para_927">This is the mildest of motions. It merely asks the Government to talk to the European Central Bank, to negate the €28 billion debt with which that bank in connivance with two treacherous governments, this and the previous one, saddled the Irish people in order to bail out bankers and bondholders from the fruit of their greed-driven speculation in Irish property. Yet even this mild motion is too much for the Fine Gael-Labour coalition which places itself in perpetual prostration at the altar of the financial markets of European capitalism, the Government which allows the sharks who infest those financial markets to dictate how a country and a continent should be run, an economic dictatorship dictating to the supposedly democratically elected governments of this country and of Europe. Last February, the Government in rushing through legislation standing down the former Anglo Irish Bank did nothing more than saddle generations yet to be born with the private debts of the speculators in the financial markets. The fruits of bailing out these speculators are bitter without exception.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">Bitter is the austerity agenda. Austerity is the weapon of choice to secure the transfusion of the lifeblood of our people, of the Greek, Spanish and Portuguese people, and of other peoples to the private hedge funds and international financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_929"> The Government should listen to the voice of that most sober and conservative institution, the International Committee of the Red Cross. In a recent report, it outlined a damning indictment of this Government and all the governments of the EU establishment:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_930">Five years ago it would have been unimaginable; so many millions of Europeans lining up for food in soup kitchens, receiving food parcels at home or being referred to social groceries (shops where they can buy food at highly reduced prices after being referred by social authorities). Former middle class citizens living in trailers, tents, railway stations or in shelters for the homeless, hesitating to go to the Red Cross Red Crescent and other organizations to ask for help.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">The report says, "there are now more than 18 million people receiving EU-funded food aid, 43 million who do not get enough to eat each day and 120 million at risk of poverty in the countries covered by Eurostat". That shameful situation is a result of austerity and undertaking debts that are not of the people. Austerity is not a necessity. It is a policy choice to save European capitalism and its financial speculators from the chaos of their profit-driven, greed-driven system. Labour and Fine Gael stand with the speculators of that system and against the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_932"> I note the perseverance of the people of Ballyhea and the anger at the unjust burdens foisted on our people. A government of and for working class people in this country might ask the ECB to stand down the Anglo Irish Bank debts, but on inevitable refusal, it would simply tear up the unjust covenants and agreements that foisted that debt on our people and the incredible €8 billion to €9 billion per year in interest alone on that and the other debts that have been put on top of our people. Such a Government of working people would launch a European movement standing with the working class of Greece, Spain, Portugal and other countries to take the financial markets, hedge funds and financial institutions into democratic public control and channel those funds for investment for our people for the creation of millions of jobs and, on that basis, begin to rebuild a society not on the basis of this failed, diseased system of European capitalism but on the basis of solidarity between peoples, genuine real democracy and socialism.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LukeMingFlanagan" eId="spk_390">
          <from>Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan<recordedTime time="2013-11-27T21:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_933">As Diarmuid O'Flynn, a hero and human being - it is good to see there are a few left - noted, for 143 weeks, Ballyhea Says No has been marching in protest against the imposition of the bank debt burden on the Irish people. The most odious element of that debt is the promissory note of €31 billion. In our dealings with the various layers of the EU, the European Council, the European Commission, the ECB and the EU itself, we have met initial strong resistance to offering Ireland a break on this bank debt. We have been told repeatedly that these were our banks, this was our regulator, these were our politicians and developers and this is our problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_934"> The one area where they cannot make any of those claims is the promissory notes. By 2010, the true picture of the catastrophic nature of what was happening across Europe had emerged and the EU and the ECB had become centrally involved. The ECB could have refused to allow the Central Bank to print that €31 billion to bail out the two zombie banks. Due to its fear of contagion, it did not do this. It made the final decision to allow that promissory note of €31 billion to be printed and the ultimate responsibility lies with it. Forget for a moment the legal question of emergency liquidity assistance to fund the issue of the €31 billion. The bigger issue is why the Irish people should be held accountable for all of that €31 billion plus interest. Why are future generations of Irish people being forced into at least 40 years of debt slavery to pay the principal and interest on this €31 billion when not one cent of it was used for the benefit of the Irish people - not a single hospital bed or classroom or metre of badly needed motorway, nothing. Quite simply, this is not our debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_935"> We could have been and are entitled to be far more demanding with this motion but we have not been. I will make a few pertinent points. The motion is not seeking unilateral default. It is merely asking the Government at least to ask the ECB to allow the Central Bank to destroy those promissory note bonds. This was not money borrowed to close our budget deficit. It was money printed to bail out banks, bankers, bondholders, international institutional investors, the eurozone and the euro. Burning those bonds would only have a positive impact on the markets and reduce our national debt. The ECB is hiding behind its own rules. These are the same rules it bent and twisted to allow the €31 billion to be printed in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_936"> This Government is long on talk of restoring Ireland's reputation in Europe. We would also like to see that, not the fawning lap dog reputation we have developed lately but the Irish reputation of the Wild Geese - Irish brigades renowned for their courage and fighting spirit in the armies of France and Spain and even further afield in the US and Mexico. In real life, Diarmuid O'Flynn is a sports journalist. He spoke of how, like most other Irish people, he had mixed emotions as he watched the Irish rugby team lose at the death to the all-conquering All Blacks last Sunday. He spoke of how he felt bitter disappointment but also massive pride at how the Irish players had fronted up in a game which people spoke about as an annihilation. Afterwards, the New Zealand coach, Steve Hansen, said, "we expected them to be tough. Every time we play them, they're tough but sometimes I don't know if they believe that they're as tough as they are". This is the only Ireland we know - the Ireland of hard battles on the GAA and soccer fields and in international arenas with our boxers or rugby players, our women and our men.</p>
          <p eId="para_937"> Ireland never played tough in dealing with the EU and the ECB in respect of the promissory note and never fronted up. A walkover was conceded. Now we are in the ironic position where the very people bailed out by the original €31 billion promissory note will be bidding for these new promissory note bonds. This Government is itself governed by fear. It speaks of making tough decisions. There was nothing tough about taking on the sick, the infirm, the elderly and the disabled and about cutting health, education, the Garda, etc. Taking on the multinationals by introducing a minimal level of corporation tax, taking on the IFSC by adopting the financial transactions tax, taking on its own exorbitant salaries and expenses and thus setting an example and taking on the ECB itself were the tough decisions but the Government has baulked at them all, more concerned about its new friends in the markets and its new partners in Europe than it is about its own people. They might be the Government's partners. In fact, they are its partners as it imposes their demands on the Irish people. We see them as people who, if they had their way, would be our masters. They will not be. We now know why the Government will not even ask that these promissory note bonds be destroyed and, yes, it is because of fear - not the fear of being told "No" but the fear of being told "Yes" and being exposed for its incompetence and cowardice. I commend the motion to the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_1411">In accordance with the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), Local Property Tax (LPT) for is payable on or before 1 January of that year. For the year 2015, the tax will be payable on or before 1 January 2015. The range of payment options provided by the Revenue Commissioners ensures that nobody is forced to pay LPT before that date. The Revenue Commissioners are facilitating those who wish to exercise a personal choice to pay by debit card. However the consequences are clearly spelled out and there are other easier and arguably more advantageous options to pay the LPT.</p>
            <p eId="para_1412"> The administration of the LPT, including payment of LPT for 2015 by debit card, is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. I understand that the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners dealt with this issue comprehensively when she attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 7 November 2013. The Chairman informed the Committee that in order to provide for a delayed payment of LPT by way of credit/debit card, Revenue would be required to retain taxpayer’s credit/debit card data. The Commissioners are concerned about retaining such data from a data protection perspective and other issues, including costs, also arise. Recent well publicised data breaches arising from the retention of such data underline those concerns. The Chairman agreed that the Commissioners would review the payment patterns for 2014 to establish the proportion of owners who choose to pay the tax by credit/debit card and they would also carefully review the issue of retaining debit/credit card data and its potential impact on systems, costs, security and data protection.</p>

            <p eId="para_1417"> Article 13(6), is the relevant governing article in the 2013 student grant scheme in relation to second chance students. The intention of this article is to focus resources on second chance and mature students. The five years' break in studies will ensure that the emphasis is, as intended, on facilitating these students to return to education. Article 15(8) of the Student Grant Scheme 2013 provides awarding authorities with discretion to waive the provisions of Article 15(7)(b)(ii) in exceptional circumstances and consider funding for a repeat period of study, in line with guidelines drawn up by the Minister. The guidelines include the nature of the exceptional circumstances as documented by the applicant, when they occurred and the period of time over which they continued, how the circumstances impacted on the applicant's ability to participate in their course of study, take exams or submit projects on time and whether the circumstances happened to the applicant or a third party.</p>

          <question by="#JohnOMahony" to="#Education" eId="pq_61">
            <p eId="para_1421">61. <b>Deputy John O'Mahony</b> asked the <b>Minister for Education and Skills</b> if the EU Commission made a mistake when it wrote on OJEU on 15.9.2007 as part of State Aid Ireland Investigation 31/07 that Bus Éireann operated the school transport services on a cost recovery basis when the value for money review March 2011 did not say that it was on a cost recovery basis and this expression has been removed from the annual report of Bus Éireann and in view of the fact that the Irish authorities have no independent impartial monitoring of actual costs incurred by Bus Éireann or its profits, if any, relating to the school transport scheme since 1975; if he will make a material statement on the implications for his Department and separately for Bus Éireann if it made a profit since 1975; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1422">I would like to preface this reply by noting that it is not for the Minister for Education and Skills to speak on behalf of the EU Commission. That said, the agreed document of 1975 provides the basis for payment to Bus Éireann in respect of the arrangements between my Department and Bus Éireann under which the school transport scheme operates. To describe the details contained in this document as providing for payment on a cost recovery basis is a fair and reasonable depiction of the position.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423"> The arrangements between my Department and Bus Éireann as they relate to school transport were the subject of extensive consideration by the High Court in the context of the recent proceedings. The outcome of these proceedings, which found decisively in favour of the Department's position, is available on the Courts Service Website. These proceedings provided full opportunity for all parties to advance the arguments and counter arguments in relation to all aspects of these arrangements including matters such as "cost recovery" and "profit". Any issues or implications in relation to these matters will be fully dealt with by the Department in the context of the Supreme Court Appeal. I refer the Deputy to my earlier reply of 6th November, in which I set out the wider context to the conduct of this case.</p>
