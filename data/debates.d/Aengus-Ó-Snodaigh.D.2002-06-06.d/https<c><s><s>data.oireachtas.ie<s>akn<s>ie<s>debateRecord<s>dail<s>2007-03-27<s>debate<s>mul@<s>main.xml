            <p eId="para_12">My sole responsibility as regards the Tribunal of Inquiry into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters is in the facilitation of its budget from my Vote.  The first report of the Moriarty tribunal was made to Dáil Éireann in accordance with the terms of reference under which it was established by the House.  I have no responsibility for and am not in a position to answer to the House on the content of the report.  In so far as the findings in the report may require action, such as improving oversight mechanisms, I refer to my statement to the House on 14 February 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_13">The total cost incurred by my Department in respect of the Moriarty tribunal from 1997 to 28 February 2007 was €27,071,138.  This includes fees paid to counsel for the tribunal and administration costs incurred since its establishment.  The total payment made to the legal team was €20,882,453 to 28 February 2007.  The total cost in respect of the Moriarty tribunal for 2006 was €3,897,559.</p>
            <p eId="para_14">The administration costs for the Moriarty tribunal, including counsel fees, are met from my Department's Vote.  Issues in this regard which may be raised from time to time by officers of the tribunal are dealt with in the normal course of business by my Department.  From time to time, there have been requests by the tribunal for records and files and my Department has submitted these.  It will continue to co-operate with the tribunal in making available any records sought.  Normally, these requests are received by the Secretary General and assigned to the appropriate departmental official by him.  All are dealt with on a highly confidential basis as required by the tribunal.</p>

            <p eId="para_32">At the time, a national newspaper stated the number of persons receiving an allocation of €2,500 a day should be strictly limited.  The Taoiseach and the Government requested a reduction in the fees payable to lawyers dealing with the tribunals.  What is the current status of the request?  Will it be implemented?</p>
            <p eId="para_33">It has been reported that the second report of the Moriarty tribunal will be available by the end of the year.  Does the Taoiseach agree that such a timescale can be met?</p>
            <p eId="para_34">What is the position on the allocation of costs for persons who have had their costs deferred?  A small number is involved.  What is the Taoiseach's position on the view that this was a fraction of those who deserved to have their costs withheld?</p>
            <p eId="para_35">In respect of persons who deliberately delayed the workings of the tribunal, what action, if any, is to be taken on that, or is that an area on which the Taoiseach has a view?</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_19">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_36">Regarding the completion of the work, I understand the entire work of the Moriarty tribunal, including the report, will be completed in the calendar year of 2007.  As we have done in some of the other tribunals, on that basis it will be allowed to complete its work under the existing arrangements.  I understand the public hearings are finished.  I have been told by my officials it is possible there could be a limited number of days of public session hearings but that is a call for the tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_37">The work on completion of the report has started or is about to start.  The tribunal should be able to commence preparation of its report in a matter of weeks from now.  It is not possible to indicate when the second part of this report will be finalised but it should completed in a matter of months.  The entire tribunal work will be finished during the course of 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_38">We must respect the right of each sole member to exercise his discretion on what can be appropriately included by a tribunal in regard to a matter in advance of the determination of costs for third parties.  Having regard to his anticipation of issues, he will have to adjudicate on them.  I understand that at the end of the report the sole member will have to adjudicate on the costs and decide whether people co-operated.  He will then make a decision on those costs and probably take submissions on the fees.  I understand this will be certainly an issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_39">Regarding the cost of the tribunal, I provided €10 million in this year's Estimates to cover the cost of the report, publication of it and some element of the award of legal costs as well as administrative costs and legal fees.  However, it is inevitable that the settling of the claims for costs that will be awarded will almost certainly continue into 2008.  I expect to have more specific insight into liability for the third party costs but it is unlikely I will have that information until the Estimates for 2008 are formulated.</p>
            <p eId="para_40">The work will certainly be finished this year as well as probably some aspect of dealing with the third party costs but it is likely, according to the view of my accounting officers, that the decision to pay the full costs or to decide on it based on the disputes, arguments and submissions that may be made around those costs will go into next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">Does the Taoiseach have any information or view on the tribunal imposing costs on persons who deliberately or dishonestly held up the working of the tribunal?  What will happen in such a case, of which, clearly, there are a number?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_42">According to the rules covering the tribunals, we have seen already that in some cases costs have been issued by some of the other tribunals.  If a tribunal is of the view that somebody has not co-operated — I think that is the word they use because people are legally entitled to challenge it, therefore such a challenge would not be considered a delay in terms of not co-operating because people are entitled to do that — it can refuse costs.  A few of the tribunals have done that in regard to other costs.  I am not sure if this arises in the case of the Moriarty tribunal; I am not aware that it does.</p>

I have dealt with the matters in the report which relate to me in answers to questions from the tribunal and that is the appropriate manner.  I am happy the tribunal accepted my evidence and was satisfied that I had no reason to believe the leader's account was operated otherwise than in an orthodox fashion.  I am also pleased the tribunal stated in a report that it is noteworthy that at my insistence, amendments have since been made in the governing of the leader's allowance accounts.  I have already dealt with the matters relating to the conduct of Mr. Haughey.</p>
            <p eId="para_72">With regard to the costs of the tribunal, I have already congratulated Mr. Justice Moriarty and his staff on bringing the long work to a successful conclusion.

            <p eId="para_78">In his response to the questions the Taoiseach has indicated a certain level of fee payment.  Does this suggest to him that anything at all like the order of overall fee expenditure in the Mahon case will be reached, as speculated by the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell?  The figures cited suggest a figure much lower but this is not to suggest it is any more acceptable.  What is the Taoiseach's position on the decision to introduce the lower fees as of 31 March 2007, which is later this week?  Will that position be honoured?  How many times now has a decision been taken to allow for the higher fees to continue?  If I recall correctly, there was at least one deferral in the course of 2006.  Are we now to face yet another deferral of the reduced level of fee payment?</p>
            <p eId="para_79">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is party to the establishment of the core team.  However, the Department of the Taoiseach is not represented on that team.  I understand that officials from the Departments of Finance and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are participating.  Why is the Department of the Taoiseach not represented?  When is it expected the core team will substantively report on its review of the fees that apply in the case of the Mahon tribunal?  Is it addressing fees in general that apply to other tribunals, particularly those that are currently sitting, not just those that may be established in the future?</p>

Is the Taoiseach aware of the nature of such actions being requested by the Irish branch of Transparency International as a result of the publication of the Moriarty tribunal's report?  It called for additional powers for the Standards in Public Office Commission and for full disclosure of financial accounts by political parties, not just for the three weeks leading up to an election but for the period between one election day and the next.  If we are to obtain value for money, does the Taoiseach acknowledge that the actions which arise on foot of the report must be taken?  Will he indicate the stage the Government has reached in the implementation of such actions?</p>
            <p eId="para_93">Is it possible for the Taoiseach to indicate — this would also impact on the actions to which I refer and it may have allowed us to avoid spending over €27 million on the report in the first instance — what would have been the position if he had refused to sign blank cheques?</p>

It is probably true to say that a lot directly related to its work.  I am not aware of any further legislative issue but changes were made over the years to Finance Bills, the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 was enacted and amendments were made to the Electoral Acts and the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 during the course of the tribunal's work.  If there is any other one on which action was not taken, I am sure it will be addressed by various Ministers when they and their officials examine the full report.</p>

Does he not agree it is the height of humbug that he and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are cooking up a storm and a controversy about the fees associated with these tribunals when he as Taoiseach approved them and the Minister, Deputy McDowell, who is leading the storm, facilitated some of the increases while he was Attorney General?</p>

            <p eId="para_157">At the outset of the tribunals, certain costs were set.  I think they were changed a few times during the course of the work of the tribunals.  They were set on the basis the tribunals would be finished within certain timeframes but for one reason or another a number of tribunals made submissions regarding extensions of time.  When the tribunals were set up in 1997, it was considered they would take two years to complete.  It is clear from the record that this was the view of everybody on this side of the House.  The legislation was amended on the basis we would know when the final modules would be finished and by what date.  The Moriarty tribunal was expected to end in 2002.  Increases were given.  In 2004 the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, and the Attorney General agreed the timescale within which the tribunal would be completed.  However, a number of the tribunals, including the Moriarty tribunal, made submissions that some delays were beyond their control and that they needed further time.  The Moriarty tribunal has completed its first report and stated a small number of hearings may be held on its second report.  It expects to start work on the second report within a few weeks and wrap up all matters relating to the tribunal, except that of third party costs, which will be a matter for the sole member.  The tribunal as we know it should wrap up during 2007.</p>

They are, in turn, forwarded to the finance unit of my Department for payment.  Office expenses and supplies are invoiced directly to the tribunal.  The tribunal registrar certifies the invoices and passes them to the finance unit of the Department of Finance for payment.

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_166">I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 to 14, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_167">I am aware that a commemorative event in respect of the Great Famine is being prepared for 27 May.  While this is not an official initiative, it is associated with the proposal under consideration between Departments to establish a memorial day.  I understand it is the intention of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to host a reception on the occasion of the Famine commemorative event.  This is intended to reflect the ongoing role of Irish Aid in responding to global issues of hunger and food security.</p>
            <p eId="para_168">The Great Famine had a most telling impact on Ireland both in the direct loss of so many lives and through the displacement of people and establishment of a pattern of emigration that continued for more than a century.  I recall the official commemorative programme for the 150th anniversary of the Great Famine which took place across several years under the auspices of my Department.  This intensive programme engaged a wide audience in Ireland and among the Irish diaspora.</p>
            <p eId="para_169">There has been a sustained pattern of commemoration of the Famine for many years.  The Famine Museum at Strokestown Park, County Roscommon, was opened in 1994.  The national Famine monument was unveiled at Murrisk, County Mayo, in 1997 and replicated on the UN Plaza at New York in 2000.  The Famine figures at Custom House Quay, Dublin were installed in 1997 and will be complemented this summer by a similar installation at the Irish Park in Toronto to be unveiled by the President.  The many official and private initiatives regarding monuments and commemorations reflect the enduring significance of this tragedy for the Irish people at home and abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_170">I am positively disposed towards the establishment of a memorial day and have asked that the matter be considered at official level, having regard to the appropriate timing and location of a commemorative event; the possible nature of the commemoration, reflecting the terrible loss of life; the links to the diaspora and the continuing issues of hunger and food security.  While I do not anticipate that an official annual event will be inaugurated this year, I am satisfied for the Government, through the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to be associated with the Famine commemoration being arranged for 27 May.  The question of financial support for this event has not arisen.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_136">
            <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
            <p eId="para_171">I am surprised to hear the Taoiseach state the commemoration will not have official status, given the presence and involvement of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan.  I ask him to take into account the fact that the Opposition parties, various Independents, the Tánaiste and 30 Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators all support the commemoration and hope it will have official status.  Does he still consider, as he stated in the House on 4 May 2005, that he has no great feelings one way or another on the issue or has he had time to reflect on the matter?  Does he consider that the commemoration should have official status, given that famine is still an issue of world significance and that the Irish Famine resonates with many around the world, particularly those of Irish extraction?  Will he make a statement on this matter in order that there will be at least an expectation of official status for this year's event?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_137">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_172">As the Deputy noted, there have been many representations on this issue.  As I stated in 2005 and many times since, it has been the practice that the principal events in our national history are marked by official commemorations on their significant anniversaries.  However, because of our long history, it has not been the practice to organise official commemorations annually of the many people and events worthy of such commemoration.  When the issue of a national day of commemoration was discussed at great length 20 years ago, the July date was used to bring them together.  There has been much debate in this regard and the committee which has been working on this memorial has cited the example of Holocaust day among others.  However, they are not official events.  While the Taoiseach, Ministers and senior politicians might attend and participate, they are organised by representative committees which reflect the communities which suffered during such terrible events and there are many such days.  I note that in the correspondence forwarded to me by Members they are being classified by the organising committee as being national or official days.  However, they have nothing to do with the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_173">As for the Famine event, many thought it should be examined.  We held events to commemorate the 150th anniversary which were significant and a lot of effort was put into them.  Through the Office of Public Works the State was involved in the commemoration in New York and the State provided €500,000 to this year's commemoration in Toronto.  We will also link in to the day of commemoration by having a reception.</p>
            <p eId="para_174">As Deputy Sargent stated, there is a great deal of support for a commemoration.  I asked officials to see how we could commemorate it through a national day, based on the three points I made, how we would best do so and in what circumstances we could do so.  I am happy we should do it for reasons of links with the diaspora and continuing issues of hunger and food security in the world.  We will consider how to best do it and on what date — it seems 27 May would be the annual date.</p>
            <p eId="para_175">I repeat what I stated before — it is never a popular thing to say — every year, the number of anniversaries, commemorations and groups throughout the country which would like the State to be affiliated with has no end.  Letters in my name go out every year stating we cannot do something and that raises a head of steam.</p>
            <p eId="para_176">This year, the official commemoration programme is looking at the 400th anniversary of the flight of the earls, their story in Ireland at a time of change and their progress in Europe.  We will commemorate the 400th anniversary of the Irish college in Louvain where the earls found their initial refuge and the 350th anniversary of the death of Luke Wadding, the Franciscan scholar.  This year will also mark two issues related to Daniel O'Connell.  It is the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade with which he was closely associated and on which he made his name internationally.  It is also the 160th anniversary of his death.</p>
            <p eId="para_177">We were able to put resources into the first two matters.  If we were to commemorate everything every year what we would do for each would become meaningless so I attempted to hold the line.  We have a great history, but the number of groups and committees would be endless if the State linked itself to all of them.  It is not a popular line to take because one gets into the thick of all of them.  If we went with everything we would have 20 or 30 commemorations every year with very limited resources.  I allowed the committee to pick what it believed were the most significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_178">We will consider a national day of commemoration for the Famine, which seems to be linked to 27 May.  I asked the committee dealing with commemorations to see how we could do that in a meaningful way.  Only a very small amount of money, amounting to a few hundred thousand euro, is provided every year to do something like what we did at the UN, and it is fitting for the country to have such a prime site for the Famine commemoration as the grounds of the UN building.  The Toronto commemoration will also be on a prominent site.</p>
            <p eId="para_179">We will try to work out a way to do this.  I want to do so on the basis that we should continue to resist the endless commemorations people want on an annual basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_215">The commemoration this year is being arranged for 27 May.  The State is not officially associated with it as an official annual event, as is being requested.  We are assisting by having an official reception around the commemoration event.  I have asked the committee of people involved in the commemoration to consider whether we should have a national day under three criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_216">First, we should have an appropriate time and location for a commemorative event and 27 May has been designated by the people involved.  Second, we should look at the nature of the commemoration, which should reflect the terrible loss of life.  Third, we should consider the links to the diaspora and the continuing issues of hunger and food security.  If we can put together a commemorative day that would embrace all the issues, which we have been asked to do, we could have a national day and I would support it.</p>
            <p eId="para_217">I made a point about other commemoration days.  The letters I have been receiving from Deputies have been indicating that the Holocaust memorial days, among others, were national days.  My point was that none of these days, organised by large national committees, county associations or other powerful committees with many people on them, is a national day.  There are committees far greater than the group behind the Famine day.  It is a good idea but others represent thousands of people who would like commemoration days, and we cannot accommodate them all.</p>
            <p eId="para_218">The Great Famine is of course an enormous issue but it does not take away from the many others.  I checked this and approximately 39 different groups have a significant belief they should have a national day.  We cannot have that range of days.  I will support the Great Famine commemoration day and I have asked officials to draw up the outline of a commemoration.  To show our support this year we will provide a reception around the event, which I know is considered helpful to the organisers.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_171">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_222">I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 to 77, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_223">The White Paper on energy policy explicitly confirms the Government's position that the electricity and gas networks, as strategic national assets, will remain in State ownership and will never be privatised.  As the networks are strategic national assets and will never be privatised, the Government has decided to transfer ownership of the transmission assets from ESB to EirGrid by the end of 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_224">High oil and gas prices worldwide are a reality with which Ireland, as price taker, has to contend.  Approximately 70% of the costs of generating electricity here are driven by international trends, our location and transportation costs.  However, the remaining 30% of costs are a result of domestically controllable factors and are high by international standards.  The transfer of the transmission grid ownership from the ESB group to EirGrid is a key component of the Government's objective policy to deliver healthy competition and consumer choice in the electricity market.  More competition in power generation and supply is needed in the interests of business and the consumer.</p>
            <p eId="para_225">Quantification of the benefits of the Government's policy actions in terms of electricity prices for consumers will be a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, in its annual price review but it is quite clear that transparency regarding access to the grid and transmission assets will attract more players into the market and help stimulate competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_226">The existing structure splits transmission operation and ownership between ESB and EirGrid.  This is complex and cumbersome and adds to costs.  Furthermore, the ownership of the transmission grid by ESB, as the large incumbent power company, competing with Viridian, Airtricity and others, is a deterrent to existing and new private sector players.</p>
            <p eId="para_227">The current arrangement also creates additional overheads and transaction costs; duplication of activities, skills and resources; the risk of blurred accountability; and more complex regulation than would otherwise be needed.  The combining of ownership and control and operation of the transmission system in EirGrid is logical.  Experience across Europe shows that where there is ownership and control over the assets, the system can be operated transparently and effectively, instilling full confidence in market players.</p>
            <p eId="para_228">The proposal to transfer ownership of the transmission network to EirGrid will bring Ireland into line with other EU member states.  It is proportionate and in line with views expressed by many in recent years, most recently in the consultation on the Green Paper on energy.  The Competition Authority, the CER, the National Competitiveness Council, Forfás, IDA and others have called for it and it is also consistent with the analysis in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report.  The proposal is in keeping with the European Commission's recent Communication, An Energy Policy for Europe, which cites effective unbundling as crucial for greater competition and security of supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_229">A strong and independent EirGrid will play a critical role in facilitating market liberalisation, supporting the development of effective competition in the electricity market, reducing energy costs and optimising investment.  The ESB group in its new form will remain a strong, commercially viable and fully integrated entity after the transmission asset ownership moves to EirGrid.  The ESB will be even better positioned to deliver on its mandate for the distribution network and to take on new competitors in power generation and supply on a level playing field.</p>
            <p eId="para_230">ESB International will be strongly growing its UK, European and international business and the ESB group will continue to compete successfully with Viridian, Airtricity and other independent operators in power generation and electricity supply in the all-island electricity market.</p>
            <p eId="para_231">It is my view that amendments to existing legislation will be required to provide for, <i>inter alia</i>, EirGrid’s ownership of the transmission infrastructure, increasing its borrowing limit and other consequential amendments.  The advice of the Attorney General on the precise parameters of the legislation required will determine its scope.  Any transactional cost inherent in the transfer process will not result in greater costs to the consumer.  The Deloitte &amp; Touche analysis considered that the transfer of the transmission asset ownership function should not have a material cost attached.</p>
            <p eId="para_232">I have had initial discussions with the chief executive of the ESB and the chairperson and chief executive of EirGrid on taking the implementation process forward.  I have also had initial discussions with the ESB group of unions.  The representatives expressed their serious concerns on behalf of their members about the decision and other aspects of the White Paper.  I listened to their concerns and confirmed my commitment to continuing the process of full engagement with the group on all of the issues inherent in the implementation of Government policy on the electricity sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_233">In the context of the fledgling competitive market at the time, the tripartite agreement of February 2000 between the then Minister and the ESB's management and unions laid the grounds for the establishment of EirGrid as an independent transmission system operator, sought to address the ESB's dominance and paved the way for liberalisation of the market and the development of competition.  Seven years on, a great deal has been achieved, but more remains to be done.  The Government intends to build on this process with a view to completing delivery of a fully competitive electricity market.</p>
            <p eId="para_234">The Government will work with ESB and EirGrid management and unions, as well as the ESB ESOT as a minority shareholder in the ESB group, to ensure satisfactory outcomes that address legitimate concerns in the process of achieving the transfer of transmission asset ownership to EirGrid by the end of 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_235">Regarding Deputy Broughan's question, the White Paper contains a number of proposals to ensure the long-term security of supply, including delivery of the North-South and east-west interconnectors, the establishment of the single electricity market, ongoing major capital investment in the transmission and distribution networks, a grid development strategy for 2025, priority to ensuring improvements in plant generation adequacy and realising the potential for distributed electricity generation.</p>

            <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_236">In the Minister's reply, he did not refer specifically to whether he, his Department or the Government intend to privatise the generating capacity of the ESB.  Has he discussed that matter with the ESB and its group of unions?  In his discussions with them, to what extent has he discussed the grid's stability in the context of the separation announced in the White Paper, given that the ESB will be solely concerned with generation and EirGrid with transmission?  Has he investigated the degree to which EirGrid's transmission capacity must be enhanced, does that enhancement entail interconnectors and what agreement has been reached regarding the interconnectors?</p>
            <p eId="para_237">In the context of the discussions, has the Minister examined the potential electricity generating strength of the various contributors to EirGrid?  Has he and his Department measured their strength to ensure the guaranteed security and stability of the grid?  Has he or his Department identified the full extent of the consumer benefit likely to flow?  Regarding the transfer of assets to EirGrid, has full and final agreement been reached with the ESB in respect of any transfer of money that might be deemed to be required or is it a paper transfer?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_173" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_238">There is no question of privatisation of the ESB's assets, as is made clear in two, if not three, different places in the White Paper.  As far as we are concerned, it is not an issue.  It is explicitly stated that privatisation of the ESB or its assets is not on the Government's agenda.  We are discussing a transfer of assets from a State company to a semi-State company.  EirGrid is the transmission operator, but it will also become the transmission owner.  The ESB will remain in the generation and distribution business, namely, it will distribute electricity to domestic and industrial premises.  There is no proposed change in that respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_239">Some months ago, the Government agreed that the east-west interconnector will be owned by EirGrid, which will be the first piece of hardware in the electricity market not owned by the ESB.  With the exception of transmission lines, the North-South interconnector will be owned by the ESB because it connects to the grid internally across the Border.</p>
            <p eId="para_240">Regarding the agreements reached, the White Paper was published two weeks ago and, for a variety of reasons, the meetings in question only took place yesterday.  As such, we are at the preliminary stages of discussions with the ESB.  We met the ESB, its group of unions and EirGrid yesterday and discussed the implementation of the decisions in the White Paper.  The timescale goes to the end of 2008 to enable us to work out the various details of the transfer of assets and how it will operate.  Legislation will also be necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_241">On the broader question of why we are doing this, the thrust of numerous aspects of the White Paper is to introduce healthy and new competition to the market, which will have an effect on prices and will directly benefit the consumer, whether domestic or industrial.  This matter relates to providing healthy competition in the market, making the economy more competitive and addressing concerns, not least of which are those of the unions.  Last week or the previous week, a union issued a publication on what it perceived to be a lack of competition in the market.  ICTU had a major concern in this regard and had the matter included in the Towards 2016 document.</p>
            <p eId="para_242">We are addressing the need to make the economy more competitive to ensure we do not lose jobs as a result of high energy prices.  The overall package in the White Paper, not just the transfer of transmission assets, is designed to make the economy more competitive and to benefit the consumer.</p>

            <p eId="para_243">The ESB debt is approximately €2 billion.  I remember when the Minister's predecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, told the House excitedly of the ESB's negotiation of favourable loan terms in New York to address a large tranche of the debt.  What will happen to the debt and the ESB's financial controls if the Minister proceeds with his policy of removing an asset worth at least €1 billion?  Must there be a major renegotiation of the debt and will the ESB's credit standing be damaged?</p>
            <p eId="para_244">The Minister said he met representatives of the ATGWU, SIPTU, UCATT and Amicus this morning to start discussing this policy with them.  What will happen to the workforce?  How many workers are involved?  I understand that approximately 700 workers are directly involved in the transmission sector but the Minister has contradicted that number which was given to me by senior ESB management on the day on which he presented the White Paper to them in the Royal Irish Academy.  What will be the fate of those workers in relation to the employee share ownership trust?</p>
            <p eId="para_245">I was present in the Department of the Taoiseach last October when the Minister published the Green Paper on Energy Policy.  On that occasion he said quite categorically that any break-up of the ESB would lead to higher prices and could cause long-term damage to the security of Irish energy supplies.  What has changed in the last four or five months to cause him to change his mind?</p>
            <p eId="para_246">Energy prices have skyrocketed since 2000, during the term of office of this Administration.</p>

            <p eId="para_248">The price of electricity has increased by well over 60%.  What benefits have accrued to the people to date as a result of the Minister's handling of deregulation?  Why should we be happy with the prospect of breaking up the ESB company, or atomising it, as the Minister said?</p>
            <p eId="para_249">Why has the Minister produced a policy on the transmission network, rather than the distribution network?  What will happen to the distribution network?  The Minister's White Paper states it will have to be priced in a cost-neutral way that will have a major impact on the finances of the ESB.  This sector can be compared to the communications sector — the transmission network is like the backhaul and the distribution network the local loop.  Does the Minister accept that if he proceeds with this policy, it will be completely crazy from every point of view?</p>
            <p eId="para_250">The Minister referred to the report produced by the ATGWU and Mr. Brendan Ogle which states clearly that the ESB's labour costs have decreased over the last five years from 22% to less than 16%.  The report points out that these costs are in the middle rank of such costs in the 15 pre-2004 EU member states.  Labour costs are higher in Belgium, Austria, Luxembourg, Germany and the United Kingdom.  Given that the United Kingdom — the only country said to have a fully liberalised market — has higher labour costs than Ireland, what is the point of all of this?</p>
            <p eId="para_251">The Labour Party is bitterly opposed to this proposal which will lead to the privatisation of the ESB which the Minister is utterly determined to facilitate.  This measure is the Trojan horse that will allow the ESB to be smashed up.  We will no longer have energy security as a result of the break-up.  Ireland will be deemed to comprise the north-west electricity market.  The native company will have approximately 7% of market share.  For that reason the Minister should not have proceeded with this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_252">I will conclude by reminding the Minister of the dangerous situation that recently developed in Germany and Italy.  The actions of a person working on a pylon in Germany caused a black-out in northern Italy for between 24 and 36 hours.  If the Minister proceeds in this manner, he will leave us in a similar position.  It will be another one of his very bad legacies.  We will continue to oppose this proposal vigorously.</p>

I do not accept the figure of between 700 and 800 workers cited in some quarters.  It is certainly not the figure from which the Commission for Energy Regulation operates when working out the costings for price increases in the electricity market.  I do not accept that there are 700——</p>

            <p eId="para_267">Some 3,500 people are working on the transmission and distribution systems in the ESB.  There are 6,500 km of transmission lines, the big lines supported by pylons.  They do not break down as often as the 156,000 km of distribution lines.  The Deputy can do his own mathematics.  If 700 or 800 people were working solely on the transmission lines, ten or 15 times more workers would be required to look after the distribution lines.  That estimate is based on a comparison of the number of kilometres of lines in each case.</p>

The question I was asked related to the proposal in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report to transfer the transmission and distribution assets and to divide the supply network into three separate units.</p>

            <p eId="para_274">The Deputy also asked about the reduced rate of return in respect of the distribution lines, or the lines which extend into our houses and businesses, etc.  The Government has taken the view that this sector is a natural monopoly — there is no competition in this area — therefore, there is no need to treat it in the normal commercial way.  We have decided that the charges we impose on the distribution lines should be risk-related.  Enough income should accrue from the distribution lines to meet capital costs, pay for maintenance and fund future investment, with a slight margin.  When the risk-related rate of return is applied, it will have a direct effect on the cost of electricity to consumers.  That is why the policy is being pursued.  We might have taken another view of the matter if there was competition in the distribution lines.  The Deputy also asked about privatisation and whether there was a plan for this.  There is no plan for privatisation.</p>

            <p eId="para_278">Given that we all agree Eirgrid should be independent, ownership of the assets should lie with an independent Eirgrid company.  This will be a job for the next Government to implement because I cannot imagine the legislation will be passed before the election.  Does the Minister's Department have a timetable in mind?  What was the nature of the tripartite agreement entered into in 2000?  Was it binding, with a timetable?  The Minister used the tried and trusted "a lot done, more to do" phrase in this regard.  What commitment was given to the union with regard to ownership of assets?</p>
            <p eId="para_279">The Minister stated the North-South interconnector would remain in ownership of the ESB unless it was a transmission connection.  I presumed any interconnection between North and South would be a transmission asset.  I do not understand how it could be considered part of the distribution system.</p>
            <p eId="para_280">I am uncertain about the proposal for a risk related rate of return with regard to the distribution network.  Assuming it is a stable, conservative business area, my vision of a green energy future requires a radical change in the distribution system with development of microgeneration, a distributed grid, smart net metering and a range of connection options for renewable suppliers.  This requires a flexible, modern, risk-taking distribution network.  It does not make sense to hamstring a company in terms of development of a distribution network because this is the area in which we need most change and innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_281">Can the Minister give an explanation of the future of the ESB?  I understand how the management and board of the ESB were confused.  Privatisation was on the cards in the time of the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  A number of parties considered it as a lucrative option and clear signals to this effect were given to management of the company.  This has since been scotched and rightly so.</p>
            <p eId="para_282">The Minister referred to the task of developing and expanding overseas and mentioned examples in the UK.  The Government scuppered one of the best investment opportunities, the Polish expansion.</p>

The White Paper refers to the need to develop a renewable future but the ESB has done nothing in this regard and has blocked others by, for example, supporting the wind energy moratorium.</p>
            <p eId="para_285">I agree with the Deloitte &amp; Touche report in respect of development of the generation business and the separation of the transmission grid.  This is a good framework for the future.  I do not know the Minister's plans for the ESB.  My vision is to turn it into the green energy company of Ireland and direct the company towards that future.  Can the Minister provide a synopsis of the business plan of the ESB?</p>

            <p eId="para_286">The timetable for the legislation is until the end of 2008.  The transfer will take place by then and the legislation will fit within that timetable.  The tripartite agreement was made in 2000 for a five year framework.  It was designed to protect the ESB from competition as we opened and liberalised the markets.  The Government was committed to a strong ESB, as it is now.</p>
            <p eId="para_287">Regarding the risk-related rate of return, a North-South grid study will take into account the work necessary, including microgeneration, to increase the amount of renewables and reach our ambitious targets in that area.  When completed, we will have a complete picture of what is needed for the transmission system to cater for renewables until 2020 and 2030 on an all-island basis.  The risk-related rate of return means that if money is spent, repayments and interest will be included in the price.  The regulator can give 3.2%-6.8% return on the distribution assets.  The risk-related rate of return would be at the lower end of that because giving a profit adds to the cost.  The cost of renewables and work needed on the grid would be returned in the risk related rate of return.</p>
            <p eId="para_288">This and previous Governments are committed to the ESB.  As part of the tripartite agreement Synergen was set up, along with new stations in Lanesborough and Shannonbridge.  Investment in Coolkeeragh was encouraged and the repowering of Moneypoint and Aghada.  Major investment was made in Spain, the investment was recouped and the ESB owns half of the power station.  All of this was approved by Government and the one deal that was not approved was one in which the ESB did not follow the correct procedures.  Instead, it presented a <i>fait accompli</i> to the Government.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</from>
            <p eId="para_293">The primary motivation in aligning the future management of the wild salmon fishery with the scientific advice and the introduction of the appropriate regulations to cease mixed stock fishing is the conservation of wild salmon stocks.  It is vital to afford every protection to the remaining salmon stocks and to clearly prioritise conservation over catch.</p>
            <p eId="para_294">The independent group was set up to examine the implications for the commercial sector of aligning the wild salmon fishery with scientific advice for 2007 and beyond.  The scientific advice called for the complete cessation of all indiscriminate mixed stock fishing for salmon and the cessation of harvesting of stocks which are below their conservation limit.</p>
            <p eId="para_295">The salmon hardship scheme, which I published recently, is being administered jointly by BIM and the regional fisheries boards.  The closing date for receipt of applications is 30 March 2007.  However, I am advised that applicants will have until 31 December 2007 to accept any offer under the scheme.  The scheme is voluntary and individuals do not have to make an application or accept an offer following an application.</p>
            <p eId="para_296">The independent group recommended that those who avail of the scheme should not be able to apply for a licence in the future.  It is my intention that the control of fishing for salmon order will shortly be modified in such a way that applications for commercial fishing licences will only be invited for fishery districts where rivers are identified as having surplus stock in 2007 and only for those methods that do not impact indiscriminately on stocks of fish that are below their conservation limit.</p>
            <p eId="para_297">In the future when stocks recover and it is established from the results of the genetic stock identification project that significant numbers of fish destined for other rivers are not intercepted, it should be possible to exploit the identified surplus in rivers, bays and estuaries by all appropriate methods, but within the constraints permitted by the habitats directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_298">The wording in the scheme to which the Deputy refers is part of the general terms and conditions which BIM applies to all schemes it operates, as has been the norm for the past four years.  This clause legally permits BIM to cater for any changes in State or EU legislation which might occur, or any other changes that may occur after a scheme has been launched, negating the need to re-advertise a scheme and requesting applicants to reapply.</p>

            <from>Mr. Perry</from>
            <p eId="para_299">Why does BIM reserve the right to amend the conditions of the scheme?  It is quite unfair that when people sign up for the hardship scheme, they forfeit the right to apply for any future commercial salmon licences.  I see the Minister of State has stipulated up to the 31 December as regards the evaluation period and for acceptance.  In certain cases fishermen are sending back the application forms.  The Minister has said this is very much a voluntary scheme.  However, are we not talking about a complete ban?  If they do apply for the scheme this year is there any possibility of a reconsideration, should they apply after 31 March?</p>

            <p eId="para_300">We have tried to be as flexible as possible with the scheme.  As I have outlined, BIM has always included this clause in its remit because it allows it to make changes without re-advertising to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_301">We have introduced an independent appeals procedures which will apply in respect of decisions by the administrative authority.  Applicants who are unsuccessful may contact the independent appeals officer.  A number of Deputies have raised the issue of 31 March with me, including Deputy Perry and Members on this side of the House.  I intend to have discussions with BIM over the next day or two to see whether the date can be extended closer to the end of April.</p>
            <p eId="para_302">There are some 1,800 licences between draft net and drift net operators and to date, more than 600 have applied.  I understand there was a meeting last night in Donegal and we expect that substantially more will apply over the next few days.  I am prepared to consider extending the date, possibly for another month, to cater for people who may want more time to review the situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_303">On the evaluation, as regards the level of compensation on offer, it is totally inadequate in that this is a hardship scheme and yet it is not tax-free.  The benchmark period adopted was very inappropriate and in certain cases people will receive as little as €2,000 and €3,000, while forfeiting the right to apply for any licence, even for draft netting.  This is an appalling scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_304">Finally, it has not been explained how the community fund is to be administered, in what manner and whom it will benefit.</p>

            <p eId="para_305">The overall provision is €25 million for hardship and €5 million for the fund the Deputy has talked about.  We are in discussions with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, to see how the €5 million scheme can be implemented.  I do not believe any Deputy would support the setting up of another bureaucratic layer within my Department when CLÁR, RAPID, LEADER and other programmes operate within Deputy Ó Cuív's office.  I believe we should examine how we can administer the fund through his Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_306">As regards the taxation arrangements, the money can be paid over a period of three years.  The Revenue Commissioners have advised that not all the hardship fund will be taxable.  The part which relates to the payment of six times the value of the 2006 licence fee, for example, will not be liable to tax.  There are therefore opportunities for fishermen to avail of the scheme over a three-year period, which will reduce their tax liability.  As I have said, we have already held discussions with Revenue on this particular area.</p>

            <p eId="para_307">As regards the flawed mythology used for the evaluation and the payment, the manner in which tags are issued to fishermen is totally in appropriate.  In certain cases tags may be bought in five different towns without any central data record being accountable and that is the situation pertaining in a modern technologically-based economy.  Does the Minister of State not agree that the €3,000 or €4,000 being paid out to the majority of drift net operators will not compensate them for their nets?  The level of compensation on offer is totally inadequate.  With 1,800 licence holders, to date only one third have sent in their applications.  That does not augur well for the future.</p>

         the situation regarding the implications the sale of the <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> will have on the Irish fleet particularly on the allocation of quota; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_219" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Mr. Browne</from>
            <p eId="para_315">The <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> fishing vessel has been de-registered from Ireland’s sea fishing boat register and accordingly does not have an entitlement to fish Ireland’s fishing quotas.  The fishing capacity of the vessel, in terms of tonnage and kilowatts, remains in the ownership of the Atlantic Dawn company which, subject to normal sea fishing boat licensing and registration rules, may be reintroduced onto the sea fishing boat register within two years of its removal from the fleet register.  Any of the capacity not reintroduced within this timeframe is lost to the vessel owner. </p>
            <p eId="para_316">The management arrangements in place for the allocation of quota to individual vessels have been developed over time in consultation with industry representatives.  Vessel size has traditionally been an important factor in determining the amount of quota allocated to individual vessels.  Proposals from industry representatives for the distribution of quota continue to be framed in the context of specified vessel size categories.  The <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> was included in a group of the eight largest vessels and received the same quota allocations as the other vessels in its size category.</p>
            <p eId="para_317">Any vessel entering the RSW segment of the Irish fleet, having purchased sufficient capacity would in the normal course enjoy the same quota allocations as other similarly sized vessels in that segment.  It is important to emphasise that quotas are a national asset and are not owned by individuals.  The normal arrangements for allocation of pelagic quotas for vessels in the RSW pelagic segment will be applied.  These arrangements vary from stock to stock.  I intend to ensure that the quotas available to Ireland are fully utilised.</p>

            <from>Mr. Ferris</from>
            <p eId="para_320">He is therefore talking about a national asset being exploited by a Dutch consortium for two years when in fact it should be divided among the Irish fleet.  Does the Minister of State accept the implications of the decision to allocate so much of the national quota to one vessel and consider that fair?  In allocating that quota the Government has discriminated primarily against the greater Irish fleet as has the fact that a national asset is now in the hands of a consortium outside this country.    The entire quota for blue whiting was taken up by one vessel.  Does the Minister of State believe this was correct?  Is it fair to the rest of the fishing fleet that one vessel should have control over the entire quota for one species?</p>

            <from>Mr. Browne</from>
            <p eId="para_321">The spring fishery for herring is closed.  If the owners of <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> have a replacement vessel registered and licensed and ready for the autumn fishery, the replacement vessel will be eligible for an allocation of the herring quota.</p>
            <p eId="para_322">Atlantic Dawn was given an allocation involving a catch limit of mackerel in January last.  This catch limit, allocated by means of authorisation issued by the Minister, was subject to several conditions.  The catch limit expired on 7 December.  In normal circumstances, unused allocation reverts to the national pool for redistribution to other vessels.  Following the de-registration of Atlantic Dawn, the unused mackerel allocation has automatically reverted to the national pool.  The vessel owners do not own the quota; it is a national asset.  Normal practice would be, where possible, to facilitate the company if it introduces a replacement vessel before 7 December 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_325">I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 379 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_326">The White Paper on energy policy commits to the completion of a comprehensive cost benefit review next year of the potential for distributed generation and the implications for the networks as a long-term alternative or supplement to the existing centralised system.  My Department is working with Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, ESB Networks and the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland to put in place the appropriate administrative, technical and safety standards and practices to underpin the widespread deployment of micro-generation technologies.  The objective is to develop appropriate solutions suited to the context of the electricity grid and for non-grid connected technologies with a view to progressing this emerging sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_327">SEI has undertaken work on metering options for small-scale renewable and CHP electricity generation.  The study identified several areas which require further analysis including the ability of such processes to secure adequate payment for their exports, a review of connection standards and processes for smaller generators and the implications of the single electricity market for small-scale electricity generation.</p>
            <p eId="para_328">CER has issued a consultation paper on micro-generation with a view to establishing appropriate administrative and technical mechanisms.  This paper discusses the technical standards to apply to such generators, the installation process for micro-generators, and the metering and commercial arrangements for such generators.  A separate consultation paper on authorisation and licensing of small-scale generators has also been published by CER, with a view to establishing a simplified authorisation process for small-scale generators including micro-generators.  These consultations should lead to more simplified processes appropriate to micro-generation.</p>
            <p eId="para_329">Informed by SEI's pilot project of 200 houses in the Dundalk energy zone and the full technical and economic review under way by CER, ESB Networks and SEI, I will decide by the end of 2007 on the roll-out and funding of a national five-year programme to install smart meters for all householders in new and existing housing stock.  This will facilitate grid connection of micro-renewable energy sources.</p>
            <p eId="para_330">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has recently introduced new regulations that amend the exempted development provisions of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.  These amendments permit the installation of solar panels, wind turbines and other micro-renewable energy sources, without planning permission, in certain circumstances.</p>

The Government has been a failure in this area.  Ten years ago, renewable energy sources came to 2% of overall energy resources, and that has remained so.  Micro-generation, which is not even referred to in the White Paper, is an example of this failure.</p>

          <p eId="para_335">Yesterday, I spent some time at the hospital bedside of a man I know well who is dying of cancer.  His wife sat there holding his hand as the end approaches.  Many Members will have had this experience with a family member, an acquaintance or a friend.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">Today's report of the National Cancer Registry dealing with the discrepancies in cancer treatment throughout the State makes one realise the lottery for life with which people must contend.  It very much depends on where one lives.  The report indicated that women suffering from breast cancer have a 30% higher chance of dying if they live in the west and the midlands than if they live in Dublin.  Men with prostate cancer are twice as likely to die within five years if they live in the mid-west than if they live in the east.</p>

          <p eId="para_338">If I want Deputy Cowley's assistance, I will call upon him.  The appalling discrepancies in cancer treatment are an indictment of the Government's programme to provide a world class health service.  The varying rates of survival, indicated in the report, will frighten many.  The survival rates for breast cancer in the north east stand at 72.3%, 73% in the mid-west and 73.5% in the south east.  Surgical services are widely unavailable in the regions while the availability of chemotherapy and radiotherapy leaves much to be desired.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_340">Does the Taoiseach have any idea why chemotherapy is likely to be used in three times as many cases in the west for prostate cancer as it is in the east?  In January of this year we learnt that the national plan for radiation oncology services, announced by the Government in 2005, was completely hollow and shallow because it had not been thought out by the Government in this first instance.  We should remember that the targets set out in that plan were described by senior officials of the HSE, responsible for the programme as not being achievable.  Does this not make a mockery of the Government's strategy for a world class health service in the area of cancer treatment services?  The issues identified by those officials indicates that the plan was not thought out and that the words of the Government in respect of it were hollow.  While cancer can strike any person, it is difficult when people such as the couple I spoke to yesterday say "Why has the Government let us down in this region in terms of the availability of services?"  Arising from this report, does the Taoiseach believe it is right or fair that a person's address indicates the place in his or her lottery for life as a result of the Government's inadequacy in the provision of cancer services?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_232">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_341">I welcome the publication of the report by the National Cancer Registry on survival patterns of care.  The report cover the period up to 2001, some six years ago.  It shows improvements in survival rates for breast, colorectal and prostate cancers but not for lung cancer at national level during that time.  It shows improvements in all regions for breast and prostate cancers and in most regions for colorectal and lung cancers.  There is no doubt that there are regional disparities in cancer survival rates.  The cancer strategy published last year, which was welcomed by all the stakeholders, is designed fundamentally to change that.  One of the major objectives of that strategy is to improve the outcomes for cancer patients in every region.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_344">We are funding and organising cancer services to ensure that patients from every region will be benefit equally from top quality cancer care.  Using more specialised care in the major centres is the way to achieve this.  That is what all the experts indicate and all the evidence shows that.  It is vital that cancer specialists treat a sufficient number of cases to maintain and grow their skills.  That has been pointed out in a number of reports published during the last six or seven years.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">We are again this year making a large allocation available for cancer control, screening, acute services and research.  The increase in investment this year is almost three quarters more than the comparable investment for the previous year to support the implementation of the national cancer control programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">The HSE and the Department of Health and Children are also working on the means to implement the national plan for radiation oncology services to meet the timeframe.  The Deputy will be aware that the timeframe for the rolling out of that programme nationwide is another four years.  The Deputy raised this issue with me previously.  It is considered by all the people involved in the programme that it will not be rolled out any faster than that.  It will take until some time in 2011 to roll out radiation oncology services on a national basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">I am sure the Taoiseach is aware from his discussions on this area that early detection and early intervention save lives.  When I was in Tralee recently the consultants I met made it perfectly clear that people die in that region because they are waiting for endoscopies and analysis — they die.  Why have mobile screening units not been provided throughout the west and north west?  There was no waiting list in Sligo General Hospital last week and a great service is available in that hospital.  However, many women may well have much shorter lives than they expect because they may have breast cancer but have not been screened.  Mobile screening units should have been made available throughout the country to provide such early analysis but that is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">Why is chemotherapy used three times more often for the treatment of prostate cancer on men in the west than in the east where surgical treatment applies?  What is the reason for that if there is supposed to be a national standard?  Can the Taoiseach explain that?  Deputy Twomey published a document on this issue in 2004 in which Fine Gael proposed a screening test for every man and woman for the detection of early signs of these problems.  Does the Taoiseach accept that would be a vital and essential service?</p>
          <p eId="para_349">I note in his sprint on Saturday, the Taoiseach outlined, in breathtaking fashion, his proposal for free screening for breast cancer, cervical cancer and prostate cancer.</p>

          <p eId="para_351">What does that mean?  Following last Saturday night's exclamations, when will those services be rolled out?  Does the Taoiseach believe this report, which clearly indicates that mortality in Ireland in 2007 is directly related to where one lives, is indicative of the world class health service he and his Government promised in view of the glaring discrepancies in treatment for those who require chemotherapy, radiotherapy and so on?  What are the Taoiseach's comments in response to those questions?</p>

          <p eId="para_352">As I said, last year there was a 75% increase in staff resources.  That investment was to support implementation of the Health Service Executive national cancer control programme.  It was for screening and acute services but men, in particular, and Deputy Kenny has been talking to some cancer consultants, are slower to come forward for screening programmes.  It is only through active screening programmes for prostate cancer that we will have success in the fight against prostate cancer.  That is the reason we invested those resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">This report covers the period from 1994 to 2001 but as a society we invested €1 billion in cancer services nationally in the past few years.  That is a significant level of resources and it has been invested substantially in all regions to improve cancer survival rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">Deputy Kenny mentioned Sligo.  He will be aware that some of the best consultants are located in the west and operate from a Galway base.  Many of them trained abroad but now work in the west because that is from where they hail.  One hundred additional consultants have been appointed in the key areas of medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology and haematology.  If the Government can complete the contract with the hospital consultants, we will move quickly to employ several hundred more consultants, including in the area of the national cancer services.  We have employed 245 clinical nurse specialists who have also been appointed in the cancer services area.  Nearly 94,000 inpatients and day patients were discharged from hospitals following a diagnosis of cancer, an increase of nearly 70% on the figure ten years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">I regret that people continue to die from cancer, including friends of Deputy Kenny, but there has been an enormous improvement in the cancer services that have been rolled out — over 70% in terms of patients discharged compared to the number of patients discharged in 1997.  This year we set up the National Cancer Screening Service Board.  That amalgamates BreastCheck, which was established by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Martin, in 1998 and the Irish cervical screening programme, both of which are now part of the national screening programme.  Both BreastCheck and the national cancer screening programme are being rolled out nationally this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_359">It is possible to use mobile units but treatments such as radiation oncology are best carried out in national hospitals and some private hospitals, which also provide the treatment.  The mobile centres are not very expensive, but the main accelerators cost several million euro.  These are based in the hospitals as are the other back-up services such as medical oncology and the consultants in radiology, histology and haematology.  To be successful they need to have experience of dealing with a large number of cases.  The mobile clinics are used for screening purposes only and patients must be referred to hospital centres.  Resources are used to build up national centres of excellence that can deal with a critical mass of patients.  I acknowledge that our success rate is not at the level of the rates in the United States where screening is continually undertaken, but our rate has improved dramatically in the past decade.</p>

The Taoiseach sent him out last Tuesday to present a press conference about the coming Ard-Fheis and the man was but a pale shadow of himself, so shocked was he at the policy platform put forward by this side of the House.  The man was aghast at what modest proposals from this side of the House would do to the country.  He stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_361">We will certainly not be matching the unprecedented scale of the promises given by Fine Gael and Labour.  We will promise less because our approach will deliver more.</p>

          <p eId="para_364">Then looking into the camera, as only the Minister, Deputy Brennan, can do, with all that sincerity, he described himself as "alarmed" at what was happening on this side of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">Deputy Mulcahy is also absent.  He said: "I urge the Taoiseach to stand firm; no tax cuts and no more spending to put the economy at risk".  I saw Deputy Mulcahy on the screen before my eyes on Saturday night, applauding like Mr. Bean on speed.  I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the impact on the Minister, Deputy Brennan, of the Niagara of promises the Taoiseach unleashed on his unsuspecting Cabinet on Saturday night.  There were 53 different commitments, amounting to €300 million per minute.  We are fortunate the Taoiseach only had half an hour.  What would be the position if he had a full hour?</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The Minister for Finance, in more sober terms, also espoused the prudence agenda.  He stated that our economic success has not been built on trade alone, that responsible economics, prioritising budgetary balance and debt reduction provide the foundation for our current prosperity.  He said that is why Fianna Fáil's proposals for the next five years will be fully costed, fully detailed and fully affordable.  Will the Taoiseach say what is the full cost?  The Opposition and the people will judge whether they are affordable.  What happened the prudence and why did the Taoiseach reverse engines mid-week and take his unsuspecting Ministers by surprise?  Why did he promise 2,000 additional gardaí when the hapless Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is in here every day of the week saying there are enough gardaí, that he is happy with the situation and things are under control?  What happened prudence the day the music died, on 24 March 2007?</p>

          <p eId="para_378">I thank Deputy Rabbitte for upsetting his usual family and social occasion on Saturday night by staying in to watch me on television.  I appreciate that greatly.  I read a few weeks ago that one of his undercover agents had discovered that Fianna Fáil was about to cut the tax rate to 18% and that is why Deputy Rabbitte changed the habit of a lifetime from his old days with the Workers' Party and Democratic Left and all his other parties, to go for a new agenda and to propose tax reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">We declared that, If the economy remains strong, we will cut taxes.  As we have done for 20 years, we will continue to reform the taxation system and reduce tax rates, as we have done.  We have introduced every single tax reduction, bar the 1% reduction which Deputy Quinn achieved when he was Minister for Finance.  We will continue to reduce the higher rate of tax to 40% and we will complete the reform of PRSI by abolishing the ceiling whereby no PRSI is paid on incomes over €49,000.  We will halve the full rate of PRSI from 4% to 2%, we will cut the self-employed PRSI rate and will double the home care tax credit.  As the Tánaiste stated on a previous occasion, based on his analysis of the number of gardaí needed, we will increase the number. Now that Deputy Rabbitte has changed his long-held view on these issues I would have thought he would be more supportive of our policies.  I assure the Deputy these policies work.

He certainly goes a long way to recycle when he visits facilities in Drogheda and Wexford.  I presume he puts the material to be recycled into the boot of his ministerial Mercedes because he does not have a car of his own and does not drive.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Nobody would believe what the Taoiseach says.  He is only short of playing cricket on some spare patch of ground.  He jumps on the bandwagon in respect of anything that becomes popular.  The only thing he recycles is other people's ideas.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">What would be the cost to the social insurance fund?  How is it that 2% off the standard rate of tax would cost €1.023 billion and 1% off the marginal rate €211 million?  That does not factor in indexation which relates to wages, not the CPI.  In addition, it does not take into account the doubling of the carer's tax credit.  All of this amounts to €850 million per annum, according to the Taoiseach.  During the prudence period the Minister for Finance said everything would be clear and fully costed.  I am asking the Taoiseach to indicate the cost of the package he outlined at the weekend.  What would be the cost of the income tax changes?  By how much would the insurance fund have to be topped up?  Is he certain that we would be able to pay social welfare benefits and pensions, particularly in the aftermath of what he has done to the social insurance fund?</p>
          <p eId="para_388">What would be the cost of the package outlined by the Taoiseach?  Why did he reverse engines mid-week after he had sent out the Ministers for Social and Family Affairs and Finance, Deputies Brennan and Cowen, and informed his backbenchers that it was a matter of steady as she went and that prudence was the way to manage the economy?  He threw promises around like confetti.  Is it any wonder the woman to whom I referred thinks he is similar to Pinocchio?</p>

What steps is the Taoiseach taking to address the very serious delay in the opening of that new facility?  What has he done to advance the objective of ensuring the hospital will be fully operational as soon as possible?  Will the matter be resolved this week?  What is the Taoiseach's view of the statement by the Minister for Health and Children that the dispute is all about money?  Does he agree with the overwhelming majority of Deputies and members of the wider public who are informed on the issue that the concerns of the midwifery and nursing staff who will be taking up positions in this new facility have always revolved around matters of safety and staffing levels?  Has he noted the concerns expressed by the Irish Nurses Organisation over a period of six months in respect of the requirement to have a full complement of fully trained midwifery and nursing support staff <i>in situ</i> in advance of the opening of the new facility?

The Minister for Health and Children, in her disgraceful contribution in respect of this matter, as much as accused the midwifery and nursing staff intending to take up posts in the new facility and the wider nursing community of greed.  How does she balance this against the revelation in the past week that three advisers to the HSE chief executive, Brendan Drumm, received up to €1 million — including an overtime rate of €1,500 per day — in the 15 months to January this year?  How can the Government have the gall to accuse nurses involved in the front-line delivery of health services of greed while trying to stand over and justify the outrageous abuse and misuse of public moneys I have outlined?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_420">It is an annual budget of €60 million.  At all stages the HSE advised that the hospital would be opened on a phased basis and would be fully operational by the end of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The Cork University Maternity Hospital was due to open last Saturday.  Deputy Ó Caoláin is correct in that regard.  Some 128 of the 144 beds were ready and due to open on that day.  The HSE, consultant staff and the midwifery management were completely satisfied that 128 beds could have safely opened last Saturday, and they are the people to make that decision.  There was a major operation put in place to assist the transfer of all women from the existing three maternity hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The hospital failed to open following a ballot by the INO members last Friday rejecting the Labour Court recommendations.  The Labour Court's recommendation 18661 stated that the facility should open as planned on 24 March.  The HSE accepted the Labour Court recommendations and the INO cited insufficient staffing as the reason for refusing to move to the new hospital.  The HSE has set a new date of 31 March, and remains in daily communications with the midwives due to transfer to the new service.  Some 125 beds will transfer from the three maternity hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Deputy Ó Caoláin stated there were no posts and a lack of staff, and that is not the case.  The HSE has created 264 new additional posts of which 146 are midwifery nursing posts for the new Cork University Maternity Hospital.  The staffing rate for the hospital is the best in the country, with a 1:23 birth ratio.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">When the facility is fully operational, the midwifery nursing complement will be 375.  Currently, there is a short-term issue in filling all the posts, but 32 student midwives are expected to graduate after the summer and all of them will be offered employment.  The HSE will make up any short-term staffing with overtime and agency midwives.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">Midwives and nurses are rostered to attend induction training and orientation in the maternity hospital this week.  Some 75 midwives have already attended orientation training.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">Those are the facts.  Hopefully, this state-of-the-art €75 million facility with 144 beds replacing outdated services will open this weekend.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_294">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_427">On that last point, we certainly agree it is a state-of-the-art facility and one that should be opened immediately.  It is all the more incredible, therefore, that the Minister has failed to make the required intervention to ensure the adequate staff are <i>in situ</i> in advance of the opening of the facility, as was clearly a requirement, not only of the INO but, indeed, of the wider populace who would be using it.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">The Taoiseach must acknowledge that the integrity of the nurses and midwives in the Cork area who would be employed there is in question by the Minister's charge that this was all to do with greed and money.  Does he agree that midwives and nurses are the people at the coalface of the delivery of the care to expectant mothers presenting for birth at this and every other facility, and they know first hand and best the level of cover and the various requirements that are necessary to ensure the safe delivery of a new generation of young children in that city and county?</p>
          <p eId="para_429">I ask the Taoiseach to clarify his position.  Does he understand the reason the midwives and nurses have rejected the proposition and, indeed, the further points put to them by the INO in an effort to see if there was another way through the difficulty?  They have given a clear answer and the INO senior executive must follow through on its membership's decision.  The Government also has a responsibility to follow through on that decision, that is, to ensure there is adequate staffing cover immediately.  What steps is the Taoiseach taking to ensure this state-of-the-art facility is up and running before the end of this week?</p>

          <p eId="para_433">It is the HSE, consultant staff and the midwifery management, not people out on the  streets or any individual member of staff, who are the people who make the call.  The HSE, the consultant staff in the hospital and the midwifery management were completely satisfied, and that is the issue.  It is not Deputy Ó Caoláin's function or my function.  The people with responsibility, the people in management positions who are paid for management positions, which Deputy Ó Caoláin obviously has a difficulty with — I am not getting into that —  are the ones who made the call.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">The HSE went to the Labour Court.  The Labour Court issued its recommendation  As always, I am consistent on that and stand over the recommendation.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, acted honourably throughout.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">The INO cited that there were insufficient staff — I have already given the reason in that regard.  The INO also sought relocation payments of €3,000 and €5,000, and additional promotional posts.  The relocation payments claim was rejected by the Labour Court, but it did recommend an additional one day's leave be granted on a once-off basis and that was accepted by the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Deputy Ó Caoláin asked about the additional posts.  The HSE has created 146 midwifery nursing posts for the new Cork University Maternity Hospital, which is the best ratio in the country, and when it is fully operational there will be 375.  As I stated, the midwives and nurses are rostered on a basis that is well known.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">Obviously, it is an industrial relations matter and it is not for me to give my personal view on these issues.  It is a matter of fulfilling a Labour Court recommendation.  I hope the matter will be resolved so this state-of-the-art facility can be opened as soon as possible.</p>

The 2001 South Tipperary by-election was held on a Saturday and, contrary to the Taoiseach's experience, the turn out was huge, especially among young people who were pleased to be back at home to exercise their democratic rights.

The Tánaiste did not even consider the debate on the Bill to be important because he believed it to have a foregone conclusion.  Will the Government think twice before providing for a Friday sitting on the agenda if it is not going to muster a quorum or if it gives the impression that the House is somehow irrelevant to its proceedings?

It is an absolute scandal that we are fast-tracking the Bill, even if it is as important as the Tánaiste believes.  On the Order of Business last Thursday I stated I was opposed to a Friday sitting if it was not to be a proper sitting.  I said we wanted a proper sitting, not a half-arsed one.  I was proven correct on Friday because it was nothing more than half-arsed.  The fact that over the weekend the Tánaiste introduced seven pages of amendments to his own Bill shows the potential for major flaws in the legislation.  As usual, he presented us with half a Bill and will introduce the other half as amendments on Committee and Report Stages, which means those in the House who are not participating in the debate will not have sight of them before they are presented by him.  Given that the deadline for amendments was supposed to be prior to the completion of Second Stage but had to be extended because of the six letter word, "quorum", what is the deadline for amendments to the Bill if it is passed on Second Stage 15 minutes after the conclusion of the Order of Business and we have to consider Committee Stage tomorrow?  It is an absolute disgrace.  We should extend the time allowed in order that all Deputies can speak on Second Stage to take account of the amendments the Tánaiste is trying to push through.  Accordingly, we should oppose the proposal.</p>

          <p eId="para_463">I wish to make several points.  Proceedings in the House collapsed just over ten minutes before the debate was due to end on Friday.  As I understand the matter, everyone who had requested to speak had a chance to make a contribution and the Minister for State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was about to conclude the debate on Second Stage.  People would have thought there would be no difficulty as regards a quorum at 5.20 p.m. on Friday.  That is not an unreasonable assumption to make but 16 Members were available.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">The scheme of the Bill was published on 8 February.  I was asked by Deputy Howlin last week to raise some of the issues.  I was not fully able to accommodate his request but, at least, we tried to move some way towards accommodating his suggestion, which was not unreasonable.  While it would, perhaps, have been better had the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, made his speech last week, no disrespect was shown at 5.20 p.m. on Friday.</p>

This is not the way to go about business or to legislate.  Having regard to the historical lessons they have learned, Members should not proceed with a guillotine for this Bill either.</p>

It only allows for bad law with poor engagement and inadequate opportunity.  Ultimately, Members have seen indications in the recent past of the failure of the Government to take account of Opposition advice and amendments.  In this case, Members will see an exact repetition with all the potential flaws that will present.  This is not how one should do one's business and I oppose the guillotine.</p>

          <p eId="para_704">The historic meeting yesterday between the DUP leader, the Reverend Ian Paisley, and the leader of Sinn Féin, Gerry Adams, is a most welcome and important event.  I wish to pay tribute to the Taoiseach for his undoubted patience during the past ten years in weathering many a storm in this matter and to all of those political personnel of all parties who made a contribution in whatever way to bringing us to this point.  It is only right and proper to state this.  In my time, all Governments in their own way played their part in putting this complex jigsaw together and I hope in early May this will result in a beginning which will herald a new dawn for the peoples and communities of Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">As a meeting is to take place between the Deputy First Minister to be appointed and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, will the Irish Government make a further allocation for cross-Border activities such as road development, tourism, education or health?  Is the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, who already put up €400 million, likely to increase this amount on the probability the Assembly will get up and running?</p>

I wish to particularly thank the small group of dedicated officials who worked long and hard on this.  A section of the national development plan deals with resources and to square the circle on this we must invest additional resources.  This was reflected in our statement last week.  To get the Chancellor to provide the extra £1 billion on top of what he allocated last November, which was £50 billion over the period and to deal with the water rates issue will require us to make an allocation.  This allocation will be specified into infrastructure and roads in the north west.</p>

Credit is due to the Taoiseach and his Government and officials and to former taoisigh for the progress to date and to the many people involved on both sides of the Border and in Britain.  Given the significance of the developments and the hope they will continue will the Taoiseach state whether on this side of the Border a programme of change and a response to the developments in the North is in place, including promised legislation?  I not only mean the monetary side as mentioned by Deputy Kenny; I also mean such matters as were raised here on many occasions including legislation such as that on the register of persons unsafe to work with children.  We know from the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, that a serious problem exists when it comes to liability for people working with children.</p>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_743">I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate over the two days last week in the House.  Many important and useful points were made and they have all been noted.  I was encouraged to see a significant degree of support from all sides in the House for the measures in the Bill.  I am not surprised by this as I know all Deputies share a common aim of defeating gangland crime.  This Bill will make a significant contribution to that end.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">Before I respond to some of the issues raised in the debate, I would like to set the Bill in a wider context.  The general level of crime forms the backdrop to the debate on a Bill such as this.  It is aimed at a particular type and level of crime, namely gangland crime.  That is, without doubt, our greatest challenge at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">However, in drawing attention to that fact we must not give the impression that crime generally is out of control as this is not the case.  If we consider crime figures in the context of a changing and increasing population, we will see clearly that the level of crime has dropped in recent years.  In 1995, with a population of 3.6 million, there were 28.5 crimes per 1,000 of the population and in 2006, with a population in excess of 4.2 million, the level had fallen to 24.5 crimes per 1,000 of the population.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">I am aware that despite the improving overall position, the experience of a victim of any crime is still traumatic and deeply upsetting, and I do not wish in any way to minimise the personal pain and suffering that a crime can cause.  However, we all have a responsibility to show a sense of perspective and proportion about crime levels and to tell people clearly what is the true picture, rather than attempt to seek short-term gain from a distortion of the figures.  Deputy Dennehy reminded us rightly of the dangers of glamorising certain crime figures and their activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">A number of Deputies asked about the publication of the final report of the review group on the balance in the criminal law.  Most Deputies are by now aware that the report, which I received last Tuesday on my return from the United States of America, was published on Friday and is available on my Department's website.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">I take this opportunity to express my thanks to the review group and its chairman, Dr. Gerard Hogan, for the work over recent months.  The report provides much very useful and thoughtful points of analysis on major issues in the criminal law and we will all benefit from consideration over the coming weeks of its conclusions.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">However, we should act in the short term on two recommendations.  I therefore propose to introduce amendments on the taking of statements by electronic means.<b> </b>The first amendment will provide that where a statement was given to a Garda and the person had been informed it was being recorded electronically, it will not be necessary to commit it to a written form.  That is implied by the warning in the Judges’ rules.  Second, recordings of statements will not be provided except to persons who have been charged and in those cases, the court may establish conditions about the use of the record.  The first one I mentioned is likely to arise on Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">These are important changes that will free up Garda time and will allow better use to be made of new technology.</p>

          <p eId="para_761">Increased reliance on video evidence will be seen as enhancing the protection of suspects and Garda questioners alike.  These changes will also address what one hears about the use and abuse of recordings given to arrested persons when they are apparently used to convince the "boss" and accomplices that nothing incriminating was said in the interview.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">Deputies Sexton and Fiona O'Malley spoke on the question of sentencing<b>, </b>with particular reference to a recent case.  I am aware the case referred to by the two Deputies is before the courts so it would be inappropriate for me to comment on it.  However, Members will recall that I set out my views on sentencing policies in my opening remarks in this debate.  I emphasised the need for consistency, coherence and rationality, and I also set out my views on the respective roles of the Judiciary and the Oireachtas in developing sentencing policies.  It is not necessary for me to add to those remarks at this juncture.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">Several Deputies inquired about the plans to introduce electronic monitoring.<b> </b> In particular, Deputy Howlin had questions about the technical feasibility of it.  Electronic monitoring can currently take two forms.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">The first type, which has been in operation in a number of countries since the 1990s, is what is commonly called tagging.  This is a tried and tested method where the offender wears an electronic bracelet, anklet or other electronic device in accordance with conditions set by the courts or on release from prison, such as compliance with a curfew condition.  The tagged person's presence at or absence from a specified location, usually the person's home, is monitored by computer 24 hours a day using a base station and telephone line.  Effectively the device is plugged into a wall and would telephone if——</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_768">The second type of monitoring, which the Deputy referred to, is by GPS tracking.  This is the remote surveillance of a person's location as he or she moves from place to place.  It uses locational technology more often associated with tracking ships and other vehicles.  It is more sophisticated than tagging, but the expectations, technical challenges and costs are higher too, as the Deputy would know.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">The offender carries a personal tracking device which receives satellite or other signals and calculates its own location.  The tracking device contains GSM or GPRS technology that allows the immediate transmission of location data to a control centre.  The end product is a detailed map showing the offender's movements while tracked.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">Its most obvious application is to monitor detailed compliance with specific requirements, for example, to stay out of an exclusion zone, observe a curfew or attend specified programmes, locations or other activities.  Deputies may be interested to know that a leaflet distribution company in Dublin could show them a GPS print-out of where its people were to prove they were on one road or another.  This shows the point the technology has reached.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">Pilot GPS projects in the UK have found GPS in its current state of development not to be sufficiently reliable where the offender is between tall buildings or on the underground or trains.  Compared to standard monitoring, GPS tracking is more expensive.  The proposals for electronic monitoring in the Bill provide for both curfew-type conditions and exclusion conditions.</p>

          <p eId="para_773">While their implementation in full would depend on the availability of reliable, economical GPS technology, the introduction of a system of tagging in the old-fashioned sense of a home-based unit would allow implementation in part.  The Department will conduct a feasibility test prior to commencing the electronic monitoring provisions introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  The exercise will be of use in respect of the proposals in this Bill also.</p>

          <p eId="para_779">A range of opinions were expressed about the Bill's proposals on the right to silence.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh was critical while Deputy Jim O'Keeffe believed I was being too cautious.  Perhaps I can take some consolation from being in the middle of this divergence of opinion and suggest that we may have achieved the right balance on this sensitive issue.  As is clear to Deputies, the interim report of the balancing of the criminal law group did not go as far as I have, I have not gone as far as Deputy Jim O'Keeffe wants me to and Deputy Ó Snodaigh believes I have gone too far.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">Deputy Howlin believed the proposals in section 24 for mandatory sentencing where the first and second offences were ones that appear on the Second Schedule to the Bill had merit.  He also described the new crime prevention orders as extremely valuable.  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe also believed they were worthwhile, an opinion with which I agree.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">Several Deputies spoke about the importance of resourcing the Garda Síochána and were correct when they emphasised the importance of a well managed, well run Garda force with the resources necessary to do the job.  I agree with the sentiment expressed that there is no substitute for good police work, but it does not just happen, it needs to be planned and paid for.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">The Government has an exemplary record in supporting the Garda.  It has initiated a far-reaching reform programme and has matched that with funding, increased personnel and increased and better equipment.  The Garda budget for 2007 stands at €1.4 billion, an increase of 11% over last year's Estimate.  Garda numbers are at their highest ever.  As of 14 March, there were 13,178 fully qualified members compared with 10,702 on 30 June 1997 and more than 14,000 recruited members.  The Government has given approval for the Garda force to reach 15,000 members, but we must go further.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">These few facts speak for themselves.  We are committed to the Garda and our task, to which I have given priority, is to ensure the resources are used to maximum advantage.  Additional resources in and of themselves are not sufficient as new and better management and improved accountability are also required.  The programme of change I have initiated will help bring that about.</p>

          <p eId="para_785">I will examine the matter before Committee Stage and discuss it with the Deputy.  I will mention some Committee Stage amendments that I will be proposing.  I have already spoken on the proposals in respect of statements taken by electronic means.  There will be amendments of a technical nature clarifying further some of the Bill's provisions on the destruction of fingerprints and similar records, bail and the operation of sections 24 and 25, including an amendment to ensure legal aid is available in cases where there will be a variation of a crime prevention order under section 25.  There will also be a number of minor amendments of a typographical and textual nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">There may be a small number of Report Stage amendments to clarify issues related to the operation of section 22 on appeals from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court and section 99, the power to suspend sentences, particularly where there are consecutive sentences and the first one is partly suspended, of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  While they are important points, they are primarily technical and operational.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">I expect to table an amendment to clarify the position in respect of non-garda officers of the Criminal Assets Bureau who attend interviews with suspects in the course of criminal investigations.  Some people have expressed doubts as to whether those officers are entitled to participate in the interrogation of suspects, but it would be foolish to exclude them from the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">I thank the House for the constructive approach evident in the debate.  It underlines our shared wish to deal effectively with organised criminal gangs, a goal to which the Bill will give effect.

        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_434">
          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_955">There was considerable debate on this matter on Committee Stage.  There is support for the Minister's goal.  I have received representations from the Irish Travel Agents Association.  The industry is dealing with net margins but is not directly providing the service.  Travel agents are paid in a certain format and this will affect turnover, profitability and survival.  One travel agent indicated this measure would result in a reduction of €20,000 in gross profit.  I am more concerned about the smaller travel agents who have been in touch with us about this matter.  Perhaps the Minister of State might read some extracts or bring to the Minister's attention the implications of section 48 of the Bill, as amended, on the ban on credit card surcharges.  Normally, I would be strongly supportive of this, but in this particular case I should like if the Minister of State would give some indication as to how we may assist in getting over this problem.  The travel industry operates on an average gross margin of 8% and a net margin of 2% or less.  The Bill, in effect, will wipe out the net margin on credit card transactions, which are now in excess of 40% of turnover due to increased web usage.  It will definitely damage the industry, as indicated to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">We do not want to discriminate unduly or unfairly on behalf of any particular industry, but there is certainly a case to be met as regards the travel agents in particular.  I assume they had no notice of the fact that this would be brought to the attention of the Minister and introduced as an amendment until the Committee Stage amendments were tabled within the past two weeks.  We just want to get the Minister of State's view, in the context of implementing section 48, as amended on Committee Stage, as to what way it might impact on this particular sector.</p>

          <from>Dr. Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_957">I concur with what Deputy Hogan has said.  I, too, have had representations on the very same points.  It certainly raises issues about the travel industry and the implications therefor.  In the submission to me the point is made that there is the risk of a knock-on effect for consumers.  Those who pay by alternative methods other than direct debit may become victims in that regard.  I would ask the Minister of State to comment on what Deputy Hogan has said.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_436" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
          <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_958">As colleagues will be aware, there is no proposed amendment to section 48 at this stage.  I am, of course, aware of the points which have been made in particular by the travel agents and their concerns about payment by credit card and the additional costs they may incur arising from section 48.  The point has also been made strongly, particular by consumer rights' interests, that across a wide range of areas no such charge is imposed by traders on the high street or elsewhere.  There is clearly a downside, as illustrated by the arguments put forward by the Irish Travel Agents Association, ITAA, representatives of which I met earlier today who put forward its case very strongly.  However, in general terms there is also considerable advantage in making provision for non-cash payments, in particular.  A move has been made towards electronic payment methods for very good reasons, not least issues to do with the safety of cash in transit as well as many other considerations which are all positive.  Notwithstanding that, the travel agents have a particular concern and there are other areas where consumers have expressed a great deal of concern about either hidden charges arising from credit card transactions or sometimes fairly transparent additional charges.  This last may be seen when payments can only be made by credit card, which is the case with one particular company and that is covered by section 49.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">Certainly the view of the Minister and the Department is that on balance, the provisions of section 48, as they stand, are in the best interests of the consumer.  While account was not taken, in the manner described by Deputy Hogan, in terms of having a long debate and a good deal of consultation on the issue with the travel agents in particular, the Minister is of the view that the provision, as it stands in the Bill, merits support on balance in that it benefits consumers to a great extent and does not appear to impact in the way that is being argued.  There are costs associated with payments by all methods, not just credit cards.  The concerns of the travel agents in particular, about credit card payments, have been made strongly, but the Minister is of the view that at this stage section 48 is of such benefit that it ought to be left as it stands.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_437">
          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_960">I understand where the Minister is coming from.  He has had the support of all sides of the House on the amendment that was tabled on Committee Stage, in terms of devising a way in which we can eliminate hidden charges and have more transparency in costs associated with transactions.  The travel industry, however, as was made clear to me and I am sure to the Minister of State, is not like an airline.  It is an intermediary body for the purpose of providing a service for consumers.  A good deal of business is now being done on-line, and the travel industry is under pressure because of that.  It is the same in the insurance industry.  The capacity to move completely to a cashless payments system, however, is still not in place to the extent that it should be, perhaps.  Nevertheless, this decision, which perhaps we did not tease out as much as we should on Committee Stage, will have an impact on this particular sector.  As it was brought to the attention of the Minister of State, I should have thought we might have found a way to accommodate within the spirit of what the section, as amended, purported to do, the specific nature of the business involved in the travel industry.  If there is an opportunity before the Bill finally passes in which this can be achieved, it is worthy of further consideration.</p>

          <from>Dr. Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_961">The ITAA has made the point that one of the consequences is that there will be a higher price for everybody.  This is the Consumer Protection Bill.  From that perspective perhaps there is a consumer aspect to it, particularly in the light of what the travel agents argue.  They maintain they will suffer greatly as a consequence and perhaps there is a consumer element within their argument which should be taken on board.  The Minister might give this further consideration, if possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_439" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
          <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_962">It is important to be aware that section 48 does not prevent travel agents from recovering the cost of the credit card operation.  I accept the important point made by Deputy Upton to the effect that spreading this charge across all payments has an impact on other consumers.  This is almost inevitable when one seeks to move towards a cashless society to get away from the difficulties inherent in transactions which are operated entirely by cash or cheque.  I have not been able to find a means for counting the cost of cash and cheques.  It is not just a cost to business but in many respects is a charge against the State and others.  That has not been possible to assess properly, however, in the short time since this issue has been on the agenda.  I accept it is a relatively short period since it came on the agenda in mid-February in the Seanad.  Nevertheless, everybody who looks at the difficulties involved concedes that there are considerable advantages in general terms from a consumer viewpoint, in the provisions of section 48.  People are even more convinced when section 48 is set beside section 49 and the other issues are dealt with which the debate, particularly on Committee Stage, threw up.  Having considered all of that and given that generally speaking cash and cheques are among the most expensive methods of payment, it is in our interests to move towards a cashless society.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">There are, of course, other issues relating to charges imposed by banks.  In this instance, this is a slightly different issue and one that may be addressed in different legislation — and ultimately will have to be tackled, in any event.  For the moment, however, it has not been possible to come up with a means to address the potential fallout and problems of concern to the ITAA and its members.</p>

          <p eId="para_988">This issue was discussed on Committee Stage.  The current maximum award in the Small Claims Court is €2,000.  The legal costs implementation advisory group has proposed that it be increased to €3,000 and reviewed biannually thereafter.  This would meet some of Deputy Hogan's concerns.  Regulations increasing the limit, the District Court (Small Claims) (Amendment) Rules 2006, came into effect in early 2006 and will be reviewed in two years.  The Minister expects the National Consumer Agency will be included in any consultation by the Courts Service in further reviews of the limit.  If it were increased to €10,000, it would be beyond the civil jurisdictional limit of the District Court which is set at €6,250.</p>

          <p eId="para_989">That is why I want to amend the District Court rules.  I understand the argument of the Minister of State.  It is not easy to increase the limits and devolve a system of small claims that would be accessible to people without some expense and time.  The principle of establishing a non-adversarial, less expensive mechanism to solve disputes around consumer protection issues is important.  I note the increase to €3,000.  Does the Department intend to expand the Small Claims Court service to more districts?</p>

          <p eId="para_1029">The Deputy tabled this amendment following the Committee Stage debate last Wednesday.  It was agreed on Committee Stage that we would recheck the point with the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Counsel.  On their strong advice, I must leave the figure of 20% stand.  The reason for doing so, as explained to me, is that, based on precedents and similar definitions in financial legislation, 20% of the allotted share capital or voting rights is regarded as an appropriate amount for the purpose of the definition of an associate of an undertaking.  According to the advice I have received, a figure of 10% would be regarded as too low.  In addition, the definition of an associate of an undertaking is comprehensive enough to cover a number of other business relationships.  This was a concern expressed by the Deputy on Committee Stage.  The definition is wide enough to incorporate other business relationships such as a holding company of the undertaking, a subsidiary of the company of the undertaking and a partnership or a joint venture in which the undertaking has a financial interest.  The point the Deputy seeks to cover is covered in the legislation as it stands.</p>

I have great pleasure, therefore, in speaking to the amendment.  Unfortunately, we tend to presume there will be Oireachtas approval, on the basis of various developments that take place from time to time and European legislation, and to observe everything except the primacy of the Oireachtas.  In a number of other parliaments throughout Europe and elsewhere there are circumstances where it is in order to have such procedures but in the case of a sovereign parliament it is always advisable to observe its primacy and provide that parliamentary approval is to be sought or given.  Legislation passed through the House recently in respect of which there was a presumption that the House would agree related measures.  However, in too many instances there is a presumption in the case of legislation and the application of the law.  This creates a dangerous precedent.</p>

          <p eId="para_1043">I acknowledge that while this may not be the Deputy's favourite topic, it is the one he raises most often.  In this instance I do not propose to accept the amendments.  Amendments Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, deal with the definition of related enactment.  A related enactment, for the purposes of the Bill, includes any Act or statutory instrument under which ComReg has a function.  The other amendments relate to regulations to be made under section 46A of the principal Act, as inserted by section 14 of the Bill.  As the Bill states, any regulation made by me is required under section 3 of the principal Act to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may within 21 sitting days be subject to an annulling resolution passed by either House.  In deference to the Deputy's efforts to include such a provision in legislation on other occasions, I advise him that this requirement is also being extended to regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972, under proposals contained in the European Communities (Amendment) Bill currently passing through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In this case the Deputy's favourite topic is being met within the Bill.  Therefore, the amendments are not necessary.</p>

We can all recognise that at least there is some role for the Houses of Parliament to play in such circumstances.  I thank the Minister for his comments.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1048">"(d) by inserting the following after subsection (1)(<i>e</i>):</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1049">"(<i>f</i>) to invigilate the volumes and revenues of international and national mobile telecom services including all termination rates,“;”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">These amendments are to amend section 10 of the 2002 Act as the Minister should have further expanded the powers of the commission.  One of the difficulties the Opposition encountered in its invigilation of the Bill is the ten Acts and 15 statutory instruments which are being amended by this Bill.  I refer to three Acts which formerly were important pieces of legislation including the Communications Regulation Act 2002, the Competition Act and the Electronic Commerce Act.  The extension of ComReg's powers into co-competition and the power to prosecute anti-competitive moves in the communications market needed strengthening.  The functions of ComReg are outlined in section 10 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002.  Under this Act the former regulatory body, the Office of Director of Telecommunications Regulation, was subsumed into ComReg.  These amendments are old chestnuts which have been discussed many times during Question Time.  If the questions on broadband had been dealt with during Question Time this afternoon I would have been able to bring to the Minister's attention the latest ComReg findings but he has probably already issued a statement trumpeting that 517,000 lines have been installed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, has been informed of the widespread belief that mobile phone users are still being ripped off despite the invigilation by the Minister's Department in the past three years.  I refer to the recent European Consumers' Organisation, BEUC, report which showed the Department was not aware of the revenues being earned by the major mobile phone companies from roaming charges.  I chaired a joint committee meeting on this subject.  The information from both ComReg and the Department was gravely deficient.  This amendment seeks to give ComReg a role in the assessment of this kind of information.  ComReg quotes statistics but international indices show that Ireland shows extremely high revenues per user which are higher than in many other jurisdictions.  My amendments propose new subsections in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">Amendment No. 10 relates to the Minister's reaction to Smart Telecom's collapse six months ago.  He stated he would introduce emergency legislation to ensure that would never happen again, that no telecommunications company could cite reasons such as cash-flow problems for the withdrawal of service.  As a result of the collapse of Smart Telecom a number of businesses were left without communications on the days in question, including a number of medical practices.  The collapse of the Smart Telecom service, even for a few days, was a serious event.  My amendment No. 10 proposes an addition to the functions of ComReg to ensure that undertakings provide at least 30 days' prior notice for the withdrawal of any electronic communications service or product to end-users.  The Minister promised to do so but 30 weeks later nothing has been done except the publication of this Bill which has been a long time coming.  The Minister has not introduced any methodology for ensuring that a similar situation does not arise again.  It seems that neither ComReg nor the Department have the requisite information in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">Amendment No. 11 proposes a new function for ComReg to regulate the content, promotion and pricing information for all premium rate telecoms' services.  The premium rate telecom service industry is self-regulated by Regtel.  This amendment proposes that the functions of Regtel be absorbed into ComReg to make it responsible for the promotion and pricing of premium rate telephone calls.  The issues of content and the suitability of content, the vulnerability of children and other vulnerable users also arise and the Department and the statutory regulator should have a role in this regard.  It would be possible to establish Regtel as a statutory body under another Bill but in my view this is well suited to ComReg's functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">Amendment No. 12 proposes a Labour Party policy which has been in our policy document for the past two years and in which we believe.  It proposes to regulate a universal service obligation for all broadband undertakings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">The Minister has been promising the House for the past year that he will take action to ensure Ireland becomes completely broadband-enabled.  We seem to be very near a general election, the date of which only the Taoiseach knows.  The Minister has not taken any action.  The industry is telling the Opposition that some major announcement is imminent.  I was expecting the Taoiseach to include it in his famous rant last Saturday night when he made so many promises he might as well have promised to broadband the country and to give a universal service obligation.</p>

I assume people like the Minister and various other ambitious Fianna Fáil people when they are on these benches, as I expect them to be in eight or nine weeks, will be looking for a new figure to lead the party so Deputy Bertie Ahern will probably not have the chance to be Leader of the Opposition once more.  He might as well have promised a universal service obligation.  I refer to the ComReg report which states that broadband lines total 517,000 which means 50% of users of the Internet are using broadband which is to be welcomed.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_1067">This reflects the Government's attention to detail in respect of legislation proposed by Members on this side of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">In the 85-year history of the State, our progress to democratic principles has been largely without awkwardness.  We came through a short but bloody civil war and managed to establish institutions of State in the form of a judicial system and a publicly acceptable police force.  Within ten years of the foundation of the State, we managed to effect a change of Government by democratic means.  Ireland was the first of the post-colonial nations to do so and other colonial nations looked to its example as a template to follow in the context of how independence could be achieved and how democratic structures could be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">Our road to democratic principles has not been easy.  Part of the reason there was such calm during the early history of the State relates to the degree of influence certain institutions were allowed to have over public opinion and the unwillingness, through a lack of democratic behaviour, of the public to challenge and question that type of institutional control of democratic procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">As the nation grew up, so did its citizenry.  We have improved the nature and quality of democracy here.  There were, however, some major difficulties along the way.  The acceptance of democratic procedures that are less than perfect means that a culture under which corruption is practised and, even worse, tolerated can be brought into being.  A number of tribunals dealing with the most obvious examples of the corruption that was practised in the past are currently in operation.  There may be a need for further tribunals of inquiry to investigate whether political behaviour has always been of the highest standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">One of the reasons political behaviour has allowed corruption to be practised relates to the existence of petty levels of corruption, involving the abuse of political patronage, and the onset of cronyism.  The latter has everything to do with how we have selected people to represent, and make contributions to, public State bodies.  The overwhelming majority of those selected to serve on State bodies are individuals of ability who contribute out of a sense of public spiritedness.  However, we must make a distinction between the people who are chosen and the methods used to select them.  In terms of winning public confidence and having the highest quality of standards of democracy, the system and the process must always be beyond reproach.  Some 85 years after the foundation of the State, there is unfortunately still a perception that many public appointments are made on the basis of who one is, who one knows and on one's political affiliation.  This does not stop people of ability from coming through.  However, it does not in every instance provide the people of greatest ability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">The Bill is an attempt to make the process of public appointments more open and transparent and, by so doing, to win greater public confidence in our political system.  It is a challenge to the Government, which has been in power for ten years — the main party in the Administration has been in office for the vast bulk of the State's history — to say that the type of politics practised in the past did not necessarily serve the best interests of the country and that the time for change has come.  It is also a challenge to other parties to join the Green Party's initiative on this area of political reform.  We are on the eve of a general election that will be about the process of change.  If the election involves merely changing the names and faces of people on the benches opposite, it will be a poor day's work.  People must be offered not only a choice but a choice that leads to real change.  The Green Party believes changes in the area of political reform are most necessary to reignite public confidence in the political system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">The Bill proposes several simple measures that can help restore public confidence in the system.  It suggests that all public appointments to State bodies and agencies — regardless of whether these have validity — should, in the first instance, be approved.  We propose that an Oireachtas committee on appointments to public bodies be established.  Part of the remit of this committee would be to examine whether what any member of the Government proposes in the context of State agencies, task forces or study groups is worthy of spending public moneys, has a specific remit and is worth following through.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">The Bill also suggests that a special unit should be attached to the Public Appointments Commission.  This unit would act as a clearing house in respect of applications from people in respect of advertised positions on public bodies.  It could assess those applications and make recommendations to the relevant Minister.  Instead of, as is currently the case, exercising the gift of patronage, the latter would make nominations that would be placed before the Oireachtas committee on appointments to public bodies, which would be responsible for approving the individuals who would serve as chairpersons on such bodies and those who would comprise their general membership.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">What we propose, therefore, is a three-stage process that would consider whether a body is necessary, whether the people applying to serve on it are of the highest ability and whether the Oireachtas was fully involved in the decision to appoint it and its members following a full ratification process.  We believe that such a process would be open and transparent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">The Oireachtas should have a further role in ratifying nominations made by the Government in respect of special international appointments.  In the past, appointments to the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and a score of other bodies were referred to as "Government appointments".  We argue that those appointed in this regard are representatives of the State and that there should be a wider process of ratification in respect of them.  We suggest that the Government should make its nominations and then put them forward to be ratified by the House.  There could, if necessary, be a debate — in most cases this might not be required — and a vote.  The latter would be unlikely if the person nominated was of sufficient quality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">The prime motivation behind the introduction of the Bill is that public appointments must be seen as being other than a reward for political service, other than compensation for those who have been disappointed politically and other than an exercise of jobs for the boys.  If we can make this type of change with this legislation, the other types of necessary political reform, which form part of my party's programme for Government and which we are prepared to implement with the co-operation of others and put to the electorate for ratification, then this is a process that could help clean up Irish politics once and for all.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_487">
          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_1078">I support the work of my colleague, Deputy Boyle, in putting this Bill together.  As the House can see, from the outset the Bill was put forward in his name.  It is all pretty much his work.  Often Bills are initiated in the names of all of the Teachtaí Dála within the parliamentary party, but it is testament to Deputy Boyle's ownership of this Bill and to his capabilities to work with experts and to use his own nous that it was initiated in his name.  I say this because I do not want to take any credit for the drawing up of the Bill, except in a role of moral support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">I want to outline why the Bill is important.  We have seen numerous planning decisions in my constituency.  Nine times out of ten, whether in the case of road proposals, the Adamstown plan or appeals on Quarryvale, An Bord Pleanála has been involved at some stage.  I am not casting any aspersions on the board of An Bord Pleanála, but it is fair to say that in many instances nationwide the inspector's report tends to be overturned.  In order to ensure transparency we need boards like that of An Bord Pleanála to be appointed totally independently without any political input in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">The same would apply for any other State body such as those in the education field, for example.  In the case of a number of Bills with which I have been involved during this Government's term of office, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, has been requested to allow certain bodies representation on a board and various education partners have been requested to be on the boards concerned because of their specific skill sets.  The Minister has always stated that she retains the right to appoint and she will weigh it up on balance.  That is not good for democracy.  The Government has made many mistakes in education but the Minister is an honourable woman.  Whatever her merits or the merits of existing or former Ministers, we must acknowledge that in the 85 year history of the State there have been some crooks in office and I make no bones about saying that.  Even if there have been decent people in office who have not been under suspicion and who have had no hand, act or part in any corrupt, semi-corrupt or incompetent activities, taking such appointment decisions out of the hands of individual Ministers or the Cabinet is the safe action to take.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">Recently at my party's Ard-Fheis I pointed to the case of people who serve in public bodies acting in a private capacity.  I mentioned the former county manager in South Dublin suddenly working for Mr. Jim Mansfield and I mentioned Colm Tyndall, a local councillor, suddenly working for developer Con McCarthy, and, coincidentally, buying a house right next door to him.  These are all people trying to do their jobs in private enterprise and there should be no aspersions cast on their good character, but public bodies and public servants going to work in the private sector should be subject to some form of control.  In the case of public servants going into the private sector, my colleague Deputy Cuffe suggested a cooling off period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">This Bill is about how people are appointed to public boards.  We have seen the suspicion that has been cast on the body politic by all sorts of payments to politicians.  We have seen that people have ever less faith in the political process.  We also see anecdotally how people always refer to jobs for the boys, as Deputy Boyle mentioned, regarding appointments to boards.  Whether they be up and coming Teachtaí Dála, Senators or people who have lost their seats, it is like a pat on the head, saying well done and giving a few quid to keep him or her going.  That is not the way business should be done.  That is why we need proper prescriptive legislation, which recognises the merits of people, which allows for a process whereby an Oireachtas committee on public bodies could see whether the people nominated are of the highest ability.  Such a committee might merely involve a exercise in rubber-stamping, but only when the necessary criteria have been met and aspersions cannot be cast in respect of the persons to be appointed.  It is the correct way to do it and I wholeheartedly support my colleague's Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_488">
          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_1083">I, too, commend my colleague Deputy Boyle on this Bill.  There was an interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Saturday last.  Ms Mary Davis, who was commissioned to look into the issue of active citizenship and return with a report, which I believe is due out tomorrow, stated in that short interview, as I am sure she will reiterate tomorrow, that when they went out and spoke to the public about how they perceive political life in Ireland, they found that the public was deeply cynical by international comparison and that in a sense they see the system as corrupt.  This particularly relates to a dysfunctionality in local government.  That has a considerable crippling effect in terms of the connection between citizens and the State in the sense that one does not have real power at local democratic level, which has an effect in terms of engendering such cynicism.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">The Irish people are not stupid and they see it as it is, that the parties opposite have been so long in power that they have become corrupted by power, and that they appoint friends to bodies on the basis of medieval kings in their fiefdoms granting favours.  While in many cases, as Deputy Boyle stated, people appointed are of the highest calibre and do a significant job, giving their time selflessly to such work, the cynicism among the public about the process is well justified because the system, as applied by the parties opposite, is clearly flawed and corrupt, or certainly corruptible.  It is not just about politicians receiving favours in terms of money.  The corruption can be in giving favours as well, where one might sanction a project that might use millions of euro of taxpayers' money favouring certain private individuals against civil servants' advice and without proper planning.  Such favours and favours in terms public appointments are practices we need to stop.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">We need to restore power, respectability, involvement and role to the committees of the House.  The new committee proposed in the Bill is one that would raise the profile, stature, credibility, interest and calibre of the people who would apply for jobs on State boards.  It is utterly sensible.  It leaves the final say with the Minister, as is appropriate.  We are not saying in the Bill that we should completely take away the role of the Minister in central Government in a directly-elected Parliament to make the final say, but it would be done in the full glare of public light and full analysis of the candidate's credentials.  That can only be to the good.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">One of the other aspects of the Bill I want to commend is the review of the number of public bodies we are creating.  In various Bills I had a sense that we were setting up a public body to allow a Minister dish out an entirely new brand of favours.  There are authorities for driver testing, taxis, aviation and transport.  We could easily amalgamate those into a single authority and do away with the plethora of boards which the parties opposite seem to enjoy setting up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">Of course I also commend this Bill's requirement that the term of boards would be limited.  There are many authorities in the enterprise area.  Those in the research area include SFI, the HEA, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the IDA, FÁS — one could continue the list.  If one looks at the output, it is not evident.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">We have passed Bills  where two thirds of the provisions deal with the nice pension entitlements to be put in place for the members of the boards.  Unsurprisingly, there is always one for the Progressive Democrats and whatever number for Fianna Fáil.  That must stop.  That cushy system of cronyism is not providing us with the best possible board structure.  It is not carrying out a review of the strategic interests and vision of the people involved.  I commend this Bill as a sensible, rational and reasonable approach to putting in place properly democratic systems for a democratic State.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_489">
          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_1089">I support this Bill and concur with much of what has already been said.  Widespread cynicism exists among the public, based on people's experience of those in high places and Government appointed members of bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">I wish to speak about An Bord Pleanála, a body that merits closer scrutiny.  In reviewing planning decisions, it performs one of the most important functions of any board in this country.  We have seen the results of its deliberations on the Indaver incinerator in County Cork, where it succumbed to Government policy in allowing the project to proceed.  The board also overturned the recommendation of one of its inspectors against proceeding with the Corrib gas project.  Many similar cases can be instanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">The board comprises ten ministerial appointees.  The chair, vice-chair and two other members are representatives of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The remaining six members are supposed to be nominated by 40 panels but there has been contrivance in that regard.  I have learned from replies to parliamentary questions and through working with the Irish Rural Dwellers Association, of which I am a founder member, that two former employees of An Bord Pleanála are now members of the board as nominees of the panels.  I use the word "contrivance" advisedly and do not mean to criticise the people concerned.  The five-year term of membership expired in 2006 but the members have been re-appointed for a further five years.  Will it be the case that the entire board will be filled by former employees of An Bord Pleanála?  I welcome this Bill as a way of preventing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">Where is democracy and the will of the people?  Where is the legislation that will represent the people on the ground or re-examine a planning decision?  The board is completely filled by ministerial appointees, although ICTU has also been involved as a nominating body.  Serious questions must be asked and I see this Bill as the way forward.  An Bord Pleanála is just one example of the questions that need to be answered.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarianHarkinIND" eId="spk_490">
          <from>Ms Harkin</from>
          <p eId="para_1093">I wish to share time with Deputy Sargent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important Bill, which outlines a new procedure for appointments to public bodies.  Its introduction in advance of the general election is timely because the public will now be able to see where the various political parties stand on this issue.  While I heard a Minister express his opposition to the Bill and will have to await his arguments, it will be a matter for the next Government to implement it if it passes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">The Bill gives us an opportunity to restore public confidence in the workings of our democracy and faith in our institutions.  We would let the Irish people see that the system belongs to them rather than being the preserve of any political party or the gift of Ministers.  Appointments to public bodies should be transparent, fully accountable and public in the sense that they should be open to all members of the public.  That may be the case in theory but we are all aware it is not the practice.  There should be public ownership of the process through the appointment of a public bodies unit which would establish, monitor, approve and carry out appointment procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">The widely held perception is that appointments to public bodies are rewards for faithful service to the party, a little thank you for services rendered or a recognition of party allegiance or financial contributions.  That has not always been the case and, as has been noted by many other Deputies, there are many excellent appointees to public bodies.  Being a supporter of any political party should not disqualify a person from appointment to a public body.  However, it is also the case that appointments are often a reward for those who have supported a party in one way or another.  Is it any wonder the public is cynical?  With this Bill, we have an opportunity to change things for the better and to practise a new kind of political approach, whereby members of public bodies are appointed by merit on the basis of appropriate skills and backgrounds.  This Bill would ensure transparency in that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">Tomorrow, the Taoiseach will publish a report on active citizenship, one of his favourite topics.  Tonight is a perfect opportunity for the Taoiseach and the Government to endorse active citizenship in action.  Theory could be put into practice by demonstrating that active citizenship allows ordinary people to play a meaningful role in shaping a better society.  Those who do not support this Bill pay lip-service to active citizenship.  They tell people what they think they want to hear, using all the right words about inclusion, citizenship, community and social capital and making soothing noises about participation and consultation, but when it comes to the crunch, they keep all the power and decision-making processes to themselves and, in many cases, hand out positions on public bodies to their friends, supporters and those who can be relied on to toe the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">An example of this was the privatisation of Aer Lingus.  Where were the board members to defend the public interest in that case?  The Aer Lingus board basically acted on the wishes of the Government.  Where were the people who took the national perspective?  Aer Lingus is now in private hands, sold so cheaply that it is ripe for take-over.  Will the State, the Irish people or the shareholders benefit from that?  The shareholders or those who have the money to invest will reap the rewards.  The Irish people no longer have control over air access to this island nation and the residents of Shannon and the west of Ireland will probably pay the price for the open skies regime.  The shareholders of Aer Lingus, many of whom are not Irish, will call the tune.  This came about because the public interest was not being served.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">There will be many positive outcomes from public scrutiny and control over appointments to public bodies.  One such outcome should be better gender balance.  Several Deputies referred to jobs for the boys.  The establishment of a public bodies unit would also ensure jobs for the girls.  If those boys and girls come from the wider public and not only the select few who enjoy the favour of political parties, that would be the most positive outcome.</p>

          <p eId="para_1100">Tá áthas orm deis a fháil labhairt an an mBille um Cheapacháin chuig Comhlachtaí Poiblí 2007.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le mo chomhghleacaithe an Teachta Boyle, a dhein an-chuid oibre chun an Bille a ullmhú.

          <p eId="para_1101">It is ironic that the Taoiseach will launch another report on active citizenship tomorrow.  I have asked him many times in the House about the manner in which people are appointed to State boards, task forces, agencies and the plethora of organisations established by the Government parties over the past ten years.  The Taoiseach does not realise that improvement is possible in this regard and he has a defeatist and almost depressing belief that nobody would like to be appointed to these bodies anyway and, therefore, he must rely on his little black book or other contacts he has to seek somebody who will selflessly take on these positions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">That argument is a sham and it is unacceptable to many people.  It would also be unacceptable to the Irish Human Rights Commission.  Its original membership comprised political appointees but, under the chairmanship of Maurice Manning, the commission decided, wisely and responsibly, at the end of its term to place an advertisement in the press seeking expressions of interest.  This was followed by fundamental reform of the way in which appointments to the body are made.  That is from where the Green Party is coming.  Change is needed urgently in the appointments process so public confidence in the political process can be restored and a level of accountability brought to bear on organisations working on behalf of the people, which in many cases have large budgets comprising taxpayers' money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">The Government parties have made more than 6,000 appointments to various bodies over the past ten years.  The manner in which such appointments are made should be examined to improve the way in which they are assessed.  Currently, there is a lack of assessment and it is difficult to know the criteria for membership sometimes, although it is obvious in other cases given the background of the person and the skills they bring to the position.  We do not seek to reinvent the wheel but in the UK, Canada, New Zealand and other jurisdictions, the process involved in such appointments has been examined and improvements made.  New Zealand officials examined the plethora of task forces that had been appointed to bring about what they call "deagencification".  That is the first time this word has been used in the House and New Zealanders are ahead of us in this regard.  They are rationalising the number of task forces.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_1106">That is another big word.  The Minister of State should get to grips with decentralisation first and then he can move on to the New Zealand model.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">Unfortunately, as we discussed during Taoiseach's Questions earlier, we have a legacy to deal with in this regard.  The various tribunals of inquiry have highlighted the aloof manner in which appointments to State bodies took place.  Former Deputy Ray Burke made a number of appointments to An Bord Pleanála, which came back to haunt him, and we are all the worse off for that.  It is not possible even today to establish clearly the criteria under which appointments to bodies such as An Bord Pleanála are made.  For example, an individual appointed to the Environmental Protection Agency was a former employee of an incineration company.  Given the remit of the agency, that appointment did not add to the organisation's objectivity and impartiality because procedures were not in place to remove any doubt about a motivation that was less than honourable.  That leaves question marks, which does not do the body politic any good nor is it good for public confidence in politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">At the same time, when one seeks to investigate appointments, a number of the bodies are not covered by freedom of information or Ombudsman legislation and we are left with more questions.  This is important in the context of questions being raised by school boards of management through the State.  On the one hand, appointments are made to prison visiting committees with the only criterion being that the person must live many miles away from the prison to be visited so he or she can benefit significantly from the mileage allowance that can be garnered from the work involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_1112">Boards of management will need to seek volunteers from the end of this year because those who volunteer will have to accept legal liability for abuse, misdemeanours and other problems that may arise following staff appointments to the schools for which they have responsibility.  On the other hand, appointments to other bodies are made on the basis of political patronage which, in many cases, involves medieval handouts in the tradition of gifts and favours for whatever was rendered by the appointees in the past or for loyalty to the party.  Volunteers to boards of management usually are the parents of the children attending the school and they give their time and expertise so they can help their children.  They must also pay for training courses so they are updated on legislation relating to the work environment, appointments procedures, health and safety and so on.  The contrast is stark and it is an absolute disgrace the Government is telling them that they will be legally liable for any problem in their school as a result of appointments made by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">In considering this legislation, I ask the Government to address the injustice it is visiting on school boards of management.  They are wondering how they will be able to continue and find volunteers to fill vacancies when their terms end and how they will be able to run schools, which are the responsibility of the State and not of the parents who are doing their best to help a Government which is not prepared to pull its weight.  Unless this is addressed, Government Members will be reminded of this injustice on the doorsteps by people who will say it is unacceptable for a Government to walk away and place liability for problems that may arise as a result of staff appointments in the hands of volunteer parents who are doing their best for their children.</p>

          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_1116">Before discussing the Bill in detail, I should note that Ireland is fortunate to have a strong tradition of public service whereby many people with proven abilities give the very best of their talents, experience and energy to lead, direct and account for their stewardship in demanding roles in key public agencies.  On making appointments or nominations, the Government carefully considers the attributes of the persons selected in the context of the requirements of the post.  The practices and procedures adopted by the Government follow those adopted by its predecessors.  A strong public sector has evolved from these procedures that delivers effectively a range of public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">The House must be mindful of the enormous contribution made by such people and refrain from putting in place procedures that would serve to deter rather than attract people to positions on public bodies.  A recent study carried out by the Institute of Public Administration, "The Corporate Governance of Agencies in Ireland — Non Commercial National Agencies", identified 601 agencies operating in Ireland.  This figure gives the House some idea of the scale of the contribution to public service made by people appointed to public bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">I will comment on current arrangements to clarify for the House the robust procedures that are in place.  The arrangements for the composition of and appointments to the boards of State bodies are usually set out in the legislation establishing such bodies.  Usually, such appointments are made by the Minister with responsibility for the body in question, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Ministers must consider the merits of their appointees and must ensure they have the appropriate skills and experience for their appointments.  Ministers are answerable to this House for such appointments.</p>

          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_1120">I make no apology for such a system, which has been tried and tested and has been shown to work.  Approximately 500 public bodies have boards and as many such boards have up to ten or 12 members, it can be seen that the numbers involved are large.  A vast range of experience, skills and background is required to ensure the composition of the board of each body is appropriate.  A balance must be struck in the composition of boards, which require qualities including sectoral knowledge, business experience, technical expertise or the representative voices of those served by a particular organisation.  In some cases the legislation establishing the body in question might also specify worker representation or that elected representatives, Departments, local authorities or sectoral bodies be represented on boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">Ministers must have flexibility to choose members of boards.  The range of skills and experience required for the board of a major commercial State company is significantly different to that required for a small, regulatory body of the kind of which there are several under the aegis of, for example, the Department of Health and Children.  A Minister with sectoral responsibility for such bodies will be aware of the needs of these organisations and is best placed to approach those who he or she considers most suited for the board in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">It is normal commercial practice for the shareholder to nominate the board to look after the shareholder's interests.  In the case of commercial semi-State bodies, the Minister with financial responsibility for the area will nominate people to the board while taking account of the type of company involved.  The Minister for Finance as shareholder or joint shareholder is consulted on the nomination.  I do not see anything wrong with the existing system and the success of the commercial State bodies over the years supports the view that the boards nominated by various Governments have worked well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">Deputy Boyle's Bill does not have due regard for the nature of State bodies in Ireland.  State bodies report to the Minister who has sectoral responsibility for them and the relevant joint committees of the Houses already have authority, if they wish to exercise it, to call before them the chairmen and top management of each State body.</p>

          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_1125">In most cases such bodies are established by legislation, which also sets out a range of functions and responsibilities possessed by the Minister and the parent Department, as well as the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance.  In most cases these include the functions to be performed by that body, the submission of annual reports and accounts, borrowing, pay and pension matters, recruitment of staff, increases in fees or prices, as well as a range of other matters peculiar to individual bodies.  Ministers also set out the general policy to be followed by individual bodies.  When all such matters are considered, it seems extraordinary that one would contemplate removing from the Ministers, who are obliged to perform this large range of functions, the power to choose and appoint the boards and chairpersons of these bodies, which are essential to ensuring adherence to the Minister's general guidelines and the State body's responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">This aspect is one of the great strengths of the present system, namely, that Ministers can approach those who they consider to have the qualities necessary for the bodies under their aegis.  In many State companies, there are men and women with vast experience in business or other areas of life who have been willing to accept positions on the boards primarily out of a sense of public duty.  I very much doubt whether many such people would wish, as proposed by Deputy Boyle, to reply to advertisements and to go through a competition for positions.</p>

          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_1128">Such an approach is appropriate for employing people within organisations rather than the appointment of those who are to be directors or chairpersons of State bodies, which is fundamentally different to full-time employment.  Is it credible that senior, experienced professionals and business people, who have already created a successful career in the private sector would wish to go through the processes that would be required under this Bill?  In many cases such people have numerous demands on their time and while they may be willing to respond positively to a request from a Minister, they would be unwilling to put their name forward as if applying for a job.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">Tapping the experience of business people has been useful to the public sector especially in the area of State companies but also in advisory capacities.</p>

          <p eId="para_1131">A number of advisory groups have advised Government on future policies and strategies over the years, including various groups devoted to industrial policy, competitiveness and aspects of social policy.  In addition, groups such as the National Economic and Social Council have helped by giving advice and have contributed to overall development.  This Bill would deprive us of access to knowledge and experience that is needed in the public sector and that has proven useful in the Public Appointments Service in State companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">I also point out that once a prospective board member accepts an offer of a position on a board, he or she is subject to the requirements of a range of legislation and guidelines, most notably the Ethics in Public Office Act and the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The code of practice sets out guidelines to seek to ensure that public bodies are run to the highest possible standards.  It is not a prescriptive list as to how the body should be run but rather it seeks to guide bodies and their boards to ensure that best practice is followed and that the requirements of other guidelines or legislation are adhered to.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">In October 2001, the Minister for Finance issued the code of practice for the governance of State bodies to his fellow Ministers for promulgation within the various State-sponsored bodies under their aegis.  The purpose of the code is to provide a governance framework within which the internal management and internal and external reporting relationships of State bodies is to take place.  This code was formally approved by the Government, which had decided that it should be binding on all State-sponsored bodies.  The code consolidates the various initiatives, both within the Irish public sector and more generally, which had been taken between 1992 and 2001, to enhance corporate governance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">The framework within which boards must operate is effectively set by the code.  It sets out clearly the Government's expectations in this regard.  It also provides board members with an invaluable instrument against which to measure their actions.  The code of practice is far-reaching in its scope and stresses the need for appropriate codes of conduct for directors and employees and that these should be in written form.  A template is set out in the code to guide bodies in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">It also requires that in respect of internal audit, all State bodies must have a properly constituted internal audit function or engage appropriate external expertise.  The code also refers to the procurement and disposal of assets and states that competitive tendering should be normal procedure in the procurement process of State bodies and that national and EU public procurement rules applicable in the public sector should be complied with.  The code also provides that the disposal of assets above €70,000 must, as a rule, be done by competitive tendering or auction.  As with all the provisions, any exceptions to this procedure must have the consent of the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">The code also deals with how diversification of activities, the establishment of subsidiaries and acquisitions by the body should be dealt with.  In such cases, the establishment of subsidiaries and the acquisition of shares are subject to the relevant Minister's approval given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  As for value for money, it places an emphasis on the need for appropriate investment appraisal and requires that all State bodies must comply with the guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure that were issued by the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">Moreover, in respect of remuneration and directors' fees, the code requires that all State bodies must implement Government policy on the remuneration of chief executives, managing directors, directors and other staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">Strategic and corporate planning is also mentioned and requires that annual rolling five-year plans be produced.  The plans, reflecting the shareholders' objectives and strategic mandate, are to be approved by the board.  The code requires that all State bodies should be tax compliant and not engage in any offensive tax avoidance transactions.  The code also sets out a framework for best practice for corporate governance in State bodies and principles for quality customer service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">Extensive though this list may seem, it cannot deal with all situations which may arise.  Directors and employees of State-sponsored bodies and their subsidiaries are advised in the code that it is primarily their responsibility to ensure all their activities, whether covered specifically or otherwise in the code, are governed by the ethical and other considerations implicit in the code.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">Membership of the board of a State body is not a sinecure.  It is a demanding role.  The stringent requirements imposed by the Government under the code of practice bring with them significant responsibilities for all directors.  This means a high degree of accountability is associated with board membership which is as it should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">In the area of corporate governance and public bodies generally, I would like to say a few words on the developments that have taken place in the last number of years.  The Government's commitment to enhancing overall corporate governance, including within the State bodies that have company status, is evident in the legislative and structural changes that have been introduced since 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, established in 2001, has a mandate to improve the compliance environment for corporate activity in the economy by encouraging adherence to the requirements of Companies Acts and bringing to account those who disregard the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">The Standards in Public Office Commission was also established by the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.  The commissioner is responsible for supervising the implementation of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 as they apply to office holders such as Ministers, the Attorney General, special advisers to Ministers, senior civil servants and designated directors and executives of prescribed State bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">The Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 also have implications for directors.  The ethics Acts require the directors of these public bodies to provide annual statements of interests to a nominated officer of the body, such as the chairperson of the board or the company secretary.  The statements of interests must also be given to the Standards in Public Office Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">The type of interests disclosed include details of occupations, shares, other directorships, land, travel or accommodation services provided at less than the commercial price, public service contracts and gifts.  Directors can also voluntarily disclose other interests not listed in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">If a director needs to carry out a task and discovers he or she has a material interest in this task, the director must inform the other directors of this interest.  The director must not perform the task unless compelling reasons exist to do so.  If this is the case, the director must inform other directors and the standards commission of the compelling reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">The standards commission is also responsible for the publication and distribution of codes of conduct.  The codes are drawn up following consultation with the standards commission.  A code of conduct for designated directors and holders of designated positions in the wider public service is being prepared.  Consideration is being given to developing separate codes of conduct for the commercial and non-commercial sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">The standards commission acknowledged concerns at the proliferation of different types of codes, statutory and administrative, which are emerging in this area.  State bodies are subject to the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, published by the Minister for Finance in October 2001, which includes a code of ethics.  In addition, some statutory bodies were established under legislation which provides for codes of conduct specific to those bodies. The danger of confusion as to the relevant provisions of such competing codes, and even the possibility of conflict between the codes, is evident.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">The standards commission notes that section 10 of the 2001 Act provides that a code of conduct drawn up under the Act shall indicate the standards of conduct and integrity for the persons to whom it relates in the performance of their functions and with regard to any matter connected with or affecting or likely to affect such performance and with regard to such other matters, if any, as may be specified in the code.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">Tonight, we are asked to adopt this Bill as proposed by Deputy Boyle.  However, the Bill is not workable, necessary nor adds value and indeed it fails on all those aspects.  The fact is that the current system works and has done so over time.  It may not be a perfect system but no system is.  The Bill proposed is heavy handed and bureaucratic and would make it difficult to recruit appropriate people to State bodies and advisory groups.</p>

          <p eId="para_1152">The proposals in the Bill include the establishment of a public appointments unit in the Office of the Commission for Public Service Appointments.  This would be responsible for monitoring, approving and carrying out appointment procedures to public bodies.  Section 8 of Deputy Boyle's Bill includes a proposal to establish a new joint Oireachtas committee on public appointments.  Among other duties, it would decide which public bodies and special appointments would be covered by the new procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">The Bill purports to include all executive bodies, advisory bodies and taskforces within its remit.  In excess of the 500 to 600 bodies and agencies would fall to be considered by the Oireachtas committee for the purposes of deciding which should come within the remit of the Bill, a considerable task by any reckoning.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">In addition to this, section 10(1) of the Bill states the joint Oireachtas committee "shall carry out a review of all procedures in place for the appointment of chairpersons and board members of existing public bodies and establish a listing of those appointments which should henceforth come under the new procedures set out under this Act within one year".  In my view the proposals would impose a disproportionate administrative task on any Oireachtas committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155">In addition the joint Oireachtas committee is left in the dark about the criteria to be used to select the bodies to come within the remit of the Act.  This is despite the fact the public sector comprises organisations which are both commercial and non-commercial in character, in other words bodies which do and do not derive the bulk of their revenue from trading and commercial activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156">The procedure set out in section 6 of Deputy Boyle's Bill for appointment to public bodies would involve the establishment of a public appointments unit in the Office of the Commission for Public Service Appointments which would be responsible for monitoring, approving and carrying out appointment procedures to public bodies.  Under section 11(1) the public appointments unit would be required to draw up a code of practice to govern the appointments to public bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">The principles applying to the code are set out in section 11(2).  Subsection (<i>f</i>) states the principle that all public appointments would be advertised.  The lack of proportionality of such a provision illustrates the lack of a commonsense approach being taken in this Bill.  Not only would recruitment be by open competition under section 13(1) of the Deputy’s Bill, but the appointments would then be subject to ratification by the Oireachtas joint committee.  This appears to be an additional layer of unnecessary delay imposed on an already unwieldy and lengthy process which lacks the proportionality already mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">Sections 17 and 18 of the proposed Bill provide that the chairpersons would be answerable to the Oireachtas joint committee and may be dismissed by them upon recommendation of the relevant Minister.  In my view it is not appropriate to deal with the dismissal of a chairman or board member in the context of this Bill.  The dismissal of board members is a matter for another context and must take into account fair procedures and natural justice.  The inclusion of provisions on dismissal in the manner outlined suggest a lack of understanding of the public service ethos on which we rely to fill positions on boards of public bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159">I reiterate the Government is committed to strong and effective corporate governance of our public bodies and has put in place a code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The code is kept under review in consultation with all stakeholders.  In my view, the proposals from Deputy Boyle will make the job of improving corporate governance in our public bodies more difficult to achieve by deterring rather than attracting candidates of the calibre needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1160">I am satisfied the accountability of bodies to Ministers and the House through the committee system is satisfactory.  As I stated, the proposed Bill is cumbersome and would not improve the system.  I am satisfied that current arrangements for appointments to various State bodies and groups are workable, practicable and help recruit people from whom the public service benefits.</p>

          <p eId="para_1188">Fine Gael is in favour of giving this Bill a second hearing and will support it.  We think it has much merit.  For example, openly advertising positions for State boards is a good idea with much merit.  Recent experience with other bodies has shown surprising people with fantastic skills coming forward to offer their services to the State free of charge.  That is worthwhile and such events will open up a gamut of people with experience and skills who can be of benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">People would need to have the required skills for the boards and an independent assessment would be required.  There should be a procedure for any of the appointments, and this is an aspect of the Bill which should be added to with relevant sections.  We must consider who will be ultimately responsible for any of these measures.  A body or person should be accountable to this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190">In this context we feel strongly that there must be ministerial responsibility.  We can consider what has been done as a State over the past number of years.  Over a long number of years, we as politicians have given away our responsibility.  For example, there is the case of the National Roads Authority.  There was a time when the Minister was responsible for deciding the allocations for specific roads, the roads that needed to be worked on etc.  The Minister now hands over a bunch of money to the NRA and it decides where it is to be spent.  If the Minister is asked a question about spending of NRA money, he or she will state the Minister has no responsibility in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">When it comes to cutting tape on a particular road, the Minister would suddenly have responsibility and be the one who delivered all the goodies.  A Minister cannot have it both ways and we as politicians should not be handing away responsibility.  We should be answerable to the people.  A section of the Bill would make the Minister ultimately responsible but the context of the Bill implies he or she may not be.  I am concerned about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192">To continue on the trend of giving away our responsibility, we can consider the shambles we have created with the HSE.  If a question is put down to the Minister about an issue in the health service across the country we get back an anodyne response stating it is not the responsibility of the Minister.  The matter is passed on to the HSE, which answers in due course.  A letter might be received in three to ten weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193">Some of the matters are urgent.  For example, in Tullamore a brand new hospital is being built but they are knocking down part of it already.  Did the Minister of State know that?  It is in his constituency.</p>

It is a brand new building that has never been occupied.  Taxpayers' money has been used putting it there and for digging it out again and knocking it, and taxpayers' money will be used to rebuild the new parts.  What kind of planning is that?</p>
          <p eId="para_1200">If we ask the Minister about it she will state it is not her responsibility but the responsibility of the HSE.  That has happened.

          <p eId="para_1202">It is another case demonstrating how we as politicians have handed over responsibility to other bodies to do the work for us and be responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203">We do the same in all sorts of other areas.  For example, the Road Safety Authority deals with a crucial issue.  We have again given over responsibility to somebody else.  The authority does excellent work in issuing reports and the chairperson goes on radio and television telling us what needs to be done.  A former chairperson was so disgusted with the lack of delivery from the Minister that he resigned, despite him doing a good job, a fact agreed across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">Who took responsibility in that case?  Instead of the Minister, who is responsible to this House, responsibility was hived off to the Road Safety Authority and its chairperson.  Is it not absolutely crazy that we hive off all these responsibilities?  The taxi authority is another example of a body where somebody else has taken responsibility.  Does that make sense?</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">We were elected to this House to take decisions and be answerable primarily to this House and to the electorate.  What are we doing?  Much of the time we are doing our damnedest to hand over responsibility to somebody else.  There is a whole list of examples.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206">Some people who spoke earlier on the Bill are a little confused.  Deputy Cowley spoke at length about An Bord Pleanála and was fairly critical of the body.  He stated that in some instances An Bord Pleanála went along with the reports of its inspectors and in others the board went against the decisions of the inspectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207">Curiously, he stated that some members of An Bord Pleanála were former inspectors and that he was against their appointments to the board, but would those appointments not have been good?  Given that the people used to be inspectors, they had learned the ropes and knew what it was like to have their reports accepted, rejected or queried, would they not be in a strong position to be able to judge fairly what was occurring in a particular sector?  I was surprised to hear that criticism.  It makes sense that a person who went through the ropes would make good decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1208">Deputy Sargent, the leader of the Green Party, discussed school boards of management.  Was he suggesting boards should advertise for people with the necessary skills?  I hope not.</p>

          <p eId="para_1210">The local communities want control of their boards of management to remain local.  They know who they want on the boards and there are strict controls in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211">We need to clear up the confusion in respect of some appointments and what is proposed in the Bill goes a long way towards clearing out some of the problems.  It is akin to the system governing the appointment of judges, which was introduced in 1996.  When appointments to the Judiciary are to be made, judges can express interest and there is a panel of review.  It is important that at the final stages, two or three names are nominated to the Minister, who makes the final decision.  That is a good system because it gives the Minister the opportunity to determine the situation.  For example, difficulties may have arisen during the process.  It is healthy that the Minister shoulders the responsibility, as it instils public interest and confidence in what we are doing and is worthwhile.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">What would the public say if an appointment was made by a board of adjudicators?  We must know who is making the appointment.  We do business by having the Minister responsible for making the appointment.  An aspect of the Bill that must be strengthened relates to the Minister's responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213">In that context, I compliment Deputy Boyle for introducing the Bill, as it is difficult to try to draw up a Bill and get it drafted properly.  He has done a great job.  It is interesting the Bill has provoked this worthwhile discussion, during which we will hear many contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214">I want clarification on another aspect relating to appointments that is overlooked in the Bill, namely, the matter of State boards such as Bord na Móna.  Currently, provision is made for worker directors who form an integral part of the boards.  While I have not served on a State board, I know former worker directors who did excellent jobs and provided a vital input in the management of the boards.  The Bill must provide for that practice.  On the next stage, perhaps Deputy Boyle will include a section to preserve the State boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215">I am approaching my swan song in the House, as I will retire in a relatively short time.  As politicians, we must shoulder our responsibility to the House and we cannot run away from our decisions.  We must stop forming bodies and quangos and appointing all sorts of people to them.  In some cases, the people do good jobs.  In other cases, the jobs they do might not be as good.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216">Responsibility must rest with the Minister.  For example, I do not doubt that the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, will take responsibility for failing to spend €56 million in the Office of Public Works last year.  He will not blame his officials for not spending the money quickly enough, preparing the plans, upgrading Garda stations that should have been upgraded or carrying out necessary flood works or tasks in respect of public parks.  As he should, he will take responsibility for the €56 million, which could have been used, that he handed back to the Exchequer.  Let us not run down the road of giving that responsibility to someone else, such as the commissioners of the OPW, who will hide while the Minister of State says he has no responsibility for the matter.  It would not be good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">Deputy Boyle might consider another matter when he is summing up.  Some people who could do excellent jobs on State boards might not want to put their names forward in answer to advertisements.  I will identify someone who is outside the House, but he will not mind, namely, Mr. David Andrews.  A former Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Government appointed him chairman of the Irish Red Cross.  He is an ideal person for the role, as he has the contacts, management skills and intelligence to do a good job.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218">Can the Minister of State countenance a situation in which the Government is looking for a board for the Irish Red Cross?  Mr. Andrews would not send in his curriculum vitae or say he was the man for the job.  We must provide for the Minister, in the heel of the hunt, to be able to make the appointment.  If someone such as Mr. Andrews is available, he or she should be able to enter the fray rather than be excluded by virtue of the fact he or she did not answer an advertisement.  There must be flexibility.  It returns to the point I am harping upon, that is, Ministers must live up to their responsibilities.  The day of slipping out from under that responsibility and getting someone else to form a board is gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219">Fine Gael supports the reading of the Bill on Second Stage, as many of its aspects have merit.  We would like additional elements and, while section 5 relates, a firmer provision to the effect that responsibility lies with the Minister.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMulcahyFF" eId="spk_546">
          <from>Mr. Mulcahy</from>
          <p eId="para_1220">I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of the Appointments to Public Bodies Bill 2007.  I congratulate Deputy Boyle on introducing the Bill because it is important for the Oireachtas to have a genuine debate on the calibre of members on our State boards, which have important functions.   We also need to discuss the process by which they are selected.  I have always known there are many State boards, but I was staggered to learn in the Minister of State's speech there are between 500 and 600 such boards.  If we take nothing else from this debate, I propose we initiate a root and branch review of all these boards.  I do not believe 500 or 600 boards are required in a State with a population of 4 million, 5 million or even 6 million.  Each of the boards has its own office, Christmas parties, computer systems and glossy brochures.  Does Ireland need 500 or 600 such boards?  I challenge anyone to support the proposition that it does.  The introduction of this Bill is a worthwhile exercise because it facilitates a discussion on the method of appointment of people to State boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">The Government is right to oppose this Bill because it is based on a deep-seated confusion between the roles of the Executive and the Legislature.  The Executive is responsible for governing, whereas the Legislature is responsible for introducing and passing laws and reviewing and monitoring the performance of the Government.  Deputy Boyle will agree that the duty of the Government is to govern.  Semi-State bodies and boards are executive bodies, by and large, and not legislative bodies.  Therefore, it is totally appropriate that the Executive should have the direct power of appointment to such boards.  I do not suggest that such appointments should not be subject to a screening process and I welcome this Bill's proposals in that regard.  We should set out a set of criteria, including the necessary qualifications, to be followed when people are appointed to boards.  Perhaps we should provide for such positions to be advertised.  It is better for the members of these boards to be appointed by the Executive than for the Legislature to interfere in this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222">I accept my argument does not apply to appointments made to boards which are closely linked to the Legislature.  The Joint Committee on European Affairs sends delegates to COSAC, for example.  I am sure Deputies are familiar with that EU organisation, which comprises parliamentarians who are members of European affairs committees.  This House also sends representatives to the Council of Europe and the United Nations.  There is merit in the proposal to allow the Oireachtas to vet those who want to represent the Legislature on such bodies, and then to vote on the potential delegates.  It is correct that there should be a distinction between the Executive and the Legislature.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223">I was sorry to hear Deputy Paul McGrath making a clear allegation during his contribution.  He seemed to imply that many people who served on semi-State boards in the past simply did not pass muster.  I do not suggest that each of the thousands of people who have served on hundreds of boards since the foundation of the State was perfect.  Nobody is perfect and no large system of this nature is ever perfect.  I agree with the Minister of State's comment that Ireland has been extremely well served, by and large, by the men and women who have served on semi-State boards since the foundation of the State.  Many of them have given large amounts of their time for very small or no remuneration.  We should acknowledge the contributions of people at the top of their careers and the height of their professions who have given their spare time to serve on boards of this nature.  I do not believe it would be appropriate for the Oireachtas to denigrate the reputations of those people in any way by casting a pall of smoke over them.  The vast majority of those who have been appointed by Ministers to give their time to the State, for little or no remuneration, have done an excellent job.  Any objective analysis of their work over the years will prove that has been the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224">I ask the Minister of State to send a memo to the Government in consideration of an excellent proposal that is made in the Bill.  I refer to the suggestion that most public positions should be advertised.  I do not have an objection to that excellent idea.  When Ministers are considering appointments to boards, they may be unaware of the talent that is available among the public.  I do not see why we should not advertise the availability of positions on boards.  I do not suggest the discretion of Ministers in making appointments should be fettered in any way.  Ministers should continue to be able to appoint people who do not respond to advertisements.  Deputy Paul McGrath made the compelling point that it would be patently ridiculous to require somebody of the calibre of the chairman of the Red Cross to reply to an advertisement by forwarding his curriculum vitae, when his abilities are clear to all and sundry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225">I have a problem with the proposal to establish two public bodies under sections 6 and 8 of the Bill.  As a matter of conscience, I must oppose the development of two new layers of bureaucracy.  Section 6 proposes the establishment of an appointments to public bodies unit and section 8 proposes the establishment of a Dáil committee on appointments to public bodies.  As I feel that less government is better government, by and large, I am not in favour of adding two more layers of administration to the decision-making process.  Such a measure would necessitate the recruitment of many more public servants, who would have to spend a great deal of time processing these new responsibilities.  I doubt that we would get a better result.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226">I question the constitutionality of section 19 of the Bill, which proposes that "all special appointments which are currently made by the Government to all international organisations shall be subject to a vote of approval by Dáil Éireann".  As I indicated earlier, the Constitution is based on a clear line of demarcation between the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary.  The Executive's job is to govern and the Legislature's job is to legislate.  I will give two pertinent examples of special appointments.  I refer firstly to the Government's duty to appoint somebody as Ireland's representative on the European Commission, and secondly to Mr. John Bruton, who——</p>

The Dáil should have a role in scrutinising this country's possible delegates to other parliamentary bodies.

          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_1233">These are amendments of the Communications Regulation Act 2002.  Amendment No. 12 provides for a universal service obligation for all broadband undertakings.  When will the Minister make the famous announcement, which the communication industry tells us is imminent, of a tendering process whereby the country will be broadband enabled?  It was disappointing that we did not hear this during the speech on Saturday night, although I did not hear the entire speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234">Amendment No. 13 provides for another function for ComReg, to ensure that the national broadband network is fully accessible to third party operators.  One of the common themes in the communications portfolio of the past four years has been the failure to unbundle the networks and the local loop.  We discussed the transmission network today in respect of electricity.  The Minister put forward the case that the national electricity network should be preserved as a neutrally run network with full accessibility for all operators.  This did not happen with the privatisation of the Eircom network.  Many of our citizens have great respect for the ESB as a great national enterprise and one of the companies, along with RTE, that created public service industry in Ireland.  This Government will not be trusted with handling the electricity network given the colossal failure of the communication networks.  This amendment would ensure the broadband network is accessible to third party operators.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235">Amendment No. 14 is related to a later amendment tabled by Deputy Durkan.  Each amendment is a matter about which we have had up to 12 questions over the past years.  The amendment amends the principal Act to ensure that the national communications network is maintained to the highest current technical standards in every sector of the network.  I recently received a petition from residents of Kilmoganny in the heart of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency.  The constituents were devastated by the failure of the old incumbent telecoms company, Eircom, to provide an updated broadband service.  I passed the correspondence on to the Minister.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_553">

        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_554">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_1237">This constituency is at the forefront of national endeavour and not just in hurling.  The area is bereft of broadband.  The usual excuse is that the lines are deficient because we paired lines to cope with the number of houses in the 70s and 80s on a particular line.  Why are failure levels on our network as high as 25% when the rate in Northern Ireland is 1%, according to the last ComReg survey?  ComReg and Eircom sometimes deny that failure rates are so high.  The network should be maintained to the highest standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1238">As the incumbent transmission network operator, Eircom refers to launching next generation networks.  There is a fear among telecoms companies that such next generation networks could be used as a cover to bypass unbundling the local loop.  Even where the local loop is unbundled a roadblock will still result.  An amendment along these lines should be considered.  It is a national communications network and should be maintained to the highest standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239">Amendment No. 16 provides another function for ComReg to intervene directly on behalf of end users where service contracts or the universal service obligation have been broken and to ensure compliance by undertakings with the terms of those contracts.  I am not sure which of these two Bills the Minister was present for because we debated them so quickly.  He was out of the country for the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill.  I referred earlier to the collapse of Smart Telecom.  We have also received complaints about NTL and the changes made to payment methods.  Complaints have also been made against a host of other operators.  "Liveline" dedicated a show to the difficulty for consumers in ensuring compliance with contracts.  This amendment is similar to amendment No. 10 in requiring ComReg to undertake a direct role in ensuring compliance.  The Minister may suggest that ComReg will be doing so in respect of the rest of the Bill by seeking information, calling in companies and pursuing court actions.  This role should be listed among ComReg's functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240">Amendment No. 16 arose from complaints made by Deputy Stagg in respect of provision of a landline service in new estates in Kildare North.  People had to wait more than nine months to have a landline connected.  This is unacceptable.  The last quarterly ComReg survey stated that 99% of cases were dealt with in less than 115 working days.  The previous report estimated that it took 171 working days, the best part of a year.  Under the terms of this amendment it shall be a function of the commission to ensure that any telecommunications service provider whose business includes the provision of landline telephone service shall provide such a service within three months of the receipt by that provider of a customer order.</p>
          <p eId="para_1241">People had to wait for a year in the 1970s to receive a landline.  My predecessor in the Dublin North-East constituency was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in the 1970s and invested in the communications network.  Under the current Minister's regime estates in Kildare North must wait longer than people did in the 1970s.  That is an indictment of the outgoing Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242">I refer to the community of the Black Valley in Kerry who appeared before the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  Deputies also visited the area.  A group of citizens in a particular geographical area did not receive a  basic service from the incumbent operator.  Through the period the Minister has been in office the Black Valley issue has not been resolved, despite his discussions with Deputy O'Donoghue, one of the local representatives.  My party colleague, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, has been very vocal on the matter.  Unfortunately, this matter will have to be resolved under the next Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">Amendment No. 16 seeks that providers of landlines — perhaps it will become a broadband service now — should ensure the service is provided within three months of receipt of a customer order.  This is crucial in particular for new communities such as those in north Kildare and other expanding areas in the Leinster and Munster regions, for example, and is something the Minister should adhere to.  This is a collection of what I believe would be good functions for ComReg.  Perhaps the Minister will not accept any of the amendments.  In the event, perhaps they will be the core of a better communications Bill in the next four or five years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_555">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_1244">I reiterate my support for this series of amendments on the basis that they provide for improvements in delivery of service, reliability and advancing the infrastructure of telecommunications for the future in keeping with the demands of the population.  On amendment No. 10, the withdrawal of communications services is something we have experienced over the last 12 months or so.  One of the provisions which should be specifically placed in the Bill is the obligation facing utilities involved in delivering a service to the public.  It is not good enough to say that negotiations have broken down and as a result the consumer must await the outcome.  The problem is that the consumer is not responsible, and it is not his or her fault.  The consumer has to take whatever happens whether he or she likes it or not.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245">I know the Minister will say that within the Bill certain obligations are placed on service providers to ensure we do not have any replication of what happened as regards Smart Telecom, etc.  That should be provided for specifically in the Bill, and this is the right type of legislation in which to do it.  It would serve as a warning and we should not have to visit that particular area again.</p>
          <p eId="para_1246">Regarding amendment No. 11, I have tabled a couple of similar amendments on the same issue.  We debated this at length on Committee Stage.  We also debated it at Question Time over the last couple of years.  The content of services provided by some of the modern telecommunications media is something that worries parents.  I refer to pornography, Internet grooming and so on.  Glibly, they are being told they have the control in their own hands.  Unfortunately, it is not that simple.  Parents do not necessarily have access to the means of preventing those who stalk through the Internet from making contact with their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1247">The European Commission has already expressed concern about this issue.  In supporting this amendment, I emphasise there are concerns among the general public and we need to be aware of that.  When we put down questions, they are referred to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the basis that this is a justice matter.  It is too late when it becomes a justice matter and the damage has already been done.  We have got to find a means to intervene through advanced technology to ensure that those with nefarious intent are not allowed to pursue, at their pleasure, youngsters through the Internet, the mobile telephone service, bullying or whatever.  The time has come to deal with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248">I support Deputy Broughan's amendment No. 12 on universal service obligations.  In general Deputy Broughan has covered the broadband network issue adequately.  He has reiterated what we, and the Minister, have said many times in this House over the last couple of years.  This is not a criticism of the Minister.  However, it is a fact of life that we have seen Ireland sliding, as it were, while the rest of Europe and the world has advanced towards cutting edge telecommunications technology.  This is simply because of old-fashioned ideas.  The structure was not right, something was not moving fast enough, competition did not kick in, the regulator did not have the power, the type of direction that should have been given at the appropriate time was unavailable, etc.  As a result, we can speak to the man in the moon, but there are still parts of this country where proper telecommunications cannot be installed.  It is absolutely ridiculous.  That is not a personal criticism, however, and the Minister should not take it as such, but it is a fact of life that whether we like it or not technology has advanced to an enormous extent, yet for some unknown reason we cannot adapt it to suit the situations that exist in Ireland.  This applies not only to the Black Valley, but to other parts of the country such as the midlands and along western seaboard.  It is time for somebody to intervene and tell all those involved that while they play their turf wars, others who are entitled to service have to do without.  That is not the way it should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249">I want to mention amendment No. 14 which seeks to ensure that the national communications network "is maintained to highest technical current standards in every sector of the network".  We have spoken about this so often, but sadly it is not so.  Neither is it true that the degree of investment in infrastructure has been sufficient to meet today's needs, let alone the needs of the future.  Technology has a very short lifespan.  In order to stay with the pack, let alone ahead of it as we once were, we need to upgrade and plan all the time.  That should be done every year.  A financial report must be made available to inform the Minister that not only is the technology advancing but the investment and the infrastructure generally is being lifted to meet the requirements in an area of international competition.  There is no reason a country such as ours, which is involved in the production of high technology, cannot compete with the best.  Again, I am not blaming the Minister and I am sure that were he to revisit the scene he would look at matters differently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">We set about, with electronic voting, to become the most technologically advanced country in Europe.  Of all the things to pick, that was the wrong one, because it meant interfering with our traditional version of democracy, which the people have lived with, loved and enjoyed, instead of putting the emphasis on the area which is required most, namely, investment in the actual infrastructure.  This will entail  a review of the structures and investment in those companies that are likely to provide the services in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">We shall come back to this issue again, although not perhaps in the lifetime of this Dáil.  I hope we shall all be back to engage on these matters at a later stage.  However, I would emphasise that this is an area that will justify a great deal of supervision from whoever is Minister, lest we replicate what has been experienced in the area of telecommunications.</p>
          <p eId="para_1252">Ultimately it does not seem to matter whether the consumer suffers, and that seems to be the <i>modus operandi.</i>  The consumer, as the most important party of all, is the one whom these utilities exist to service.  Profit for investment is fine and very desirable and can go hand in hand with meeting the requirements of the consumer.  The consumer, however, is the most important party, even in this highly impersonal age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253">On Committee Stage, we went into some detail on the provision of landline telephony.  The Minister is aware that counties Meath and Kildare have seen major housing developments.  Many people in these new estates cannot get access to broadband or telephone services, a situation that requires attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254">I support the amendments because they spring from a clear need that has emerged in the past few years.  This is not an attack on the Minister or the Department but it is a matter we need to resolve.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_1255">I support these amendments which cover the concerns raised by many.  If ComReg is not given the powers to tackle the problems outlined by Deputy Broughan, we will have to return with a new Bill and this process will have been wasted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">One Member referred to people bringing up their problems with telecommunications service providers on Joe Duffy's show.  It is Joe Duffy who seems to have become the champion people are seeking.  ComReg must become the champion of the consumer and have responsibility for the changes required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">As I have often said, it was a mistake to sell Eircom.  The idea behind it was that it would improve competition but it did not help the consumer.  What did the sale achieve?  We are still paying the price for the Eircom sell-off with the unsatisfactory roll-out of broadband.  A universal services obligation must be written into the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">We have all experienced the difficulties with unwanted and unsolicited text messages, telephone calls and e-mails.  Some Members referred to protecting vulnerable young people from these.  Vulnerable adults must also be protected.  For instance, a person receives a text message with football results and is forced to reply to it, for which he or she is charged both times.  They have entered a cycle where they are charged very high rates.  It is difficult to break out of such a cycle.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">Every time one turns on the computer, one is bombarded with spam e-mails.  I do not know how many times I have received an e-mail informing me I am a millionaire, having been the 999,999th person to log on.  We may laugh at it but some people are conned by it.  I do not know how many times I have received a message requesting me to lodge a sum into one bank account to receive a larger amount.  It plays on people's greed and naivety.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">Deputy Broughan's amendments will strengthen the Bill and provide the telecommunications champion people want.  During the recent events involving Smart Telecom, a man whose son was dying of cancer and who needed to keep in contact with the hospital contacted me over the difficulties he was having just getting a telephone switched back on.  The problem dealing with monolithic telephone companies is they give many excuses but no one seems to be able to make a decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261">It is a scandal that many new housing estates have no telephone or broadband services.  It is not acceptable that people must wait nine months for a telephone line.  Various excuses are made such as the lines have not yet been rolled out in the area or works on improving the service are ongoing.  That is due to the sell-off of Eircom.  E-mail, broadband and telephone lines are basic necessities if we want to encourage people to work from home and see new business develop.  These amendments would strengthen the Bill.</p>

          <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1262">The intention of amendment No. 9 is that the development of the mobile telephony sector should be monitored and provide a basis for intervention.  The framework regulations, which transposed the framework directive in 2003, have already set out the procedures for the imposition of specific obligations in the electronic communications sector.  All interventions must be evidence-based.  The regulator has to complete an analysis of the relevant market, the results of which have to be notified to the European Commission along with the measures intended to be imposed to address any competition problems which have been identified.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263">ComReg already has the power to collect the information required for the conduct of such tasks.  It also has the power to require the provision of information for reporting on general market developments.  Subject to statutory requirements and confidentiality, it publishes a quarterly report on the communications market.  Amendment No. 9 is, therefore, not necessary.  I accept Deputy Broughan's intent in tabling this amendment.  We had a number of discussions on this matter during the Smart Telecom crisis.  This amendment would introduce an unnecessary rigidity into commercial negotiations and could end up being detrimental to an operator experiencing temporary financial difficulties with negative consequences for its customers.  That is not the Deputy's intent.  I appreciate the concerns he may have, which I share, to safeguard the protection of consumers.  What happened in the case of Smart Telecom last year was unacceptable.  Subsequent to that crisis, Deputy Broughan said I did not do anything about this matter but I did.</p>

          <p eId="para_1267">The commissioners examined the matter at my request and decided they could handle it without causing too much damage in the market by putting a protocol in place to help protect customers should a similar situation arise in the future.  That protocol seeks to manage the risks associated with such a situation and to try to minimise disruption to customers.  There was no statutory provision at that stage required for this protocol.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268">I listened carefully to what Deputy Broughan said on this matter and I discussed it again with my officials.  To strengthen the protocol in place, I propose to request ComReg to make it a condition of an authorisation that all operators granting wholesale access to other operators to their networks or products would be obliged to give ten days notice to ComReg of an intention to withdraw such access or product.  That would enable ComReg to engage with the operator concerned to try to minimise disruption to consumers.  I am advised that no legislation is necessary to do that.  ComReg has those powers and I intend to ask it to use them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1269">Regarding amendment No. 11, neither the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources nor the Communications Regulator, ComReg, has a role with regard to content.  The regulation of premium rate services is the responsibility of Regtel, which is a self-regulatory industry body that authorises and supervises the content and promotion of premium rate telecom services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270">What is at issue in recent coverage of premium rate telecom services is not primarily the product or the service on offer but rather the nature of the contract between the retailer, which in these cases is not a mobile phone operator, and an individual consumer.  The second issue is the question of the sales practices involved.  This is not an area of responsibility for the Department.  It is an area of consumer protection within which Regtel operates.  It falls under the remit of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the National Consumer Agency.  Therefore, two bodies are responsible for this area.</p>

In addition to that, the Data Protection Commissioner also has some strong investigatory and prosecution powers with regard to unsolicited electronic communications for direct marketing purposes.</p>

          <p eId="para_1274">On amendment No. 12 on the universal services obligation in the electronic communications sector, this is provided for under the European Communities (Electronic Communications) (Universal Service and Users' Rights) Regulations which came into force in 2003.  These regulations do not include broadband services as an obligation.  The European Commission reviewed the scope of the universal service directive the year before last and concluded that broadband need not be required as an obligation under it.  The Commission examined the technological market and social developments affecting consumers of e-communication services before concluding that broadband Internet services do not fulfil the criteria for inclusion in the scope of a universal service as the current level of take-up does not meet the criterion of use of the service by a majority of consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1275">Universal services in the communications area is a safety net for those whose financial resources or geographical location do not allow them to access the basic communication services that are already available to the great majority of citizens.  Broadband does not yet have the ubiquity that would warrant a universal service obligation.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_1279">This is already legally mandated.  Responsibility for the promotion and regulation of local loop unbundling lies with ComReg under section 10(4) of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and the transposed EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services.  Access to Eircom's or any other operator's network is governed by the directives that comprise the EU regulatory framework and in particular the access directive.  ComReg can impose access obligations on an operator on foot of a finding of significant market power in an appropriately defined market and any such finding is subject to the approval by the European Commission.  The Bill allows the Minister to make the breach of such obligations an indictable offence with proportionate penalties.  On that basis, amendment No. 13 is not necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">Regarding amendment No. 14, the telecoms market is fully liberalised and regulated by ComReg whose objectives include the promotion of competition and the promotion of the interest of users.  In an open market decisions on investment, the provision of telecommunications services and the development and roll-out of telecommunications technology are primarily a matter for the industry itself based on commercial considerations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281">On amendment No. 15, section 10 of the principal Act, as amended, already enables ComReg to carry out investigations on its own initiative and as a  result of a complaint made by an end user or an undertaking.  However, the primary responsibility for a complaint resolution must be retained by the operator as it has the direct relationship with the consumer and every consumer is entitled to receive a minimum quality of service standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">With regard to universal service obligations, ComReg will conduct a public consultation on the setting of appropriate performance targets for the delivery of the universal service during April of this year.  Where there is a persistent failure to meet performance targets, the regulations already provide ComReg with a mechanism to take court action to secure compliance.  What Deputy Broughan's proposes in this amendment is already covered in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">Regarding amendment No. 16, it would therefore not be appropriate to impose such a mandatory requirement on all fixed line operators as suggested in this amendment.  It particularly would not be right to do it in primary legislation.  Eircom, however, as the designated universal service provider is obliged to satisfy any reasonable request for a land line and ComReg has set out the guidelines for the timescales in meeting the requests for connections.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">I will deal with the other questions raised on the roll out of broadband.  Apart from the work being done by the Department and the Government on the roll-out of the metropolitan area networks, the steering group was set up in my Department in association with ComReg at the end of last year and it is finalising a scheme to bring a broadband service to those parts of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.  When fully rolled out, the national broadband scheme will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from households and businesses in rural areas can be met.</p>

          <p eId="para_1286">It will be a tendering process.  It would not be advisable to come into the House and suggest we were willing to pay millions of euro to somebody to provide this service and provide them with a map showing the last 10% or 15% of the country which needs to be covered by broadband and invite offers.  It would not be very smart to intimate the amount we would pay as it might be possible that somebody would be willing to provide it free of charge or for the commercial return they might receive.</p>

The information was not forthcoming from ComReg to the joint committee and neither did the Minister's Department have the information. There is a dearth of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">I welcome the Minister's announcement about amendment No. 10 as it will bring the amendment into effect.  The proposal for ten days notice of withdrawal is a step forward.  It would be preferable if it were legislated for but I acknowledge the Minister has made a step forward and I hope the statutory instrument will be enacted speedily.</p>

          <p eId="para_1308">Amendment No. 12 is the most important of these amendments.  The EU has noted that broadband in not ubiquitous but it cannot become so if a universal service obligation is not in place.  The amendment dealing with service is important.  I observed the Taoiseach speaking about the health services when I was doing the Johnny Giles commentary on the Order of Business for RTE with the political commentators.  We commentated on the performance of Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte and the Taoiseach.  I thought the Taoiseach was living on a different planet when he was speaking about health.  Does the Minister not receive complaints about the service providers in telecommunications as Deputies Durkan and Crowe have observed?  Drastic action is required.</p>

          <p eId="para_1314">I recognise what the Minister has said about all the amendments.  For some unknown reason we seem to be burdened with a vast amount of legislation, regulations, statutory instruments and protections of all descriptions which are deemed to serve the needs of the consumer, but they have not done so.  This is the kernel of the problem.  The legislation and regulation exist but they do not suffice for some unknown reason.  They do not kick in when they are supposed to and if they do, they are ineffective.  When those of us in opposition are asked to explain what we are doing about the situation, we explain we are doing all we can do in the House because we must bring the matter to the attention of the Minister and the Minister replies that it is already provided for.  I do not want to repeat what I said earlier but I am not sure that it is provided for or that the system works adequately.  Obstacles continually arise in respect of the delivery of services.  I wish to emphasise that customers deserve some degree of service and that they have a right to harbour reasonable expectations when entering into contracts.  Operators inform their customers that if they do not pay, the service will be discontinued.  What is the position when, through no fault of the customer, the service disappears?</p>

I take on board Deputy Broughan's point that when customers contact companies they are transferred from Billy to Jack.  Such behaviour is not acceptable.  This matter should perhaps be raised more frequently with the National Consumer Agency.  I will take it up with the telecommunications companies, one or two of which are worse than others.  My Department raised this matter on previous occasions.  I also intend to bring it to the attention of ComReg because this is an area which should be monitored.  People are entitled to a service.  However, they are also entitled to be treated with a level of civility when that service does not reach the required standard.</p>

          <p eId="para_1420">Amendment No. 21 seeks to insert the following: "(<i>c</i>) the level of investment required to provide the level of service expected”.  This relates to the need to ensure ongoing investment in the infrastructure so it is upgraded in keeping with the requirement of the services expected by the community.  We have discussed at length on Committee Stage the need to recognise the interests of the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1421">Amendment No. 22 deals with the necessity for regular upgrades to infrastructure, a matter which Deputy Broughan and other Members have raised in the past.  There is little sense in crying about the dark if the ways and means are available to light it.  If insufficient investment in upgrading infrastructure is the cause of the failure to provide the level of service expected by consumers, we should address the issue by making legislative provision for upgrades.  The Minister will say the legislation already makes sufficient provision for this but unfortunately the issue has not been addressed despite the existing legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1422">Telecommunications services are being exposed to competition, deregulation and different circumstances to the monopoly and direct State involvement of the past.  We will have to face similar issues in respect of other utility services and it is important to decide how best to proceed.  We should be certain the financial structures are correct, service providers are capable and the utility service is used as a service deliverer in the first instance and not solely as an investment project.  It should operate in the interests of consumers, be they commercial or domestic.</p>
          <p eId="para_1423">Amendment No. 23 provides for similar matters.  With regard to amendment No. 24, I referred earlier to the need for modern infrastructure.  Technology has a short lifespan, so it is necessary to modernise on a regular basis.  I do not want to revisit our discussions on the last group of amendments, in which we referred to places such as the Black Valley, but there are similar problems in other parts of the country.  Given recent technological advances, it is not credible to have telecommunications blackspots.  I thought it was possible to do anything with modern telecommunications, which is what the experts tell us.  It was technically possible to provide broadband services throughout the country three years ago but they were not put in place.  The technology is available to provide a high quality service similar to that in the parts of Europe which have passed us by.  I do not blame the Minister or his officials for that because we have not yet become accustomed to the changes which have taken place in this country's systems.  In the US, these services have been provided for many years by putting the onus on the service provider to develop strong company structures and by fostering competition.  An integral part of competition is that the customer benefits from lower prices and continuity of service.</p>

        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_597">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_1424">Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 are in my name.  In the three or four years since the establishment of metropolitan area networks, MANs, I have put parliamentary questions on a number of occasions to seek essential information about them.  However, the Ceann Comhairle has ruled nearly all my questions out of order on the basis the matter is not directly in the Minister's remit.  With MANs, the previous Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, seems to have begun a process, which the current Minister is continuing, of establishing a second national communications network.  This has arisen from the mistakes made in the sale of the Eircom.</p>
          <p eId="para_1425">Like my colleagues, I regularly meet e-net, the company which won the contract to run MANs, and know Mr. Conal Henry and his colleagues.  It is an efficient organisation and its turnover is increasing with the lighting of additional MANs.  When the previous Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, announced MANs, he planned to introduce the service to 123 towns with populations of 1,500 or more.  That number currently stands at 27 in the first group for which e-net won the tender.  The company has lit the bulk of those projects and is currently trying to sell space on them.  It has been successful at doing so in some parts of the country.  However, the question arises of what happens to the second phase of MANs.  Is the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, going to do anything about this before he leaves office?  The total cost of MANs thus far is up to €120 million.  He announced a tendering process for 100% broadband enablement but what will be the cost of meeting the demands?  A range of important national decisions on MANs remains to be taken.  I am aware of e-net's goodwill in terms of reporting to Deputies and spoke with representatives of the company as recently as last Friday about its current performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1426">People might say at some point in the future that MANs resembles the genesis of a new national communications network.  It arose because the Minister's predecessor, Senator O'Rourke, made a grave error with regard to Eircom from which we have never recovered.  We sold the network.  MANs has been likened to a big stick which we hold over Eircom to make it perform as if it was still a national asset.  However, is a lot of money not being spent on this big stick?  According to the Ceann Comhairle's interpretation of Standing Orders, the Minister cannot report to Deputies on the progress of MANs, even though €100 million in taxes is being spent on the project.  It is now beginning to make an impact on communications but reporting to this House should be first and foremost.  E-Net told me it would be happy for the Minister to report to the House on MANs.  I hope such reports will be accessible to Members of the 30th Dáil because MANs has become a major national asset and we should know how it is progressing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1427">Amendment No. 20 is similar to my earlier amendment on mobile telephones and termination rates.  According to the Minister, we will get the relevant information under the 2003 legislation.  Through no fault of their own, the Department and the regulator do not have the information.  When the phrase "termination rates" is mentioned to mobile telephone operators, they get very upset and worried.  It is akin to asking them about their internal structures or whatever.  However, the fees they charge for access to each other's networks are key drivers of revenues and profits and nobody knows what is happening, despite the Minister's comments on the previous group of amendments.  Ms Reding, the EU Commissioner, for example, found it difficult to do so.  When she issued her first proposal on roaming charges, all the powerful international mobile companies, which control three out of four such companies in Ireland, came out swinging in the <i> Financial Times</i>, <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, <i>The Irish Times</i> and <i>Irish Independent</i>.  They were upset about the investigation into termination rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1428">Both these issues should be covered by legislation.  The companies should be accountable to the Minister and the House regarding MANs expenditure, while full information should be available about mobile telephone charges so that proper assessments can be made of how companies are behaving in the context of competition.  I commend my two amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_1429">I do not propose to accept the amendments because the purpose of this section is solely to obtain information to formulate policies and plans to deal with emergencies and network security issues.  Deputy Broughan referred to MANs and his amendment regarding the provision of information on the technical and financial performance of such networks.  That is covered by way of contract between the Department and the manager of the networks, which is e-net.</p>
          <p eId="para_1430">It is proposed that information on national and international telecommunications, financial stability and investment in infrastructure can be gathered by ComReg pursuant to its functions and pursuant to section 13(<i>d</i>).  That issue is, therefore, covered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1431">With regard to amendment No. 20, the purpose of the provision of information under section 13(<i>b</i>) is to enable the Minister to formulate plans and policies to deal with emergencies and network security issues.  The information referred to in the amendment is collated by ComReg and, therefore, there is no need for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1432">The Deputy asked a number of questions about MANs.  Companies that oppose the concept generally make a case against such networks on the basis that they represent a duplication of facilities and so on.  However, these are fibre-based telecommunications networks, which are the networks of the future, because fibre, unlike copper, does not suffer bandwidth restrictions.  It is also future proofed in terms of its ability to adapt to new technologies.  The Deputy referred to convergence and increased customer demand.  A number of commentators have written nonsense to the effect that we have spent a significant amount on these networks but they are not making money.  However, they are not expected to make money in the first few years and it will take 15 years for them to pay for themselves.  MANs are a classic example of future investment and the provision of infrastructure before it might be used or in demand.  They offer bandwidth more than 100 times greater than that available currently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1433">MANs have performed another useful function, to which the Deputy adverted but to which the critics do not refer, in that they provide open access.  Anybody who wishes to access a MAN can do so, unlike other networks.  We have spent a great deal of time debating the difficulties of local loop unbundling over the past two or three years.  One of the effects of MANs is they have driven down prices in various places because they have provided competition.  I do not suggest the programme is perfect but MANs are a vital part of the telecommunications infrastructure because they will permit operators to graduate to next generation networks or NGNs, which is extremely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1434">A total of 27 towns and cities have MANs, all of which are being managed by e-net.  This company maintains, manages, markets and operates them on behalf of the State.  Phase 2 involves the construction of 90 additional networks nationwide.  Construction has started on 23 towns — approximately one third — in the north east, Galway, Longford and Donegal and it is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year along with construction works in Cork, Roscommon, Mayo, Wicklow and Fingal.  It is anticipated that the remaining MANs will be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2008.</p>

          <p eId="para_1436">Yes.  All the networks would have been constructed by now only for the many questions asked in Brussels by people who do not like the concept.  The Commission, in turn, asked the Government many questions, which we answered.  We received the all clear from Brussels from a state aid point of view but that took 12 months.  The only stipulation laid down by the Commission regarding the second phase was that there would have to be a fresh tender for the management entity.  When the new MANs come on stream, the Department will have to advertise and tender for a management services entity, which will be open to anybody to apply.  I appreciate what the Deputies are striving to do in the amendments.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1528">In page 12, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1529">"(<i>c</i>) fails to provide at least 24 hours of prior notice for the withdrawal of any electronic communications service or electric communications product to an end user.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1530">This amendment proposes an insertion into the new section 13D which concerns the power of ComReg to obtain information from a telecommunications undertaking.  It reiterates a previous amendment I wanted to make to the provisions on the functions of ComReg under the 2002 Act.  Under this amendment, an undertaking would commit an offence if it failed to provide at least 24 hours' prior notice for the withdrawal of any electronic communications service or electric communications product to an end user.</p>
          <p eId="para_1531">On Committee Stage, we discussed the definition and use of the phrase "end user" and the fact that the word "consumer" was not used.  The word "consumer" is used later in the Bill and I wondered whether an ambiguity or discretion arose through the use of both.</p>
          <p eId="para_1532">We also discussed the collapse of Smart Telecom.  When ComReg was before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, it stated that although it was aware of the difficulties for a number of months, it was not aware during the days prior to the collapse, which were over a weekend, of how serious the matter was.  The outstanding bills owed by Smart Telecom to Eircom were called in immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_1533">This amendment seeks at least 24 hours' notice of withdrawal of service and I asked for 30 days as a general requirement.  No business or household should be left without a service if another matter like the Eircom-Smart Telecom debacle emerged.  An interesting aspect explored in some sections of the media was the extent  to which ComReg knew and whether it should have been in a position to warn people the service would disappear.</p>
          <p eId="para_1534">While it is a re-run of the earlier amendment and in the same spirit, it is slightly different in that it is an attempt to insert the provision into the new section 13D and create an offence if a telecommunications provider unilaterally withdraws service.  The Smart Telecom situation was terrible.  References were made to people's health in the context of depriving them of a service, particularly local GPs and health centres not being able to have a communications service, which was completely ludicrous.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1547">In page 13, line 19, after "disclosure" to insert ", as defined in the Whistleblowers Act,".</p>
          <p eId="para_1548">Deputy Broughan and I did not discuss this issue and both our amendments on this matter were put down spontaneously.  Reference is made to whistleblowers and disclosure of information and evidence.  We agree that a person divulging information which could be beneficial to the consumer or industry should receive adequate cover.  I also felt a number of other protections might be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1549">One of these would be the introduction of a primary Act, the Whistleblowers Act, to which it is proposed to refer.  On Committee Stage the Minister indicated it was the intention of the Government to split the Act through the various line Departments instead of having a single Act which could be referred to as primary legislation.  I am interested in the Minister's comments on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1550">The rest of the amendments under discussion are along similar lines.  Amendment No. 28 refers to the need to ensure the information provided is not false, groundless or malicious, and we also discussed that at length on Committee Stage.  It is a protection to ensure deliberate damage is not done by a competitor, for example.  It would also protect the system, the Minister and the service provider.</p>
          <p eId="para_1551">Amendment No. 29 is in Deputy Broughan's name.  Amendment No. 30 provides that information, if sensitive, does not become public knowledge until its veracity has been established.  The reason for that amendment is that we know, for example, information has often come before tribunals which is initially quite damaging to the reputation of a person central to an allegation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1552">There would be virtually no way the person against whom the allegation is made — the accused for want of a better description — could recover the ground.  Mud thrown might well be ground lost but it would at least cause damage.  It has done so to people's reputations, and the matter has been a subject of contention in legal terms, as well as everything else.</p>
          <p eId="para_1553">Amendment No. 31 is again a reference as defined under the Whistleblowers Act.  Amendment No. 32 is something similar, and I have already spoken on the matter.</p>

        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_609">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_1554">This section is clearly welcome, amending the principal Act of 2002 to include these new sections 24A to 24C, relating to whistleblowers.  As I stated on Committee Stage, the Labour Party would have preferred if Deputy Rabbitte's Bill, which was brought before the House to Committee Stage a number of years ago, had been brought forward as a whole.  In other words, whistleblowers, in certain circumstances where it was believed serious wrongdoing was evident by a company, agency or other organisation, could speedily and safely bring the matter to the attention of the relevant authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1555">These are the kinds of developments we have had over the past 15 years of politics, from the beef tribunal through the other tribunals, including the Moriarty, Mahon and Flood tribunals.  There would have been comprehensive legislation to protect people in general terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1556">Through the years the Taoiseach and Deputy Rabbitte have had a number of discussions on this matter across the floor on the Order of Business.  The Taoiseach has indicated it is the intention of the Government to proceed in a sectoral way but this is not the right way to proceed.  We could have moved on the issue in general terms and we had legislation in Deputy Rabbitte's name and on behalf of the Labour Party which the Government thought to be fair, reasonable and adequate.  Perhaps that legislation could have been brought through.  We are left with the whistleblowers' protection through this Bill, which I welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1557">Everybody wants the whistleblower to be protected.  It is indicated in the Bill that ComReg has discretion in pursuing an investigation and would have to believe the matters brought to its attention to be serious and important.  I have sought to amend this.  In response, the Minister might argue that I am trying to narrow the grounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1558">The relevant section is 24A(2), which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1559">For the purpose of subsection (1), a person makes an appropriate disclosure of information about the conduct of an undertaking, or an associate of an undertaking or an association of undertakings only if—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1560">(<i>a</i>) the conduct relates to the provision of an electronic communications network or service or an associated facility, and...</p>
          <p eId="para_1561">That could include everything.  My addition is "where a whistleblower believes on reasonable grounds that an undertaking, an associate of an undertaking or an association of undertakings are involved in anti-competitive practices or collusion".  We should spell this out, as it is the key concern of the Bill.  Some telecommunications companies engage in the anti-competitive practices outlined in earlier amendments.  Some people have made allegations of collusion in the mobile telephone sector, which we should highlight in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1562">While whistleblowers could bring other matters to the attention of ComReg and the general public, I wanted to refer to these areas specifically.  After the Bill's passage through the Oireachtas, powers will be exercised under the Competition Authority in this regard.  From that point of view, I believed the Bill could be improved.  I would prefer a whistleblowers Act because there are many areas in which this Bill's provisions will not apply.  In local government and elsewhere, some believe the business of the people is not being carried on transparently or in an accountable way.  Anyone who wants to bring such a situation to the public's attention should be protected.  I welcome the Bill's provision, but I wanted to make a simple improvement.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_610" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_1563">The Deputies have confirmed my assumption that they were referring to the Whistleblowers Protection Bill 1999.  The provision for the protection of whistleblowers in this Bill follows a Government decision on 3 March 2006, which stated that all legislation in preparation should, where relevant, include provisions for the protection of whistleblowers.  For the purpose of this Bill, "appropriate disclosure" is defined.  Protection is offered to any whistleblower, who is generally accepted by people to be an employee who communicates to ComReg any incidence of non-compliance with the obligations under the Bill or related enactments that the person believes is occurring.</p>
          <p eId="para_1564">It is not proposed to accept amendment No. 28 because the proposed section 24A provides protection from liability for any person who makes an appropriate disclosure to the commission about the conduct of an undertaking and is designed to encourage such disclosures.  The proposed section 24C provides for a summary or indictable offence for the disclosure of false or misleading information.  The fines for the summary conviction shall not exceed €5,000 and those for the indictable conviction shall not exceed €50,000.  This provision offers protection to undertakings from malicious disclosures of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1565">The Government amendment introduced on Committee Stage enhanced the whistleblowers provision by providing that ComReg may use its discretion when information is disclosed to it.  If satisfied on reasonable grounds, it can decide not to accept or deal with the information.  For example, it would not need to act if frivolous or vexatious information was offered to it.  The provision will also offer operators protection from a disgruntled employee who might, for example, seek to disclose commercially sensitive information to ComReg.  This is in addition to the protection from mischievous claims offered by the proposed section 24C.</p>
          <p eId="para_1566">The whistleblower provision allows for appropriate disclosures to be made about any conduct relating to the provision of electronic communication network services and associated facilities.  According to our legal advice, the proposed amendment No. 29 would restrict the areas where information could be given to the commission to two, namely, anti-competitive practices and collusion.  For that reason, I do not propose to accept the amendment.  I accept that it is not Deputy Broughan's intent to restrict the obligations.  All other non-compliance with obligations under the framework would not be disclosable if the amendment were accepted.  The Deputy feared such a situation, but his amendment would have the opposite effect to his intention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1567">The proposed section 24A(2) sets out what is meant by "appropriate disclosure of information".  A person must believe the information to be true, but the onus not to make something public knowledge should not lie with the whistleblower.  The duty of care lies with the body to which the information has been disclosed and natural justice protections would apply.</p>

What is a whistleblower?  This and issues regarding vexatious claims comprised the point of Deputy Rabbitte's Bill.  For example, someone may have had a row with his or her boss or may not have been carrying out his or her work properly.  While the word is mentioned and the Bill refers to someone who makes an appropriate disclosure, what is a whistleblower?</p>

          <p eId="para_1573">Deputy Broughan is correct, but while we know what a whistleblower is, putting it into words in a Bill might have a negative effect.  We would need to define all of the circumstances in which someone might make a disclosure.  I can imagine what lawyers might attempt to do in respect of someone who discloses this type of information.  If we include a definition, the lawyers will examine it first to determine whether there is a loophole.</p>

          <p eId="para_1575">Deputy Broughan described it well in talking about how to define an elephant on paper.  Writing a definition of a whistleblower might provide someone an opportunity to argue the case.  While the information was of a nature that it should have been disclosed, people could get off on a technicality through a lawyer's argument that the person who disclosed the information did not fit the definition of a whistleblower.  It is as well to leave it as it is.  I cannot remember whether the Labour Party Bill had a specific definition.</p>

The amendment relates to the provision whereby ComReg will be required to produce an annual action plan outlining its principal planned activities and an associated annual financial forecast before the end of its financial year.  It just so happens that the commission started its activities in the middle of the year.  It is not seen as very important to change its financial year.  It would probably be more difficult to change it than to leave it as it is.  This system does not hinder ComReg's ability to plan for each year.  It could be argued that it allows the commission to base its plans on an 18-month rather than a six-month period.</p>

          <p eId="para_1592">I have tabled this amendment to try to amend the section of the Bill that proposes to insert a new Part 2A in the Communications Regulation Act 2002 which will set out regulations governing ComReg hearings.  As we had a long discussion on this matter on Committee Stage, I will refer to it briefly on this occasion.  I referred on Committee Stage to the proposed new section 38C(2) of the 2002 Act which will require people to attend hearings and produce information and documents at such hearings.  I propose the deletion of the section which states that "if a person who appears before the Commission in compliance with a requirement made under section 38A requests the matter to be dealt with in public, the Commission shall comply with the request" because I want the commission to have discretion in this respect.  If ComReg wants to conduct a private investigation into a company which it considers not to be delivering the service required of it, or engaging in some way in anti-competitive or similar practices, it should have the discretion to do so without being compelled by the company to conduct the investigation in public.  I have received representations on this matter from people in the industry who believe ComReg should have discretion to act as it sees fit.  They argue that it should be possible for the commission to investigate something diligently without it involving a massive public session with barristers, etc.  We should try to avoid such paraphernalia which we are now used to as a result of our experience with tribunals.  We need to ensure the proceedings are as simple, snappy and short as possible.  Perhaps this is the wrong way around, in retrospect.  I heard the argument the Minister made on Committee Stage.  The genesis of my consideration of this matter is my belief the commission should have discretion.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_1593">One can argue either way in regard to this matter which was discussed when the Bill was being prepared.  I am not making a political point when I suggest that if Deputy Broughan were Minister and I were in opposition, he would make the argument I am making and <i>vice versa</i>.  Having consulted a number of interests, including the Office of the Attorney General, and examined the submissions made in this respect, we have decided to proceed in this manner.  The default position, as it may be called, in the proposed new section 38C is that all proceedings under Part 2A are to be held in private.  The legal advice we have received is that we should provide for such proceedings to be held in public if a person who is required to attend a ComReg hearing makes a request to that effect.  This provision will protect the right of a person, enshrined in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to have a hearing held in public if he or she wants it to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1594">I do not imagine that there will be many requests for hearings to be held in public.  ComReg will arrange a hearing if it decides that a company may have a case to answer in respect of anti-competitive practices, for example.  The default position is that a hearing will be held in private unless an individual wants it to be held in public.  I do not think many individuals and companies will want to have their dirty linen washed in public.  I remind the House that we are talking about the information gathering stage.  If the process goes further than this, there will be a public hearing that will lead to a finding of fact by the commission.  Having this part of the process in private will enable a speedier investigation, in many respects.  I return to what I said about whistleblowers — the private nature of the initial hearings may make it easier for people to come forward to provide evidence which might back up the commission's other suspicions, evidence or information.  We have framed it the right way in the Bill.  If an individual wants to go public in these circumstances, he or she will have the option of doing so.  We have struck the right balance in the legislation as it stands.</p>

          <p eId="para_1603">It was difficult to find somewhere in the Bill in which to include this amendment.  I am not sure to what extent I have been successful in finding an appropriate place.  There is a general feeling in the industry that the Electronic Communications Appeals Panel, ECAP, which was established under a statutory instrument or regulations is being used by the incumbent to try to defer the much needed reform of the market.  Given that this legislation is giving ComReg some new procedures and powers, I have decided to provide for the dissolution of the ECAP in this part of the Bill.  I would like to know how these provisions will work out.  If ComReg is being used, or something is scheduled to go into the courts system, what further need will there be for the ECAP?  It was created on foot of European legislation because there must be an appeals process where there is a regulator.  We are used to An Bord Pleanála operating in the planning area.  The argument has been made by many companies that ECAP was used as a roadblock.  This Bill might provide a useful opportunity to get rid of it.  What is its function, given the new structure of ComReg?  ComReg cannot levy major fines as IFSRA can and this may prove to be a difficulty.  The industry makes a good case for getting rid of ECAP.</p>

          <p eId="para_1604">It is neither appropriate nor necessary to provide for the dissolution of the ECAP in primary legislation.  ECAP was established under the framework regulations of 2003.  Any changes to the appeals structure could be facilitated by secondary legislation.  The Bill is concerned with competition and anti-competitive practices.  ECAP is mainly concerned with decisions about significant market power.  We will review ECAP and the criticism of it — it has been unfairly criticised.  The panel sought to deal with appeals.  Some appeals were not successful and some decisions were challenged legally, but the panel developed expertise in procedures.  It is natural that the first appeals were slower than we would have liked.</p>

          <p eId="para_1611">This is the meat of the Bill, relating to the Minister's power.  Many people are nervous about the Minister creating offences triable on indictment.  It has arisen in other regulations.  This appeared in the European Communities Bill and concerns special powers enabling the Minister to make regulations to give effect to European Community instruments relating to communications matters.  In recent years, when we were in opposition and the Minister was in the Department, we had much difficulty with European legislation.  The Vincent Browne <i>v</i> Attorney General case is one example.  There is concern that the Minister can create a serious offence by ministerial diktat and for that reason my party opposed the European Communities Bill.  The Labour Party believes serious offences should be created by the Oireachtas, as it will do tomorrow in the Criminal Justice Bill.  The Minister will also have the power to create offences punishable by fines of up to €4 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1612">Either the Minister or the Minister of State spoke on the Bill in the Seanad and stated that there would be a 21 day period of scrutiny by the Oireachtas after any regulation the Minister introduces.  This would take place after the regulations are made and would be of less value than Oireachtas approval before the law was changed.  This is not the way to legislate under the Constitution.  The Labour Party has a problem with this European legislation and this section compounds the problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_1617">I can withstand the temptation of a moment of fame in exchange for a lifetime of hard work as a Minister.  For that reason I do not propose to accept the amendment.  The purpose of the section is to enable the Minister to make regulations for the purpose of giving effect to the European Community legislation.  This arose from the Vincent Browne <i>v</i> Attorney General case.  It provides the power for effective penalties for non-compliance and serious breaches of the regulatory framework.  The Minister of the day has the power to implement new changes to the framework in a timely manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1618">The Deputies refer to other areas to which this power may apply, but it is more important for the telecommunications industry than for others.

            <p eId="para_1623">I thank the Acting Chairman and I want to thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for providing me with the opportunity to raise this important matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1624">The Kilronan parent and toddler group is currently in dire financial difficulty due to the uncertainty regarding the payment of a staffing grant under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-06.  The group which has been in existence since March 2000, is largely run by volunteers.  Members of the current committee all have children attending playschool and they receive no monetary reward for the hours they spend running the school.  The current committee took over the running of the facility in July 2005 following an 18-month closure, and must not be judged on anything that happened prior to that date.  It has run the facility since then without any funding on the generosity of the small, local, mainly rural, community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1625">The group has been in a school premises on which it has paid no rent as the income from fees goes towards the paying of staff.  This in turn has a knock-on effect on the running of the adjoining primary school.  The income is reduced as the group is not paying the agreed rent throughout the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1626">After a long and protracted period the group received re-approval under the EOCP for €25,000 to provide a playground at the playschool, and I want to acknowledge and thank the Minister and the Department officials for sanctioning this funding.  However, while it was successful in securing funding for the playground, the group has been refused a staffing grant which is now critical to the survival of the playschool.</p>
            <p eId="para_1627">What makes the current crisis so illogical, is that without staff, the playground will be redundant, and State funds will have been provided without children to utilise the new facility.  The group now finds itself in the position that if it cannot secure a decision on the staffing grant, it will be forced to permanently close the playschool at Easter.  It cannot keep up the fundraising efforts if it does not know whether there is a future for the playschool, and without a staffing grant, there is no future.  The decision affects the 12 children at present using the playschool and a further pupil scheduled to start after Easter, as well as the two staff currently employed there.</p>
            <p eId="para_1628">It will also have an effect on a further 13 children to whom it was hoped to offer a second session in September, not to mention the parents of those who use the facility to avail of training and employment, and the children of St. Patrick's, the adjoining primary school.  Since this particular committee took over the running of the playschool it has had only one late quarterly financial return for July-September 2006.  The July-September return was a few weeks late as members of the committee had no previous experience with such returns.  They had to make an appointment to see an accountant who explained what was required so that they could complete the returns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1629">This committee has given a commitment that it is willing to stay with the playschool voluntarily for the next three to five years.  With almost two years experience running the school, paying PRSI, dealing with fire safety, insurance, HSE officials and knowledge of quarterly returns, it can ensure that all requirements set down by the Department are met.  The programme appraisal committee and the Department are forcing the facility to close and I earnestly request that this vital service is maintained in this disadvantaged community, where it means so much.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O’Malley)</from>
            <p eId="para_1630">I am taking the Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</p>
            <p eId="para_1631">To respond to Deputy Naughten, it is first necessary to give a brief explanation of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 for which the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is responsible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1632">An Agreed Programme for Government, the progress of the EOCP and the NCIP are confirmation of the Government's commitment to developing child care services to support the child care needs of parents, with a particular emphasis on those who may be in employment, or education or training to prepare for employment.  The EOCP has both an equal opportunities and a social inclusion perspective and aims to increase the supply of centre-based child care places by 55%, or 31,300 places, by programme end.  This target has been exceeded, with some 34,000 additional places already created by the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1633">In order to build on the success of the EOCP, the Government introduced the NCIP to cover the period 2006-10.  This programme will build on the success of the EOCP and incorporates a number of key objectives.  It will increase the supply and quality of early childhood care and education services across the board.  It will support families in breaking the cycle of disadvantage and provide a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care that is centred on the needs of the child.</p>
            <p eId="para_1634">The decision of the Government to create a major new investment programme immediately, rather than wait until the previous programme had expired, is evidence of its commitment to drive progress in the area of child care.  The NCIP 2006-10 has a funding allocation of €575 million and aims to create an additional 50,000 new child care places.  It is expected that approximately 22,000 of these places will be in the private sector and 28,000 in the community not-for-profit sector.  Some 20% of the overall places will be for children in the three to four age group and will provide an early childhood care and education focus.</p>
            <p eId="para_1635">When taken with the other child care related measures introduced by this Government, such as increases in paid and unpaid maternity leave, the introduction of the early childhood supplement worth €1,000 per year per child under six, and tax relief for childminders, no one can doubt that it is giving this issue the priority it deserves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1636">I turn now to the group in question.  Deputy Naughten may be aware that the Kilronan parent, toddler and playschool group was approved €25,554 in capital grant assistance under the EOCP in March 2002 as a contribution towards the capital costs of the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1637">From November 2000 to date, the group has been approved staffing grants under EOCP totalling some €85,000.  Recently the group requested additional funding towards the staffing costs of the service.  However, the Secretary General agreed with the recommendation of the programme appraisal committee that the application should be declined on this occasion as the group had not met the reporting requirements of previous funding which had been approved and, therefore, had not sufficiently demonstrated its capacity to implement the requirements attaching to further funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_1638">The Kilronan parent, toddler and playschool group appealed this decision to the child care directorate of my office on 7 February 2007, and all details were forwarded to Pobal which oversees the day-to-day management of the programmes, for an assessment which will be considered by the programme appraisal committee in due course.  That committee will make its recommendation to the Secretary General who in turn will make the final decision — and the group will be informed of the decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1639">Many child care services throughout Roscommon have benefited from grant assistance under the EOCP and the NCIP.  To date, funding of over €9 million has been approved for child care in Roscommon, which is supporting the creation of over 748 new child care places and over 714 existing places throughout the county.  It is only fair to emphasise that the EOCP has been central to the recent development of child care services in Ireland and with its successor, the NCIP, will continue to flourish under the careful stewardship of this Government.</p>

          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_648">
            <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_1640">It is heartening that the Minister for Education and Science is in the Chamber for the Adjournment debate.  Normally, Ministers leave it to their Ministers of State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1641">There are 167 pupils attending O'Brennan national school, Kielduff, Tralee, County Kerry.  It has grown by 50% in the past ten years, due primarily to the school's excellent and dedicated teaching staff, board of management and parents' council.  The school has eight teachers comprising six classroom teachers, a learning support teacher and a part-time resource teacher.  It also has two special needs assistants and a secretary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1642">Yesterday morning, the parents and staff invited local public representatives and the press to see at first hand the conditions both teachers and pupils must endure.  It was a dreadful experience.  The main school is dilapidated and damp.  Windows do not open.  The staff office is a converted bicycle shed and doubles up as a remedial classroom.  The schoolyard is broken and uneven and floods during heavy rain.  There are five prefabs, one of which is 25 years old.  They are too hot in summer and too cold in winter, heaters are coming off walls and the ceilings are covered with damp patches.  One of the prefabs has no lobby and none has a cloakroom.  Class sizes are over 30 pupils and there is no school hall.  Any major remedial work that has taken place, such as the upgrading of toilet facilities and the new tarmac playground, has been provided through fund-raising by the parents' council.  The secretary works in an office in which the door does not open fully.  Overall, the prefabs and the main school building are in very poor condition.  The Minister visited the school some time ago and will be aware of these problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1643">Four years ago the board of management was advised to draw up plans for a new school building consisting of five classrooms and a hall.  However, on receipt of the plans, the Department requested that the board of management purchase an extra acre of land adjacent to the school because of the restrictive nature of the site.  The land was purchased but no progress has been made since.  While it is welcome that an architect from the Department will visit the school this week, why has it taken so long to advance this project, particularly at a time of unprecedented financial resources?  The only conclusion one can come to is that the Minister and the Department ignored and abandoned the staff and pupils of O'Brennan national school.  Hopefully, the Minister will give a clear indication that the project will be prioritised by the Department and the staff and pupils will not have to wait another four years for a response from the Department.  It is critical that the Minister should provide some positive news on the school's accommodation.  The staff, parents and pupils of the school are not prepared to endure these conditions much longer.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1644">I thank Deputy Deenihan for giving me the opportunity of outlining the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding O'Brennan national school, Kielduff, Tralee, County Kerry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1645">Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task, given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nonetheless, since taking office, the Government has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  As evidence of this commitment, over €540 million will be spent on school building and modernisation projects in the coming year on primary and post-primary schools.  Some 1,500 projects of various scales will be undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_1646">O'Brennan national school was one of several schools which the Department approved to progress through architectural planning.  However, as the enrolment increased substantially, the long projected enrolment had to be reassessed for this school.  The brief for the project was subsequently amended to provide adequate accommodation for a principal, seven classroom teachers and 1.5 learning support and resource teachers.  Deputy Deenihan should note that the Department gave the school extra teachers to cope with the extra enrolments.  The Department could have waited for the new school building to be completed before appointing the extra teachers.  It was felt, however, that it was more important the pupils should benefit from the extra teachers immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_1647">The Department's technical team is assessing how best to progress this project and several options are being considered.  When this assessment is completed, the Department will be in contact with the school authorities as to the next steps involved in progressing this building project.  In the case of all large capital projects on hand in the school building section, progression of the project to tender and construction will be considered in the context of the multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.  The Department of Education and Science is committed to providing suitable high quality accommodation for O'Brennan national school at the earliest possible date.</p>

          <heading>Inquiry into Child Abuse.</heading>
          <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_650">
            <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_1648">Like Deputy Deenihan, I am glad the Minister is in the Chamber to respond to the issue I have raised.  The way the State is treating those abused in State primary schools is shameful.  Anyone who saw the effect of the State's response to victims of abuse on the "Prime Time" programme last week will support a review of the issue.  In some cases, the victims were concerned they would lose their houses due to legal costs.  These were victims of abuse in State-run national schools by teachers who were paid for by the State, yet the Government has washed its hands of any responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1649">The Government's position in this matter is inconsistent.  On the one hand Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats signed up to a deal with the religious communities under which they have picked up the majority of the cost of compensating victims who were sexually abused in institutions under the control of these orders.  The cost to the taxpayer of this deal by the State — repeatedly defended by the Taoiseach and the Minister — will run to approximately €1.3 billion.  On the other hand the State is denying all liability for the sexual abuse of children who were abused in State primary schools, by teachers whose salaries were paid by the State.  Where is the consistency in these positions?</p>
            <p eId="para_1650">Last week, the Minister informed me on several occasions that as the State had the deepest pockets, it should take up the majority of costs in this regard.  The State, however, has far deeper pockets than those of schools' boards of management which will be responsible for actions taken concerning child abuse in schools.  Such abuse did not only occur in the past, but could well happen in the present.  If a case of abuse occurs, as has occurred and as we saw portrayed in a recent "Prime Time" programme, against whom do the victims claim?  If victims claim against members of a board of management, there is nothing for them to claim against as there are no assets.  In effect, the State is saying people who were abused have no legal redress that is in any way meaningful.  To make matters worse, the Department of Education and Science is now subjecting people who are contemplating legal action to a form of legal intimidation by warning that they will be pursued for the full legal costs of any unsuccessful legal action.</p>
            <p eId="para_1651">I refer in particular to Louise O'Keeffe, whose case I raised here and my party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, raised last year.  She faces the prospect of losing her home as a result of being pursued by the State.  I truly believe this marks a new low and makes a total nonsense of the Taoiseach's apology to victims of sexual abuse.  Victims have suffered enough without being subjected to further trauma at the hands of the Department of Education and Science.  What we have is a totally legalistic response to what is an enormous case of human suffering as a result of abuse.  This response is totally inappropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1652">I call on the Government to review its decision to deny liability for the shocking sexual abuse of children in State primary schools.  I also call on the Department of Education and Science and the Minister to stop sending threatening letters to those contemplating legal action against the State.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_651" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1653">I wish to extend my sincere sympathy to those who were subjected to abuse in their schools, places where, as children, they should have felt safe and protected.  Child abuse is devastating wherever it occurs and I know victims continue to carry a great deal of hurt and emotional pain.  Abuse of a child is an abhorrent, inexcusable act.  It brings suffering both to the victim and to his or her family.</p>
            <p eId="para_1654">There is no doubt that a terrible wrong was done to some young children in our primary schools in the past and criminal charges have been successfully brought against some perpetrators.  However, the courts have found the State was not liable for this abuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_1655">The education system has long been structured on the basis that our schools are sponsored by religious and other patrons and run by local management on their behalf, in the form of the school manager or nowadays the board of management, in whom legal responsibility is vested.  The Roman Catholic Church set up the vast majority of our primary schools and continues to act as their patron.  Other patrons include those of Protestant, Jewish and Muslim faiths, and the patron bodies for Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1656">While the Department sets the curriculum and funds the running costs of schools, including teachers' salaries, it is the school management that recruits and employs teachers and other staff.  They are assisted in this role by departmental guidelines and agreements reached with the education partners.  Given the responsibility of local management for employing staff, they are also responsible for suspending or removing staff from their posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1657">The courts have found in four separate cases that the Department of Education and Science was not liable for abuse that occurred in schools.  I accept that the fact the State is not legally responsible for what happened does not make it any less awful for the people concerned.  It just means the Department is not the correct party to bring a case against.</p>
            <p eId="para_1658">Our current system of school management has served us well.  It means that communities have a strong role in how schools are run and that patrons can ensure their ethos is promoted in their schools.  I know that such a locally-based system places a lot of responsibility on voluntary members of boards and I am anxious to ensure that members of boards are provided with the training and other supports they need to discharge their responsibilities.  The Department has provided funding to the various school management bodies to enable them to provide training for their boards of management.  Since last year, the Drumcondra Education Centre has had responsibility for offering training for boards of management to meet their identified needs.  Areas covered by this training include legal issues, financial management, bullying and child protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1659">While members of boards have a responsibility to ensure that procedures are in place within the school to keep their pupils safe and to investigate any allegations of abuse, they are not personally liable for claims against the school.  The Education Act specifically protects individual members from being sued.  It is important that there is local responsibility and vigilance in relation to child abuse but this does not mean volunteer members of boards being exposed to claims.  I do not believe this issue will stop people from volunteering to participate on boards.  The head of the Catholic Primary School Managers' Association has also publicly reassured board members that they are protected by insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1660">In regard to the civil proceedings which are being brought against the State, there is a responsibility to the taxpayer to defend cases where it is clear the State is not liable and where the courts have upheld this.  However, when it comes to pursuing costs, naturally in cases involving child abuse, the State is anxious to balance the need to be responsible to the taxpayer with a strong desire to treat victims in a humane and sensitive manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1661">As the House will be aware, the State Claims Agency is the body appointed by the Government to manage civil proceedings brought against the State, including those involving child abuse.  The Department of Education and Science has specifically asked the agency to approach the issue of costs in such cases in a measured and understanding way.  There is certainly no question of victims being forced to sell their family home.  At the same time, however, it is important that solicitors representing victims are made aware of recent court judgments and the need to avoid incurring unnecessary legal costs in pursuing cases where the State is not liable.  The purpose of the letters sent to solicitors by the Chief State Solicitor's office last year was to make them aware of the legal situation before their clients enter into a costly and stressful process arguing a case against the wrong party.</p>
            <p eId="para_1662">While the courts have found the State was not liable for cases of child abuse in schools, nonetheless the Government is determined to ensure that all schools have policies and procedures in place to protect their pupils.  Over the past number years, a range of measures have been put in place to ensure this.  The Department has provided a range of supports and guidance to schools in the implementation of child protection policy.  Child protection guidelines and procedures, based on Children First, the Department of Health and Children's national guidelines, have been issued to all primary and post-primary schools.  These guidelines make clear the reporting and investigation mechanisms to be followed in cases of suspected child abuse wherever they occur, and the lead role of the Health Service Executive in dealing with such cases.  The Department has provided an extensive in-service training programme for school principals and teachers to assist them in dealing with child protection issues and in implementing these guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_1663">Procedures have also been introduced, based on Children First for departmental staff to assist them in dealing with any allegations or complaints of abuse which are made known to them.  Under these procedures, the existence of allegations of abuse is notified directly to the HSE and all allegations of abuse received in the Department are treated with the utmost seriousness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1664">A range of other initiatives have been put in place, including the stay safe programme, social, personal and health education and Internet safety guidelines, all with a view to educating students in relation to issues of personal health, well being and safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_1665">In addition, from the beginning of the 2006-07 academic year, all new teachers and other ancillary staff who have unsupervised access to children are subject to Garda vetting.  Vetting will be broadened to include all 55,000 serving teachers over the next few years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1666">The Government has also introduced strong criminal measures to ensure persons found guilty of child abuse are firmly dealt with.  In addition, proposals have been published for a referendum to enable further legislation to be enacted to strengthen child welfare and protection supports.</p>

          <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_652">
            <from>Mr. Ferris</from>
            <p eId="para_1667">I have had the benefit of hearing the Minister's answer to the matter raised by Deputy Deenihan on O'Brennan national school.  That answer does not offer great hope for the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1668">The school authorities indicated in or around 2000 that the school was in need of refurbishment and that they required a new school.  They wanted this project to be progressed because the roof was leaking, the heating system was inadequate, the classrooms were small, the school grounds were unsafe and the drains became blocked on a frequent basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1669">A necessary site was required and the trustees purchased a site of one acre adjacent to the existing school.  They commenced the planning process.  During the period that progress on this project has been delayed, the number of pupils enrolled in the school has increased.  If the project is to progress, a new planning application will have to be submitted to meet the requirements of the school and its pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_1670">There are currently five prefabs on the school grounds and it is disturbing that one of them costs €1,200 a month to rent, which is equivalent to the monthly repayments that would be incurred by a person procuring a mortgage to build a house that would involve a cost of more than €200,000.  This situation has been ongoing for a number of years and will continue.  It makes no sense to incur such a debt when a fine site is available to build a school.  As Deputy Deenihan said, both Deputy McEllistrim and I, as well as other people who will be contesting the election, were in the school on Monday and I understand the Minister previously visited it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1671">The school's administration secretary works in a room measuring about 30 sq. ft.  It is not possible to open the door to enter the room because a filing cabinet is in the way.  A resource classroom is also being used as a lunch room for the teachers and special needs assistants.  The yard surface is uneven and highly dangerous and I assume the children are constantly falling and are a danger to themselves and to others.  The playing pitch has been taken up by prefabs in order to meet the requirements of the pupil numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1672">The teachers' and parents' council is concerned that the school is far down the list.  They hope the school will be categorised as a priority by the Minister and the Department so that the problems can be addressed speedily.</p>
            <p eId="para_1673">The Minister's reply is very bland and does not tell us anything.  When I go back to meet the parents' council, the principal and the teachers they will be disappointed as they will not see themselves being any further on than in 2000.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_653" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1674">Rather than repeating my reply to Deputy Deenihan, I acknowledge that Deputy Ferris is correct and that Deputy McEllistrim also expressed his concerns about this school.  Had the school progressed its building project a few years ago, it would now be too small because the population of the area has grown and the numbers in the school have increased.  It was therefore essential to examine the projected enrolments closely so that when the project is completed it will be suitable for the number of children in the school and for the extra teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1675">The Deputy will be aware of the allocation of learning support and resource teachers of which the school has 1.5, meaning at least two teachers are involved.  The reduction in class size last year and next year and the commitment for the next three years could also impact on the number of teachers in the school, as could the population growth.  Even though the conditions might be difficult at present, it may be to the school's benefit that a more accurate assessment has been made of its numbers and the staffing.  The school numbers have been assessed and the technical team is now examining the school.  This is evidence of a commitment by the Department with reference to the school building and modernisation programme.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</from>
            <p eId="para_1681">I accept fully the recommendations made in the 9th Interim Report of the Public Accounts Committee concerning the application of the principles underlying the Guidelines for the Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure Proposals in the Public Sector to capital projects undertaken by the State. However, the question concerns specifically the application of these principles to the issuing of grants to marinas, and there are no plans for any scheme for grant aid for marinas to be operated by the Department. All State support for tourism development, including marine tourism, will be channelled through Fáilte Ireland under the new National Development Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1682">The only outstanding matter concerns a grant for a marina at Roundstone, County Galway, which was selected for grant aid by way of a Budget Day adjustment in 2000, in advance of the terms of the former Marine Tourism Grant Scheme being finalised. The conditions set down for approval of the grant to this project mirror as closely as possible the conditions for payment that were put in place for the Marine Tourism Grant Scheme. The Operational Guidelines for the Scheme laid down rigorous selection and assessment procedures which were consistent with the 1994 Guidelines for the Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure Proposals that have now been updated by the 2005 Guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_1683">The Roundstone project has been unable to satisfy the conditions for payment of the grant, and no payment has been made. There is a token provision in the 2007 Revised Estimates to allow for the possibility of this grant being paid in the event that the applicants can comply fully with the conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1684">With regard to the issuing of foreshore leases and licences, the Department is pursuing a number of initiatives designed to significantly improve our processes and procedures with a view to enhancing customer service while protecting the foreshore.</p>

            <p eId="para_1686">The ability of the existing postal service and An Post to meet the future challenges of full market opening and electronic substitution are in the first instance, a matter for the board and management of An Post and other companies operating in the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1687">Competition has arrived in the postal sector in Ireland and across the EU. The weight limit applying to postal items falling within the reserved area and therefore not open to competition, has been reduced on a phased basis since 2003. The reserved area currently only applies to mail weighing 50g or less and two and a half times the basic tariff for domestic and inbound international mail. Outbound international mail was fully liberalised on 1 January 2004 and the parcels business is fully liberalised, with major international players operating in the Irish market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1688">To date Ireland has adopted a light-touch regulatory approach to liberalisation so as to encourage and maximise the number of postal operators that might wish to enter the market. Currently, there are 29 firms operating in Ireland with a postal service authorisation from the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg. The level of competition is likely to intensify in the coming years. Full market opening of the postal market is due to take place across the EU from 1 January 2009, subject to political agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1689">A vibrant, efficient postal service is an important aspect of any successful economy and it is vital therefore that An Post continues its return to a secure financial footing and prepares to meet the challenges ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_1690">The Government is confident that once the initial challenges have been overcome, full competition in the postal market will ultimately be good for both An Post and Irish consumers. It is however, imperative that the company restructures itself effectively and that management and trade unions in An Post work together to transform the company into an efficient and modern service provider by implementing the agreed restructuring programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1691">By embracing the necessary changes in a positive manner, management and staff in An Post will help move the company in the direction it needs to go if it is to maintain current contracts and compete for further business.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_657">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1693">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband and mobile telephony, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</p>
            <p eId="para_1694">I have no powers to influence the behaviour of private sector companies in relation to the provision of mobile telephony services. ComReg sets out the obligations on mobile network operators with regard to population coverage. These obligations are set down in the licence conditions for each operator. All four mobile network operators have complied with these targets to date. The mobile network operators in Ireland, Vodafone, O2, Meteor and 3 are all investing significantly in their networks and ComReg estimates that more than €600m is invested annually on mobile networks in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695">It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country. That is why my Department has undertaken initiatives to address issues regarding broadband coverage. These include investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in over 120 towns and cities. These MANs will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs. Complementary to the MAN networks, the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) has funded over 120 projects specifically aimed at smaller communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1696">However, despite Government and private investment in broadband I am aware that there are still some parts of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. A Steering Committee comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently finalising a scheme, entitled the National Broadband Scheme which will address the question of availability of broadband to unserved areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1697">The Steering Committee has met with Service Providers and key stakeholders about this scheme. The scheme, when it is fully rolled out, will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in unserved areas of the country are met. Work on the design of an appropriate public tender is under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1698">There has been a large increase in the number of operators who offer Broadband services. In addition, there have been welcome signs in the last year that public take-up of alternative means of accessing broadband such as cable broadband and fixed wireless has begun to take off. The continuing development of Wi-Max and other wireless and mobile broadband technologies offers considerable potential for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1699">Migration to Next Generation Networks is currently being considered by Service Providers and will generate many issues with wide implications for regulation, competition, investment and service delivery that need to be addressed. Therefore I consider it essential that all stakeholders are working together to ensure that Irish business and consumers have choice and that competitive products and services are being offered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1700">To achieve this migration, I intend to establish a National Advisory Forum to advise me on progress towards Next Generation Networks. The Forum will be charged with having a blueprint in place by the end of 2007 on the migration.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1710">I propose to take Questions Nos. 85, 86, 99, 114, 120, 124, 147, 163 and 186 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1711">The Government is firmly committed to the development of an Irish biofuels market and to the development and deployment of bio-energy generally in Ireland. A range of initiatives is already in place to support the development of the biofuels sector. The Minister for Finance has made it clear that any extension in the amount of excise relief under the Biofuels Relief Schemes is not envisaged at this stage. The second Scheme runs until 2011. We are focusing now on non-fiscal measures which will increase the market penetration of Biofuels. The planned introduction of a Biofuels Obligation by 2009 will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales.</p>
            <p eId="para_1712">In announcing the obligation, I have also committed to achieving 5.75% market penetration of biofuels by 2009, in advance of the target date in the EU Biofuels Directive. We have also committed to achieving 10% market penetration of biofuels in Ireland by 2020. We will undertake a series of consultations this year with stakeholders on the specific details of the scheme and this will be followed by the introduction of appropriate legislation. We have set 2009 as the date for introduction of the obligation. This is a tight timeline in reality and it allows for sufficient time for market players to gear up and for the details to be worked through.</p>
            <p eId="para_1713">The Bioenergy Action Plan sets out a series of cross-Governmental and inter-agency actions to support the development and deployment of bioenergy in Ireland. In formulating the plan, it was agreed that while excise relief is an effective short-term measure to stimulate the biofuels market, other policy initiatives, such as a renewables obligation, would be beneficial in the longer-term. The obligation will also give all market players the necessary long-term certainty to make appropriate investment decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1714">The Bioenergy Action Plan also sets out the measures aimed at encouraging farmers to grow energy crops. The move to a biofuels obligation and our ambitious targets, together will create opportunities for the farming community to diversify into energy crops. The production of energy crops in Ireland is relatively underdeveloped and the incentives put in place by my colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Food are designed to encourage further development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1715">The biofuels obligation will provide market players and producers with long-term certainty and a more stable investment climate. The 5.75% obligation represents a long-term commitment by the Government to the development of a biofuels market in Ireland, and will build on the success of the two biofuels excise relief programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1716">Under the 2005 Pilot Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax (MOT) Relief Scheme, excise relief was awarded on the production of 2m litres of bioethanol and 2m litres of biodiesel for the duration of the scheme. 95% of the 16m litres of biofuels being produced overall under the scheme involve the use of raw materials sourced in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1717">Under the 2006 Biofuels MOT Relief Scheme, excise relief was awarded on the production of 306m litres of bioethanol and 290m litres of biodiesel for the duration of the scheme. The scheme provides for the production of 40m litres of bioethanol and 57m litres of biodiesel in 2007. This is in addition to the pilot scheme, which provides for the production of 0.795m litres of bioethanol and 1.076m litres of biodiesel in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1718">Scheme II was designed to move from the pilot stage to a 2% market penetration of biofuels by 2008, representing up to 163m litres of production per annum. While there is a significant increase in indigenous feedstocks being used in this scheme, it is too early to state the precise percentage of indigenous raw materials that will be used.</p>
            <p eId="para_1719">In the case of larger scale, long-term developments under the Scheme, where significant investments are required, a degree of imports have been identified as necessary until facilities and feedstock supply chains are in place. I can confirm however that the majority of applicants under the scheme have indicated that it is their immediate or longer term intention to locate processing facilities in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1720">The Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes were rolled out as competitive calls for proposals. They involved an open and transparent process in which the scoring mechanism was published as part of the application form and accompanying documentation. The schemes were the subject of State Aids applications which were approved by DG Competition. Under State Aids Rules the process must be open and fair and subject to single market rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_1721">The EU transport fuel market is fully liberalised and EU rules do not allow for positive discrimination. Neither could preference be given to any participants within the competition by virtue of the origin of biofuels or biofuel feedstocks, or by the size or nature of the company applying for excise relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_1722">In addition to measures to increase the penetration of biofuels, farmers are also being incentivised by a new €6 million bioenergy scheme to top-up the EU energy crop premium, announced recently by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food. Under this scheme, farmers will receive an additional €80 per hectare on top of the existing €45 premium.</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">Ireland currently has 400,000 hectares of land under tillage and 75,000 hectares of land would be required if all of the 2% target were to be met from indigenous crops. By establishing targets of 5.75% and 10% market penetration by 2010 and 2020, we are creating a Biofuels market framework in which Irish farmers will have significant opportunities to participate.</p>

It requires the Authority to provide a national television and radio service and permits the Authority the discretion to provide "broadcasting services of a local, community or regional character".</p>
            <p eId="para_1726">Section 28(1) of the Broadcasting Act 2001 expands the public service broadcasting remit of the RTÉ Authority to the whole of the island of Ireland.  Section 3(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2006, as recently passed by Dáil Éireann, proposes to amend Section 16 of the Broadcasting Act 1960, to require the RTÉ Authority to provide television and radio services to Irish communities outside of the island of Ireland. The television service is required to be representative of the programme schedules of the existing public service channels RTÉ One, RTÉ Two and TG4. Whilst ultimately a matter for RTÉ it is likely that the programming provided on the television service will consist primarily of domestic programming commissioned or produced by RTÉ and Teilifís na Gaeilge.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">Paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 16(2) of the Broadcasting Authority Act 1960 empower the RTÉ Authority to establish, maintain and operate transmission infrastructure for the purposes of providing its public service broadcasting services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">Section 3(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2006 also proposes that the RTÉ Authority would be required to establish, maintain and operate the provision of a national multiplex service. Such a service would comprise of the infrastructure and electronic services needed to allow for digital terrestrial broadcasting in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1729">In essence, the existing corpus of broadcasting legislation and the proposed Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2006, taken together mandate the RTÉ Authority to provide public service broadcasting services within the island of Ireland and to Irish communities abroad, and empowers the RTÉ Authority to establish broadcasting transmission infrastructure for such a purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_1730">As such it is a matter for the RTÉ Authority to decide on the extent and reach of its transmission capacity in delivering on its statutory mandate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1737">Matters relating to the development and delivery of postal services and the electronic upgrading of post offices are a matter, in the first instance, for the Board and management of An Post and ones in which I have no statutory function.</p>
            <p eId="para_1738">However, I asked the company to ensure that any strategy for the development of the company should ensure the long-term viability of the network.</p>
            <p eId="para_1739">It was to this end that the Government, in September last year, gave its approval for An Post to enter into a joint venture agreement with Belgian Bank, Fortis, to set up a retail banking business. This will entail the provision of a range of financial services operated through the post office branch network, using the An Post brand and other An Post assets. Key to the Government approval of this joint venture was that it not only offers a real opportunity for the growth and development of An Post and the post office network but that it will, in time, greatly benefit the income streams of postmasters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1740">The company recognises that having an automated network is an important prerequisite to availing of the opportunities for additional business. In this context, the company has recently completed a pilot project in which ten smaller post offices were fully automated. It is intended to evaluate the business generated and the income gains in these newly automated offices, in order to see if there is a justified commercial case for further automation of non-automated offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">With respect to mail services, I believe there will continue to be a key role for An Post in the delivery of mail and parcels. With full market opening from 2009, subject to political agreement, competition in the market can be expected to intensify. Therefore, in terms of dealing with the challenges it faces, An Post must deliver on restructuring agreements, particularly in the mails area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1745">I understand that the Corrib developers anticipate first gas in late 2009. I would add, however, that completion of the development works by Shell is clearly the principal factor that will determine the date for first gas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1746">Production of gas from the Corrib field is also obviously dependent on the successful re-routing of the onshore pipeline. Deputies will recall that the Corrib mediator, Mr. Peter Cassells, recommended that, in order to address local concerns about the proximity of the pipeline route to houses, the developer should modify the route in the vicinity of Rossport. The developer has committed itself to implementing this recommendation and I understand that public consultation with the local community is now under way to help choose the optimum route. The developer will also require additional consents both from my Department and from the planning authorities in this regard. Any application received by my Department will be examined from a technical, environmental and safety perspective.</p>
            <p eId="para_1747">My consent will also be required before commercial production operations from the field can commence. That consent will depend on the satisfactory completion of the development works and fulfilment of all of the required technical conditions by the developer.  My Department, meanwhile, has ongoing contact with the developer as part of its role in monitoring the project.</p>

            <p eId="para_1755">The support programmes put in place by the Government to promote the increased use of renewable energy technologies in electricity production have more than doubled the total capacity of renewable energy powered electricity generating plants connected to the electricity network in the last three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1756">Building on the success of the Government in this area, we have set a national target of 15%, contribution of renewable energy which approximates to 1650MW, by 2010. The current renewable capacity is approximately 1,000 MW. We are fully on track to meet that target.</p>
            <p eId="para_1757">The Government's White Paper, "Delivering A Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland", sets a further target of 33% of gross electricity consumption from renewable energy sources by 2020.  Delivery on the ambitious 33% target requires the maintenance of robust support measures which can provide sufficient market certainty to assist new sustainable projects. The system must also maintain the necessary flexibility to accommodate emerging technologies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1758">At the present state of technology development, it is expected that wind energy will provide the pivotal contribution to achieving the 33% target. But we are creating the conditions for a balanced portfolio of renewable technologies including biomass and ocean technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">The Government's White Paper sets a target of 30% co-firing at the three State owned peat power generation stations to be achieved progressively by 2015. ESB and Bord na Móna will work with the biomass sector on the potential of co-firing over the short to medium term.</p>
            <p eId="para_1760">The White Paper also sets an initial ambition of 500 MW of ocean powered plant by 2020. This will be achieved as part of an integrated Strategy to make Ireland a world leader for research, development and deployment of Ocean Energy technologies. Collaboration by SEI, the Marine Institute, UCC and other institutions as well as, ESB and EirGrid is being enhanced to develop and deliver solutions to the challenges facing ocean technologies. Ireland is also working in collaboration with other countries under the IEA Ocean Energy Systems Implementation Agreement. We will also leverage opportunities under the EU FP7 support programme for renewable technologies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1761">The Government is not prescriptive in terms of the contribution which each renewable energy technology will potentially make to meeting the 2020 target. We will continue to support the research and development and deployment of all renewable technologies appropriate to Irish energy needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1763">I set up an Inter-departmental Committee on the Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields, in September 2005, to consider the recommendations contained in the report, "Non-ionising radiation from mobile phone handsets and masts", published in June 2005 by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1764">In that report the Joint Committee recommended: "That no mobile phone handsets should be allowed for sale in Ireland unless they are certified as complying with the International Commission for Non Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) standard."</p>
            <p eId="para_1765">And: "That all mobile phones should have a label that details its non-ionising radiation level — this to be similar to the A/B/C electricity efficiency rating applied to white goods."</p>
            <p eId="para_1766">It is already the case that all mobile phones and the associated base stations must comply with the international emission standards developed by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation (ICNIRP), and endorsed by the World Health Organisation and the European Union under Council Recommendation EC/519/1999. These standards are continually under review and take account of the totality of the latest scientific research.</p>
            <p eId="para_1767">Mobile phones on sale in Ireland must carry the CE mark to demonstrate compliance with these standards in accordance with the EU Council Radio and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment Directive (RTTE), 1999/5/EC, transposed into Irish legislation under S.I. 240 of 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_1768">Following their review, the Inter-departmental Committee noted that any further labelling would be contrary to that EU directive. Mobile phones are supplied with their tested maximum Specific Absorption Rate (SAR).</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">The Committee was guided by the science-based advice provided by an Expert Group, established by the Committee, who concluded that: "no adverse short or long-term health effects have been found from exposure to the radiofrequency signals produced by mobile phones and base station transmitters. Radiofrequency signals have not been found to cause cancer."</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">The Inter-departmental Committee has now reported to Government, which has decided that the current responsibilities of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in relation to the health effects of EMF will become the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government from 1st May 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1771">Furthermore, the Government decided that a single State agency be established to deal both with ionising radiation and non-ionising radiation. This will be achieved by extending the statutory powers of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) to include responsibility for matters relating to non-ionising radiation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1772">The details of implementation of the new mandate for the RPII, in particular the powers and functions and the resources necessary to deliver the extended functions, will be presented to Government for approval in due course by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, following detailed consultation with other relevant Government Departments and agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1773">Government has also agreed to establish a national research programme to undertake further scientific research in Ireland on the health effects of exposure to EMF. This research programme will build expertise in Ireland and contribute to global knowledge.</p>

            <p eId="para_1775">Reduction in energy sector carbon emissions will be achieved under the Energy Policy Framework 2007-2020, in particular through the actions listed under the sustainability pillar. The contribution of the energy sector to carbon emission reductions will be further addressed in the forthcoming Climate Change Strategy. Among the key relevant 2020 targets are: 33% for electricity consumption from renewable sources; 800MW from combined heat and power; 500MW installed ocean energy capacity; 20% energy savings; 12% renewable share in heating; and 10% biofuels in road transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1776">Achieving these targets requires the widescale commercial deployment of renewable and sustainable technologies in the electricity, heating and transport sectors, which, in turn, necessitates underpinning research and development. The investment required depends on the stage of development of the various technologies in each category. Ocean, solar and combined heat and power are at different, but relatively early, stages of feasibility, development and commercialisation in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1777">The White Paper on Energy Policy states that over €150m will be directly invested in energy research under the National Development Plan. The Government is committed to an energy research strategy for the medium to long term, which delivers on Ireland's strengths and tackles specific national priorities, while ensuring that Ireland benefits from international energy research and innovation. A comprehensive energy research strategy, which will set Irish energy research priorities, will be developed during 2007 under the auspices of the Irish Energy Research Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1778">Particular priority will be given to R&amp;D on renewable technologies, including biomass, ocean, solar and wind, other key priority areas include energy efficiency in transport, the built environment and industry, electricity storage projects and grid integration for renewables. The National BioEnergy Action Plan also highlights R&amp;D priorities for second generation biofuels and research forestry and energy crops.</p>

This will facilitate a timely response to the European Commission in April at which time it will be published.</p>
            <p eId="para_1785">On the specifics of pay and conditions for workers in the maritime sector, this is an issue for my colleagues the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment. Both of their Departments are participating in the ongoing process of drafting a national response and their input, along with the views expressed during the consultation process, will form the basis of the national response on that section of the Green Paper.</p>
            <p eId="para_1786">As you know the Green Paper cuts across many different sectors and it represents a significant challenge to develop an holistic approach across such a range of issues.

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1799">I propose to take Questions Nos. 98, 104, 151, 165, 176, 182, 373, 386, 399, 415, 418 and 428 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1800">Government policy in relation to the ownership of the electricity and gas networks is clearly set out in the recent White Paper on Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland. It is the Government's explicit position that the transmission and distribution network assets will remain in State ownership as strategic national assets and that these assets will never be privatised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1801">As I have also made it very clear to this House on a number of occasions, there are no plans to privatise any part of the ESB and The Government fully supports the continuation of ESB as a strong and commercially viable vertically integrated utility within State ownership. This will continue to be the position. It is equally the case that EirGrid as Transmission owner and operator will remain in State ownership now and in future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1802">ESB Group will continue to own and run the distribution network and will continue to undertake the major networks infrastructure investment programme to provide enhanced levels of continuity of supply for the economy and the consumer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1803">In power generation, ESB has been given approval to build the new power plant at Aghada, Co. Cork. The ESB-CER Asset Management Strategy Agreement will see ESB Powergeneration reducing its market share by 2010 and becoming more efficient and commercial in the process. The ESB Group will continue to compete successfully with Viridian, Airtricity and other independents in power-generation and electricity supply in the all-island electricity market.  ESB will also continue to develop its renewable energy portfolio on the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_1804">Over the next five years, ESB Group will, through ESB International, strongly expand its increasingly profitable all-island, UK, European and international business in power generation and supply, renewable energy and consultancy services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1805">Informed by a wide range of views from interested players, the Government has decided this is needed in order to secure a competitively priced energy supply and a positive investment environment for competition. Further structural change is necessary in Ireland's electricity sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1806">The Government's decision to transfer by end 2008 the transmission assets from ESB Group to EirGrid, establishing it as both the owner and the operator of the national transmission system, is a vital part of the further change needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1807">Combining the ownership and operation of the transmission system in EirGrid will deliver confidence to all market players that the system is run in a non-discriminatory way. It will underpin the efficient operation of the all-island electricity market. It is also the norm across Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1808">The combining of ownership and operation of the transmission assets will also reduce the amount of heavy regulation on both EirGrid and ESB. It will deliver efficiencies and reduced overheads for EirGrid. The result will be reduced costs for the electricity users over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1809">Combining the ownership and operation functions within EirGrid will also enable more efficient and timely integration of renewable energy on to the grid system. This is critical for delivery of our ambitious renewable energy targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1810">As well as supporting a strong ESB, the Government is equally firm in its commitment to a strong, independent and forward-looking EirGrid as the State-owned utility charged with the ownership, development and management of the national grid transmission system and as operator, jointly with its Northern Ireland counterpart, of the Single Electricity Market on this island.</p>
            <p eId="para_1811">EirGrid has specific responsibilities to ensure security of electricity supply, manage national electricity demand, and to ensure fair and transparent access to the grid for all players in Irish power-generation. The proposed restructuring will ensure that it can effectively deliver on those responsibilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1812">The mechanisms to implement the successful transfer by end 2008 of the transmission assets will comprise a range of legislative and commercial components. As enshrined in successive Partnership Agreements we will work on the principle that change requires negotiation and agreement. There will be a full process of engagement with the Management and Unions of both ESB and EirGrid over the coming months as we work together on implementation by the end 2008 deadline. The process of discussion will also include the legitimate concerns of the ESOT.</p>

            <p eId="para_1816">The report by ‘beuc', the European Consumers' organisation, highlights the need to address high roaming charges.  Since coming into office I have highlighted the issue of roaming charges.</p>
            <p eId="para_1817">Following pressure from me, my Northern Ireland counterpart and the regulators, all the Irish mobile phone operators introduced special tariffs to address the cost of roaming on this island.  I have strongly supported the European Commission in bringing forward proposals for a regulation on roaming. High charges for roaming within the EU represent a very clear example of a barrier to the single market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1818">The German presidency compromise proposal is currently the subject of negotiation at EU level. My officials are playing an active role in these negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1819">While acknowledging that the regulation is still under negotiation, it is likely that National Regulatory Authorities will be responsible for monitoring compliance by operators with the provisions of the Regulation when it enters into force. This will include requesting the companies to supply the necessary data to enable the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), to monitor compliance. ComReg will be independent in exercising this function.</p>

            <p eId="para_1827">I propose to take Questions Nos. 102, 119 and 123 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</p>
            <p eId="para_1829">It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit in the regions by building high-speed, open access, carrier neutral Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Twenty-seven of these have been completed with the remaining due for completion during 2007 and 2008. These Metropolitan Area Networks will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1830">Complementary to the MAN networks, the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) has funded over 120 projects specifically aimed at smaller communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1831">However, despite Government and private investment in broadband I am aware that there are still some parts of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. A Steering Committee comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently finalising a proposed scheme, entitled the National Broadband Scheme, which will aim to provide broadband to these unserved areas. The Steering Committee has met with Service Providers and key stakeholders about this scheme. The scheme, when it is fully rolled out, will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in unserved areas, including rural areas, are met. Work on the design of an appropriate public tender is underway. It would not be appropriate to estimate the cost of providing full broadband coverage, as the services for this scheme will be procured under a tendering process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1840">It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country. The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit in the regions by building high-speed, open access, carrier neutral Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Twenty-seven of these have been completed with the remaining due for completion during 2007 and 2008. These Metropolitan Area Networks will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1841">Complementary to the MAN networks, the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) has funded over 120 projects specifically aimed at smaller communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1842">I am aware of the importance of advanced telecommunication services to the continuing economic prosperity of this country and there is no evidence that the commercial sector is at a disadvantage due to a lack of broadband facilities. The Government considers investment in and development of the telecommunications sector including broadband to be an important factor in determining long-term national economic competitiveness. There is provision for investment of €435 million under the Communications and Broadband Programme in the National Development Plan over the period 2007-2013, and this will facilitate e continued growth in the telecommunications sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1843">However, despite Government and private investment in broadband I am aware that there are still some parts of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1844">A Steering Committee comprising officials from the Department and ComReg is currently finalising a proposed scheme, entitled the National Broadband Scheme which will address the question of availability of broadband to unserved areas. The Steering Committee has meet with Service Providers and key stakeholders on the National Broadband Scheme. This scheme, when it is fully rolled out, will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in unserved areas are met. Work on the design of an appropriate public tender is underway.</p>
            <p eId="para_1845">There has been a large increase in the number of operators who offer broadband services. There is also evidence of an increase in the numbers taking up alternative means of accessing broadband, i.e. cable broadband and fixed wireless. The use of fixed wireless local access is increasing, especially in rural areas that cannot obtain DSL connectivity, and the development of Wi-Max offers considerable potential in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1846">Enormous progress has been made in the roll out of broadband in the past two years. The official number of subscribers in October 2004 stood at 63,600. Estimates from ComReg suggest that there were more than 515,000 subscribers at the end of 2006 (final figures for 2006 are expected shortly from ComReg). I recently issued a new challenge to industry to reach 700,000 subscribers by the end of 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1847">The migration to Next Generation Networks is being considered by Service Providers and will generate many issues with wide implications for regulation, competition, investment and service delivery that need to be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1848">To achieve this migration, I intend to establish a National Advisory Forum to advise me on progress towards Next Generation Networks. The Forum will be charged with having a precise blueprint in place by the end of 2007 on the migration. I would point out that the migration to Next Generation Networks will not be made at the expense of our current broadband rollout.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1861">I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 159 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1862">It is my objective to ensure that the licensing regime in place maximises the return to the national economy while, at the same time, encouraging exploration for petroleum through an ‘open door' policy in the Celtic Sea and a ‘Licensing Round' system in the Atlantic Margin. This regime must be sufficiently progressive to accommodate both future variations in oil and gas prices and the high cost of deep-water field development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1863">I am considering the report of the consultants who were engaged to assist with the review of the licensing regime. I will bring my proposals for the future of the licensing regime to Government in the near future and I will then take appropriate steps to give effect to the decisions taken. It is my intention that the consultants report would then be placed in the public domain.</p>
            <p eId="para_1864">With regard to non-petroleum minerals, it is Government policy to stimulate discovery of economic mineral deposits and to maximise the contribution of the mining sector to the national economy, with due regard to its social and environmental impact. Exploration and development is undertaken by private enterprise and regulated under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1999. All extraction of minerals under the Acts is subject to payment of royalties to the State. While it is my intention to consolidate and update the Minerals Development Acts in a new Minerals Development Bill currently being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, I do not propose to change that policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1865">There have been four commercial finds of natural gas, namely the Kinsale, Ballycotton and Seven Heads fields in the Celtic Sea off the south coast and the Corrib field in the Slyne Basin off the west coast. There have been no finds onshore that have proved to be commercial.</p>
            <p eId="para_1866">With regard to non-petroleum minerals, exploration and development is undertaken by private enterprise and regulated under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1999. New exploration is continuously undertaken as part of my requirements to holders of Prospecting Licences, of which there are currently 274. Details of these Licences can be found in the six monthly report to the Oireachtas, which I am obliged to lay before the House under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1999. The last such report was in respect of the six-month period ended 30 June 2006. I will shortly lay before this House the report for the six months to 31 December 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1867">No new economic deposits of non-petroleum minerals have been discovered in recent years. There have been some encouraging results, however. Exploration adjacent to existing base metal mines at Navan, Co. Meath (Boliden Tara Mines Ltd.) and Galmoy, Co. Kilkenny (Galmoy Mines Ltd.) has discovered additional resources which have the potential to extend the life of those mines. I have granted new State Mining Licences to both companies for extraction of parts of these additional resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_1881">As a peripheral island energy market, Ireland fully supports the progressing integration of European markets and European energy networks. The Energy Policy White Paper "Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland" sets out the Government's plans for the progressive development of a regional electricity market with UK and North West Europe over the next five years, underpinned by new interconnection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1882">My Department, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the Transmission System Operator, EirGrid, along with their UK and French counterparts, are actively working towards the development of a regional electricity market, as part of the EU Commission's initiative to develop regional energy markets through ERGEG (European Regulators Group for Electricity and Gas).</p>
            <p eId="para_1883">The objective of the ERGEG Regional Initiative is to make concrete improvements in the development of a single energy market in Europe by first integrating national markets in electricity and gas into regional markets. This is achieved through the identification and removal of impediments to trade at a regional level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1884">The France, Ireland and UK electricity Regional Electricity Market initiative is led by the British Energy Regulator (Ofgem) and aims to integrate national markets in the three countries. The Irish authorities are actively participating through the Regional Coordination Committee and Stakeholder and Implementation Groups. Progress is being made in addressing the key priorities of congestion management and intra day trade, balancing and transparency issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1885">This work is a natural progression from the key Government priority to develop with the Northern Ireland authorities the All-Island Energy Market and to deliver the Single Electricity Market (SEM) on November 1st this year. It is complemented by the Government decision to deliver, through the CER and EirGrid, a 500 MW East West Electricity Interconnector by 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1886">Annual electricity consumption in France, Ireland and the UK is around 30% of the EU 25 electricity market. At present ESB has a total installed generation capacity of just over 60% of the generation market in the Republic of Ireland. The CER-ESB Asset Strategy agreement, which includes an agreement for ESB to divest 1,300 MW of its existing capacity, in conjunction with the SEM, will ensure that ESB's share of the all-Island power generation market falls to approximately 40% by 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1887">It is in this context that ESB will continue to compete in the island of Ireland and, eventually, as the regional energy markets progress, the wider single energy market in the EU. The scope for European-wide competition will be determined also by the availability of physical interconnection between systems. Ireland endorses the priority being given to interconnection under the Energy Policy for Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1888">The development of a regional regulatory body is outside the scope of the ERGEG Regional Initiatives. In its recently launched Energy Policy for Europe, the EU Commission addresses the need to balance the role of national energy regulators. The EU Commission has outlined a range of options, including a European network of independent regulators with enhanced powers and a new single body at Community level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1889">I am supportive, in principle, of measures which deliver more effective and proportionate energy regulation. I welcome the proposal to work towards a level playing field for regulatory authorities across Europe. Varying degrees of independence and the differing mechanisms by which regulatory authorities are funded and resourced need to be analysed in this context. I look forward to further elaboration of the Commission's proposals at an early date.</p>

This will be achieved by extending the statutory powers of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) to include responsibility for matters relating to non-ionising radiation. The details of implementation of the new mandate for the RPII, in particular the powers and functions and the resources necessary to deliver the extended functions, will be presented to Government for approval in due course by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, following detailed consultation with other relevant Government Departments and agencies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1929">In the context of this question, I assume that the Deputy is referring to the fishing periods specified to Irish fishermen for the targeting of certain species such as mackerel and herring. Their exploitation is largely seasonal, reflecting the normal life cycle, availability and migratory habits of these species in our waters. I have addressed this issue on a number of occasions recently, and have stressed that the management arrangements for these stocks, which are set at national level, are specifically developed and agreed with Irish fishing industry representatives. They are there in order to ensure a fair and equitable share-out of the available quota of these important species so as to protect the livelihood of a greater number of our fishermen.</p>
            <p eId="para_1930">Given the input of the fishing industry into these measures, I cannot accept that the arrangements force any fisherman to take unacceptable risks in order to exploit the quota allocated to him. In that regard, it is a matter ultimately for the master of each individual vessel to determine the type of fishing operation that is appropriate having regard to the capability of the vessel and the operational and navigational conditions it will have to contend with in order to participate in any given fishery.</p>
            <p eId="para_1931">At the same time, I am satisfied that, regardless of the legal framework governing the catching and landing of fish, whether demersal or pelagic, there are no circumstances where the control authorities would give precedence to their regulatory responsibilities over consideration for the safety of a fishing vessel or its crew.</p>
            <p eId="para_1932">All such management measures are subject to ongoing review, in conjunction with the industry, in order to ensure that they continue to meet the needs of promoting sustainable and equitable exploitation of what are increasingly diminishing resources. Safety considerations of course underpin all of the management measures and other requirements imposed on our fishing fleet.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1943">As stated in the Government's White Paper on Energy, Irish energy policy must be strongly focused on contributing to greater productivity, national competitiveness, a strong economy and the needs of all customers. The Government is also committed to delivery on the All-Island electricity market jointly with Northern Ireland as the logical first step towards creating regional electricity markets between the island of Ireland and Britain. Regionalisation will in due course bring benefits for consumers and for the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1944">The position in law is that sole responsibility for the regulation of electricity and gas tariffs lies with the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body. As Minister, I have no function in setting or regulating tariffs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1945">International energy prices are key drivers over which suppliers have no control as they are driven by volatile international energy markets. The Government policy is to continue to drive down those elements of energy costs which are within our control.</p>
            <p eId="para_1946">There is an impression that because of price rises sanctioned by the CER, regulation is having the opposite effect as to what was intended. The reality is that electricity and gas prices must be cost-reflective to underpin network investment and reflect the cost of fuel. The Government believes that as a natural monopoly, the networks should be run to minimise the price to consumers and not to maximise profits. Accordingly, the Government is directing the Regulator to revise the rate of return for distribution network charges to a risk related rate of return. The resultant savings, through reduced network tariffs, and a lower State shareholder dividend from the networks business will be passed on in full to electricity consumers. Government is adopting these positive reforms in the interests of consumers and the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1947">As regards market opening and contestability Ireland has been progressively implementing the liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets in line with EU Directives and in the context of the All-Island energy framework. The electricity market has been fully open and contestable since 2005. With regard to gas, the market is currently open for commercial competitive customers and the Irish gas market will be fully open by 1 July 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1948">In light of recent movements in international fuel prices, the CER undertook a review, in the latter part of 2006, of the costs Bord Gáis Éireann (BGÉ) and ESB would face in 2007. On 1 December 2006, as a result of the review, the CER announced its decision to direct both BGÉ and ESB to amend their prices for 2007. As a result, electricity prices increased on average by 12.6% on 1 January, rather than 19.7% as was announced on 10 October 2006 and gas prices decreased by 10% from 1 February 2007 following the increase announced on 1 October 2006. Having regard to the volatility in international fuel costs, I understand that CER is considering whether it will develop a further consultation process on fuel cost variation with interested parties in 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_1964">The Salmon Hardship Scheme of some €25 million which I published recently is intended to provide a measure of relief to individuals in line with the level of hardship likely to be experienced based on their recent catch history.</p>
            <p eId="para_1965">Payments under the scheme are based on the average verifiable catch and on the average net income per salmon in the commercial fishery for the five years, 2001 to 2005. This income calculation is based on the average price obtained per fish each year less the costs incurred by fishermen.</p>
            <p eId="para_1966">Each individual licence holder who applies to the fund is set to receive six times their average catch multiplied by the average net income per salmon. An additional payment equal to six times the current licence fee will be made in all cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1967">An additional €5 million is being provided for the Community Support Scheme, details of which are being finalised at present with a view to publication in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1968">Both of these figures were recommended by the Independent Group set up to determine and address the hardship likely to be experienced as a result of the Government's decision to align the wild salmon fishery with scientific advice from 2007 onwards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1969">I believe the overall fund of some €30 million to be a fair and reasonable allocation which does not need to be modified.</p>

            <p eId="para_1980">In accordance with legislation, the body's articles of association and the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, ESB and An Post must seek Ministerial approval for all large projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1981">The specific tax structuring of each transaction is a commercial matter for the body itself as long as it is in full compliance with tax legislation and also the "Code of Practice for Governance of State Bodies" as set out by the Department of Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1982">I receive an annual statement from the Chairman of each semi-State body confirming that the company is in full compliance with:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1983">a. Tax Legislation</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1984">b. The Code Of Practice</p>

Does not engage in any "offensive" tax avoidance schemes, and engages in communications with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in an open and honest manner and that full details of any material transaction, where doubt is cast over the tax treatment, is brought to the attention of the Inspector of Taxes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1987">This statement was duly received by me from ESB and An Post for the periods in question.  The vast majority of multi-national companies, including Irish based companies, use Dutch holding companies to structure their international operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1988">Dutch holding companies are popular with multi-national companies from around the globe primarily because of generous provisions in the Dutch tax regime (regarding dividends, capital gains tax and loan interest) and its network of double taxation agreements.  This provides a legal tax efficient way of structuring investments by Irish companies and other multi-nationals abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1989">The ESB and An Post transactions, which involve a Dutch holding company, are bone fide commercial transactions. These are transactions to purchase, build or operate power stations, in the case of ESB and other corporate entities, in the case of An Post abroad. They are not created specifically to avoid tax, they are created in the normal course of business by ESB and An Post.  I am advised that The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has not sought to unwind any of these transactions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1990">The structuring of investments so as to minimise a tax bill clearly makes an investment more profitable and thus allows Irish companies to compete on a level playing field with their international counterparts who structure their investments in the most tax efficient manner legally permissible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1991">It is legitimate and makes full commercial sense for ESB and An Post to structure and finance their international projects in a tax efficient manner. It ensures that they are competitive in bidding for business. Otherwise their cost of funds would be inevitably higher than that of their competitors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1992">In addition, all value created by ESB and An Post from their international activities (including any theoretical "tax foregone" by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners) is not lost to the State as it is retained within the bodies and ultimately the State as shareholder.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_704">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</from>
            <p eId="para_1994">Following police raids in autumn 2005 on fish factories in Scotland, the United Kingdom fisheries control authorities reported that over 41,000 tonnes of mackerel (worth at least €49 million in current prices) had been landed illegally into Scotland in unreported landings by large Irish trawlers over the 2001-2005 period. There were also large scale reported illegal landings by United Kingdom vessels of both mackerel and herring.</p>
            <p eId="para_1995">As a consequence, in early 2006, the Commission reduced the Irish mackerel quota for 2006 by over 6,500 tonnes to take account of the illegal landings reported in respect of 2005. I and my officials began detailed negotiations with the Commission in 2006 in relation to paying back the 33,486 tonnes of unreported mackerel landed by Irish vessels into Scotland in the 2001-2004 period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1996">My objective in these negotiations was to deliver pay back arrangements that minimised the impact on the majority of fishermen who had little or nothing to do with the illegal fishing, to set the reductions at reasonable levels and to spread those reductions over 6 years from 2007 to 2012. They were successfully concluded in January this year. Ireland's 2007 mackerel quota has been reduced by 3,687 tonnes as a result and quotas for 2008 to 2012 will be reduced by 4,178 tonnes annually to take account of the required pay back.</p>
            <p eId="para_1997">The Irish herring quotas are set on an annual basis at the December EU Council meeting. The Irish quotas for 2007 were set at just over 34,000 tonnes in all areas. As Ireland was not implicated in the undeclared landings of herring into Scotland, no deductions were applied by the Commission to these quotas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1998">In January this year, the European Commission adopted a review of deep-sea species management measures that have been in place since 2002, when quotas were introduced for these species. The review report concluded that the implementation of the measures had been too poor to adequately protect deep sea stocks and that further cuts are inevitable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1999">The main conclusions can be summarised as follows.  Many deep-sea stocks have such a low productivity rate that current catch levels are probably too low to allow economically viable fishing. Also, it takes such a long while for stocks to recover (as such species take a long while to grow and live a long time) that any reduction in fishing must be considered as a permanent measure and not just a way to increase catches in the longer term.  The 2005 quotas were not fully used (percentage take up per fishing zone ranged from 13-61% for deep-sea sharks, 10-98% for scabbardfish, 13-75% for tusk, 8-79% for grenadier, 23-76% for orange roughy, and 5-98% for blueling).  For the long-term management of deep-sea stocks, Total Allowable Catches (TACs) must be complemented by other measures, such as fishing restrictions.  The Commission was critical of member states in relation to the implementation of protection measures for orange roughy (there is a prohibited fishing zone, located to the west of the United Kingdom and Ireland).</p>
            <p eId="para_2000">The findings of the Review have been communicated to the Parliament and Council and, together with the scientific advice, will likely inform future policy decisions on the management and exploitation of deep-sea species.</p>
            <p eId="para_2001">TACs and Quotas for deep sea species are set for two years at a time. Ireland's total deep-sea quotas, set at the November 2006 EU Fisheries Council, amount to 902 tonnes for both 2007 and 2008, compared to 1,416 tonnes in both 2005 and 2006. Ireland's catches of orange roughy had decreased to 96 tonnes in 2005 and in 2006 were just 38.4 tonnes. Ireland's quota for this stock is 49 tonnes in both 2007 and 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2002">However, quotas for other deep-sea stocks of importance to Ireland such as black scabbard and roundnose grenadier were unchanged for 2007 and 2008 and there remain good fishing opportunities for Ireland's fishing vessels targeting deep-sea stocks.</p>

            <p eId="para_2013">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</p>
            <p eId="para_2014">Enormous progress has been made in the past 2 years in the roll out of broadband. The official number of subscribers in October 2004 stood at 63,600. Since then I have issued challenges to industry to break the 500,000 subscribers barrier. I am delighted to say that the next report from ComReg will show that this barrier has not only been reached but has been exceeded with more than 515,000 subscribers at the end of 2006. Final figures for 2006 are expected shortly from ComReg. To continue this impetus I recently issued a new challenge to industry to reach 700,000 subscribers by the end of 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2015">I am confident that this challenge will be met. There has been a large increase in the number of operators who offer broadband services. In addition, the take-up of alternative means of accessing broadband, i.e. cable broadband and fixed wireless by broadband subscribers has begun to take off. The use of fixed wireless local access is increasing, especially in rural areas that cannot obtain DSL connectivity, and the development of Wi-Max offers considerable potential in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2016">It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country. The Government has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage. These include investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in over 120 towns and cities; the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and the new National Broadband Scheme which is currently being finalised and which will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in unserved areas are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_2017">The migration to Next Generation Networks is being considered by Service Providers and will generate many issues with wide implications for regulation, competition, investment and service delivery that need to be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2018">To achieve this migration, I intend to establish a National Advisory Forum to advise me on progress towards Next Generation Networks. The Forum will be charged with having a precise blueprint in place by the end of 2007 on the migration. I would point out that the migration to Next Generation Networks will not be made at the expense of our current broadband rollout.</p>

            <p eId="para_2457">I propose to take Question Nos. 157 and 364 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2458">I recently published the National Bioenergy Action Plan which is an important milestone in the Government's ambitious and comprehensive energy policy. The Plan sets out a cohesive strategy for the development and deployment of indigenous bioenergy resources, in the electricity, heating and transport sectors. The Plan will be underpinned by existing support programmes as well as additional support necessary to realise ambitious targets up to 2020 and will fully reflect EU developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2459">The National Bioenergy Action Plan, with its wide ranging and targeted action points, is only one component of our rapidly evolving energy and climate change policies. The publication of the White Paper on Energy provides a comprehensive roadmap for the development of the entire energy sector. That policy addresses the key challenges of climate change, competitiveness and security of energy supply with a view to providing a long-term vision for alternative energy development. The White Paper on Energy Policy supports the targets and strategic approach in the Bio Energy Action Plan with the objective of delivering a fully integrated approach to the sustainable use of bioenergy resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_2460">The Government's commitment to a cleaner, greener environment is strongly reflected in the pace of our renewable energy policy development. Our targets are ambitious but achievable and our policies and programmes to meet those goals are already firmly established.</p>
            <p eId="para_2461">In the last two years alone, the Government has introduced a range of renewable energy support programmes valued at over €400m. The programmes are designed to be accessible to all energy users, from householders, to community and voluntary groups, the commercial and industrial sector and renewable electricity producers. They are backed up by strong investment in energy research and development, as well as the €10m "Power of One" energy efficiency campaign.</p>
            <p eId="para_2462">I have increased the EU target for renewable energy sourced electricity from 13.2% to a national target of 15%, which approximates to 1650MW, by 2010. The current installed capacity is over a Gigawatt. This consists of approximately 774MW of wind powered plant, 236MW of hydro powered plant with the balance (c. 34MW) made up of different biomass technologies. In the White Paper the 15% target has been further increased to 33% of gross electricity consumption from renewable energy sources by 2020.</p>

As part of its analysis, the board's advisors, recruited by ComReg, carried out an extensive consultation with stakeholders both within the postal sector and outside it with a view to arriving at a postcode model that best meets the needs of the various stakeholders. They also measured the likely costs and benefits of the introduction of such a postcode.  I am currently considering the report with a view to bringing proposals to Government at a later date.</p>

            <p eId="para_2470">In so far as my Department is concerned all necessary consents and approvals have been given for the development of the Corrib Gas Field. With these in place it is now up to the developer to proceed with the development of the field. Certain development works have commenced and are ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2471">On foot of the recommendation of the Corrib mediator, Mr. Peter Cassells, the developer, Shell, has committed itself to modifying the route of the onshore pipeline. RPS consultants have been appointed by Shell to manage this process. I understand that public consultation is now under way to help choose the optimum route.</p>
            <p eId="para_2472">Progress on the development works will be the principal factor that will determine when the gas will come ashore. I understand that the developers anticipate first gas in late 2009. The transmission and distribution of gas throughout Ireland including throughout the western region, is a matter for the gas supply industry; I am aware that Bord Gáis Éireann has announced that it will be piping gas to several towns in the West and North West.</p>
            <p eId="para_2473">The Corrib field, when it is developed, will bring significant volumes of gas into the Irish system, which will reduce our dependence on imports and will enhance the security of our energy supply into the future. Having regard to the uncertainty relating to future oil and gas supplies, this project is of vital national importance. Delivery of Corrib gas also has the potential to bring significant benefits to North West Mayo and the region as a whole.</p>

            <p eId="para_2475">I have no function in this matter.  Premium Rate Services are commercial products in a commercial market.  Responsibility for the regulation of the content and promotion of Premium Rate Telecommunications Services including subscription based services is a matter for Regtel, an independent self-regulatory body established in 1995 to regulate these services.  Regtel does not report to me as Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and I have no plans to amend its status.  In addition, the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg has no role in relation to content.  The area of consumer protection within which Regtel operates falls mainly under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the National Consumer Agency.</p>

            <p eId="para_2477">The draft general scheme of the Broadcasting Bill proposes the establishment of a Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to regulate the three principal categories of broadcaster — public service broadcasters, commercial broadcasters and community broadcasters.</p>

In addition, the White Paper commits to the creation of a landbank of power generation sites, the transfer of the electricity transmission assets to EirGrid and the operation of the distribution network business under a risk related rate of return. These actions will address the structure of the market and ensure that the benefits of competition result in lower prices for the consumer.</p>

            <p eId="para_2495">Full market opening in the postal sector is due to take place in 2009, subject to political agreement.

            <p eId="para_2501">The Government is committed to deliver enhanced interconnection on the island of Ireland as well as with Britain as a priority. The Government's Energy Policy White Paper, "Towards a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland", underlines this commitment. This is also the way forward envisaged at European level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2502">On foot of a Government decision, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is arranging the design of a competition to secure the construction of a single 500 megawatt interconnector between Ireland and Great Britain at the earliest possible date before 2012. While work is progressing on final route selection and technical specification of the interconnector, the CER is also finalising the competition structure, working on the associated competition documentation and related contractual arrangements and going to market as soon as possible within 2007. The Government decision provides that the interconnector will, as a key strategic asset, remain in public ownership and will be owned by EirGrid.</p>
            <p eId="para_2503">While it is too early to say precisely when the project will be completed, the CER and EirGrid are committed to providing the new interconnector by the timeline the Government has set. In this regard, the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure Act) 2006, which provides for a streamlined planning process for strategic infrastructure developments, includes special provisions designed to expedite the planning process for electricity interconnector projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2504">To underpin the development process, new arrangements have been made in respect of the construction and governance under licence of interconnector operators by the CER in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. In particular, the Act provides that the CER may, with Ministerial consent, secure the construction of an interconnector by one or more means, including by competitive tender. Such consent will be contingent on final Government approval.</p>

            <p eId="para_2506">Matters relating to quality and levels of postal service are a matter in the first instance for the management and board of An Post and one in which I have no statutory function. An Post operates within a regulatory framework as enshrined in EU and Irish law and therefore the universal service obligation is a statutory requirement for An Post, as the designated universal service provider. This is set out in Statutory Instrument 616 of 2002 European Communities (Postal Services) Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2507">The Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, in accordance with the regulations, is responsible for the monitoring, measurement and regulation of the postal sector including measuring the levels of service to be achieved by An Post and ensuring that the company abides by its statutory universal service obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2508">To further facilitate ComReg's performance in this regard, the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2007, once enacted, will enable amendments to the current postal regulations to permit ComReg to apply to the High Court for the application of a financial penalty to An Post in the event that An Post fails to comply with a direction issued by the regulator in respect of either An Post's domestic quality of service standard or quality of service corrective action.</p>

            <p eId="para_2528">The grid connection application and delivery process is a matter for the appropriate network generator under the supervision of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). I have no statutory function in the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2529">However, I am advised that applications for connection to the national grid from conventional fossil fuel or renewable generators are received on a continuous basis by EirGrid, the independent State company, which operates Ireland's transmission system. Connections by renewable generators are processed together in batches under criteria decided on by the CER.</p>
            <p eId="para_2530">EirGrid and the operator of the distribution system, ESB Networks, are currently processing connection offers to over 120 renewable generators, equivalent to over 1,300 MW of renewable capacity. It is expected that these connection offers will roll out from April to December of this year, increasing the amount of renewable generation connected to the network over the next few years. It means that Ireland is on course to meet the White Paper's target of 15% or electricity consumption coming from renewable energy sources by 2010, and it will also assist in Ireland working towards the White Paper's target of 33% of consumption from renewable sources by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_2531">In addition, applications for grid connection of two conventional CCGT generating stations in the South West, with a combined export capacity of around 860MW, have also been received by EirGrid and offers have recently issued to the developers — BGÉ and ESB Power Generation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2532">The published data record there are 69 wind energy projects with a capacity of 744MW already connected to the national grid. There are a further 37 projects with a capacity of 547MW contracted for connections and a further 117 projects with a capacity of 1,300MW in the process of receiving connection offers and a further 99 projects with a capacity of 1,933MW at more preliminary stages in the connection process.</p>

The programme provides grants of up to €6,500 for householders depending on the individual technology used. Over 13,000 grant applications have been received since the programme was launched.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_2557">The Sex Offenders Act, 2001 sets out the obligations on persons convicted of a range of sexual offences.  A convicted sex offender must notify his/her name(s), date of birth and current home address to the Garda Síochána within seven days of the conviction for the sexual offence concerned or, where the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, from the date of full release from prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_2558">Thereafter, the offender must notify the Gardaí of any change of name or address within seven days of that change.  Notification of any address where the offender spends either as much as seven days or two or more periods amounting to seven days in any twelve month period must also be given to the Gardaí.</p>
            <p eId="para_2559">If the offender intends to leave the State for a period of seven days or more s/he must inform the Gardaí of this fact and the address at which s/he intends to stay and also notify the Gardaí of his/her return. If s/he did not intend to stay away for more than seven days but did, s/he must inform the Gardaí within a further seven days.</p>
            <p eId="para_2560">The provisions of the Act extend to any sex offenders entering this jurisdiction from abroad who have an obligation to register in their own countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2561">The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit of An Garda Síochána monitor and manage the notification provisions. There are nominated Garda Inspectors in each Garda Division who have responsibility for the monitoring of persons subject to the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001 in their Divisions, including the person referred to by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2562">The address provided by a person subject to the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001 is always checked by An Garda Síochána under the direction of the local Inspector with responsibility for the monitoring of sex offenders and if child protection issues are identified the local Health Service Executive is informed, as provided for in the Children First Guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_2563">The Sex Offenders Act, 2001 makes it mandatory for a convicted sex offender to inform their employer or future employer of their conviction if their job entails having unsupervised access to children.  The Act also allows for a Chief Superintendent of An Garda Síochána to request the court to make a sex offender order, whereby a sex offender can be prohibited from behaving in a particular way, where such behaviour is perceived by the court as having a potential danger to the welfare of children.  It should be noted that Garda clearance is now required for potential employees in a number of occupations which entail access to, or authority over, children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2564">I share the desire of local communities that the strongest possible protection is afforded to children. This desire is also shared by An Garda Síochána, who pursue all cases which come to their attention of persons who do not fulfil the obligations placed on them by the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2565">Furthermore, based on five years' experience in the operation of the Act, I am proposing a series of changes to the Act with the aim of strengthening the protection it offers to the community.  These will include raising the penalty for failure to register from 12 months to five years' imprisonment, thus making it an arrestable offence, and giving probation officers power to prosecute offenders who fail to comply with the terms of a post release supervision order.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_2578">The act of "phishing" constitutes a number of offences contained in the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001. In addition, a provision to give the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime the force of law in Ireland is included in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  The Government has approved the drafting of the Bill along the lines of a General Scheme and the General Scheme has been forwarded to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting of the Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_2579">I am aware of a number of initiatives taken by Departments, Agencies and the industry itself in relation to "phishing" and I have outlined some of them below.</p>
            <p eId="para_2580">I understand from An Garda Síochána that they have received in excess of 25 complaints from members of the public relating to fraudulent withdrawals from their bank accounts, offences which are committed using a technique known as "phishing" which is a term used to describe the theft or attempted theft of personal information using e-mail and "bogus" websites.  It is a relatively recent phenomenon.</p>
            <p eId="para_2581">The primary function of An Garda Síochána is the investigation of the criminal conduct through which the monies have been lost by the injured parties as opposed to the recovery of funds.   However, criminal courts invariably make orders restoring funds which have been identified as the proceeds of crime following conviction of the offender.</p>
            <p eId="para_2582">I understand that An Garda Síochána is working with the Banking Industry to counteract this phenomenon.  All the Banks offering on-line banking services have posted warning notices on their websites to the effect that this activity is occurring and that members of the public should not respond to any request relating to their personal banking security details.</p>
            <p eId="para_2583">A High-Tech Crime forum has also been established with all relevant stakeholders including An Garda Síochána and the Financial Services Industry, including the banking sector.  This forum facilitates the rapid dissemination of information related to "phishing" and other methods being used in an attempt to compromise banking services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2584">Victims of "phishing" attacks are advised by An Garda Síochána and the industry to report any such attacks immediately to An Garda Síochána for investigation.  Every assistance is given by An Garda Síochána to injured parties and their representatives in their efforts to recover moneys.</p>
            <p eId="para_2585">Garda investigations to date have resulted in a number of persons being prosecuted for theft offences, related to "phishing"  incidents where the proceeds of fraudulent withdrawals have been transferred to an apparently legitimate account which has been used to facilitate the withdrawal of stolen funds.  A number of other similar investigations are ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2586">An Garda Síochána have advised that, through the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigations, it has participated in a number of initiatives, by various Government Departments and the Financial Institutions, whose primary aim is to raise public awareness of this type of criminality, and include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2587">A website entitled ‘Safecard', which was launched in partnership with the Irish Payment Services Organisation, addresses many issues around payment card fraud, in particular the issue of identity theft.  The Garda website (www.garda.ie) also contains advice to members of the public on how to avoid this type of criminal activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2588">The ‘Make ITSecure'  Programme, in conjunction with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources which, inter alia, produced advice booklets, including one on Identity Theft, for the public and which have been distributed to every Garda Station.</p>
            <p eId="para_2589">I also understand that the Financial Regulator in June 2004 published a factsheet informing consumers as to how to protect themselves from fraud and this is available from the Financial Regulator's website.  All the information and communication from the Financial Regulator has reinforced the same warnings — that no bank would ever ask their customers to confirm any of their financial information by email or by entering details into a website.</p>
            <p eId="para_2590">I am sure that the Deputy is already aware that the Director of the Office of Consumer Affairs and the Consumer Protection Agency (under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment) on 15 March 2007, World Consumer Rights Day, advised of their forthcoming launch of their Scams Awareness Campaign.  The Campaign is to be formally launched on April Fool's Day, 1st April next.  "Scammers" have many ways of targeting people in Ireland including phone calls, e-mail, post and door-to-door visits.  Their material, including information in relation to phishing, can be viewed on their website at consumerconnect.ie.  Similar material on European wide scams can be viewed on the European Consumer Centre website at www.ecc.dublin.ie.</p>

            <p eId="para_2753">The construction of the education unit at St. Patrick's Institution was completed in April 2003. The Project was budgeted at €8m including VAT. The final account amounted to €7.5m including VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_2754">The facility consisted of a dedicated educational unit, a recreational sports hall, counselling rooms as well as other ancillary services, thereby creating a self-contained facility.  However, the negotiations on the staffing and operation of the new Education Unit were deferred pending the advancement and roll-out of the wider change agenda comprehended by the Agreed Proposal for Organisational Change in the Prison Service as a whole. Following the successful implementation of this comprehensive and fundamental change package  for the Prison Service in early 2006, discussions resumed on the staffing and operational requirements of the new Unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_2755">I have asked Prison Service management to give priority  attention to bringing these talks to a conclusion. It is intended in any event to proceed with the opening of the school element of the facility on a phased basis in the week commencing Monday 2nd April, 2007.</p>

         the arrangements being put in place to allow a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny to stay in Kilkenny after a hostel closes; if persons living in the hostel who want to remain in Kilkenny will be accommodated by arranging private rented accommodation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2760">The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department has a contract in place for the accommodation of asylum seekers at the Ormonde Hostel in Kilkenny until 9th May, 2007. After that time the premises will no longer be available for this purpose as the contractors have decided not to renew the contract. Obviously this decision is regrettable for the RIA but also for the residents of the centre who will have to be moved to alternative suitable accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2761">All State service providers (e.g., HSE, Department of Social and Family Affairs) have been advised of the closure of this centre so that they can prepare for the necessary adjustments to the provision of their services. In addition, the local support group, who have provided on-going support and assistance to the many residents who have resided at the centre since it first opened in December 2000, has also been advised of the closure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2762">The Deputy will appreciate that the residents of this accommodation centre are involved in a process to determine the outcome of their claim for asylum in the State. Under a Government decision it was decided that all applicants for asylum would have their needs met through the system of direct provision. Direct provision is the means by which the State discharges its obligations to provide for the basic requirements of asylum seekers and represents, for the most part, a cashless system with suitable accommodation being provided on a full board basis. This system does not provide or arrange for private rented accommodation. In the event of a positive determination of refugee status, the residents will be free to reside in Kilkenny or anywhere else in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2763">In the meantime, residents will be offered alternative RIA accommodation nearer to the date of closure. As the availability of accommodation at any one time is governed by a range of factors, including the numbers and class (i.e., single/families/couples) of persons requiring accommodation, the RIA is not in a position to offer specific accommodation to the residents of this centre at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_2793">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 13,178 following the attestation of 273 new members on Wednesday 14 March, 2007. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) on 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,476 (or over 23%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training on 14 March, 2007 was 14,258. Furthermore, I should say that on 19 December, 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met.

         his plans to draw up guidelines or legislation to govern the operation of the free travel area with Britain as operated at airports here; if he will segregate the arrival of passengers from Britain as the British do for Irish passengers at British airports; and if his attention has been drawn to the free travel area implementation difficulties for Gardaí at airport immigration points due to the increased numbers of non-Irish citizens living here and of the difficulties experienced by some Irish citizens due to the lack of a clear implementation policy.

            <p eId="para_2921">The issue of immigration facilities at Irish ports and airports in general was discussed in my Department's publication "Outline Policy Proposals for an Immigration and Residence Bill" (April 2005).  It was acknowledged in the discussion document that such facilities do in some respects fall short of what is needed for effective checking of arrivals. I understand senior Garda management within the Garda National Immigration Bureau frequently meet with the appropriate port of entry authorities in order to reduce as far as possible, delays experienced by passengers arriving in Ireland, within the immigration facilities currently provided.</p>

            <p eId="para_2942">The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2943">Long term residency is granted on the basis that a non EEA national has completed five years (60 months) legal residence in the State on Work Permit conditions which is reflected in the corresponding Stamp 1 endorsements in a person's passport and not by the dates of commencement and expiry of each Work Permit. Subsequently, in calculating the reckonable period of 60 months legal residence, the Immigration Division of my Department only takes into consideration time spent in the State legally on work permit conditions.  However, periods of time, where a person has not had legal residence (ie: having an up to date endorsement on Work Permit conditions in their passport) cannot be counted towards an application for long term residency.</p>
            <p eId="para_2944">On foot of a Parliamentary Question put down for answer on the 27th February, 2007 (PQ No. 242) the Immigration Division contacted the person concerned in writing as she did not meet the qualifying criteria for long term residency and her permission to remain had not been renewed since 9th May 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2945">In light of the particular circumstances, she was granted permission to remain in the State on the 26th February 2007 for a 4 month period to allow a prospective employer obtain a work permit on her behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_2946">Enquiries made with the Garda National Immigration Bureau indicate that the person concerned has not attended her immigration office to regularise her immigration status in line with the permission to remain granted, as outlined above.

For students coming from countries that are not visa required, the position must be consistent with that for visa applicants in that students should only be granted residence permits where they are attending fee paying schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2955">In recent months the immigration authorities have become aware of a number of students who have been placed in State second level schools by companies operating in the overseas student sector.

            <p eId="para_2986">The UK Act to which the Deputy refers provides a framework by which certain criminal records may be expunged.  In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a person convicted of all but the most serious criminal offences and who receives a sentence less than 30 months in prison (including suspended), benefits from the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, if they are not convicted again during a specified period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2987">The effect of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act, 1974 is that once a conviction is spent, meaning the rehabilitation period is finished, the rehabilitated person shall be treated, in law, as a person who has not been convicted or charged with the offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2988">In general there is no provision in Irish law allowing for the expunging of criminal convictions from the Garda criminal records.  However, with the introduction of the Children Act, 2001 provision was made for a limited "wiping of the slate" in respect of most offences committed by persons under 18, once certain conditions have been met.  The provision in the Children Act, which came into operation on 1 May 2002,  limits, as far as possible, the effects of a finding of guilt, where the relevant conditions have been met, by treating the person for all purposes in law as a person who has not committed, been charged with, prosecuted for, found guilty or dealt with for an offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2989">The Second Programme of the Law Reform Commission for the period 2000 to 2007 proposes, as part of an examination of the law on privacy, to consider longevity of criminal records and expunging of certain offences from the records.  I understand that the Law Reform Commission intends to prepare a Consultation Paper examining the complex range of issues surrounding the matter of ‘spent convictions'.  Such Consultations Papers normally encompass an analysis of legislation and practice in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom.  I understand that the Law Reform Commission will publish this paper within the first half of this year.  Such papers are normally followed by a final report from the Commission. I expect that we will await the findings of the ultimate Law Reform Commission Report before proceeding with legislative proposals on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_2990">In a broader context, the Deputy may wish to note that the Council of the European Union has adopted a Council Decision on the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record and a proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between Member States is currently under discussion.</p>

Of those persons convicted, two were sentenced to imprisonment, one received a community service order and two were fined.</p>
            <p eId="para_2993">Conscious of the difficulties which the illegal use of fireworks presents each year and the distress they cause to people, I introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2006, a number of amendments to the Explosives Act 1875. These amendments provide for new offences, governing the illegal possession and use of fireworks, and increased penalties.</p>
            <p eId="para_2994">Under these new provisions it is an offence: to possess a firework with intent to sell or supply, without a licence; to throw an ignited firework at any person or property; and to light unlicensed fireworks in a public place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2995">The penalty for such offences is a fine of up to €2,500 or six months imprisonment or both on summary conviction and a fine of up to €10,000 or five years imprisonment or both on conviction on indictment.

            <p eId="para_3077">The civil service superannuation schemes are funded on a pay as you go basis from monies voted each year by the Oireachtas during the Estimates campaign.  Civil service superannuation payments are met from Vote 7, Superannuation and Retired Allowances. The vast majority of other public service superannuation schemes are also funded on a pay as you go basis from monies voted each year by the Oireachtas for the respective areas, such as the Education and Science Vote, the HSE Vote, the Justice and Defence Votes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3078">In general terms, expected increases in numbers of retirees and in life expectancy have highlighted a potential sharp rise in the cost of public service pensions in the decades ahead. Against this background, the Government set up a Commission on Public Service Pensions to examine and report on public service pensions having regard, amongst other things, to present and future costs of those pensions. The Commission published its final report in 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_3079">Since then, and based largely on the recommendations of this Commission, the Government has embarked on a substantial program of public service pension reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_3080">The key cost-containment change in this reform program, implemented in 2004, was the raising of the general pension age for new workers in public service employment from 60 to 65 years.  When fully realized around mid-century, it is expected that annual savings across the public service of some €350 million will flow from this change.</p>
            <p eId="para_3081">The 2004 legislation which implemented the pension age increase (Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004) also abolished the long-standing mandatory retirement age of 65 years for new-entrant public servants.</p>
            <p eId="para_3082">Ireland's demographic profile, with one of Europe's youngest populations, allowed the 2004 Act to confine these changes to new entrants.  The savings which the pension /retirement age changes will produce are therefore timed to peak at the time of real need — towards mid-century — when we will have a large number of pensioners relative to workers, and a correspondingly large pensions bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_3083">An earlier measure to help make provision for the expected increase in pension costs was the establishment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund in 2001 under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000. The Fund was established in order to meet as much as possible of the cost of social welfare and public service pensions from 2025 until at least 2055. The Act requires the payment of 1% of GNP annually into the Fund until at least 2055. These moneys are invested by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, which controls and is responsible for the investment of the Fund. The market value of the Fund at end-2006 was estimated to be €18.8 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_3084">Finally, the future cost of public sector pensions is being considered in the context of the Green Paper on pensions policy, publication of which is expected shortly.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_3110">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not undertaking any specific investigation into individuals who enter into building contracts with companies that they own.</p>
            <p eId="para_3111">Whether a transaction is artificial or is a genuine business transaction, at arm's length or otherwise, is a question of fact having regard to the facts and circumstances of each case.</p>
            <p eId="para_3112">As to an income tax charge, directors of companies are ‘office holders' and, as such, are treated in like manner as employees for income tax purposes.  Office holders and employees are chargeable to income tax in respect of all salaries, fees, wages, perquisites or profits from their office or employment.  The question of whether anything received by an office holder or employee from their office or employment comes within any of these descriptions — in particular, whether it is a perquisite or profit — and the quantum of same is a question of fact having regard to the facts and circumstances of the arrangements in place surrounding the provision of the advantages to an office holder or employee.</p>
            <p eId="para_3113">On a slightly separate note, as regards the individuals acquiring properties in such manner, there is the possibility that such individuals could be held to be carrying on a separate trade of dealing in property the profits of which attract income tax rather than capital gains tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_3114">In the case of VAT, Section 80 of the Finance Bill 2007, as passed by Dail Eireann, permits the Revenue Commissioners, where they consider it necessary in order to ensure correct collection of the tax, to determine that VAT will be charged on the open market value of a supply. They can do this in circumstances where the supply is being made for a consideration other than market value where the parties are connected.</p>
            <p eId="para_3115">The section may be applied by Revenue to prevent the value of a supply being manipulated by the connected parties in order to gain a VAT saving, for example where a building service is supplied to a land owner and the finished building will be used for VAT exempt activities, such as short-term letting of residential accommodation. Open market value is defined as the value at which the supply could reasonably be expected to be made between unconnected parties dealing at arms length.  Where there is no comparable market value, the open market value of a supply of services means an amount not less than the cost to the supplier of providing the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3116">The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the scenario described by the Deputy appears to indicate a situation in which the issue of a determination under the proposed section would be considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_3120">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that individuals may claim tax relief in respect of the cost of ‘service charges' (i.e. charges in respect of the provision of water for domestic purposes, domestic refuse collection or disposal or domestic sewage facilities) the details of which are contained in Revenue's Explanatory leaflet and claim form IT 27 Tax Relief for Service Charges which is available on Revenue's website at <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_3122">As regards companies (including management companies), I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, whilst there is no specific tax relief in respect of service charges and other expenditure, a company within the charge to corporation tax may claim a deduction, in computing its profits, in respect of expenditure wholly and exclusively incurred for the purposes of its trade. This is subject to any express prohibition in the legislation in respect of certain types of expenditure (e.g. business entertainment expenses which are prohibited by virtue of the provisions of section 840 TCA 1997).</p>
            <p eId="para_3123">In the case of a property management company, it is likely that expenditure on waste management services would meet the wholly and exclusively criteria and would be deductible in computing the profits of the company for tax purposes. However, to the extent that a property management company recovers any costs directly from the tenants in question in relation to service charges, such amounts should be ‘added back' in the preparation of the company's tax computation/return.</p>
            <p eId="para_3124">As the cost of all the items laid out by a company for its business are not separately captured on the tax return form, the value in tax terms of deductions claimed by management companies in respect of service charges is not available.</p>

            <p eId="para_3154">Between 1997-2007 the Government has invested additional funding of €926m in health funded support services for people with disabilities of which additional revenue and capital funding of €603m has been provided for services for persons with intellectual disability and autism.  Approximately €323m in additional revenue and capital funding has been provided for services for people with physical or sensory disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3155">In the Estimates for 2006 the Government published a multi-annual investment programme for disability    specific services which would have total cumulative value close to €900m for the period 2006 to 2009.

By the end of this programme these monies are expected to provide 1,290 additional new residential places, 430 new respite places and 2,540 new day places for Intellectual Disability Services and 380 new residential and 1,200,000 extra hours for Physical and Sensory Disability Services.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_3162">I propose to take Questions Nos. 270, 290 and 338 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3163">As the Deputy may be aware, my Department and the HSE have been reviewing the pharmaceutical supply chain, with a view to seeking value for money in the State's drugs bill in order to better fund existing and innovative therapies without compromising continuity of supply or patient safety.  The review of the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland, APMI, Agreements, with the proprietary and generic supplier representative bodies, was completed in mid-2006 and the new agreements are in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_3164">Following completion of the manufacturer agreements and in line with the process agreed by the Cabinet Committee, the State entered talks with the wholesaler representative body, the Pharmaceutical Distributor's Federation, PDF.  As wholesale margins are not addressed in the new IPHA and APMI Agreements, the State intended to negotiate, for the first time, direct formal arrangements with the wholesale sector, to address the cost of wholesale supply to hospital and community through fair, transparent and accountable cost structures.  In particular, the State wished to examine the high margin, relative to the EU,  for wholesale supply to community pharmacy and the wholesalers' claim that they supply hospitals at a loss.  However, while PDF was willing to negotiate new arrangements for hospital supply, it refused to negotiate a new margin for community supply. This refusal was based on legal advice that such negotiation would interfere with agreed trading terms of third parties, community pharmacists, and expose PDF to prosecution.</p>
            <p eId="para_3165">Subsequent advice to the HSE indicated that the PDF position was too narrow.  As wholesalers and pharmacists are undertakings for the purposes of competition law, PDF and the IPU are associations of undertakings and collective negotiation of fees, prices or margins on behalf of their members breaches section 4.1 of the 2002 Competition Act.  The position is as follows.</p>
            <p eId="para_3166">Section 4.1 prohibits all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have the object or effect of restricting or distorting competition, including agreements to fix prices, unless the agreement, decision or concerted practice meets certain conditions.  I have been advised that those conditions are not met in this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_3167">Wholesalers and pharmacy contractors are undertakings. Therefore, PDF and the IPU are associations of undertakings and come under Section 4.1 of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_3168">The coming together of wholesalers under PDF or pharmacy contractors under the IPU to negotiate prices would be a breach of Section 4.1.</p>
            <p eId="para_3169">Acting in contravention of Section 4.1 is a criminal offence and would expose those parties and their officials to the risk of criminal prosecution.</p>
            <p eId="para_3170">In light of the implications for GP and dental contract negotiations, the Department sought the Attorney General's views. The Attorney General and Senior Counsel engaged by the Attorney General confirmed the HSE advice.  Given this position, it is not possible for the State to negotiate with PDF or the IPU on fees or margins and such negotiations places these bodies at risk of prosecution.</p>
            <p eId="para_3171">As with the rest of the supply chain, the State has been examining how to improve value for money and transparency and fairness in relation to the cost of service provision in community pharmacy.  The State intended to address the review through negotiation with the IPU, as in the past.  This is no longer possible for fees, although contractual matters other than fees may be negotiated.  Accordingly, the negotiating team re-examined, in light of the legal position arising from the wholesaler legal advice,  how best to address the review of pharmacy contractor services.  The HSE wrote to all community pharmacy contractors in January, setting out the situation in detail and stating that the HSE is constrained from negotiating fees with the IPU for the reasons outlined, and the IPU was fully briefed.   A meeting was held on 21 February between the negotiating team and the IPU, to agree a procedure to examine available options for advancing contractual negotiations in compliance with Irish and EU competition law.  Following that meeting, agreement was reached on talks to examine options for contract review that would comply fully with competition law.  The talks will be chaired by Mr Bill Shipsey, SC.  It is expected that the talks will begin within the next few days.</p>
            <p eId="para_3172">The State continues to recognise the IPU as the representative body for its members, but negotiations with the Union must comply with the law.  The legal issues that emerged during the wholesale sector review were raised by the wholesaler representatives.  Once the State became aware of these issues, it was no longer possible to continue as intended.  There is, and will continue to be, ongoing dialogue with the IPU as the representative body for pharmacists, within the constraints of the competition legislation and the negotiating team will consider, in the context of competition law and in particular the relevant Competition Authority guidelines, all available options for advancing the process agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Health.  I am satisfied that the Cabinet Committee process for review of the supply of drugs to the State is progressing effectively, within the constraints of relevant legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3187">Over 120,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the health care needs of the population into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_3188">Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>

One individual has had their legal costs of €1,815.00 met by the Department in respect of their attendance at the Inquiry as a witness in relation to an allegation of abuse against a third party.  Payment to this person was made on the basis of advice received from the Inquiry Team.</p>
            <p eId="para_3196">A number of other parties including the Diocese of Ferns have advised the Department of legal costs incurred in relation to their engagement with the Inquiry.   It would be inappropriate to list these parties in the context of the report's approach generally to those who engaged with the Inquiry. Officials of the Office of the Minister for Children are considering the issue of legal costs in relation to both the Bermingham Inquiry and the Ferns Inquiry and it is expected that Government will take decisions on these matters in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_3209">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services.  In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_3210">Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card.  The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs.  In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards.  These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>

            <p eId="para_3226">The European Working Time Directive (EWTD) was transposed into Irish law on 1 August 2004.  It specifies that non-consultant hospital doctors' (NCHDs') working hours should be reduced as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_3227">maximum of 58 hours per average working week from 1/8/04;</p>
            <p eId="para_3228">maximum of 56 hours per average working week from 1/8/07; and</p>
            <p eId="para_3229">maximum of 48 hours per average working week from 1/8/09 onwards.</p>
            <p eId="para_3230">In addition, there are also provisions for minimum daily and weekly rest periods and for compensatory rest periods</p>
            <p eId="para_3231">11 hours rest per 24 hours, or compensatory rest must be given immediately; and</p>
            <p eId="para_3232">weekly rest period of at least 35 consecutive hours, or fortnightly rest period of at least 59 consecutive hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_3233">Many NCHDs are already compliant with the 58-hour week, but the most significant challenge is to achieve full compliance with the requirements for rest and breaks.</p>
            <p eId="para_3234">In order to achieve compliance with the Directive the Task Force on Medical Staffing made a series of important recommendations including</p>
            <p eId="para_3235">the changes required in NCHD work patterns;</p>
            <p eId="para_3236">the need for a significant increase in the number of consultants;</p>
            <p eId="para_3237">the need for a revised contract for medical consultants;</p>
            <p eId="para_3238">reform of medical education and training; and</p>
            <p eId="para_3239">the reorganisation of acute hospital services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3240">Health Service employers have established a number of pilot groups — local implementation groups (LIGs) — throughout the country.  These groups include representatives from management, medical grades, nursing grades, the social care professions and the training bodies.  The pilot groups will examine local issues and develop plans for EWTD compliance.  A National EWTD Implementation Group (NIG), chaired by Dr. Cillian Twomey, has been established to give guidance to the LIGs.  A Nursing and Midwifery Expert Group has also been established to interface with the NIG on the implications for nurses of any changes proposed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3241">The LIGs have presented proposals to the NIG on options for the reduction of NCHD hours.  So far 16 pilots have begun and a further 3 have been formally approved.  When the work of these pilot sites is complete, by the end of this year, the outcomes will be evaluated by the NIG with a view to the broader application of similar arrangements.  The hours worked by nurses in the public health service are within the limits set by the EWTD.</p>

            <p eId="para_3245">The statutory position governing the eligibility of children to dental treatment under the Health Service Executive (HSE) service is Section 66 of the Health Act 1970, the Health (Amendment) Act 1994 and the Health (Dental Services for Children) Regulations, 2000 (S.I.

The screening provided in second, fourth and sixth classes ensures that follow up appointments for examination, treatment or orthodontic review are made, as necessary, with the Dental Surgeon in the clinic designated for the particular school(s).

            <p eId="para_3249">The report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, entitled "A Vision for Change", was launched in January 2006.  It provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over the next 7 to 10 years.  "A Vision for Change" recommends that child and adolescent mental health services should provide mental health services to all aged 0-18 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3250">Currently there are 10 child and adolescent psychiatric in-patient beds in the public sector for the under 16 age group, 4 at St. Anne's in Galway and 6 at Warrenstown House in Dublin.  A further 12 beds will be provided this year in these units i.e. 6 additional beds in each unit.  There are also 12 dedicated beds in the private sector (St. John of God, Stillorgan, Dublin).  Four purpose built, 20 bed Child and Adolescent Units will be developed in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick in line with ‘A Vision for Change'.  These projects are at an advanced planning stage and have secured funding through the HSE Capital Programme 2006-2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_3251">As an interim measure pending the development of child and adolescent in-patient units, the provision of an additional 24-32 dedicated adolescent psychiatric beds, primarily for the 16 and 17 year age group, across the four HSE administrative areas is being progressed by the HSE.  Dedicated child and adolescent multidisciplinary teams will be provided for these additional beds and training will be provided for staff in the identified units.</p>
            <p eId="para_3252">The Mental Health Commission acknowledges that the admission of children to adult units is undesirable, however, in situations where there is no available alternative, such admissions may be necessary.  The Commission has issued a code of practice relating to the admission of children under the Mental Health Act 2001 to ensure that the best interests of children are protected at all times.</p>
            <p eId="para_3253">Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004 and funding for all health services has been provided as part of its overall vote.

            <p eId="para_3281">The Report of the Task Force on Sudden Cardiac Death was published in March 2006.  It makes recommendations on the prevention of sudden cardiac death and on the detection of those at high risk.  Among the recommendations of the Task Force is that training initiatives should be prioritised.  I understand that the HSE, which has overall responsibility for the implementation of the report's recommendations, has set up working sub groups to address the recognised priority areas in the SCD report one of which is First Responder development.</p>
            <p eId="para_3282">Progress has already been made in this area. The process for appointing a national community first responder co-ordinator plus four HSE area community first responder co-ordinators has begun.  A similar process for appointing six community resuscitation training officers to ensure that all health care professionals receive ongoing basic life support (BLS) training, has also begun.</p>
            <p eId="para_3283">A draft guide giving information and advice for community first responder programmes has been produced and is being developed further.  Support has also been given to the MERIT project that provides automated external defibrillators (AEDs) and AED and BLS training to GPs and GP practices throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_3284">Funding the training in the use of AEDs will be decided by the HSE and will be guided by the priorities identified in the report. My Department will continue to monitor the progress being made by the HSE in implementing the recommendations of the Task Force.</p>

            <p eId="para_3290">A Service Level Agreement for the  provision of air ambulance services by the Air Corps was prepared and signed in September 2005.  The signatories to the agreement are the Departments of Health and Children, Defence, the Health Service Executive, the Defence Forces and the Air Corps.</p>
            <p eId="para_3291">The agreement sets out the range of services to be provided by the Air Corps, specifically:</p>

            <p eId="para_3293">Air Transport of neonates requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland</p>

            <p eId="para_3297">A Steering Group comprising representation from each of the signatories to the Service Level Agreement has been established.   The Group is monitoring the operation of the agreement and will amend, if necessary, the provisions of the agreement to take account of service developments, including the new fleet replacement programme currently being put in place by the Air Corps.  The Air Corps introduced two new EC 135 helicopters into service in 2006 and intend to introduce a further six AB 139 helicopters into service (4 in 2007 and 2 in 2008).  Each of the new helicopters has a specific air ambulance capability.  The new fleet will also have a far greater flying capacity than was previously available.</p>
            <p eId="para_3298">The Department of Defence has advised that patients requiring transfer to St James's, Beaumont or the Mater Hospitals by air ambulance are flown to either Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnell, the Phoenix Park or Dublin Airport.  They are then transported by a ground ambulance to the appropriate hospital.</p>

            <p eId="para_3311">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services.  In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_3312">Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card.  The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs.  In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards.  These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>

            <p eId="para_3399">The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board has advised me that since its establishment in 1980 it has directly managed seven lakes out of the 1000 lakes in its Region as Brown Trout Fisheries, one of which is Lough Sheelin.  These fisheries, which include some of Europe's most productive wild brown trout, have been managed on the best scientific advice available.</p>
            <p eId="para_3400">The scientific advice has recommended the removal of pike from these lakes, as there is compelling evidence that pike predate heavily on brown trout reducing their stocks significantly.  While all of the pike in the early 1980s were killed on removal, changes were introduced in the 1990s, which saw many of the pike moved alive to more suitable lakes, where they contributed to the angling in those waters.</p>
            <p eId="para_3401">The Board seeks to remove pike in as healthy a condition as possible and transfer them to other pike waters, however some are killed in the process.  The Board has also advised that there are numerous locations within the Shannon Region where pike angling is available and where pike culling does not take place.  The Board actively promotes these waters to local and visiting anglers.  These waters include Lough Derravaragh which is only a short distance from Lough Sheelin.</p>
            <p eId="para_3402">This programme will not reduce the opportunities for pike angling by tourists or local anglers in the Shannon Region and will improve the opportunities for wild brown trout angling at Lough Sheelin.</p>

            <p eId="para_3404">In order to examine the introduction of a postcode system in Ireland, I established a Working Group comprised of people with experience of the postal sector, together with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Following from the recommendations of the Working Group report, I asked ComReg to appoint project managers to support the postcode project by providing technical and economic advice including assessing the costs and benefits of the introduction of a postcode.  I also appointed a National Postcode Project Board, comprising of representatives of Government Departments and public and private sector organisations to oversee the process and to submit a detailed report to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_3405">As part of its analysis, the board's advisors carried out an extensive consultation with stakeholders, both within the postal sector and outside it, with a view to arriving at a postcode model that best meets the needs of the stakeholders and measuring the likely costs and benefits of the introduction of such a postcode.  The board has presented to me, for consideration, its recommendation as to the most appropriate postcode system for Ireland, the costs and benefits arising from its introduction along with a detailed implementation plan including the levels of funding required and how those funding requirements should be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_3406">The consultants calculated that the likely upfront cost of establishing, implementing and promoting the postcode would be in the region of €15m.  There would also be ongoing annual maintenance costs but that these would to be met from revenues generated by the postcode manager.

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_875">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_3409">The National Bioenergy Action Plan sets out a series of cross-Governmental and inter-agency actions to support the development and deployment of bioenergy resources in Ireland. It is the case that the production of energy crops in Ireland is relatively underdeveloped.  The policy objective is to develop an indigenous biofuel industry sourced, where feasible, from indigenous raw materials.</p>
            <p eId="para_3410">The Bioenergy Action Plan sets out the measures aimed at encouraging farmers to grow energy crops.  The move to a biofuels obligation and establishment of ambitious targets, together with the relevant agricultural incentives will provide new opportunities for the farming community to diversify into energy crops. I am confident that this will facilitate increased participation by growers in the emerging bioenergy market.</p>
            <p eId="para_3411">In addition to measures to increase the penetration of biofuels, farmers are also being incentivised by a new €6 million bioenergy scheme to top-up the EU energy crop premium which was announced recently by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food. Under this scheme, farmers will receive an additional €80 per hectare on top of the existing €45 premium.</p>
            <p eId="para_3412">Ireland currently has 400,000 hectares of land under tillage and 75,000 hectares of land would be required if all of the 2% target were to be met from indigenous crops.  By establishing targets of 5.75% and 10% market penetration b y 2010 and 2020, we are clearly creating a market framework in which Irish farmers have significant opportunities to participate and which facilitate recycling of wastes such as recovered vegetable oil and tallow.</p>
            <p eId="para_3413">The biofuels obligation to be introduced by 2009, will provide market players and producers with long-term certainty and a more stable investment climate.  It will build on the success of the two biofuels excise relief programmes rolled-out in 2005 and 2006.  The Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes were rolled out as competitive calls for proposals.  They involved an open and transparent process in which the scoring mechanism was published as part of the application form and accompanying documentation.  The schemes were the subject of State Aids applications which were approved by DG Competition.  Under State Aids Rules the process must be open and fair and subject to single market rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_3414">The EU transport fuel market is fully liberalised and does not allow for positive discrimination.  Preference could not be given therefore to any participants within the competition by virtue of the origin of biofuels or biofuel feedstocks, or by the size or nature of the company applying for excise relief.  Under the pilot scheme, launched in 2005, eight projects were awarded excise relief on 16m litres of biofuels. 95% of the biofuels being produced under the pilot scheme involve the use of raw materials sourced in Ireland.  Scheme II, which was rolled out in 2006, was designed to move from the pilot stage to a 2% market penetration of biofuels by 2008, representing up to 163m litres of production per annum.  While there is a significant increase in indigenous feedstock being used in this scheme, it is too early to state the precise percentage of indigenous raw materials that will be used.  The majority of projects under Scheme II however have indicated that are producing or intend to produce biofuels on the island of Ireland, and have indicated that Irish feedstocks will be used.  In the case of larger scale, long-term developments under the Scheme, where significant investments are required, a degree of imports have been identified as necessary until facilities and feedstock supply chains are in place. I can confirm however that the majority of applicants under the scheme have indicated that it is their immediate or longer term intention to locate processing facilities in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3415">In announcing the obligation, we have also committed to achieving 5.75% market penetration of biofuels by 2009, in advance of the date proposed for such a target in the EU Biofuels Directive.  The Government is also committed to achieving 10% market penetration of biofuels in Ireland by 2020.  The obligation will be rolled out in 2009 after consultations this year with the stakeholders in relation to the specific details of the scheme and we will also be working towards the introduction of appropriate legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3417">The Government's policy with regard to the future of the postal service, as set out in my Department's statement of strategy, has three principal aims: to ensure Irish industry and domestic customers enjoy competitively priced, high-quality postal services; to maintain a nationwide postal service and viable network, with uniform tariffs applying throughout the State; and to develop the postal service in such a way that it will underpin Ireland's key economic objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_3418">These issues, in particular ensuring that Irish consumers have access to a broad suite of high-quality postal services and the maintenance of the universal service obligation, are of key importance to Ireland in the context of the future full liberalisation of the European postal market, which is due to take place in 2009, subject to political agreement. I intend to hold a public consultation examining the key issues in the draft directive, later in the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3419">While the Government will support An Post in any way it can, it is the responsibility of the board and senior management team to make strategic decisions regarding the future of the company, how it will prepare itself for further competition and the number and type of post offices in the network.  In preparation for competition, it is vital that the company restructures itself effectively and that management and trade unions in An Post work together to transform the company into an efficient and modern service provider by implementing the agreed restructuring programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3423">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</p>
            <p eId="para_3424">It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country. In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in over 120 towns and cities.  These MANs will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.  My Department has also provided grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3425">However, despite Government and private investment in broadband I am aware that there are still some parts of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.  A Steering Committee comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently finalising the proposed National Broadband Scheme, which will aim to provide broadband to these unserved areas.  The Steering Committee has met with Service Providers and key stakeholders about this scheme which, when it is fully rolled out, will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in unserved areas are met.  Work on the design of an appropriate public tender is underway. Indicative maps are being prepared to help inform the tendering process.  It is not possible, at this point in time, to specify what exact areas of the country will receive broadband under this scheme. However areas without any broadband service should be provided with a service under the scheme, provided the cost of provision is not unreasonable.</p>

            <p eId="para_3429">The current Foreshore public consultation process, requires that notices are published in local and national newspapers informing the public that an application has been made for a Foreshore Licence, and that the Environmental Impact Assessment (including photomontages) are available in a publicly accessible place (e.g. Garda Station or Library), and this will continue.

            <p eId="para_3594">I propose to take Questions Nos. 357 and 358 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3595">Under the Fisheries Acts, the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards are primarily responsible for the management, conservation, protection, development and improvement of inland fisheries sector and I have been advised that they are actively targeting the threat that zebra mussels pose.</p>
            <p eId="para_3596">Illegal introductions and the translocation of zebra mussels from one water body to another have the potential to do serious damage.</p>
            <p eId="para_3597">Perhaps the most effective measures which can be enacted to curtail this are educational. People must be advised of the dangers associated with their actions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3598">The Fisheries Boards have produced leaflets which have been distributed to all relevant groups, and have published information on their web sites alerting the public, and anglers in particular, to the dangers associated with the zebra mussel.</p>
            <p eId="para_3599">The Fisheries Boards and some local authorities have erected notices alerting anglers and boat owners to the dangers associated with these species and provide advice on appropriate steps to take to control the spread.</p>
            <p eId="para_3600">The Fisheries Boards have recently participated with Galway County Council, the Western River Basin District and a third level institution on the production of a television programme highlighting the spread of unwelcome species which have appeared in Lough Corrib and other waters.</p>
            <p eId="para_3601">The Central Fisheries Board with support from Waterways Ireland, Galway County Council, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Office of Public Works and the Western Regional Fisheries Board published a calendar for 2007 advising the public of the need to halt the spread of non-native invasive species and this has been widely circulated.</p>
            <p eId="para_3602">The Boards will continue to develop and deliver appropriate programmes to tackle the zebra mussel problem.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_3604">The Government has invested in broadband infrastructure through investment in private sector infrastructure, the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and through the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3605">During 2000 and 2001 grants of almost €35 million were awarded to private sector companies. The largest of these projects were ESB Telecoms installation of a new national fibre backbone network, and roll-out of DSL (digital subscriber line) services by Eircom and BT Ireland. Grant payments were made during the following three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3606">The Group Broadband Scheme was launched in 2004 with a budget of €25 million.  The scheme is co-funded by the E-Commerce and Communications Measure of the Boarder Midlands &amp; Western and Southern &amp; Eastern Regional Operational Programmes of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The Government offered funding of up to 55%, the maximum allowable under EU rules in the BMW Region and funding of up to 30%, the maximum allowable in the S&amp;E Region.</p>
            <p eId="para_3607">There were two calls for proposals under the Group Broadband Scheme. Approximately €6 million was committed in grant aid for 162 approved projects. The criteria to draw down the grant is available on the Departments website www.gbs.gov.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_3608">Under the Metropolitan Area Network (MANs) Programme (Phase One) the Department offered grant aid to Local Authorities of €78 million for the construction of 27 high speed, open access fibre optic networks.  Under phase two of the programme it is estimated that further Grant Aid of approximately €118 million will be drawdown by the Local Authorities for the construction of over 90 networks.</p>

            <p eId="para_3610">I would like to assure the Deputy that I am well aware of the concerns which traditional fishermen have raised in relation to mussel farms. Where disputes arise, every effort is made to encourage discussion to find an appropriate solution. With increased activity around our coast from fish farming and other activity it is important to support arrangements that balance the needs of all activities and ensures that fishing activities both traditional and more recent are supported and allowed to prosper.</p>
            <p eId="para_3611">In January the Government launched the strategic report of the Seafood Strategy Review Group (SSRG) on the seafood industry — ‘Steering A New Course'. The report, which took on board the views of fishermen, fish farmers, processors, marketers and other stakeholders, focuses on ten core themes and outlines specific actions to be taken in order to achieve a sustainable seafood industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_3612">I have established an implementation Group under the chairmanship of Dr. Noel Cawley to implement the recommendations of the report ‘Steering a new course'. The independent group comprises representatives from all the main sectors including inshore fishermen and also aquaculture. I am confident that within the framework of the strategic report, opportunities are available to address issues arising from the competing interests of the sectors. In the meantime BIM is available at a local level to discuss any issues/concerns that individuals may have.</p>

            <p eId="para_3614">An Post operates within a regulatory framework as enshrined in EU and Irish law and therefore, the universal service obligation, which includes nationwide postal delivery requirements, is a statutory requirement for An Post, as the designated universal service provider. Statutory Instrument 616 of 2002 European Communities (Postal Services) Regulations provides that An Post is obliged to make one postal delivery per day on not less than five days a week to the homes and premises of every person resident within the state. In addition, Section 12 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 provides that counter services should be provided for the company's own business and Government business.</p>
            <p eId="para_3615">In relation to the structures in place to meet such obligations, it is the responsibility of An Post to ensure that these are in place. Furthermore, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), is the regulatory body responsible for the monitoring, measurement and regulation of the postal sector including measuring the levels of service to be achieved by An Post and ensuring that the company abides by its statutory universal service obligations.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_897">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_3647">Since 2000, the State has invested EUR €93.75 million in the Digital Hub project. That sum comprises an initial investment in property purchase of €73.64 million for circa 9 acres in the Thomas Street/Liberties area of Dublin. State of the art telecommunications infrastructure investment came to €2.29 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_3648">The remainder of the amount is made up of operational expenditure. To date, the Agency has received exchequer assistance of EUR €15.3 million in order to meet its performance targets.  Total private sector investment in the Agency has amounted to EUR €3.4 million. Additional investment has been, and continues to be, undertaken by firms who choose to locate in the Hub.</p>
            <p eId="para_3649">In terms of growth, the Agency has grown the cluster to 80 companies now employing over 500 employees in the Hub. These enterprises are involved in a range of activities including gaming, software development, mobile technology, animation and TV production.</p>
            <p eId="para_3650">Estimates suggest that the Global Digital Media industry will be worth over EUR €1 billion by 2009. I have no doubt the digital media space will be a real platform for the next wave of innovative Irish entrepreneurs to flourish.  Currently in Ireland there are between 400-500 companies in this space, employing almost 3,500 people. In 2003 there were few foreign owned digital media companies in Ireland. Today 20% of the Digital Hub companies are foreign-owned.</p>
            <p eId="para_3651">In order to support the development of the Hub and expand the number of high value added jobs in the Digital Media industry, I announced in November 2005, the acceptance of tenders for two separate sites in the Digital Hub area.  In return for 6 acres of land, the State will receive a combination of €72.4 million in cash and €45.7 million in high quality offices, which will accommodate digital enterprises as the Digital Hub grows. The break down of the tenders means that the Digital Hub will receive over 150,000 square foot of office space by 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_3652">From an economic perspective this shows a reasonable return for the State. However, the Digital Hub has delivered significant returns from an educational and social perspective.  The Diageo Liberties Learning Initiative (DLLI) provides a distinctive approach to digital literacy in teaching and learning within schools in the Liberties area and offers a viable template in terms of advancing progress towards a system that allows teachers nationwide to use digital tools in a cross-curriculum manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_3653">DLLI also holds considerable potential to address the digital imbalance in this locality whereby technology has become a resource that can address the needs of the local community, empowering participants to accustom themselves with the digital age.</p>

            <p eId="para_3722">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</p>
            <p eId="para_3723">I am aware of the importance of the availability of telecommunications services including broadband to ensuring the continued economic and social prosperity of this country. It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country. In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage. These include investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in over 120 towns and cities. These MANs will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs. My Department has also provided grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3724">However, despite Government and private investment in broadband I am aware that there are still some parts of the country, where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. A Steering Committee comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently finalising a proposed scheme, entitled the National Broadband Scheme which will address the question of availability of broadband to unserved areas. The Steering Committee has meet with Service Providers and key stakeholders on the National Broadband Scheme. The scheme, when it is fully rolled out, will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in these unserved areas are met. Work on the design of an appropriate public tender is underway.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3744">"So far no adverse short or long-term health effects have been found from exposure to the radiofrequency (RF) signals produced by mobile phones and base station transmitters. RF signals have not been found to cause cancer. However research is underway to investigate whether there are likely to be any subtle, non-cancer effects on children and adolescents. The results of this research will need to be considered in due course."</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3745">"There is limited scientific evidence of an association between Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) magnetic fields and childhood leukaemia. This does not mean that ELF magnetic fields cause cancer, but the possibility cannot be excluded. However considerable research carried out in laboratories has not supported this possibility, and overall the evidence is considered weak, suggesting it is unlikely that ELF magnetic fields cause leukaemia in children."</p>
            <p eId="para_3746">The Government published the Report of the Expert Group last week and copies will be made available to all Deputies as soon as the printed version is available. The Report is also available on my Department website www.dcmnr.gov.ie.</p>

I issued a statement condemning the decision in the retrial by the Libyan Court on 19 December 2006. We have pressed the issue at EU level on many occasions. I discussed this case with my EU colleagues at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 22 January. The Council expressed its grave concern over the unacceptable verdict of the Criminal Court in Libya. The Council also called for the urgent conclusion of the judicial process according to internationally accepted standards. The EU expects the Libyan authorities to ensure that a positive, fair and prompt solution is brought to this case, leading expeditiously to the release of the medical workers.

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_3778">I propose to take Questions Nos. 437 and 438 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3779">The political, economic and human rights situation in Zimbabwe is a matter of the most serious concern. There is currently no indication that the Zimbabwean government is willing to alter the malign policies which have destroyed the country's economy. Nor is there any sign of an intention to introduce real and necessary democratic reforms. On the contrary, we have seen increased repression, with large-scale arrests of peaceful demonstrators. There is incontrovertible evidence that opposition activists, including Morgan Tsvangarai, the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, have been seriously ill-treated in police detention following a peaceful church-sponsored rally organised by the Save Zimbabwe Campaign on 11 March.</p>
            <p eId="para_3780">Not only has the Zimbabwean Government failed to discharge its responsibility for the safety and wellbeing of those in custody, but the open and unapologetic attitude of President Mugabe and the Zimbabwean leadership to this shocking incident was outrageous. The police action in the break up of the protest contravenes the internationally recognised rights of freedom of speech and of assembly. The ill-treatment of those in custody also infringes international human rights standards, including the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, of which Zimbabwe is a signatory. On 12 March, the EU Presidency issued a statement on behalf of the Union condemning the violent break-up of the protest on 11 March and the ongoing violent suppression of the freedom of opinion and of assembly, as well as of other fundamental rights in Zimbabwe.</p>
            <p eId="para_3781">In a further development, on 18 March opposition MP Nelson Chamisa was arrested and brutally treated while on his way to an EU meeting in Brussels, while on 17 March two other opposition MPs were delayed in leaving Zimbabwe for medical treatment. The EU Presidency has issued a statement expressing its outrage at these acts and calling on the Zimbabwean Government to release all detained opposition politicians immediately, to enable them to have access to legal assistance and medical care, and to allow representatives of the EU Presidency to visit them.</p>
            <p eId="para_3782">I issued a statement earlier this month on behalf of the Government, condemning the disgraceful actions of the police, and expressing my condolences to the family of the protester who was killed. I urged the Zimbabwean government to cease suppressing the basic fundamental rights of its people. I noted that a new approach, which includes dialogue between all political forces, is needed to resolve Zimbabwe's serious political, social and economic problems. It is planned that Ireland will be among the countries making national statements on Zimbabwe when the UN Human Rights Council considers the situation there tomorrow. Now is the time for the international community, including the EU and the members of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), to work together to help bring about peaceful change in Zimbabwe. I agree that Zimbabwe's African neighbours have an especially important role to play.</p>
            <p eId="para_3783">African Union President John Kufuor of Ghana, AU chairman Alpha Konare, and Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa have all spoken of their concern at events in Zimbabwe. President Kikwete of Tanzania visited Harare earlier this month and met with government and opposition leaders in an attempt to influence the situation positively. Events in Zimbabwe will be discussed at a SADC meeting in Tanzania on 28-29 March. I hope the leaders of those countries which are most affected by the overspill of Zimbabwe's problems will speak out and highlight instances where the policies of the Mugabe government contravene the human rights standards on which Africa seeks to base its future development.</p>
            <p eId="para_3784">As a mark of the EU's concern, EU Presidencies in the SADC countries have taken the step of expressing to their host governments' the concern of the EU and its Member States about the recent developments in Zimbabwe. A special meeting of EU officials has been scheduled for 4 April to focus on Zimbabwe only . The EU already has restrictive measures in place against the leadership of Zimbabwe, and last month the Common Position on these restrictive measures was renewed until February 2008. These measures are designed to affect the Zimbabwean leadership, without adding to the suffering of the people of Zimbabwe.</p>
            <p eId="para_3785">The Embassy of Ireland in Pretoria monitors allegations of human rights abuses in Zimbabwe. The Embassy raises issues of concern in relation to human rights with the Zimbabwean government at all levels and at every available opportunity — most recently when our Ambassador to South Africa, who is also accredited to Zimbabwe, presented credentials in Harare on 23 February 2007. I have instructed Ambassador Wrafter to travel to Harare to convey our concerns directly and forcefully to the Zimbabwean authorities, and he has requested an urgent appointment with them.</p>
            <p eId="para_3786">I am acutely conscious of the suffering caused by the dire economic situation in Zimbabwe, and of the need to provide support directly to the ordinary people there. Irish Aid is continuing to provide assistance for the people of Zimbabwe, through NGO partners and through UN agencies. Total Irish Aid funding to the Zimbabwean people in 2006 amounted to almost €8 million. So far in 2007, Irish Aid has given €2.4m in emergency and recovery assistance to Zimbabwe. A further €3m has been allocated for local NGOs which are working on HIV/Aids, and €1.4 million will be allocated to Trócaire and Concern.</p>

            <p eId="para_3788">My Department has no direct function in the establishment of a national centre of adapted physical activity for people with a disability. However, the Institute of Technology, Tralee has applied to my Department for funding under the 2007 sports capital programme towards the provision of sports facilities for such a centre, as part of its overall capital development programme at the Institute.</p>
            <p eId="para_3789">Applications for funding under the 2007 sports capital programme received before the deadline of November 24th 2006 are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.  I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_3791">As the Deputy is aware, the Irish Sports Council (ISC) is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport including initiatives to promote sport at local level.  The provision in funding for the ISC in the 2007 Estimates is €54.025 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_3792">Following an independent review in 2005 of the Local Sports Partnerships (LSPs), through which sports initiatives at local level are delivered and coordinated, I gave approval to the ISC to extend the LSP network from 2006 on a national basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3793">Funding has been provided to the ISC to facilitate continued extension of the network of LSPs on a national basis.  Three new LSPs were established in 2006 and there are now 19 LSPs fully operational with an additional six sites now in the development stage.  The Council is on track to have a minimum of five new sites established by mid-year.  All remaining sites have met with representatives of the Council with regard to their next steps and I would envisage the Council meeting its target of having 29 fully established LSPs by year-end.  That would leave a maximum of three areas in the advanced development phase with the aim of making appointments at Co-ordinator level in the first Quarter of 2008 as scheduled.  They will make an essential contribution to reaching the Council's ambitious targets for increasing the participation rates of adults and children in sport in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_3795">The sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and to voluntary and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3796">The amount of grant aid allocated on a county basis under the programme in each of the past ten years is contained in the following tabular statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3797">All applications received under the programme are assessed on an individual basis by my Department in accordance with a detailed set of assessment criteria as specified in the guidelines, terms and conditions that accompany the application form for the programme.  The assessment process takes into account factors such as the existing level of facilities in an area, the number and quality of the applications received, the amount of funding being sought by each applicant and the strategic positioning of major facilities that may be required as well as the most recent Census of Population figures.  I am satisfied that every effort is made to achieve a balanced geographical spread of funds throughout the country, while also affording priority to projects in areas of social and economic disadvantage.</p>

            <p eId="para_4149">Government support for the Arts is generally channelled through the Arts Council, which is a statutorily independent body, under the Arts Act, 2003, and is independent in its day-to-day operations, including in relation to its funding decisions.   I have no role in relation to its funding decisions. During my own term as the Minister responsible for the arts, funding for the Arts Council has increased by almost 68% from €47.67 million in 2002 to €80 million in 2007.  These are significant amounts of money in any context and have transformed and increased access to the arts and allowed the Arts Council to support artists and arts organisations nationwide.</p>

            <p eId="para_4151">I am aware of the project in question, which is the proposed establishment of a permanent national scouting jamboree centre, whose most recent estimated cost was €10.7 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_4152">I can confirm that I met the promoters of this project in July 2003 in the course of which potential funding options were mentioned.  One of these, the Tourism Product Development Scheme, was not a matter for my Department but was operated by Fáilte Ireland with grant decisions taken by an independent Management Board.  As far as programmes operated by my Department are concerned, the project applied unsuccessfully for funding under my Department's sports capital programme in 2002. It was explained to the promoters of the project that it was not suitable for consideration for funding under the sports capital programme as only projects directly related to the provision of sport and recreational sport facilities are considered for funding under that programme and the sporting element of the project in question was a very small proportion of the overall cost. Scouting Ireland has not submitted a subsequent application for the project to the sports capital programme since 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_4153">The issue of funding for this project was debated as an adjournment item in the House on February 28th 2006 during which I repeated that I have no source of funding available to me to assist this project, which is primarily a centre for the scouting movement. I advised the organisers of the project to seek alternative sources of funding, most notably the EU-funded PEACE II and PEACE III cross-border programmes, on which the special EU programmes body in Belfast can provide further information.</p>

            <p eId="para_4158">I also understand that the person concerned had a case for unfair dismissal heard by the Employment Appeals Tribunal on 3rd December 2001, after he had been laid off with effect from 13th October 2000.  He was successful in this appeal and was to be reinstated to his position. It is unclear whether or not the reinstatement ever occurred. The person concerned was not among the group of 105 employees who received statutory redundancy payments from the Social Insurance Fund after his employer went into liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4159">An employee must seek a statutory redundancy lump sum from his former employer within 12 months of the date of termination of his employment. The Employment Appeals Tribunal has discretion to extend this 12-month period to 2 years. As it is now approaching 4 years since his employer went into liquidation, the person concerned is now out of time for bringing a claim for a statutory redundancy payment before the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p>

            <p eId="para_4163">In the period 2002 to 2006 a total of 790 new jobs were created in IDA supported companies in County Sligo.  Details of the number of jobs created in each of those years is set out in the following tabular statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4164">A central goal for IDA Ireland is the achievement of balanced regional development.  The Agency's strategy for Sligo has been to promote the County as part of an integrated North West region with a population base of 236,656 (Census 2006). The Agency's focus is on the Gateway town of Sligo and the linked Gateway of Letterkenny-Derry.</p>
            <p eId="para_4165">Sligo has traditionally been a centre of manufacturing.  However, over recent years it has proved challenging to maintain investment in this sector in the County as much of this investment globally is going to low cost destinations such as Eastern Europe and China.  As a result of this locational shift in global manufacturing Sligo experienced a number of closures and downsizings. Despite this, there are approximately 2,450 people in full time employment in 21 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Sligo.</p>
            <p eId="para_4166">IDA Ireland is marketing Sligo as a key location for investment in the following sectors: Medical Technologies, Globally Traded Business and Financial Services.  In addition, the Agency is working closely with educational institutions in the Sligo region, in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the County.  The Agency is also working with utility and infrastructure providers to develop the enterprise environment and with FAS to provide guidance in developing the skill-sets needed by those in the workforce.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
            <p eId="para_4183">The Redundancy Payments Scheme was established on 1st January 1968.  The scheme is governed by the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, the Redundancy Payments Act 1971, the Redundancy Payments Act 1979 and the Redundancy Payments Act 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_4184">In general, a redundant employee with at least 2 years service in an employment is entitled to receive 2 weeks pay per year of service plus one extra week's pay at the gross rate of pay up to a ceiling of €600 per week.  Wages in excess of €600 per week should not be included when calculating a statutory redundancy lump sum payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4185">It is up to the employer to pay the statutory payment in the first instance.  When an employer pays the statutory redundancy lump sums to the employees, he is entitled to claim a rebate of 60% from the Social Insurance Fund by submitting completed forms RP50 in respect of each redundant employee to the Department for processing.  When the necessary checks are carried out on the claims and officials of the Department are satisfied that the claims are in order, then a payable order in respect of 60% of the statutory amounts paid to the employees is issued to the employer in settlement of his claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_4186">If the employer is unable to pay the statutory amount but gives the employee the necessary documentation to claim the statutory lump sum from the Social Insurance Fund (completed form RP50) then the employee can be paid directly by the Department from the Fund on foot of the form RP50.</p>
            <p eId="para_4187">In cases when the statutory redundancy lump sums are paid directly by the Department to the employees, 40% of each statutory redundancy lump sum paid is recoverable from the assets of the employer by the Department for the Social Insurance Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_4188">This statutory Redundancy Recoveries function is provided for in Sections 42 and 43 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967 as amended by Section 14 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1971 and amended further by Section 14 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1979.</p>
            <p eId="para_4189">Section 42 of the 1967 Act, as amended by Section 14 of the 1979 Act, gives me, as Minister, preferential status in a winding-up situation in recovering amounts paid from the Social Insurance Fund.  Thus, under Section 14 of the 1979 Act, a redundancy lump sum (or part thereof) is made a priority debt under Section 285 of the Companies Act, 1963, in cases of winding-up, and a priority debt under Section 81 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1988, in cases of a bankrupt or arranging debtor.</p>
            <p eId="para_4190">Section 43 of the 1967 Act also makes general provision whereby all monies due to the Fund (whether in a winding-up situation or not) are debts, which can be recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_4191">Section 14 (5) of the 1971 Act makes provision for companies in liquidation/receivership /bankruptcy/administration or insolvent companies to get the benefit of 60% rebate in determining their outstanding debt to the Fund in respect of statutory redundancy lump sum payments made by the Department to eligible employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_4192">As can be seen from the foregoing, I have no discretion with regard to the 40% due to the Social Insurance Fund.  I have no legal powers to divert — from the Social Insurance Fund to the employees concerned — monies which may be recovered from the assets of Castlemahon Food Products.</p>

            <p eId="para_4216">The existing cross-border free travel scheme, introduced in July 1995, applies to all free travel pass holders, to enable them make journeys from a point in the Republic to a destination in Northern Ireland. A spouse/partner or companion (in the case of a companion pass holder) may travel with the pass holder for free on point to point cross-border journeys.</p>
            <p eId="para_4217">I have recently announced the implementation of the all-Ireland free travel scheme commencing from April 2nd.  This new scheme will extend the existing cross-border free travel arrangements by allowing pensioners resident here travel free of charge on all bus and rail services in Northern Ireland.  Likewise, pensioners in Northern Ireland will travel free of charge on participating transport services in this State.</p>
            <p eId="para_4218">More than 600,000 customers are in receipt of free travel, of which 430,000 are aged over 66 years.  The all-Ireland free travel scheme is based on the existence of criteria of entitlement to free travel North and South for pensioners and applies only in this category.</p>
            <p eId="para_4219">The extension of the scheme to an all-Ireland free service for pensioners represents a significant expansion in travel opportunities. I will continue to examine any opportunities to further improve and expand on what will, from April 2nd, be a very comprehensive free travel scheme. Any additional developments would have to be agreed and worked out in conjunction with the authorities in Northern Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_4221">In February 2006 as part of its reform of the Health Sector, the Government decided to transfer certain functions from the Health Service Executive to my Department. Arising from that decision, administration of the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, as well as certain other functions, will be transferred to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4222">The SWA scheme is currently administered by some 700 Community Welfare Officers (CWOs), 59 superintendents and other staff within the Community Welfare Service of the HSE. The transfer of functions will not change the role of the CWOs who will remain community based and, in addition to providing financial supports to individuals, will continue to provide key information, advice, advocacy and referral links between agencies. There will be no loss of flexibility, discretion or personal service on the part of CWOs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4223">The implementation of the programme will be carefully managed to ensure that continuity of the SWA scheme and related services is maintained.

            <p eId="para_4225">Carer's allowance is a means tested social welfare payment for people providing full time care and attention to people who need it.  In line with social assistance payments generally, one of the eligibility requirements for carer's allowance is that the applicant be habitually resident in the State.  This requirement was introduced in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.  The relevant section of the Act, section 17, came into effect from 1 May 2004 by way of Statutory Instrument Number 184 of 2004.  Section 180 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 is the primary legislation governing this provision in relation to carer's allowance.</p>

The question as to what is a person's "habitual residence" is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the criteria to be applied in determining whether or not a person is habitually resident.</p>

            <p eId="para_4238">The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker's scheme which was introduced in and took effect from 1994. The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.</p>
            <p eId="para_4239">For any year to be disregarded, a homemaker must be out of the workforce for a complete year (52 weeks). Provision is also made for the award of credited contributions in the year in which a person commences or ceases to be a homemaker.</p>
            <p eId="para_4240">The question of backdating the homemaker's scheme gives rise to difficult and complex issues, not least of which is the position of other groups excluded from social insurance cover over the years and who do not qualify for contributory pensions. In general, changes to insurability of employment are not backdated and the same principle was applied to the homemaker's scheme when it was introduced in 1994.</p>
            <p eId="para_4241">A Green Paper on pensions is currently being prepared and will deal with the full range of issues and challenges associated with the pensions system including the issues relating to backdating the homemaker's scheme. Following the publication of the Green Paper there will be a consultation process leading to the development of a long-term policy framework on pensions.</p>

            <p eId="para_4280">Under the Maritime Safety Act 2005 local authorities have been given the powers to regulate and control fast powered craft in their functional areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_4281">The legal framework to regulate fast powered craft, provided for in the Maritime Safety Act 2005 arose from the Report of the Action Group on Small Powered Recreational Craft (including personal watercraft) in 2000 which concluded that the primary public policy response to regulating such craft should be the use of local by-laws.</p>
            <p eId="para_4282">Conditions and issues vary in different parts of the country and it makes sense that those closest to the issues and with local knowledge should regulate for the particular circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_4283">Section 6 of the Maritime Safety Act 2005, provides that by-laws may be made regulating or controlling the operation of specified craft, including jet skis, by Local Authorities, harbour authorities and Waterways Ireland in waters under their control or management or in their functional area. The prohibition or restriction of such craft will be for the purposes of safety to persons, prevention of nuisance or injury, damage to watercraft or property and to protect national heritage areas and protected monuments.</p>
            <p eId="para_4284">The Maritime Safety Directorate (MSD) of my Department has prepared and issued guidelines to the relevant authorities on the powers available to them to regulate craft under the 2005 Act.

            <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_4295">For ease of reference I am enclosing my original reply to Parliamentary Question No. 202 of 8 March 2007.  PWC were appointed to advise on the implementation of the State Airports Act 2004 including the development of Business Plans by the three State Airports.  The total cost to date was €217,506 (inclusive of VAT).</p>
            <p eId="para_4296">In 2003 my Department engaged the services of PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC)  in association with Matheson Ormsby Prentice and Steer Davies Gleave to advise on the restructuring of the State Airports and on the drafting of the State Airports Act 2004.  After the enactment of the legislation PWC were also engaged to advise me and the Minister for Finance on the implementation of the State Airports Act, and particularly on the development of Business Plans by the three Airports.</p>
            <p eId="para_4297">The current position with regard to the development of Shannon Airport is that if it is to develop as a successful and sustainable business, it is clear that one of major issues that must be addressed in its business plan is the airport's uncompetitive cost base. When that obstacle is overcome the Airport will have a real opportunity to develop new markets and to attract the airline customers that it needs for its commercial future.</p>
            <p eId="para_4298">In this context, I am glad to see that the Labour Relations Commission has once again engaged with all parties to seek to resolve the outstanding issues following the recent rejection of a comprehensive package designed to deal with the costs issues at Shannon put forward by the Dublin Airport Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_4299">The Cork Airport Development Project, which was completed last year, is comprised not only of a new terminal, but also a fire station, car parks, a combined utility building and new roads and pathways and associated works at a total cost of €184 million. As I have said before, the funding of these developments will have to take account, not only of what is commercially and financially feasible for Cork Airport, but also what is commercially and financially feasible for Dublin Airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_4300">If the Cork Airport Authority is to achieve autonomy in the foreseeable future, it will have to accept responsibility for a reasonable portion of the outstanding debt of €200 million, in return for the substantial assets to be transferred to it on separation. In deciding what level of debt is to be borne by Cork, it will have to be manifest to all concerned that it is a manageable debt burden that would not put at risk the airport's commercial future.</p>
            <p eId="para_4301">The future plans for both Shannon and Cork as independent airports must have regard to the capacity of each airport to contribute to its own capital investment programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4323">The position is that the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme in 2005 brought the new concept of Payment Entitlements into the direct payments system.  Payment entitlements are not attached to land but are the property of the farmer who was farming during the reference period and was in receipt of direct payments under one or more of the Livestock Premium and/or Arable Aid schemes. Entitlements may now be sold with or without land but can only be sold without land once 80% have been used in one calendar year.  On the other hand entitlements may only be leased to another farmer if accompanied by an equivalent number of hectares of eligible land. Entitlements may also of course be transferred, with or without land, by gift or through inheritance.  The registration details of entitlements may also be changed (for example from one name to joint names).  In the event of inheritance of an estate where the land is bequeathed to one party and the residue of the estate is bequeathed to another party, the entitlements form part of the residue of the estate unless otherwise specified in the will.  Where no will exists the entitlements, while forming part of the estate, are not attached to the land.  My Department has taken every opportunity of informing farmers and others about the rules pertaining to the transfer of payment entitlements.  The Department has also written to the Incorporated Law Society pointing out the need for members of the legal profession, who are dealing with the succession of estates where Single payment entitlements are involved, to fully familiarise themselves with the rules pertaining to these entitlements.</p>

The Regulations governing the transfer of entitlements allow that Single payment entitlements may be transferred without land only if the transferor has used at least 80% of his entitlements. A person uses entitlements by submitting one hectare of land per entitlement on their Single payment scheme application form. While the person named activated his entitlements in 2005 he did not in fact use any of them in 2005 or 2006. My Department wrote to the person named in February of this year outlining the position with regard to his non-utilised entitlements and advising him of his options for 2007.  The case will now be examined in the light of the details supplied by the Deputy and my Department will write to the person named shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_4329">The position is that an application under the Single Payment Scheme-Disadvantaged Area Compensatory Allowance Scheme was received from the person named on 12 May 2006. As part of the control procedures under EU legislation governing the Single Payment Scheme, the application was randomly selected for and was the subject of a cross compliance inspection on 4 November 2006. During the course of the inspection errors were discovered with regard to the identification and registration of bovine animals that resulted in a 5% cross compliance penalty being recorded. The person named had also been the subject of a cross compliance inspection in 2005 and had incurred a 5% penalty for a similar infringement. Under the EU Regulations governing Cross Compliance and the rules regarding repetition of non-compliance, his penalty in 2005 was therefore multiplied by 3 to calculate the final penalty for 2006. This has resulted in a 15% penalty being applied to his Single Payment for 2006. If the person named is not satisfied with the result of the inspection, he may seek a review by contacting his Local Office. To date no review has been sought. He also has the right to appeal the outcome of any such review.</p>

This figure includes incomplete applications (e.g. missing the required drawings) and those for which planning permission has either not yet been applied for or is still awaited.   Farmers and their advisers have until 29 June 2007 to submit the required drawings and, where planning permission is required, to confirm that they have applied for planning permission.   Of course, approval to proceed with the works concerned cannot issue until written evidence of the issue of such planning permission has been received by my Department.   To date, 370 approvals have been issued to farmers in Sligo to commence work under the Scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4380">The policy towards on-farm inspection has been to give advance notification of up to 48 hours in all cases.  This policy of systematic preannouncement of inspections was questioned by the European Commission in July 2006 and its unacceptability was conveyed to my Department in a formal communication in August.  As a result my Department was obliged to agree to a proportion of Single Payment Scheme inspections being carried out in 2006 without prior notification.  Some 650 farms out of 130,000 involved in the Single Payment Scheme were subsequently selected for unannounced inspection.  The balance of inspection cases, representing some 92% of the 7,514 farms selected for Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme inspection in 2006, were all pre-notified to the farmer.</p>
            <p eId="para_4381">The EU regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme would allow my Department to give prenotification of inspection in all cases where certain elements of cross-compliance are involved e.g. the Nitrates Regulations.  However, my Department is committed, in the Charter of Rights for Farmers 2005-2007 to carrying out all Single Payment Scheme and Disadvantaged Area Scheme checks during one single farm visit in most cases.  This then obliges my Department to respect the advance notice requirements applicable to the most stringent element of the inspection regime viz. maximum of 48 hours notice but with no advance notice in a proportion of cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_4382">My Department believes that prenotification of Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme inspections fits in with the practicalities of Irish agriculture where increasingly, farmers are also engaged in off-farm employment.  In a decoupled Single Payment Scheme system, the provision of advance notification of inspection to the farmer should not negatively impact on the effectiveness of the control.  However, as the EU regulations stand, my Department is obliged to carry out a proportion of inspections without prior notification and this is what was done in 2006.  My Department is seeking authority to allow advance notification in all inspection cases and I will continue to press this point in the CAP simplification process.  The Commission is at an advanced stage in finalising a review document on cross-compliance.  The review will include the question of advance notice of inspections and will be discussed by Agriculture Ministers in April.</p>
            <p eId="para_4383">In tandem with this, my Department is carrying out a full review of the inspection arrangements and checklists for the Single Payment Scheme with a view to simplification of the arrangements (including paperwork) where possible while, at the same time, ensuring compliance with the regulatory requirements. The review of the inspection report forms together with the outcome of the Commission's review of the cross-compliance arrangements generally, will be fully discussed with the farming organisations before the Single Payment Scheme inspections for 2007 get under way.</p>

            <p eId="para_4402">The position is that the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme and my Department's commitment in the Charter of Rights for farmers to ensure maximum integration of inspections has resulted in a drop in annual on-farm inspection levels from 18,000 under the coupled regime to less than 8,000 in 2006. I agree that the inspection requirements linked to cross-compliance are complex and I am committed to negotiating significant changes in the context of the simplification exercise, which is currently underway in the Commission.  I think it needs to be made clear however that the inspection checklist on cross-compliance is not a document for completion by the farmer but is an internal Department document.</p>
            <p eId="para_4403">It is important also to bear in mind that the controls under the various direct payment schemes are set out in EU Regulations. Failure to ensure a satisfactory control environment leaves a member State open to serious financial penalty — a fact that cannot be lightly dismissed given the magnitude of annual payments of  €1.9 billion to Irish farmers under the Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and REPS. Nonetheless, I believe that the cross-compliance inspection requirements are overly demanding on farmers. It is my clearly held view that some practical amendments can be secured without in any way undermining the objectives of cross-compliance or putting accountability in the disbursement of EU and national funds at risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_4404">As I have made clear already, I have raised my concerns about the Single Payment Scheme — particularly the inspection arrangements and the need for advance notice  — with Commissioner Fischer Boel on a number of occasions. I have also discussed the problems with Minister Seehofer, the German President of the Agriculture Council and I am assured of his commitment to dealing with the issues over the next few months.</p>
            <p eId="para_4405">The Commission is finalising a review document on cross-compliance. This document is due to be presented to the Agriculture Council for discussion by Ministers in April.

            <p eId="para_4410">Force Majeure does not provide for the allocation of additional entitlements, but allows for the exclusion of certain years during the reference period 2000-2002, where production was adversely affected in the calculation of Single Payment entitlements or if the whole reference period is affected then the alternative reference period 1997-1999 can be utilised.</p>

            <p eId="para_4426">Issues relating to wild deer are primarily the responsibility of the Parks and Wildlife Divisions of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  My Department does not operate an official programme for the eradication of tuberculosis in deer and therefore does not routinely test or sample deer herds for TB. It does, however, provide on-going advice to keepers on disease control measures and bio security in relation to wildlife, including deer. My Department also provides advice and assistance to farmers and their veterinary practitioners who may experience a TB problem in farmed deer.</p>
            <p eId="para_4427">However, when an outbreak of TB is identified in a cattle herd, an epidemiological investigation is carried out by my Department to identify the possible and probable sources of the infection and thus to provide relevant advice to the farmer. These investigations reveal that deer are very infrequently implicated in bovine TB outbreaks.  Where epidemiological investigations indicate that the source of TB infection in bovines may be wild deer, staff from my Department liaise with personnel from the National Parks and Wildlife service with a view to taking samples from any wild deer that may be culled in the area. The National Parks and Wildlife Service routinely issue licences, under a number of different categories, to shoot deer.  One particular licence category is available to a farmer who suspects that deer are spreading disease to his livestock herd.  I understand that one of the conditions applicable to such a licence is that all animals shot under the licence must have a post-mortem.  My Department supports such licence applications by farmers and examines relevant post-mortem samples for TB.  It is my Department's experience that the National Parks and Wildlife Service is very supportive to farmers making licence applications in this category.</p>

            <p eId="para_4438">The policy towards on-farm inspection has been to give advance notification of up to 48 hours in all cases.  This policy of systematic pre-announcement of inspections was questioned by the European Commission in July 2006 and its unacceptability was conveyed to my Department in a formal communication in August.  As a result my Department was obliged to agree to a proportion of Single Payment Scheme inspections being carried out in 2006 without prior notification.  Some 650 farms out of 130,000 involved in the Single Payment Scheme were subsequently selected for unannounced inspection.  The balance of inspection cases, representing some 92% of the 7,514 farms selected for Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme inspection in 2006, were all pre-notified to the farmer.</p>
            <p eId="para_4439">The EU regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme would allow my Department to give pre-notification of inspection in all cases where certain elements of cross-compliance are involved e.g. the Nitrates Regulations.  However, my Department is committed, in the Charter of Rights for Farmers 2005-2007 to carrying out all Single Payment Scheme and Disadvantaged Area Scheme checks during one single farm visit in most cases.  This then obliges my Department to respect the advance notice requirements applicable to the most stringent element of the inspection regime viz. maximum of 48 hours notice but with no advance notice in a proportion of cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_4440">My Department believes that pre-notification of Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme inspections fits in with the practicalities of Irish agriculture where increasingly, farmers are also engaged in off-farm employment.  In a decoupled Single Payment Scheme system, the provision of advance notification of inspection to the farmer should not negatively impact on the effectiveness of the control.  However, as the EU regulations stand, my Department is obliged to carry out a proportion of inspections without prior notification and this is what was done in 2006.  My Department is seeking authority to allow advance notification in all inspection cases and I will continue to press this point in the CAP simplification process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4441">The Commission is at an advanced stage in finalising a review document on cross-compliance.  The review will include the question of advance notice of inspections.</p>
            <p eId="para_4442">In tandem with this, my Department is carrying out a full review of the inspection arrangements and checklists for the Single Payment Scheme with a view to simplification of the arrangements (including paperwork) where possible while, at the same time, ensuring compliance with the regulatory requirements. The review of the inspection report forms together with the outcome of the Commission's review of the cross-compliance arrangements generally, will be fully discussed with the farming organisations before the Single Payment Scheme inspections for 2007 get underway.</p>

            <p eId="para_4458">My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students. These are the Higher Education Grants (HEG) Scheme, the Vocational Education Committees' (VEC) Scholarships Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate Courses.  The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC.</p>
            <p eId="para_4459">Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.  The Schemes outline the respective courses which are approved for grant purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4460">It has been the practice in recent years to increase the level of maintenance grants annually, at least in line with inflation. In the current academic year, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 3% in the ordinary maintenance grant to give a maximum grant of €3,110 in the 2006/07 academic year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4461">In addition, the reckonable income limits for ordinary maintenance grants were increased by 5.3% for the 2006/07 academic year. This increase exceeds the increase in the average industrial wage for the September to September reference period. The top limit for grant eligibility where there are less than four dependent children was increased from €44,350 to €46,700, ensuring that a significantly higher number of students from households with moderate incomes will not have to pay the Student Service Charge of €800.</p>
            <p eId="para_4462">In relation to the number of students receiving financial assistance under the student support schemes, the most recent figures show that over 57,000 students benefited under the schemes in 2005/06, of which approximately 12,500 benefited from the special rate of maintenance grant (sometimes known as the ‘top-up' grant) in addition to the basic maintenance grant. The top-up grant was introduced by this Government to provide greater assistance to the most disadvantaged students, and in this regard it should be noted that the maximum amount of grant support available this year is €5,970 (including the special rate of maintenance grant) compared to just €2,032 in 1996/97.</p>
            <p eId="para_4463">Under my Department's student maintenance grant schemes, I am committed to ongoing improvements in the student support schemes including increasing the rates and income limits, as resources permit.</p>

            <p eId="para_4474">A decision was taken by the Trustees of the school to which the Deputy refers that it will close in June 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_4475">This decision was taken because, in line with demographic changes in the area, the school has experienced a steady decline in enrolments in recent years.  Current enrolments in feeder primary schools indicate that this decline will continue.  In fact, a general decline in enrolments in the area where the school is located has resulted in considerable spare capacity at post primary level.  Coupled with the decline in enrolments, the Department was also concerned about the ability of the school in question to offer a broad and balanced curriculum given the relatively small number of pupils enrolled.</p>
            <p eId="para_4476">In all of the circumstances, the Department concurred with the Trustees decision to close the school.  When it closes, ownership of the school property, which is currently vested in the trustees, will revert to the Department.

            <p eId="para_4487">The existing pre-service teacher training programmes in the Colleges of Education (primary teacher training) include specific elements aimed at enabling all student teachers to recognise and deal with children with special educational needs, including pupils with Autism.</p>
            <p eId="para_4488">At second level, there are elements to both the Higher Diploma in Education and the Education Degree programmes in the University of Limerick, as part of a general alertness orientation programme, on the variety of learning difficulties which pupils may have — this also covers the issue of Autism.</p>
            <p eId="para_4489">My Department holds ongoing discussions with the Colleges of Education and Universities to ensure that appropriate responses are made at pre-service level in relation to the continuing needs of all trainee teachers to acquire knowledge of, and familiarity with, the needs of pupils with special educational needs, including Autism.</p>
            <p eId="para_4490">I would like to point out that my Department has developed a strategy to meet the continuing professional development of teachers working with pupils with special educational needs.  This strategy has resulted in a major expansion in the range of post-graduate professional development programmes for teachers.  These programmes, which are available annually, include the "Masters in Special Educational Needs (MSEN)", "Combined Post-Graduate Diploma Programme of Continuous Professional Development for Teachers involved in Learning Support and Special Education" and the "Graduate Certificate Course in the Education of Pupils with Autism".  It is a central feature of all these courses that teachers are given the necessary skills and expertise to recognise Autism as well as providing the training to meet the needs of students with autism and special educational needs in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_4491">Ongoing support in the area of Special Educational Needs is provided by the Special Education Support Service (SESS).  The SESS was established as part of the Department's overall strategy on continuing professional development of teachers working with pupils with special educational needs, and it undertakes a number of approaches to address the training needs with a view to enhancing the teaching and learning for children with special educational needs.  The SESS provides a dedicated support team of expert teachers delivering a range of supports to schools through seminar delivery and individual school visits.  In 2006, over 4,000 training places were funded by the SESS to enable teachers to access a range of autism training.  The recognition of Autistic Spectrum Disorders forms an integral part of all supports provided by the SESS.  This support and training in the recognition of Autism informs training across the educational spectrum, both in mainstream and special schools.  Given the training and support available, I am satisfied that there is comprehensive training and support available to all frontline education professionals in the recognition of Autistic Spectrum Disorders.</p>

            <p eId="para_4493">I wish to inform the Deputy that my Department's spending on the home tuition scheme has not been reduced.  The cost of the home tuition scheme has increased from €5.3 million in 2004 to over €8 million in 2006.  The Deputy will be aware that the home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.</p>
            <p eId="para_4494">All primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  In counties Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, Wexford and Tipperary South Riding, a total of 225 Primary and Post Primary schools have NEPS Psychologists assigned to them.  In addition NEPS psychologists are assigned to all DEIS schools in the Region.</p>
            <p eId="para_4495">I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have signalled an increase of 31 psychologist posts in NEPS staffing in 2007.  It is envisaged that these appointments will allow for further expansion of coverage by NEPS psychologists across all regions.  Additionally under the Towards 2016 Agreement commitments I have further announced that NEPS psychologist numbers shall expand by a further 35 posts over the next two years.  Since the establishment of the NEPS in 1999, the number of NEPS psychologists has increased from 43 to 127 at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_4496">While the Deputy is aware that the provision of speech and language therapies, occupational therapies and a co-ordinator for autism in the south east region is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, there are Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) in place across the country.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has taken over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with special educational needs, including autism, since 1 January 2005.  The NCSE has a key role in the delivery of services for persons with special educational needs and operates through a network of SENOs.  The SENOs have been appointed throughout the country and are a focal point of contact for schools and parents.  The NCSE, through the local SENO, processes the relevant applications for resources and convey decisions directly to the schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_4507">Under my Department's Maintenance Grant Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) courses Clause 6.3.6 provides as follows; "Grants may not be paid in respect of a second period of attendance at the same level for a course approved for the purposes of this scheme, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously.  The Vocational Education Committee will have discretion to waive this provision only in exceptional circumstances such as serious certified illness."</p>
            <p eId="para_4508">My Department understands that the student referred to by the Deputy is currently attending the Diploma in Advertising and Public Relations [FETAC Level 5] at Cork College of Commerce.  This student previously attended a PLC course in Electronics at the Galway Technical Institute from September 2003 to February 2004, also a FETAC Level 5 course.  As this student did not enter an approved PLC course for the first time when commencing the current course in Cork College of Commerce funding cannot be approved under the PLC Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4509">The award of funding for a repeat period of study, on the basis of certified serious illness, can only be considered where the student is returning to complete the original course studied.  As the student in question has moved to a different course at the same level, in a different institution, the VEC cannot award repeat funding under the provisions of Clause 6.3.6 of the PLC Scheme.</p>

As with (b) above, for staffing purposes, a pupil can be included in the enrolment of just one school in any school year. **</p>
            <p eId="para_4607">**In the event that the school in which the pupil was enrolled on 30 September can verify that the pupil did not need to be counted for the appointment or retention of a teacher in that school, the Appeal Board will consider allowing the pupil to be counted as part of the enrolment for staffing purposes in the school to which s/he has transferred.</p>
            <p eId="para_4608">9.2The Appeal Board, which operates independently of the Minister and the Department, will review appeals on the mainstream teaching allocation to schools for the 2007/08 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4609">9.3It is proposed that the first meeting of the Staffing Appeal Board to deal with appeals for the 2007/08 school year will be held in May, 2007. Further meetings will be held in July and October, 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_4610">The closing dates for receipt of staffing appeals are 11 May, 22 June, and 12 October. These closing dates will also be posted on the Departments' website. <i>Please note that closing dates will be strictly adhered to and accordingly, appeals received after a particular closing date will not be considered by the Board at that session.</i>

            <p eId="para_4616">10.1A statutory regulation governing the allocation of mainstream staffing and the establishment and operation of the Appeals Board is at draft stage. Copies of the regulation when implemented will issue to all Boards of Management.</p>
            <p eId="para_4617">11.Class sizes</p>
            <p eId="para_4618">The staffing schedule is structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to an average mainstream class size of 27 pupils. Posts allocated on the basis of this schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly. School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</p>
            <p eId="para_4619">The attention of the Department has been drawn to the existence of very large classes in a limited number of schools. Given the level of staffing which the schedules allow, the Department considers that apart, perhaps, from exceptional accommodation constraints, there is no reason for the existence of very large classes in any particular school.</p>
            <p eId="para_4620">The Department's Inspectorate will monitor the deployment of staff and class sizes and, where necessary, discuss with school authorities the basis on which school policy decisions in this regard have been made, and report to the Department, where appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_5230">I propose to take Questions Nos. 539, 540 and 546 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5231">A decision was taken by the Trustees of the school to which the Deputy refers that it will close in June 2007.  This decision was taken because, in line with demographic changes in the area, the school has experienced a steady decline in enrolments in recent years. Current enrolments in feeder primary schools indicate that this decline will continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_5232">In fact, a general decline in enrolments in the area where the school is located has resulted in spare capacity of an estimated 2,300 places at post-primary level.  Coupled with the decline in enrolments, the Department was also concerned about the ability of the school in question to offer a broad and balanced curriculum given the relatively small number of pupils enrolled.  In all of the circumstances, the Department concurred with the Trustees decision to close the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_5233">Given the extent of spare capacity at post-primary level in the general area, the Department does not envisage any difficulty in transferring pupils securing alternative places. Normally a closing school assists its pupils to secure places in the event of any difficulty arising.  The Deputy will be aware that the decision as to which subjects to offer is made at the level of the individual school, subject to compliance with my Department's regulations concerning provision of the core curriculum.  Demand will of course depend on the number of students that want to take other subject options.</p>
            <p eId="para_5234">My Department is currently considering a request from the Trinity Access Programme to establish links with another school in the area.  In addition to the School Completion Project referred to by the Deputy, there are six other SCP projects in the area, involving ten post primary schools and their feeder primary schools. The National Coordination Team for the School Completion Programme will work with these projects to ensure that any pupils currently targeted for support in the SCP project referred to by the Deputy and who enrol in other schools involved in the School Completion Programme, will continue to receive support according to their needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5235">With regard to the Leaving Certificate Applied programme, there are two other schools in the Dublin 5 area offering this programme, Chanel College in Coolock Village and St. John Of God Secondary School in Artane. In addition there are several schools in the surrounding area which offer the programme, including O'Connell School on North Richmond Street, Mount Carmel Secondary School on Kings Inn Street, Plunket College in Whitehall, Larkin Community College on Champions Avenue, Marino College in Fairview, Margaret Aylward Community College in Whitehall, Rosmini Community School in Drumcondra, The Donahies Community School on Streamville Road, and Colaiste Dhulaigh in Coolock.</p>

            <p eId="para_5252">My Department is of the view that children with autism, in common with all children should have access to appropriate provision delivered by suitably qualified teachers within the school system where children have greatest opportunity mix with their wider peer group and have maximum opportunities for integration.  My Department's ongoing commitment is to ensuring that all children, including those with Autistic Spectrum Disorders, receive an education appropriate to their needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5253">In this regard my Department has established: 182 special classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools; 5 special classes for children with Asperger's Syndrome; 16 pre-school classes to facilitate the demand for early intervention provision for children on the autistic spectrum; and 14 standalone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodology on a pilot basis — 2 of these facilities has yet to be established.  The scheme is operated directly by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5254">The preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for children with autism, is through the primary and post primary school network, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or units or in special schools, a view that is supported by the findings of the Task Force Report on Autism. My Department supports a multi-skills approach in regard to the education of children with autism where a range of teaching methods are available e.g. Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), ABA (Applied Behavioural Analysis), Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS).</p>
            <p eId="para_5255">The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) was established under the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act (EPSEN) to improve the delivery of education services to persons with special educational needs arising from disabilities with particular emphasis on children. Since it was established in 2005 NCSE is responsible for allocating resources for children with special educational needs. The Council has a key role in the delivery of services and operates through a network of special educational needs organisers (SENOs) who act as a focal point of contact for schools and parents.  As the current ABA pilot scheme is operated directly by my Department the SENO would have no involvement in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_5256">As provided for in the EPSEN Act, an education plan for each individual pupil (IEP) with special educational needs will become mandatory when the relevant sections of the Act are commenced. In preparation for this, the NCSE has drawn up guidelines on the IEP process and these guidelines were published on 20th June last. The guidelines present a checklist of the essential elements required for an IEP for a child with special education needs as envisaged by the EPSEN Act 2004.  The analysis of each child's needs will lead to an IEP specifically designed and delivered for each individual child.</p>
            <p eId="para_5257">The IEP will be reviewed annually to build on the child's progress and to provide new educational goals to be attained during the following school year.  Identifying appropriate teaching methodologies specific to the needs of the child concerned will form part of the IEP process.</p>

These new resources are intended for schools with large numbers of pupils who do not have English as a first language. Under the revised arrangements, depending on the number of eligible pupils enrolled, schools may now have up to six language support teachers. In addition, the limit of two years' support for an individual pupil no longer applies.</p>
            <p eId="para_5273">The additional 200 teachers are part of the Government's commitment in Towards 2016 to provide an extra 550 language support teachers by 2009 and to reform the limit of two teachers per school.

            <p eId="para_5279">A recent review of a number of applications for home tuition highlighted some cause for concern regarding the qualifications of proposed tuition providers. The Deputy will appreciate that, as this tuition takes place outside of the normal school structure, there is a need to ensure that the tuition providers are appropriately qualified to give educational intervention. Following the review of qualifications, which took place in consultation with my Department's Inspectorate, an extended list of qualifications acceptable under the scheme has been published. This list is available on my Department's website. Aside from recognised teaching qualifications such as the Bachelor in Education and approved Montessori training, the list includes certain qualifications in autism and in applied approaches to teaching children with autism, such as ABA, PECS and TEACCH. Third level qualifications in relevant areas such as psychology may also be appropriate depending on circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_5280">Responsibility for ensuring that a child is receiving an appropriate level of education under the terms of the home tuition scheme rests with the parents/guardian of the particular child.

I have decided as a matter of policy that no vocational education committee (with the exception of the aforementioned pilot community primary school project) shall act as a patron in respect of a primary school or otherwise, establish or maintain a primary school until further notice. therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred under section 14 of the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 2001, I have directed VECs not to establish or maintain primary schools and not to seek recognition of primary schools or recognition as Patrons pursuant to the provisions of the Education Act 1998 until further notice or direction. The Department will begin a process of consultation with the relevant education partners to explore the detailed implementation measures that will be needed to be put in place prior to the opening of the proposed new school.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_5362">I propose to take Questions Nos. 571 and 572 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5363">Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and the Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_5364">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with Section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission of a pupil to the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_5365">Currently, under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, parents of a student who has been refused enrolment in a school may appeal that decision to the Secretary General of this Department. Such appeals are dealt with within 30 days of their receipt and where an appeal is upheld the Secretary General is empowered to direct the school to enrol the student.</p>
            <p eId="para_5366">Otherwise, the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.</p>
            <p eId="para_5367">Officials in the School Planning Section of the Department have carried out a survey of the number of children who will leave primary school in the area concerned in June 2007. This survey indicates that there will be a total of 1,018 children seeking first year places in 2007/08 as compared with 897 in 2006/07.</p>
            <p eId="para_5368">Given the fact that there is spare capacity at two post primary schools in the Dublin 15 area, I am satisfied that there are sufficient places to cater for current demand, even though every pupil may not secure a place in the school of first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_5369">However, I am conscious of the significant on-going housing developments in the area. The Department is examining the need for another post primary school on this basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_5370">In order to cater for the increasing numbers of children who will be seeking post primary school places in the coming years, I have given the go ahead for a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school in Phibblestown, Dublin 15. This new school will be delivered along with new schools in Donabate and Laytown under a design and build contract that is aimed at delivering 3,000 school places for these rapidly developing areas. The inclusion of these three projects in one bundle will further facilitate the achievement of value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_5371">The procurement process is well advanced for a Design Team to do the initial design of these 3 new schools. Thereafter, a Design and Build contractor will be appointed to complete the designs and build the new schools. The Department is working closely with relevant local authorities on the delivery of these projects. Assuming there are no delays during the design and planning permission phases it is envisaged that the schools will be completed as close as possible to the 2009/2010 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5372">Sites have been reserved for further post primary schools in both Tyrrelstown and Hansfield and consideration is being given to the development of a further post primary school in Castleknock.</p>

            <p eId="para_5374">The funding arrangements made by my Department for voluntary secondary, comprehensive &amp; community and VEC schools and colleges reflect the different management and ownership arrangements that apply to schools at second level.</p>
            <p eId="para_5375">Voluntary secondary schools, in the Free Education scheme, which are privately owned and managed, are funded by way of per capita grants. Community &amp; Comprehensive schools are funded on a budget basis, that is based mainly on pupil numbers, but also take into account additional factors which vary from school to school such as disadvantaged status, age of buildings, size of school etc. Financial allocations for Vocational schools and Community colleges are made to the VECs as part of a block grant which also covers the VEC head-office overheads and other activities apart from the second-level programme. At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principle determinant of funding. All schools submit a return of pupil enrolments based on the number attending as at 30th September each year. Schools have considerable discretion as to how this funding is best utilised in the interests of pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_5376">In the case of VECs, the Department does not earmark funding allocations for individual schools or for the various activities of VECs. The way in which such allocations are distributed among schools is a matter for each committee in line with their priorities and perceptions of need. As VECs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of their budgets, the extent of information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department and would involve an inordinate amount of administrative time to compile.</p>
            <p eId="para_5377">Major improvements have been made in the funding of our second level schools in recent years and I will continue to prioritise this area. With effect from January 2007, the standard per capita grant was increased by €18 per pupil and now amounts to €316 per pupil. An additional per capita grant of €38.09 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total per capita grant in the case of such schools to €354.09. In addition, equalisation funding grants of up to €44.44 per pupil, subject to a cap of €15,554 per secondary school, introduced in 2001 and also additional to the per capita grants of some €70 per pupil, subject to a cap of €24,442 per school, introduced in 1992, are provided to voluntary secondary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_5378">Budget allocations for the VEC and Community &amp; Comprehensive sectors are increased on a pro rata basis with increases in the per capita grant.</p>

            <p eId="para_5383">The Deputy will be aware that the home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.</p>
            <p eId="para_5384">A recent review of a number of applications for home tuition highlighted some cause for concern regarding the qualifications of proposed tuition providers. The Deputy will appreciate that, as this tuition takes place outside of the normal school structure, there is a need to ensure that the tuition providers are appropriately qualified to give educational intervention.  Following the review of qualifications, which took place in consultation with my Department's Inspectorate, an extended list of qualifications acceptable under the scheme has been published. This list is available on my Department's website.  Aside from recognised teaching qualifications such as the Bachelor in Education and approved Montessori training, the list includes certain qualifications in autism and in applied approaches to teaching children with autism, such as ABA, PECS and TEACCH. Third level qualifications in relevant areas such as psychology may also be appropriate depending on circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_5385">I wish to inform the Deputy that the qualifications of the tutors concerned have been examined and are not acceptable under the terms of the home tuition scheme. It is important to stress that the allocation of tuition hours under the scheme is not at issue in the context of the qualifications of the nominated tutors in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_5387">Two Montessori qualifications are recognised for restricted recognition by my Department, namely the AMI (Association Montessori Internationale) qualification, which has been recognised for teaching in special education settings since 1963, and the B.A. in humanities in Montessori Education from St. Nicholas Montessori College, Dún Laoghaire, which has been recognised since 1997, and is accredited by HETAC (formerly NCEA). Both courses are full-time and of at least three years duration.</p>
            <p eId="para_5388">Teachers with the above recognised Montessori qualifications are granted restricted recognition to teach in special schools and in the categories of special classes in mainstream schools where Irish is not a curricular requirement. Such teachers are also eligible for posts as resource teachers (low incidence) for children with special needs in mainstream schools (Circular 02/2005).

            <p eId="para_5392">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year.  The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.  Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2005 was 220 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0023/2006), which is available on my Department's website, <i>www.education.ie</i>, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006/07 school year is a Principal and 8 mainstream class teachers.  According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 216 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department’s website, <i>www.education.ie</i>, and a hard copy of which will be issued to all primary schools shortly, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year will be a Principal and 8 mainstream class teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5393">Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.  It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools.  Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule.  They are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department's website.  Hard copies of this circular will issue to primary schools as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_5394">It is proposed that the first meeting of the Appeal Board will be held in May, 2007.  Further meetings will be held in July and October, 2007.  The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 11 May, 22 June and 12 October respectively.  Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made.  The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department's website.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Minister and my Department and its decision is final.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent Appeal Board.</p>

My Department is in consultation with the key stakeholders in order to map the most logical and effective arrangements for the future structure and administration of the student support schemes, including the arrangements for the 2007/08 academic year.  These consultations are a priority for my Department at present.  Work on the income limits, rates of grant and other aspects of the general criteria of the 2007 Maintenance Grant Schemes is also a priority in my Department.  It is anticipated that any change in criteria will be completed in time to give sufficient notice to awarding bodies and grant applicants in advance of the 2007/2008 academic year.  My Department recognises the importance of notifying the awarding bodies of any changes in relation to the Schemes at the earliest possible date.

            <p eId="para_5398">My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students which are administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees.  The Higher Education Grant Scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.  Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality.  The decision on eligibility for third level or further education grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC.

            <p eId="para_5399">The Third Level Student Support Schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students pursuing approved full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration (pursued in a university or a third level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds) in other EU Member States with effect from the 1996/97 academic year.  The extension of the Schemes at that time did not include courses at postgraduate level or to courses outside the EU and, accordingly, there is no grant aid available under the schemes for students pursuing studies outside of the EU.  Any extension to the scope of the maintenance grants schemes, can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.  I would like to make the Deputy aware of the Endeavour Programme, an internationally competitive, merit-based scholarship programme that forms part of the Australian Government's $1.4 billion Australian Scholarships Initiative.

The pilot project initially involved 11 group water schemes, including Donaghmoyne, and three local authority public water supply schemes.  My Department provided a 100% capital grant to finance the project under the Rural Water Programme.  The Donaghmoyne Group Scheme subsequently withdrew from the pilot project, notwithstanding the special 100% grant for participating groups.  Work has since been completed on the other schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5444">In common with other publicly funded programmes, the eligibility criteria for grant assistance under the Rural Water Programme require compliance with certain public procurement, financial management and control procedures, including prior clearance of technical specifications and approval of grants in advance of commencement of works.   Following its withdrawal from the pilot project, the Donaghmoyne group scheme progressed alternative upgrading works from initial planning to construction stage although the Committee was advised on a number of occasions that the proposal was not in compliance with the requirements for grant purposes.  In the circumstances, no funding can be made available under the Rural Water Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_5463">The improvement and maintenance of non-national roads is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State grants provided by my Department.  The initial decisions regarding projects to be funded on foot of these grants, including the location of works, is primarily a matter for the relevant local authority. Local authorities may either submit applications for grant aid for specific schemes or may fund eligible works from discretionary grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_5464">In 2007, non-national road grant allocations by my Department to Meath and Westmeath County Councils are €29,502,498 and €15,933,997 respectively.  All non-national road grants for 2007 have now been committed and there are no additional funds at my disposal from which further grant allocations could be made at this time.</p>

        <b>Mr. Sargent</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</b>
         the reason Ireland has not alone failed, refused and neglected to ratify the Aarhus Convention in domestic law but has, in addition failed to implement the terms of the European Directive which seeks to impose the terms of the convention on countries of the EU and grant the benefit of the directive to those citizens and bodies of the general populace of the EU who might seek to invoke the terms of the convention against their native Governments, State bodies, provincial and regional bodies and companies across the territory of the EU.

            <p eId="para_5468">Ireland signed the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters on 25 June 1998.  Progress towards ratification of the Convention is closely aligned with work at EU level.  To date, the European Union has adopted two directives as part of the ratification process for the Convention.  These deal with public access to environmental information (2003/4/EC) and public participation in certain environmental decision-making procedures (2003/35/EC).</p>
            <p eId="para_5469">I intend to make regulations transposing Directive 2003/4/EC into Irish law in the near future.  Irish legislation is now largely compliant with Directive 2003/35/EC, and the remaining work required will be completed by the earliest possible date. When the above work has been finalised, the instrument of ratification of the Aarhus Convention will be laid before the Dáil in accordance with the requirements of the Constitution.</p>
