        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_8">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_12">I welcome this opportunity to speak on the peace process in Northern Ireland.  The ongoing support of all Members of this House for building and maintaining peace in the North has been invaluable, and remains a strong cornerstone of the continued progress towards lasting peace and reconciliation.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">As we are all aware, the agreement announced in Hillsborough on 5 February represented the culmination of many hours of intensive negotiation and engagement on all sides.  It provides the basis for the future stability and success of the democratic institutions which we have all worked so hard to create and maintain.  Fair and balanced compromises were required so that gaps could be bridged and different perspectives accommodated.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">The completion of the devolution of policing and justice by 12 April will be an essential step for peace, stability and security in Northern Ireland.  It will consolidate the operation of devolved government and close the circle in the transformation of policing and justice structures in Northern Ireland.  I also welcome the agreement on a way forward on parades.  An enhanced framework, implemented by agreement, offers the prospect of respecting and equitably balancing the rights of everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">It is fair to say that the recent negotiation process was not an easy one.  The issues that were being discussed go to the very core of Northern Ireland's past.  Their solutions are the foundations for Northern Ireland's future.  As well as the key political issues that had to be agreed, these talks were, in many ways, about the re-establishment of trust between the parties.  It is very important to realise that the political context for the recent talks was very different from any that have gone before.  While they were facilitated by the two Governments, in the end, they were primarily conducted between the parties in Northern Ireland.  That is because, unlike on previous occasions, we have had fully functioning democratic institutions throughout this recent period of political turbulence.  Indeed, the members of the current Northern Ireland Executive have now held office for longer than any of their predecessors since Good Friday of 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">In addition to the outstanding issues from the St. Andrew's Agreement, that period of working together has thrown up new challenges which only the parties themselves can properly address.  While the two Governments have an essential role in upholding the agreement, and a continuing role in supporting the institutions and the parties as they move forward, it is the parties themselves who came to an agreement on this occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">Naturally, not all the parties are happy with all aspects of the agreement reached or with the level of their involvement in the negotiations.  I understand many of their concerns.  For our part, the Prime Minister and I met all of the parties bilaterally on several occasions, as did the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  We also convened a number of all-party plenary sessions.  Of course, the political reality — determined by the electorate at the last Assembly elections — is that the DUP and Sinn Féin are the leading parties and, between them, can command cross-community support in the Assembly.  It, therefore, fell to those two parties in particular to reach agreement.  I urge them to continue to work more closely with the other parties in future.  In that regard, I welcome the proposals for improving the workings of the Executive and for greater discussion with the other parties which are part of the agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">Prime Minister Brown and myself have worked closely together over the past months, remaining in close contact with each other and with the Northern parties.  We had a lengthy meeting in London on 30 November, when we assessed the issues and risks faced by the institutions and agreed on a joint approach to facilitate agreement between the parties.  Following our meeting of 17 December in Copenhagen, we said in a joint statement that we believed that early completion of the devolution of policing and justice powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly was realistic and achievable and that any outstanding issues were capable of resolution by the parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">I met again with the Prime Minister on 14 and 25 January and discussed the political situation in Northern Ireland.  At the latter meeting, we judged there was a serious risk of a crisis in the institutions if the Governments did not intervene directly.  We travelled together from Downing Street to Hillsborough Castle where we convened over three days talks with all of the Northern Ireland parties on outstanding issues relating to the devolution of policing and justice.  During those talks we worked hard to establish common ground, to build dialogue between the parties and to re-establish the trust necessary to complete the devolution of policing and justice in Northern Ireland.  Having talked to all of the leaders of Northern Ireland's political parties, we believed there was a clear pathway to an agreement.  While we had hoped to bring matters to a conclusion during the week of 25 January, we felt that it was right and necessary for the parties to work together in the spirit of trust and understanding to agree and take ownership of the proposed solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">We asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to continue to work with all of the parties to seek a resolution.  I congratulate all of the parties around the table that contributed to the positive outcome reached last week.  The leadership displayed by the First and Deputy First Minister and their respective party colleagues was instrumental in achieving the agreement that has been reached.  I also acknowledge the wisdom and leadership of all of the other party leaders, including Sir Reg Empey, Mr. Mark Durkan, Mr. David Ford and Ms Dawn Purvis, and their teams, and the part they played.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">I take this opportunity to place on the record of the House my special appreciation to the former SDLP leader Mr. Mark Durkan for all that he has done to help build peace, prosperity and reconciliation in this country.  I know that he has much more to contribute to political life in the future.  I also congratulate Ms Margaret Ritchie on her election as Mr. Durkan's successor and wish her every success in her new role as SDLP leader.  I thank the Prime Minister, Mr. Gordon Brown, for the extraordinary commitment he has shown in recent weeks and months in making last Friday's agreement possible.  I pay particular tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Shaun Woodward, in terms of the enormous efforts they invested over many days and nights in facilitating this agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">Throughout the journey of this peace process we have benefited from the continued support of our friends in the United States.  I thank President Obama for his kind words last Friday on the reaching of agreement and for his generous invitation to me to visit the White House and meet with him on St. Patrick's Day.  I recognise the role of the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, and her encouragement of the parties to reach agreement and for the positive contribution made by Mr. Declan Kelly, the US Envoy to Northern Ireland.  Above all, I commend the political leaders of Northern Ireland for the courage and determination they have shown in stretching themselves to reach this agreement.  The parties took clear ownership of these negotiations and worked closely and patiently together to reach a mutually acceptable outcome.  The quality of that engagement has reinforced my view that the devolved institutions can and will work and deliver good government for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">The agreement reached presents a real opportunity to renew the partnership which is the life blood of the devolved institutions.  It demonstrates that the parties can and will continue to work the political institutions of the North for the benefit of all of the people.  It is my strong view that the spirit of the agreement is just as important as the letter of the agreement.  The agreement is not some abstract mathematical formula about setting up structures for people to coexist peacefully and tolerate each other.  It is about people coming to the table with a sense of generosity, understanding and accommodating the views and opinions of others and doing so in a way that best serves everyone in the community and promotes security, stability and support for democracy.  The devolved institutions can now move on to focus on the day-to-day issues of concern to everyone, including the economy, jobs, health, education, infrastructure, social services, community safety and the quality of life generally.  I look forward to seeing all of the agreed steps for the devolution of policing and justice implemented.  The drafting of an addendum to the programme for Government for the Department of Justice will allow the development of policies which support an effective policing and justice system.  In addition, the people in the North can now receive the full benefit of £800 million of resources for a new department of justice from the British Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">Achieving agreement on parading as part of this process has also been a major achievement.  The new and improved framework will see a co-chaired working group comprising six members.  They have now been appointed by the First and Deputy First Minister and will begin work immediately to bring forward agreed outcomes.  It is vital that all of these steps are taken as agreed and within the timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">In moving forward on these critical matters, I believe the parties have recovered the spirit of the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements — that vision of a better future for all the people of these islands.  That better future must be built on mutual respect for people of different traditions, equality and tolerance, and respect for each other's political aspirations, cultural expression and inheritance.  That includes respect for the Irish language and for those who treasure it as part of their cultural heritage.  In this regard, we look forward to further progress in implementing the relevant commitments in the St. Andrews Agreement.  It also includes respect for all aspects of our rich traditions on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">As I said at Hillsborough, we are very fortunate to enjoy the rich tapestry which has been woven from all of the history, cultures and traditions on the island of Ireland.  We must continue to work for reconciliation and partnership, to protect and nurture all we hold dear, including our beliefs, traditions and, above all, the new relationships that have grown from the peace process.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">We also look forward to the implementation of outstanding commitments relating to the establishment of the North-South parliamentary forum, the North-South consultative forum and the completion of the St. Andrews review of North-South co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">In recent weeks, I have outlined to the House the considerable progress that has been made on these issues, including the convening of the first ever North-South consultative conference last October and the proposal for a North-South parliamentary conference to take place soon, at a time to be agreed between the Ceann Comhairle and the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">I see an increasingly vigorous agenda of North-South co-operation as a key to the future prosperity and success of both parts of this island.  Ireland, North and South, is facing unprecedented economic challenges.  In meeting common challenges — such as promoting economic recovery, dealing with the effects of climate change, guaranteeing our energy security and developing our skills and research and development base — there is a growing recognition that we are strongest when we share approaches and weakest when we work alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">It is in all our interests to work together to identify where we can reduce or share costs, or improve services.  For a small island in an increasingly globalised world, it makes simple common sense to co-operate in order to compete.  The Government remains committed to working with the Northern Ireland Executive and the British Government in the future to help build on all our achievements and to make a better future for everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">As we mark this month's deadline for paramilitary decommissioning, it is worth taking stock of the great degree of success there has been in taking the gun out of politics in Northern Ireland.  Recent acts of decommissioning remind us all of the great benefits that the peace process can bring and the confidence it generates in communities.  This Government has expressed its appreciation of those who worked so hard to bring about decommissioning by the UDA.  I also welcome yesterday's confirmation by the INLA and other groups that they have put their weapons beyond use.  Their recognition that politics is the only way forward is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">Sadly, the evil, criminal attack on PSNI Constable Peadar Heffron in recent weeks is a stark reminder that there remain a tiny, unrepresentative few whose aim is to destroy all that has been achieved.  I pay tribute to Constable Heffron for all that he has done for this country and for his bravery in dealing with what I know are significant injuries.  It is very important that we place our deep appreciation and our best wishes for Constable Peadar Heffron and his family firmly on the record of Dáil Éireann.  I know that all the elected representatives of the Irish people in this House join with me in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">Such attacks by so-called dissident republicans do not represent the democratic will of the people of this island.  They offer nothing but pain and suffering to the Irish people.  The best response to such people is to complete the devolution of policing and justice powers, secure the stability of democratic institutions and show that politics is delivering for all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">Peace is a precious thing.  All the people of these islands greatly value what has been achieved in the North in recent years.  They have no wish to see a return to the bad old days.  It is the duty of all of the political leaders on this island to continue working together in trust and partnership to ensure that we continue on the path of peace.  I again thank all of the Members of this House for their continued support in our collective endeavours and for all of their work in the cause of peace and reconciliation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_35">I welcome this opportunity to reflect briefly on the recent achievements in Northern Ireland and the progress in the past week on the path to peace.  I welcome the agreement reached between the parties in Northern Ireland last week on the devolution of justice and policing powers to the power-sharing institutions.  It was the clear hope of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland that this deal would be reached.  The positive outcome to the lengthy negotiations has averted the prospect of a prolonged period of instability and uncertainty.  It required intensive efforts from each party and they have secured a complete and enduring agreement.  I would like to give credit to the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs for their hours of attendance, if not always fruitfully at least leading to the conclusion that was eventually reached.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">The challenge for the parties now is to work together to deliver on the implementing of the remaining elements of the Good Friday Agreement so that the people of Northern Ireland can be convinced that the political process can deliver real improvements to their lives.  Let me assure the Northern parties that we in the Fine Gael Party will continue to play our part in supporting and assisting the full implementation of the agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">I had the privilege of attending the SDLP conference last Saturday.  I convey my personal congratulations and that of my party to Margaret Ritchie MLA on her appointment as party leader, which comes at a critical time in the politics and development of Northern Ireland.  As we hope to see the completion of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, her experience as a Minister in the Executive will stand to her and I look forward to meeting her in the not too distant future.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mark Durkan MP MLA for his leadership of the SDLP in the past ten years.  I have known him for many years and his fearless leadership of the SDLP not only benefited his party, but more importantly was a voice of reason for all the people in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">The 12 April will be an historic and defining day in the North.  The Independent Monitoring Commission has previously stated — with which I agree — that the devolution of policing and justice brings important benefits to Northern Ireland, not least in allowing closer integration of law enforcement with other domestic policies.  It will have a real and positive impact on people's lives and the problems they face on a daily basis.  The IMC also made the point that dissident groups try to exploit the uncertainty of this issue and try to argue that politics was not winning in Northern Ireland when the reality was always very different.  They have failed in their unjustified attempts to create a divide.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">Regarding the new Minister for Justice, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister are meeting today to consider applicants interested in the post.  Strong candidates are being put forward and I hope that a candidate of calibre and strength will emerge as the first Minister for Justice in Northern Ireland.  I hope that decision will be made in the coming days.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">A further positive step in the path to peace in the North came yesterday with the announcement by the INLA, the Official IRA and the south-east Antrim brigade of the Ulster Defence Association that they have put their weapons beyond use.  This completion of the decommissioning process removes a key obstacle to political progress in Northern Ireland.  It also fulfils the clearly expressed democratic wish of the Irish people, North and South, when they approved the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.  General John de Chastelain deserves our thanks and credit for the effort he has put in over many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">Fine Gael, as always, will stand ready to support the forces of law and order in confronting the threat of dissident republicans.  The Taoiseach will have the full support of our party in respect of whatever action the Government must take in this regard.  Fine Gael is concerned about reports that the Real IRA is actively recruiting new members in this jurisdiction.  It is essential to ensure that young men are not lured into these organisations by some romantic notion of Irish republicanism and the continuation of an armed struggle.  To achieve this we must continue to highlight in every way we can the necessity of implementing the Good Friday Agreement in full in order that people understand and see that co-operation and power-sharing are the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">We must ensure that it is considered both the normal and effective way of delivering for everybody.  Dissident activities in Cork in recent times are a worrying development.  Their claim to murdering a man and threat to continue such vigilante activities cannot be allowed to continue.  I am glad to see media reports of a massive Garda operation in Cork today, with more than 60 detectives involved in targeting this particular group.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">We must also ensure our security forces have the necessary resources to monitor the activities of dissident groups in this State.  Sadly, we are nearly a year on from the murder of two army officers at Massareene barracks by the Real IRA and the murder of PC Pat Carroll, days later, by the Continuity IRA.  We must ensure that these evils cannot happen again.  A concerted effort to disrupt their recruitment methods and other activities will prevent further atrocities being carried out.  I wish the Government well in its future endeavours in this regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_10">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_44">I join with the Taoiseach and Deputy Kenny in congratulating the parties in the Northern Ireland Executive for having agreed yet another strategic step forward in arrangements for devolved government in Northern Ireland.  I also want to extend my thanks and congratulations to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and their officials who on behalf of all of us here, have spent so much unexpected and prolonged time away from here in an effort to secure a successful outcome to the talks concluded by the parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">Thanks are due, too, to all others who gave a hand in facilitating the agreement in Washington, London and Dublin.  However, I want to reflect also on the number of times in which we in this House have made statements over the years on agreements usually ascribed as "final" that have been squeezed eventually from the Northern Ireland parties.  How many times we have welcomed statements along the lines of the most recent: "This text is an affirmation in our shared belief in the importance of working together in a spirit of partnership to deliver success for the entire community."  How many times these intended agreements, notwithstanding the encouragement and facilitation of Dublin, London and other capitals, have failed to eventually meet expectation or at least have ended up having such expectation deferred.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">How many times is it realistic to foresee similar down-to-the-wire collapses of talks in Northern Ireland and the resumption of the always existing threat, the abolition of devolved government and the resumption of direct rule?  I believe it is appropriate to do this now, in a week that saw a former colleague of mine, former Deputy Tomás MacGiolla, laid to rest and a still serving colleague, Mark Durkan, pass on the leadership of our sister party in Northern Ireland to his elected successor, Margaret Ritchie.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">Tomás MacGiolla was a man of great principle and personal courage.  He played a central role in weaning the republican movement away from its violent roots.  If more people had listened to Tomás MacGiolla in the late 1960s, 30 years of violence and more than 3,000 deaths in Northern Ireland might have been averted.  He was a genuine republican in the tradition of Wolfe Tone, an early advocate of the civil rights strategy in Northern Ireland and a fierce opponent of sectarianism.  He was shocked and appalled by the campaigns of sectarian violence that blighted Northern Ireland for so long.  Although he and I took different political paths in recent years, I have always retained an enormous respect for him, which I believe is shared by many on all sides of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">As regards my colleague Mark Durkan's resignation, and the election of his successor, Margaret Ritchie, I want to put this on the record.  The SDLP was born out of the civil rights movement in August 1970 and has, for four decades, been the voice of democratic nationalism in Northern Ireland.  As a member of the Party of European Socialists and the Socialist International, it is a sister party of the Labour Party here and is solidly internationalist and socially democratic in outlook.  Throughout the past 40 years the SDLP has never deviated from its core values.  It has stood completely opposed to all violence, arguing that not only was this morally wrong, but politically bankrupt as well because violence always destroys that which it claims to defend.  From its earliest days, as illustrated from as long ago as its 1972 policy document, Towards a New Ireland, the SDLP has argued for an agreement that addressed the three core sets of relationships: between Nationalists and Unionists in the North, between North and South and between Britain and Ireland.  The Good Friday agreement was an agreement first designed and promoted by the SDLP, in Seamus Mallon's famous phrase as "Sunningdale for slow learners".  I pay tribute to the designer of the Good Friday agreement, John Hume, his successor as party leader, Mark Durkan, and his successor in turn, Margaret Ritchie.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">I join with the Taoiseach and Deputy Kenny in paying tribute to Mark Durkan.  He was a key member of the SDLP team during the negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement and he was, in many respects, its chief draftsman.  In 2001, Mr. Durkan replaced Seamus Mallon as Deputy First Minister.  He also succeeded John Hume as SDLP leader.  He has represented the interests of nationalism, his party and his constituency with distinction since 2005.  He has spoken strongly, including directly to my party, about justice issues, economic development, health care and children's rights.  He has a well-established reputation as a leading advocate on international development and he will continue to speak vehemently at Westminster about these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">Throughout the worst and most disastrous weeks, months and years in Northern Ireland, the SDLP has always adhered to its conviction, namely, that argument works better than violence.  I am hopeful as regards the latest agreement, the Hillsborough agreement.  However, in my parliamentary lifetime I can recollect similar statements welcoming breakthroughs in talks and fresh agreements coming from, for example, the Downing Street Declaration, the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrews Agreement and now the Hillsborough agreement.  Recently, we saw a quotation from the <i> Guardian</i> newspaper greeting yet another previous breakthrough in Anglo-Irish talks.  The<i> Guardian</i> opined: “The impossible has happened and the Irish controversy . . . is, to all intents and purposes, settled.  It is a splendid achievement ... Let us thank Heaven that that chapter of our history is closed and that a new one opens today.”  The problem is that quote from the<i> Guardian</i>, republished in the history pages of <i>The Irish Times</i>, came from its editorial opinion on the Anglo-Irish Treaty, published almost 90 years ago in 1921.  For almost 90 years since then, politicians North and South, east and west, have been doing mostly not enough, but sporadically their best to achieve progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">Tremendous damage has been done in the interim by people with irredentist views who put politics above any value they place on human life, and who have destroyed human life on an industrial scale in the interests of what they regarded as political progress.  Meanwhile, politicians have attempted agreements, most recently with the political representatives of those most responsible for the most devastation.  Each successive experience of devolved government in Northern Ireland has had to be re-rescued, by talks led by the two Governments.  Let us all hope that the latest agreement now arrived at will work.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">This latest agreement moves things on, but politics has also moved on in Northern Ireland.  At the time of the Good Friday Agreement, it was hoped that the centre would strengthen and that in a climate of peace, moderate politics would thrive.  Instead, the political initiative and support moved to those with a harder line.  Now Sinn Féin and the DUP are the dominant parties, not the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist Party, the parties which led the making of the Good Friday Agreement.  Power is shared between two parties which have yet to convince that they believe in the concept of sharing power on a daily basis in an atmosphere of trust and with a hope to building a shared future.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">While I welcome the agreement about modalities for the appointment of a justice Minister in Northern Ireland to administer policing, I am concerned at the manner in which the process for selecting the party to hold that office has been altered.  Under the d'Hondt system used to allocate every other Minister, the SDLP would be next in line for the post.  That process is being ignored on this occasion and it is believed the Alliance Party will be lined up to get the position.  I would welcome David Ford's appointment to the post.  The Alliance Party is a thoroughly decent political movement that has preached partnership and power-sharing throughout its existence.  It is deeply committed to creating the shared future between all the people in Northern Ireland that so many of us recognise as a requirement.  However, the over-riding of the SDLP's right to achieve this political outcome does public trust in the political system no good whatsoever and it adds to the perception that this deal has been made at the insistence of the DUP and Sinn Féin.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">I fully understand the need to accommodate all shades of political opinion and cross-community representation in post-conflict societies.  However, as Mark Durkan stated 18 months ago, we must begin to think about removing some of the ugly architecture around the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.  This may not yet be the time but moving towards voluntary coalitions rather than the mandatory system that exists at present must be a long-term aim of all parties on this island.  In reality, all parties in Northern Ireland are living in a context of voluntary coalition, even if the concept is anathema to some of them, but power sharing is still a fragile concept.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">If last week's agreement shows that more work can and will be done by the two major parties involved, then it will have been a good day's or ten days' work.  Voters on both parts of this island shared an important part of a journey when they voted overwhelmingly to support the Good Friday Agreement.  Their votes were the strongest mandate for a new departure in Irish politics, North and South of the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">To appreciate how far we have come, we should take stock of what we have left behind.  More than 3,500 deaths on this island, over 30 years, were directly linked to the sectarian conflict in the North.  Approximately 100 people a year on this small island were murdered every year since 1969, simply because of who they were, where they came from, who they voted for or the church they prayed in.  For every murder victim, there was an ever-increasing circle of the injured, bereaved and frightened.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">Some politicians calcified the bitterness, handing it on to their successors.  Communities were brutally segregated.  The politics of the latest atrocity overshadowed the wider tragedy.  The national question dominated Irish life for decades when we could have been questioning what kind of social and economic future we wanted for ourselves and our children.  However, that is the past and we need to be ambitious for the future.  We need to be ambitious for peace.  We need to be ambitious for a peace that is not simply the absence of aggression, a peace that is not simply a new rewriting of a complicated deal about power sharing.  We also need to be ambitious for a peace that results from willing and easy sharing of space, a peace between people at ease with each other and working to assist each other.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">The sad fact is that while all this drama about devolved government and its arrangements is played out, the scourge of sectarianism remains and infects the lives of many people in Northern Ireland on a daily basis.  Although the latest and long-awaited high-level engagement and resolution between political leaders is always welcome, the fact remains that society in Northern Ireland is now more sustained in its<b> </b>divisions, such as those associated with where people live, socialise and send their children to school, than it was three decades ago.  We have witnessed the increasing danger referred to by both the Taoiseach and Deputy Kenny, that is, the re-emergence of extremist violence.  I send the best wishes of the Labour Party to Constable Peadar Heffron on his recovery from the appalling injuries he has suffered.  The saddest fact of all is that, although Sinn Féin and the DUP can agree about policing and justice, the “Shared Future” agenda for improving community relations on a daily basis, and for improving the lived experience of their own constituents, is still the last agenda item they can agree upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">The agreement just made provides for the devolution of policing and justice.  This is, by any standards, great progress.  We must now look increasingly to the future and the kind of society that we should build North and South, a society based on fairness and tolerance and rooted in democracy.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_60">Friday, 5 February 2010 was a very significant day in the development of positive and constructive politics in Ireland.  The agreement reached on that day represents a step forward for all the people of this island.  The agreement was not easily reached and it will not be easily implemented but it is essential that it work and that all parties and both Governments play their part in full to ensure its success.  I commend the Sinn Féin negotiators, the DUP negotiators and those of all parties and both Governments who contributed to this very welcome and positive development.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">Céim chun tosaigh atá sa chomhaontú.  Molaim iad siúd a ghlac páirt sna cainteanna.  Bhí dul chun cinn maidir le póilíneacht agus an córas dlí agus le feidhmiú an Choiste Feidhmiúcháin.  Pléadh ceisteanna tábhachtacha eile, paráideanna agus an gá le Acht na Gaeilge sna SéChontae san áireamh.  Chuir Sinn Féin an Acht sin ar chlár na gcainteanna agus beimíd ag obair go dian chun an Acht a fháil agus a chur i bhfeidhm.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">The agreement reached last Friday has the potential to ensure a stronger Executive on the basis of equity and respect for the mandates of all parties.  The agreement is broader than the issue of policing alone because the working of the Executive had effectively seized up due to the blocking tactics of obstructionist Unionist elements.  That obstruction had to be overcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">A date has now finally been set for the long overdue transfer of policing and justice powers from London to Belfast.  That is a major achievement and it will also be a major challenge to ensure that policing services are delivered equitably and efficiently for all communities and that the justice system is independent and fully rights based.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">Much exasperation was expressed at the time it took to reach agreement.  From many, that exasperation was understandable, especially from people in the Six Counties and all communities who want to see real improvements in social and economic terms and to see the Executive and the Assembly work.  However, some of the impatience expressed by commentators on this side of the Border was less acceptable and reflected a partitionist outlook.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">We must make no mistake.  Republicans, more than anyone, had a right to be impatient and to express deep frustration at the delay in delivering on policing and justice.  Republicans throughout Ireland have been very patient not only in recent weeks, but in recent years with regard to the vital issue of policing.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">Just over three years ago, after a process of intense internal debate and consultation, we in Sinn Féin brought our party members to an extraordinary Ard-Fheis to debate proposed changes to our policy on policing.  We expressed our support for civil policing through a police service which is representative of the community it serves, free from partisan political control and democratically accountable.  We pointed out that the Good Friday Agreement requires and defines a new beginning to policing as an essential element of the peace process.  The Good Friday Agreement also requires functioning, power sharing and all-Ireland institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">Before that Ard-Fheis in 2007, the British Government had agreed to the transfer of powers on policing and justice away from Westminster to locally elected political institutions, and set out the departmental model to which these powers were to be transferred.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">On the basis that a new beginning to policing had commenced, and that policing and justice powers would be transferred to Ireland within a reasonable period, Sinn Féin agreed to support the PSNI and the criminal justice system in the Six Counties, hold the police and criminal justice systems fully to account North and South, and participate in local policing structures in the North.  We appointed Sinn Féin representatives to the Policing Board and the District Policing Partnership Boards.  Their role was, and is, to ensure full accountability of the PSNI and the achievement of policing with the community as the core function of the PSNI.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">I, too, wish to add my personal good wishes to the injured Constable Heffron for his full return to health.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">The decision of the membership of Sinn Féin to critically engage with policing in the Six Counties was a momentous step that took courage and determination.  We needed to see the same courage and determination from both Governments and all parties, especially the DUP, to ensure the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">Throughout the debate and consultation which took place prior to that 2007 Ard-Fheis, a key point raised by party members was the weakness of the Irish Government in failing to press the British Government on a whole range of issues, but especially on policing itself.  The "heavy lifting" in negotiations was done by Sinn Féin.  The Irish Government joined with the SDLP in accepting far less than was needed to ensure a new beginning to policing.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">Sinn Féin took these political risks because we wanted to see the process back on track.  The Executive was re-established and it worked well across departments, but only up to a point, and that point was the essential and overdue next step of transfer of policing and justice powers.  This was clearly a touchstone issue.  The Sinn Féin ard chomhairle motion, adopted by the 2007 extraordinary Ard-Fheis on policing, also pointed out that elements of the DUP were determined to use policing and other issues to prevent progress, resist power-sharing, equality and oppose any all-Ireland development and that this was unacceptable.  They were prophetic words and borne out over the past two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">I hope and believe that the 5 February 2010 agreement represents a new beginning for the relationship between the DUP and Sinn Féin, a new beginning for the Executive, the Assembly and the all-Ireland structures, as well as a new beginning for policing.  There is also a need for a new focus on the peace process and the all-Ireland process from the Irish Government, from all the political parties and from the media in this State.  I have already referred to partitionism which I am afraid is widespread in this jurisdiction.  We heard it in the type of commentary which lamented the fact that the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister had to alter their schedules to attend the negotiations in Hillsborough.  It was as if these were some parochial issues that should not be troubling the minds of two international statesmen.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">The issues at stake in the negotiations go to the core of the relationship between Ireland and Britain and the people who share this island.  They are about the survival and future working of the structures established under the Good Friday Agreement.  They are about the continuing development of a peace process into a viable political process.  Policing and justice, public safety and human rights are not trivial or parochial issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">The other myth peddled in recent times, and which continues from the mouths of some, is the portrayal of the DUP and Sinn Féin as the two extreme parties.  Related to this have been some efforts to disparage the power-sharing structures and the requirements for cross-community support in the Executive and the Assembly.  In the Seanad, a Member claimed the d'Hondt system, "rewards people from the extremes and does not reward people who bring together communities and serve all of the people within their communities".</p>
          <p eId="para_76">This position was praised by a political commentator in a national newspaper who also painted Sinn Féin as extremists along with the DUP and bracketed the two parties together in their attitude to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I remind that commentator, and those who hold to his views, that while the DUP excluded itself from the talks in 1998, Sinn Féin played a key role in negotiating the Good Friday Agreement, in delivering it and in implementing it in the years since.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">The same commentator proposed a return to direct rule.  I am glad the patience and persistence of negotiators won out and that an agreement was reached a few days after the article was written.  A return to direct rule would do nothing to heal community divisions or foster co-operation and compromise.  On the contrary, it would be a step backwards for everyone.  What is needed is the full working of the agreements on the basis of partnership, equality and a determination to deliver for all the people.  That is the essence of the pledge taken by each Minister in the Executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">I accept there is understandable frustration at the slowness of movement.  However, the slowness of movement at Executive and Assembly level is only part of the picture.  There is an appreciation across the North that great progress has been made, that there is local accountability of Ministers and Departments and, above all, that many barriers between communities and individuals are being broken down.  It is happening slowly but it is also happening surely.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">For the same reason the issue of parading needs to be handled with the greatest care.  It must be remembered there is no contention about the majority of parades in the North.  Sinn Féin acknowledges parades by the loyal orders as an expression of heritage and culture.  All citizens have a right to that expression, the right to assemble and to parade.  All citizens also have the right to be free from sectarian harassment.  No one should want to parade down a road or through a community where they are not welcome.  This is a problem now in relatively few places and it must be addressed through dialogue.  I hope that the arrangements put in place on Friday last will bring progress in this area and that we will see a trouble-free marching season this summer.  I guarantee it will not be for want of effort on the part of Sinn Féin and I pay tribute to my party's members who have worked extremely hard over recent years to prevent conflict in interface areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">A new beginning to policing and justice is not solely a Six Counties issue.  We need far more robust accountability structures to ensure an end to political policing, corrupt policing and inefficient policing in this jurisdiction.  I again use the opportunity to call for the repeal of the draconian Offences Against the State Acts, which is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">On the issue of collusion, I regret to have to state that the Taoiseach and his predecessor have been far too accepting of the claims by the British authorities that they can do no more.  We have seen the British Government's continuing refusal to establish an independent international inquiry into the murder of Mr. Pat Finucane, as demanded in a Dáil motion passed unanimously three years ago.  We have seen their refusal to respond positively to the Dáil motion seeking complete disclosure and a parliamentary debate on collusion, including the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of May 1974.  The Taoiseach's responses to me on collusion, including last week, have been disappointing and show a lack of appreciation of the importance of these legacy issues for all who have been directly affected by the conflict, and I urge that that change.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">I believe the title of these statements to be incorrect.  What we are addressing is not"Northern Ireland"; it is the peace process and the all-Ireland political process.  It is of vital concern to everyone on this island.  I represent a Border constituency and the communities that elect me and my constituency colleagues obviously have a very particular interest in the success of the process.  They have seen the very physical barriers of the Border taken down and have seen many of the benefits of peace and dialogue and new co-operation between the two jurisdictions, but the Border remains and it still causes social, economic and political disruption to communities on both sides of the Border.  It distorts the economy of this island and the lives of all who view Ireland as home.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">I welcome especially the commitment in the 5 February agreement to work on the outstanding issues from the St. Andrews Agreement.  That must include completion and full working of the all-Ireland structures, including the North-South parliamentary forum.  Last week in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement we discussed the progress being made in all-Ireland co-operation on education and how so much more can yet be done.  The same applies in areas such as health, transport, employment creation and agriculture.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">The real test of this agreement will be how it delivers improvements in the daily life condition of ordinary people, not only in the Six Counties but across the island of Ireland.  The Sinn Féin extraordinary Ard-Fheis on policing three years ago to which I referred reiterated our republican commitment to bringing about Irish reunification and the full integration of political, economic, social and cultural life on this island, and we hold that commitment as firmly as ever and look forward to its fulfilment through persuasion and dialogue over the time ahead.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Martin Mansergh)</from>
          <p eId="para_85">The successful negotiation of what should prove the final chapter in the peace process is a cause of great satisfaction.  I warmly congratulate the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Irish officials on their leadership role in bringing this about as joint guarantor with the British Government of the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements.  As the Taoiseach has observed, the institutions have continued to function for the longest sustained period but the intervention and involvement of the two Governments undoubtedly prevented a breakdown.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">As is known from previous experience, a great deal of time, dedication, painstaking work grappling with difficult, interconnected and complex issues the roots of which in many cases are deeply embedded in the past, and an extraordinary level of patience is required in order to achieve the necessary breakthrough.  While this level of commitment is sometimes criticised, it has been necessary and it has produced results.  The Taoiseach will well remember the time he spent on policing issues as Minister for Foreign Affairs in Weston Park in 2001, and in many other venues, when he had to re-thread, so to speak, the implementation of the Patten report.  It must be said that Sinn Féin took its time to accept reformed policing and it is not entirely surprising the DUP has taken its time to agree to its devolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">The political parties in Northern Ireland are also to be greatly commended on concluding this agreement in conditions which are three months ahead of a British general election.  It sends out an important message that the stability of the Northern Ireland peace agreement and its agreed self-governing institutions have been protected.  It will reassure investors in difficult and challenging economic times, it is a good example for other intractable conflicts in other parts of the world and, above all, it confirms that there is no going back to the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">A parallel example of patience rewarded is the work of the International Commission on Decommissioning.  As we know, all paramilitary groups, even when on ceasefire, were initially appalled at the notion that anyone was asking them to decommission their weapons.  Now all groups on ceasefire have done so, including the UVF, the UDA — all branches of, the INLA and the Official IRA, and this has been paralleled by extensive demilitarisation by the British Army.  Great credit is due to General de Chastelain, who has probably had one of the most extraordinary military missions in history but has brought it over many years to a successful conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">May I, too, interject in this debate to pay my respects to the memory of the late former Deputy Tomás MacGiolla.  His roots were in the IRA — later Official IRA — but the broader movement was a political nursery to many leading lights in these Houses which on the whole has made its own contribution, collectively and progressively, to the modernisation of a democratic Nationalist and republican philosophy.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">A particular tribute is also due to President Mary McAleese and her husband Martin for the practical but also potentially hazardous bridge building in which they have engaged and which has borne fruit, not least in terms of trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">It is dismaying that there are still small reactionary elements holding back and engaging in sporadic but occasionally lethal armed attacks.  It cannot be repeated too often that such activities have no theoretical, historical or moral justification and that the settled will of the Irish people for peace will not be changed by them.  Without wishing for any censorship, I would ask editors of media organs not to let themselves be used as al-Jazeera type outlets for murderous threats or self-justifications.  The constitutional position now arrived at is legitimate and has been legitimated by the Irish people as a whole — to put it more neutrally, by the people of the island of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">One of the main achievements of the peace process has been the widespread normalisation of relations between the two parts of the island even though, as has been observed, there is much progress to be made still in community relations in Northern Ireland and in tackling the scourge of sectarianism.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">Relations between Britain and Ireland have also been normalised and those who want to maintain old enmities and obstruct normal courtesies between friendly and neighbouring states, or to deny all shared experiences and traditions, have at this stage to be quietly ignored and faced down.  To those who want to claim that we have not moved on, the answer is "Yes, we have, and decisively so."  We must transcend the wounds of history mutually inflicted.  I say that because complaints about past wounds inflicted on us would always come better if accompanied by acknowledgement of appalling wounds that have been inflicted, sometimes by persons making such complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">A proud and independent state should hold its head high and behave with appropriate self-confidence and magnanimity.  While the focus has been on the largest parties, Sinn Féin and the DUP, which have made a further statesman-like accommodation from what were once very fundamentalist positions, and for this they deserve much praise, we should not forget the role of other parties such as the SDLP, the Ulster Unionist Party and the Alliance Party.  Mark Durkan, a successor of John Hume, carried on in the most honourable manner, the signal contribution of his party throughout the Troubles, and we all congratulate and wish well the new leader, Margaret Ritchie.  If there is a new government in Westminster after the May election, which cannot be presumed, I hope it will, notwithstanding any partisan interests, maintain unswerving and renew the commitment of successive British Governments under Gordon Brown, Tony Blair and John Major to both the principles and the achievements of the peace agreements.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">Parades have long been a contentious issue and it is to be hoped that a better <i>modus vivendi </i>building on the Derry model can be achieved.  Greater unity on this island can only be built up on respect for different traditions and on acceptance that we proceed from where we have now arrived and not from where we might wish to have been if we could roll history back to 1919 or 1914 or the 1790s.  Ireland, all of it, has an important role to play and contribution to make in the modern world and much of that we can do, North and South, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">We should remember all those politicians, officials, clergy and community activists who laboured long and hard in the field to bring about a just and lasting peace.  I think of the Taoiseach's predecessors, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and Albert Reynolds, not forgetting Dick Spring, John Bruton and the late Charles Haughey, who were all associated with historic advances.  I also think of Dermot Nally, now deceased, who gave great service to the State and to the betterment of Anglo-Irish relations.  I commend the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs for bringing a noble work to both a conclusion and a new start.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_99">I am pleased to welcome the significant progress in the devolution of functions to the Northern Ireland Assembly.  Real change is never quick or easy but recent events show that tenacity can deliver real results.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">Deputy Kenny outlined the Fine Gael view on the positive developments in Northern politics but I would like to take the opportunity to refer to the threat posed by dissidents on both sides of the Border, a threat that historically has grown out of the political situation in the North.  I welcome the announcement yesterday by the INLA, the Official IRA and the loyalist south east Antrim brigade that their illegal weapons have been destroyed as part of the decommissioning process.  These groups have recognised that political dialogue achieves far more than violence ever could.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">Regrettably, however, there remains a rump of irredentist dissidents who refuse to acknowledge the will of the people and the authority of the State.  It is clear from recent developments that the threat from dissident republicans on this island has now reached a very dangerous level.  Just last month, as has been referred to, a PSNI officer was critically injured when a bomb exploded under his car.  Experts have been warning for the past few months that there has been a realignment of terrorist groups in Northern Ireland with a new group emerging from the hard-liners among the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">In the past two years, there have been more than 750 bomb alerts in the North, an average of one per day.  Although no one has been killed by the Continuity IRA or the Real IRA since the vicious murders of two soldiers and a policeman last March, terrorist actions still average one per day.  The most recent report of the Independent Monitoring Commission suggested that the threat level is "really serious" and at its highest in six years.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">Even among groups which have theoretically abandoned the path of violence, there are worrying signs that the legacy of violence has not been completely left behind.  We sadly recall the brutal murder of Paul Quinn, for which nobody has yet been convicted, despite a widely held belief that the Provisional IRA was responsible for the death.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">At the weekend, Assembly member, Dominic Bradley, told the SDLP conference that there still is "a functioning murder machine" run by republicans in south Armagh.  Mr. Bradley further warned that although the Provisional IRA's army council has prohibited punishment beatings, south Armagh IRA members simply do as they please.  He stated that even if the Provisional IRA has theoretically been stood down, individual members still have access to its structures, its skills and its experience and the group as a whole is still trying to exercise community control and worst of all, it can still draw on political support from Sinn Féin in exercising that control.  This is, indeed, a stark and chilling warning.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">In the Republic, there are ongoing warnings that the dissidents are still involved in vigilante-type activity.  Leaflets being circulated in Cork city attribute the recent murder of Gerard Stanton, a convicted drug dealer, to the 32 County Sovereignty Movement.  The leaflet also claims that the Real IRA has a list of alleged drug dealers who it has marked out for execution.  I understand the Garda is currently investigating these claims and I wish it well.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">I urge the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to take decisive steps to address the threat posed by dissidents to life and limb in this Republic.  There is a clear need for increased Border security and to ensure intelligence resources are made available to counteract the increasing terrorist threat.  Senior Garda posts, to which we referred last week in a justice debate, must be filled urgently.  We require both a political and a security response from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">Last month's bomb in the North shows that the situation continues to deteriorate.  We need to do all we can in this Republic to protect lives from the threat posed by the remaining dissident republicans in the form of their terrorist activities.</p>

          <p eId="para_108">When the people voted for the Good Friday Agreement, which contained three strands — the internal, the North-South and the east-west strands — in effect, they voted to allow the people of Northern Ireland deal with issues themselves.  They wanted them to get on with their lives, to come together and to work together.  It is almost 12 years since the Good Friday Agreement was passed.  While it has taken a very long time to reach this stage, any progress or, indeed, even stagnation is better than from where we came.  Any development, once it is not a retrograde step, is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">I commend both Governments and the parties in the North for coming to an agreement on 5 February in Hillsborough.  While on occasion, we in the South can be impatient, it is important to realise from where the parties have come and the difficulties inherent on both sides.  It will take a long time until there is complete trust between all parties in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">I hope the devolution of policing and justice, which people thought would never come, will come some time in April.  It is important the Governments continue to play the role of guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement but, by the same token, it is also important that the parties can get on with their own business and that it is not necessary to hold their hands on all occasions.  Both communities in the North want to move on.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">It is important that there is no vacuum.  Reference was made by a party colleague and others to the dissident republicans.  Many of these young people do not recall what the violence was like in Northern Ireland — the endless horrors on our television screens and the endless suffering and pain.  This romantic concept must be dealt with.  We have a role to play in this part of the island by cracking down on these dissident republicans and by working in conjunction with the PSNI to address the difficulty.  When one sees the horror visited on Constable Heffron and the families of the British soldiers and Constable Carroll, it brings us back to the dark bad old days.  There is nothing more depressing than to see the violence reoccur.  There is enough goodwill and commitment and the distance the parties have travelled over the past decade will ensure that we never return to those dark days.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">Deputy Gilmore mentioned the parties and Government in the North dealing with the issues that impact on people's lives.  The main political parties in the North have had their own internal traumas recently which show they are human like everyone else.  The economy, education and employment impact on people there as much as they do on people here.  Let us devote our energy to working together to create a synergy which helps to address those difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">The decommissioning of the UDA and INLA in recent days must be welcomed.  It is important to pay tribute to the work General John de Chastelain has done over the years.  I recall attending a dinner at which he spoke of going to a barber for a free haircut.  He said he would not go until there was a final agreement on peace in Northern Ireland.  I do not know if he ever got a free haircut but he is probably entitled to it at this stage.  He has given a very important period of his life to deal with the issue, as have the various representatives from the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">There will never be final trust until such time as the people in Northern Ireland work, play and go to school together.  First we have to build up trust in the institutions in order that they can govern together and then the real trust will come from people leading their daily lives.  It is important to recognise the positive and silent role President McAleese and her husband have played in the past few years.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_117">I join with my colleagues in congratulating both Governments and compliment members of the DUP and Sinn Féin on the role they played in the negotiations, along with the other parties who were not just peripheral partners, but who were involved.  However, when the dust settles there may be questions as to whether that involvement was constructive enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">When we had statements on Northern Ireland in the past, they concerned blockages, tragedies and major incidents, such as the Omagh bombing.  It is unfortunate that became the <i>raison d’être</i> in this House.  Any time there is a crisis in Northern Ireland, we have statements on the matter in the House.  We need to take cognisance of the fact that this is on ongoing, evolving situation.  The major lesson which has been learned is that we let the 1998 Good Friday Agreement go on autopilot, not necessarily at an institutional level in Stormont but at a county council level, a cross-Border level and a grassroots level.  There was tremendous empowerment of cross-Border relationships over a period of time prior to 1998.  We have to get back to basics.  We do not have to rebuild that infrastructure but we have to acknowledge the work which has been done at that level.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">We are making statements on Northern Ireland here today but if one asked a member of the public from Athlone or any area further south, such as the constituency of the Minister, Deputy Martin, in Cork one will find there is an attitude towards Northern Ireland, namely, that we should let it look after itself.  Many people just do not want to know about it. We have to change that mindset.  In changing it we have to reach out to our colleagues across the Border and not just at Assembly, Leinster House or Stormont level.  We have to reach out through the North-South Ministerial Council.  People on the ground are looking for more transparency at those meetings.  They are also looking for a better, more constructive mechanism than two or three meetings a year.  It is very important to keep it going.  While it is also important to examine strand two, strand three, which involves the east-west negotiations and the British-Irish Council, must not be ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">We have to be careful of jargon; we could use words like "process".  In moving the machinery of what has been built on in the past 12 years, we have to create, as Deputy Timmins mentioned, a synergy among cross-Border groups.  I will not use the term "quango" because it would be an insult to much of the work done by groups such as the North West Region Cross Border Group.  We cannot have great work going on at a northern level and a southern level but not have a meeting in the middle.  Simple things such as tax, entitlements, welfare, people who reside in east Donegal and work in Derry and people who live in Derry and work across the Border in Donegal, Monaghan or Louth are issues to be considered.  There is a mass movement of people and we have to take cognisance of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">It is no longer Northern Ireland; the six county bloc no longer exists as an entity.  There is public policy which we need to move forward regarding getting institutions and public services harmonised on both sides of the Border.  Currency is an issue which we cannot harmonise but we can harmonise public service provision.  These are the challenges.  We have an obligation in this House to do that.  It is also an obligation in the framework of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_20">
          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_122">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  I recall speaking on the ceasefire and all the different steps which have taken place during my time in the Dáil.  However, this is, in many ways, the most significant event.  I thank the Taoiseach, Prime Minister Brown, the Ministers and our professional staff who are often unrecognised but who do an important job behind the scenes, for their work on this agreement.  As has been said, we must also pay tribute to General John de Chastelain, and the Secretary of State, Ms Clinton for their involvement.  Above all, we must pay tribute to our President and her husband Martin for their work behind the scenes on this issue to bring us to 5 February.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">The deal has been worked out between the two main parties.  That it took ten days to reach an agreement is important because it is not a rushed deal.  All the issues have been teased out and the Minister, Deputy Martin, had a part to play in that.  That there is a deal between the people of Northern Ireland which was not imposed on them cannot be overemphasised.  The future now depends on how the two parties concerned treat their other counterparts, such as the SDLP, the Ulster Unionist Party and the Alliance Party in the future and whether the Assembly is seen to work together as a united organisation and not as divided groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">The proof of how the Agreement is put into operation is something positive which we all want to see.  Policing and justice will now be handed back to the Northern Ireland Assembly and we do not yet know who will be the minister.  Whoever it is, it is vital that he or she gets the full commitment of all parties in Northern Ireland.  If people are committed to democracy, they must be prepared to co-operate with the PSNI, the Garda and any other organisation to make sure that whoever is at fault in trying to continue to plant bombs, etc., stops.  More than 3,000 lives have been lost. Very often we forget those who have been maimed and lost limbs, and who will live with the situation for the rest of their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">One only has to think of the recent attacks on the PSNI, in which Constable Peader Heffron, who is a staunch GAA supporter and a Catholic by birth, was obviously targeted to try to stop people from the minority side in Northern Ireland from joining the force.  The bombs found in Forkhill, Donegal and other places is proof that there is still a rump out there.  That young people are being brought into the negative or dissident organisations is frightening.  We must have hope that the new justice system in Northern Ireland, if it is backed by the general public and by democratic organisations, can deal with this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">I congratulate Ms Margaret Ritchie on her appointment as leader of the SDLP and I thank Mark Durkan for all he has done.  The SDLP was very active in the entire issue from the start, from John Hume to Seamus Mallon and others.  I do not forget the UUP and others who also played their part.  Today we have an agreement made by the people of Northern Ireland among themselves.  They now have the opportunity to prove they can make it work in a positive, constructive and caring way.  There are people trying to claim full responsibility for this who say that others were at fault.  I remember well the times when others, on all sides, failed for years to move forward when they were meant to do so.  I ask people to forget the blame game at this stage and try to be constructive and positive.  I, too, live in the Border area and I remember all the troubles there.  I stood at the graves of those on both sides of the divide and I never want to have to do so again.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_21">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_127">I thank the Leas Ceann Comhairle and the Government for allowing me some speaking time. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, were involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">I welcome the developments in the peace process in recent weeks and commend all those involved.  This is above party politics.  When people do the right thing they should always be praised and commended.  I commend in particular the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs for their patience and perseverance during the entire process, especially in recent weeks.  I also commend and thank Martin McGuinness and the Sinn Féin team at the talks for their patience, courage and vision.  From the Unionist tradition, I thank and commend those who were prepared to move and act on the Good Friday Agreement.  Politics is about change, and on this island, in particular, we need progressive change.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">I come from the tradition that wants to unite Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter.  Nowadays, in modern Ireland, there are many more religions and faiths.  I want to build a country based on the values of respect and equality, that will enjoy diversity and difference.  Sectarianism is not part of any politics and all Members of the Oireachtas have a duty to speak out and challenge it no matter where it pops up its head on this island.  When I talk about equality and respect for the Unionist tradition, which I fully support, I expect to receive the same respect for my tradition which stems from that of Tone and Connolly.  Sadly, there are too many Nationalists on this island who seem to be apologetic for what they believe in and appear to be afraid to say what they stand for and support.  I believe in Irish unity and independence and I expect the same respect from others that I have for their traditions and views.  However, not in 1,000 years would I dream of wanting to march down the Shankill Road or any road in east Belfast, waving a banner or a tricolour.  I say this because I expect the same respect from the Orange Order which should not force itself down the Garvaghy Road.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">During these talks I had major concerns about the background presence of the Orange Order on the Unionist side.  Happily, common sense seems to have prevailed.  Respect and equality should always be the name of the game in these talks and dominance or arrogance have no place in any peace process.  We have now resolved to develop politics on this island without the gun.  I welcome this major progress.  All politicians must stand up now and sort out political differences by democratic and peaceful methods.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">The Taoiseach said in the House today that the ongoing support of all Members for the building and maintenance of peace in the North has been invaluable.  It remains a strong cornerstone of continuing progress towards lasting peace and reconciliation.  That is the view of the vast majority of the Members of this House and that is the way it should be.  The Taoiseach also spoke of the political reality, meaning that what was determined by the electorate at the last Assembly election is that the DUP and Sinn Féin are the leading parties which can command cross-community support between them in the Assembly.  It is felt, therefore, that those two parties should reach out in agreement.  I was astounded during the talks by the vision and leadership shown by both parties which come from completely different traditions.  I commend the leadership involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">I have concerns that there are some people in the DUP, however, who are not happy with this deal and that there are others in the wings who want to wreck the entire peace process.  This must be challenged.  We, as politicians, should never take it for granted.  The peace process is bigger than the political parties, both in the North and in this Dáil.  It belongs to the people of Ireland and to the community, voluntary and justice groups.  I emphasise the word "justice".  Peace will never have a solid foundation without justice and equality.  Truth and reconciliation are a major part of any peace process.  That is why I say there can be no running away from the issue of collusion, which other speakers mentioned.  It is not acceptable in any state to have state forces running, funding or assisting death squads, as happens in South America.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">As Members of the Dáil, let us remind ourselves what happened in the North for many years or on the streets of Dublin or Monaghan, or in places such as Loughinisland.  Those involved showed clearly in many other instances the issue of collusion.  We must get rid of this for once and for all.  Pretending it did not happen will not heal the hurt.  I say this to all sides that were active in the conflict during the past 30 years.  That is why I welcome the recent disarming by all but a few of the paramilitary groups.  Today I urge the few that are left to disarm and get involved in politics.  It is never too late to save a life.  I urge these people to read the words of Tone and Connolly, roll up their sleeves and bring Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter together and build a new Ireland, a new republic that does not end at Dundalk, and to use their energy to unite our people on this island.  That is what I want to see.  That is the vision for the future for which all of us in this country want to work.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_136">Over many years I have heard and participated in many debates and special statements on Northern Ireland in this House.  I sincerely hope that this may be the last such occasion.  It would signal that we had come to the end of a long and tortuous journey and would pay tribute to the contributions made by so many different people.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh,  who in his own short contribution, put on the record of the House a litany of names.  This went only a small way to recognising the extraordinary number of talented Irish people, on both sides of this Border and across the water in our neighbouring island, who contributed to the construction of a pathway towards peace that ultimately became wide enough and enticing enough to allow even the most reluctant to participate and travel that journey.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">I recall my mother, a mother of six, saying to me that any parent of a large family never goes fully to sleep until the last child is home safely.  In that sense, Mother Ireland can now go safely to sleep in the sure knowledge that all the children, delinquent or otherwise, slow or quick learners, have finally found a way to live peacefully together.  I endorse the claims and suggestions made by others concerning those remaining people who believe they have some kind of political mandate from history to use violence instead of persuasion, that they too would come home safely.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">It is extraordinary to think of the young people of Northern Ireland who will go to the Westminster poll in May 2010 aged 18 years.  They were six years of age when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998.  If one thinks further back, their parents were probably only 6 years of age in 1974 when the Sunningdale Agreement was signed.  As Seamus Mallon famously said, the Good Friday Agreement was Sunningdale for slow learners.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">We have travelled a long way and should celebrate that.  It is to be hoped there will be a normalisation of relations, not only on this island but between these islands.  The institutions of the Good Friday Agreement must be worked vigorously, both on an east-west axis, between Dublin and London, and between Belfast and Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">I acknowledge the presence here of both the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, and would like to put one suggestion for consideration to the Government.  I would love to see some exploration of the possibility that a childhood in Northern Ireland could somehow be enhanced and repaired by developing a new kind of shared history for the people of these islands.  This shared history should be taught in classrooms of both Glasgow Ranger and Glasgow Celtic supporters and in the classrooms of Belfast, Cork, Dublin, London, Bradford and even Warrington.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">It should be a shared history of these islands and of the people who have populated them and of the migration that has taken place, North, South, east and west.  It should be taught so that people's victories, trumpeted in the past years of violence, are no longer seen as somebody else's defeats.  Rather, it should be shown that defeats and victories were the experience of all of the peoples of these two islands — economic defeats and migration defeats that forced people to leave the place in which they lived and grew up — so that we have a better understanding of our shared history.  This is something that might be for a future generation to explore, because the wounds of the past 30-odd years of struggle will take at least a generation to heal.  Learning about our shared history in an open and positive way, without bitterness, might help towards this.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">I want to commend in particular the energy and attention both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have given to this project over a difficult period, at a time when they had a lot more to be doing.  Their commitment to this project must be recognised.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_25">
          <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_143">I welcome this debate, which gives us an opportunity to pay tribute to all those involved in the discussions and the agreement that has been found.  In particular, I commend the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Gordon Brown for giving their time to it.  They could have found many reasons not to make that special effort, but they did not.  They made a special effort and were the midwives who delivered what was a difficult conclusion, but which was immensely worthwhile.  They deserve credit for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">We have seen change with regard to these negotiations.  We have seen changes in terms of what is, essentially, a deal between political parties.  I do not buy the idea that this issue is somehow above political parties.  It is about parties having to move, accept change, accommodate and compromise.  It has happened in a context where change has occurred in Northern Ireland because time has moved on and peace has been established.  The public in general has moved on as a consequence.  It is worth noting a change that would have been inconceivable 20 years ago, namely, that a woman, Arlene Foster, took over, albeit on a temporary basis, the role of First Minister.  Also, a second woman, Margaret Ritchie, became leader of a Northern Ireland party.  Dawn Purvis, already heads up the PUP.  The role of women in Northern Ireland has largely been marginalised and male supremacy was seen as the way Northern Ireland coped.  This kind of change is very welcome and I hope it will develop further.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">People now have very different expectations of their politicians.  I was very struck by the comments I heard made in the vox pops on local Belfast radio.  People were extremely angry that the politicians were not doing a deal and coming to an agreement.  The general view was they should get on the job because people wanted to ensure they were dealing with the real issues affecting them on a daily basis, such as unemployment, the chance of getting a decent house and security in terms of policing.  These are the daily concerns of people on this island.  It really does not matter whether people are North or South, they have the same concerns to a great extent.  It was an indication of a healthy society that the people wanted a deal to be struck in order to ensure that these issues were confronted.  The old quarrels were being put in their place to a great extent.  Yesterday, when attending the funeral of Tomás Mac Giolla, I was conscious that he was very far-seeing in terms of his political view.  He expressed the view many times that the issues of unemployment and housing should bind people together and that sectarianism was the evil that prevented people uniting on issues central to their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">Northern Ireland has many other challenges to meet.  One of the major issues for the future will be how far it can depend on ongoing funding from the British Government.  This funding has sustained Northern Ireland for a long time, but it is unsustainable into the future and this must be recognised by all, regardless of their persuasion.  It is important we are straight and acknowledge that the DUP has moved considerably from its position in the past, as has Sinn Féin.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">I propose we concentrate on what we can do well together, North and South, east and west.  One area in which we have proven we can work well together is infrastructural development.  Most people are not aware, for example, that we have an all-Ireland electricity market.  This was done almost subterraneanly because it was not seen as politically difficult.  However, it was a milestone and it has worked well and to consumers' benefit, North and South.  We need to consider ways we can build infrastructure, particularly in the renewable area, that will be of benefit to all of us.  The wind does not stop at the Border nor in the Irish Sea.  There is a way to ensure we work for the benefit of our communities, whether in Scotland, Wales, England, Northern Ireland or Ireland.  That is the future.  The world is getting smaller and we have opportunities now that we did not have before.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">We should not lose sight of the opportunities in terms of policing.  While there is always the fear of paramilitarism and general criminality, I have no doubt but that devolved policing and better communication between North and South will benefit everyone on this island.</p>

          <p eId="para_149">I thank Deputies for their contributions this afternoon and welcome the expressions of support and goodwill across the Chamber for this agreement.  Such unity of purpose in this House has been a great strength of the peace process and will remain important as we encourage the parties in Northern Ireland to build on the progress reached at Hillsborough.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">The spirit of partnership which has marked the relationship between the two Governments as guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement was once again demonstrated at Hillsborough.  I pay tribute to the role the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister played in convening the talks and creating the conditions that enabled the parties to break the deadlock.  The Taoiseach and Prime Minister worked very closely throughout this period and stayed in close touch with the talks throughout, applying appropriate and judicious degrees of encouragement, advice and pressure as we moved to final agreement.  In particular, I want to pay tribute to my counterpart, Secretary of State Shaun Woodward.  He and I have worked together to secure the devolution of policing and justice not just for the past two weeks, but for the past 18 months.  His commitment has been extraordinary and I thank him for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">However, it was the Northern political parties that were at the centre of what happened at Hillsborough over the past fortnight.  This is their agreement just as it is their Executive and their Assembly.  This deal was essential to enable the Executive and Assembly to move forward.  Its implementation is the primary responsibility of all of the parties in Northern Ireland.  Reaching agreement on a timetable for the devolution of justice and policing powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly was the centrepiece of this agreement.  This was a major item of unfinished business from the St. Andrews Agreement.  The transfer of these powers on 12 April will represent the consolidation of devolution at Stormont and the completion of the transformation of policing begun with the publication of the Patten report in 1999.  The appointment of a Minister for Justice, accountable to the Northern Ireland Assembly, will signal a strong vote of confidence in the robustness and sustainability of the devolved institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">The DUP and Sinn Féin occupy a joint office which is at the heart of devolved government in the North and, thus, their capacity to engage with each other and reach accommodation is crucial to the stability of the institutions.  The fact that they, facilitated by the Governments, have been able to conclude this comprehensive agreement around a number of contentious and sensitive issues is, therefore, a major step forward.   I want to also put on record appreciation for the leadership and political will displayed by the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson MLA, and the deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness MLA, that made this agreement possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">Government is about more than concluding agreements — the real business of government is implementation.  In that process of implementation, the role of the other parties in the Assembly and the Executive is a key element, as several Deputies have articulated.  This was already acknowledged by both Sinn Féin and the DUP in last Friday's plenary meeting.  Questions such as the better functioning of the Executive and progress on the outstanding issues from the St. Andrews Agreement can only be taken forward successfully on an inclusive basis, taking advantage of all of the talent, expertise and goodwill available in the Assembly.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">In that context, I again offer my appreciation of the leadership role Mark Durkan MLA has played over the years.  He has made a most notable contribution to the peace process and we look forward to his continued advice as he devotes his career to the Westminster Parliament.  We offer his successor, Margaret Ritchie, every best wish as leader of the SDLP.  I have been in contact with her and will be meeting her shortly to facilitate ongoing consultation and engagement between the Government and the SDLP.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">There are a number of areas which will be covered in the working group to be established on outstanding commitments from the St. Andrews Agreement.  One of particular interest to this House is that of the Irish language.  The Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement recognised the importance of respect, tolerance and understanding of the linguistic diversity and culture of Northern Ireland.  The Irish Government is committed to assisting the development of the Irish language in Northern Ireland and the implementation of outstanding commitments made in the St. Andrews Agreement, including an Irish language Act.  We also look forward to early agreement on an Irish language strategy.  Since language issues are a devolved matter, this is an area where the Government works directly with the Northern Ireland Executive, including through the North-South body, Foras na Gaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">Engagement continues with the British Government on relevant non-devolved areas such as broadcasting and through the British-Irish Council.  I am pleased that, only last week, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and his British counterpart signed a memorandum of understanding which will facilitate the continued availability of Irish television services, including TG4, in Northern Ireland after digital switchover.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">As the House will be aware, the promotion and protection of the Irish language is a key priority for the Government in this jurisdiction and the work in this area can have a positive effect on the island as a whole.  The 20-year strategy for the Irish language will have a beneficial impact on speakers of the Irish language on the whole island, and the Government will look at how these synergies can be optimised.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">I also want to reiterate the need for tolerance and respect for both the Irish language and Ulster Scots language and culture in Northern Ireland.  I have previously urged a more open approach to the Irish language by those who erroneously see it as something threatening.  Far from being feared, the languages and cultures of this island ought to be shared and celebrated.  I look forward to a more mature and less politicised discussion about the Irish language, building on the improved dynamic and mutual respect that enabled agreement to be reached in Hillsborough last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">In moving forward, we need to build and consolidate trust between communities in a spirit of equality and tolerance for each other's political aspirations, cultural expression and inheritance.  Much has already been achieved in building sustainable relationships where once there was mistrust.  However, more needs to be done to knock down the barriers which physically and metaphorically separate too many in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">One of the issues which goes to the heart of the remaining divisions is that of parading.  While most parades pass off peacefully, there remain a handful of contentious parades and another small few which retain the potential for difficulty.  Against this background, the agreement between the parties at Hillsborough sets out a process for an improved framework for the management and regulation of parades.  Their aim is to bring forward agreed outcomes which can achieve cross-community support.  This, in itself, will be a significant step forward.  The core point is that any enhanced framework would have at its core the principles of local people providing local solutions and respect for the rights of those who parade and those who live in the areas through which parades pass.  This includes the right for everyone to be free from sectarian harassment.  Until new arrangements have been agreed and put in place, the Parades Commission will continue to do its valuable work.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">An ambitious timeframe has been set for this work.  The First Minister and deputyFirst Minister have now appointed representatives to the working group provided for in theHillsborough Agreement.  It will report back with agreed outcomes within weeks.  These outcomes will, in turn, provide the basis for widespread public consultation, leading to responsibility for parading being devolved to the Northern institutions and Assembly legislation before the end of the year.  The agreement between the parties to move forward on an agreed basis has the potential to transform the situation, lifting the stresses and pressure on communities arising from parades.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">Realising this potential will require generosity of spirit and respect for others on the part of all stakeholders.  There is also a duty of care on those who take this work forward to ensure that the rights of all are equitably accommodated.  The Government will remain close to this process as it progresses through the various stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">As colleagues have recognised, the Hillsborough agreement provides a new platform upon which we can build stronger and deeper North-South co-operation over the months and years to come.  There have been more than 50 meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council since the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly in May 2007.  Every one of those meetings has included Ministers from the Unionist and Nationalist traditions in Northern Ireland, as well as their Irish Government counterparts.  This is a hugely significant level of engagement between elected representatives in both parts of the island on the economic and social issues of most concern to those we represent.  The era of "back-to-back" development has truly been consigned to the past.  Ministers, North and South, no longer hesitate to pick up the phone or meet in person, discuss common challenges, argue options and agree shared approaches to the difficulties we face.  That is politics as it should be.  The political compromises reached at Hillsborough will free up time and space to tackle the bread-and-butter issues of most concern to ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">The Government is determined to work closely with our Northern Ireland Executive colleagues to tackle those issues on an all-island basis, wherever possible and helpful.  We will continue to take a North-South approach to meeting the infrastructural needs of the island, as evidenced by our support for the upgrading to dual carriageway status of the new A5 road to Derry and Letterkenny.  We are also stepping up our efforts to build a smart and dynamic "innovation island" by increasing our collaboration through the US-Ireland Research and Development Partnership and under the EU's seventh framework programme.  We are intensifying our co-operation in areas like health and education, with North-South studies completed or in train on how we can achieve economies of scale and deliver improved services.  We are looking forward to examining closely with our Northern Ireland Executive colleagues ways in which both our administrations can save money by eliminating duplication on the island.  It is simple common sense that we can do more together, for less, if we pool our talents, resources and time in the many areas in which we have shared ambitions and targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">We look forward to completing the review of North-South bodies, as set out under the St. Andrews Agreement, and areas of co-operation as soon as possible, thus ensuring Ministers can address issues of most pressing concern through the North-South Ministerial Council.  We are also determined to bring into being the North-South consultative forum and the North-South parliamentary forum, which will each have a valuable role in advising the Government and Northern Ireland Executive on socioeconomic and cultural issues with a North-South dimension.  The time is now right to make progress on all these outstanding issues and we look forward to doing that over the months ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">I thank all Members for their contributions.  We will take on board many of the constructive suggestions that have been made, not least the comments made by Deputy Ruairí Quinn in terms of exploring the possibility of a shared history of these islands being developed in curricular terms for children in both Ireland and Great Britain.  That idea has merit and, while some historians would relish such a task, it would be a significant one.  I will not hazard a guess on whether consensus could be achieved on that as quickly as we have achieved consensus in terms of the political framework we have just developed and elaborated upon.</p>

Broughan — the urgent need for the Minister to fully report to Dáil Éireann on why cutbacks of up to 30% in funding have been sanctioned in 2010 for Sphere 17 and RASP programmes in Dublin 17 which provide essential community programmes including educational, health, art, drug outreach and counselling programmes and support for the local travelling community and given the appalling effect these cutbacks will have on the local north Coolock communities; if the Minister would also indicate if the Government is planning to end completely funding for these vital programmes in 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter; (3) Deputy Joe Costello — proposals for the metering of water in family homes; (4) Deputy John O'Mahony — the urgent need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to immediately sanction funding for the mobility grant scheme, the housing adaptation scheme, and the housing aid for older people scheme; (5) Deputy Finian McGrath — allegations of inappropriate housing allocation in the country's largest local authority Dublin City Council and the urgent need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to have a proper inquiry into this matter; (6) Deputy Jimmy Deenihan — the problem with the processing of REP scheme four plans; (7) Deputy Brian Hayes — to obtain clarification from the Minister for Education and Science on the new contractual arrangements for the provision of ICT in schools and whether small Irish ICT businesses have the opportunity to compete on a level playing field for contracts; (8) Deputies Michael Noonan, Jan O'Sullivan, Kieran O'Donnell — the lack of Government finance to the Limerick regeneration agencies; (9) Deputy Dan Neville — Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Services; and (10) Deputy Tom Hayes — in view of the fact that the roads in South Tipperary have deteriorated so seriously over the past three months due to flooding and frost conditions, to ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to confirm when funding will be made available to improve the roads.</p>

        <heading>Leaders’ Questions. </heading>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_30">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_172">I offer my sympathy to the 760 workers of Bank of Scotland (Ireland) which has just announced its intention to close its Halifax operations in Ireland with the loss of 760 jobs by end July 2010, which is devastating news.  In that context, I put the following question to the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach will be only too well aware that the Irish taxpayer has had to write the biggest ever cheque of €54 billion in respect of NAMA.  The proposition put by Government before, during and since NAMA has been that in return for our taking the huge risk of relieving the banks of their reckless loans and property deals credit would flow to Irish business.  Throughout the NAMA debate last year the Government and Ministers indicated that the tens of billions of euro provided by Irish taxpayers through NAMA to the banks in respect of their toxic developer loans would be used to finance new Irish businesses by way of lending and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">I recall that the Taoiseach stated that his sole motivation in setting up the controversial agency was to get credit flowing into the economy.  The Minister for Finance told the Dáil on 16 September last that NAMA would ensure that credit flows again to viable businesses and households.  He also stated in <i>The Sunday Tribune </i> at that time that a wall of cash from NAMA could help restore credit flow and get the economy growing again.  This is in complete contrast with what was stated at the meeting held with the IMF, namely, that it does not believe that NAMA will result in a significant increase in bank lending in Ireland.  Why was this relevant and fundamental fact withheld from the House?  The IMF is the international reputable body in respect of banks and banking issues.  It now transpires from information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act that it told Government that NAMA would not result in a significant amount of credit flowing to Irish business.  Why was this fact concealed from this House during the NAMA debate when it was made known to the Taoiseach and Government?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_31">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_174">Nothing relating to these matters was concealed.  The IMF supports the establishment of NAMA.  As regards the issues arising from information contained on the Department of Finance website, a specific paragraph relates to the fact that NAMA will result in a significant increase in bank lending in Ireland.  This is on the basis of our encouraging the adoption of a NAMA-type initiative even if the Minister had not already announced the initiative.  The suggestion that the IMF was not in favour of the establishment of NAMA or indeed that we could proceed with a NAMA is not correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">The note on which yesterday's newspaper report was based contains an endorsement of NAMA by the IMF.  That particular part of the note did not make it into yesterday's reports.  It is clear that the IMF fully backs the Government policy on the banks and the establishment of NAMA.  The remarks made on bank lending in Ireland were made in the context of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, assuring the IMF that the Government did not wish to see a surge in lending designed to re-inflate the property market to near boom levels.  That discussion took place at a meeting last April.  We did not then and do not now regard such an outcome as desirable.  The IMF agrees with us in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">Since the meeting referred to in yesterday's newspaper report took place we have had an intensive debate about NAMA inside and outside this House.  That debate culminated in the passage of the NAMA legislation which allows the Minister to issue guidelines to the participating institutions to facilitate the flow of credit to SMEs.  The inclusion of that provision in the legislation arose directly from the concern expressed on all sides of the House that credit be available in this economy.  Let us be clear, the intention of the guidelines is not to return to a credit splurge but to ensure that viable businesses and households can access funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">The purpose of NAMA is to cleanse the banks' balance sheets of toxic loans so that we can create a healthy banking system.  The role of the banks in the economy is to make credit available to viable, sustainable businesses and households.  It is the Government's view that NAMA is the best way to achieve that aim.  The IMF delegation agrees with that view.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_32">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_178">The point I made was that the information given by the IMF was that there would not be a wall of cash as referred to by the Minister for Finance arising from NAMA, a fact that was not disclosed to this House by the Taoiseach or Ministers during the debate on NAMA in this House.  The assertion made by Fine Gael that NAMA would not result in a return to significant lending to Irish business has been vindicated by what the IMF stated.  It was further vindicated by Mr. Sheehy at an Oireachtas committee meeting in November last when he stated that if people believe that the day after NAMA is established the country will be awash with money, they are wrong — that is not going to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">Yesterday, the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, criticised bank lending policy in terms of their facilities for extending credit to Irish businesses.  Thousands of Irish businesses, including retail and manufacturing industries and so on, cannot get credit from banks.  The Irish taxpayer has been duped by Government into writing a cheque for €54 billion in return for a wall of cash which will not be evident.  This means thousands of jobs could be lost as a result of credit drying up.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">In that context and in view of the fact that this materially fundamental information was withheld from the House and that the Government would have discussed this matter at some length with Government officials, will the Taoiseach tell the House what moneys, in his estimation, will be available to banks for lending to Irish business in what is now a crisis situation for thousands of small businesses.  What is the Taoiseach's estimate of the amount of money that will be available to be loaned to Irish businesses all over the country which are now in crisis?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_181">Deputy Kenny has again misquoted the situation.  Professor Honohan in his statement stated that the overall thrust and macro economic policy and the pace and scale of budgetary adjustments appeared to him about right as a basis for building a sustained recovery.  He also stated that interest rates on Government bonds are much lower than they were only a few months ago because of the degree to which foreign confidence is building in Ireland's ability and determination to restore the public finances and its clearly defined strategy as exemplified by the relatively tough measures already taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Deputy Kenny continually suggests that we are writing cheques of €54 billion in respect of NAMA operations.  However, what we are doing is presenting Government bonds to the European Central Bank for the purposes of losses being taken primarily by the banks and those who own the loans, which is at great variance to how Deputy Kenny characterises the operation being brought forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_187">We are presenting to the Central Bank bonds which will be backed by assets on the basis of the reduced value NAMA will pay for them.  The first losses will be taken by the banks and creditors.  No matter how many times the Deputy says it, I will still keep saying what the true situation is.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">As regards the question of how we deal with providing sufficient credit to the economy, it is by taking the decisions we have taken.  Reducing the cost of Government debt, first of all, has reduced the cost to taxpayers.  International confidence in the direction we are taking is providing funding to the Irish banking system on an ongoing basis.  The fact that NAMA will be operationalised will provide further evidence of the Government's determination to proceed along the lines we have outlined.  It is clear that by using the NAMA mechanism and bringing those distressed assets on to NAMA's books, we will be in a position in which banks will be able to obtain funds on international markets in addition to whatever capital they have themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">As we have outlined, there will be a recapitalisation programme involved.  We will deal with all of that comprehensively.  That is the only way we will get to a situation where we have a pathway to recovery and where banks get back to the core franchise of providing loans to the productive sector.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_192">Some 760 jobs are to go in the Bank of Scotland (Ireland), while yesterday it was announced that 175 jobs are to go at Boston Scientific in Galway.  That is almost 1,000 jobs in two days, on top of the 436,000 people who are already out of work as we saw from last week's live register figures.  The biggest and most urgent issue currently facing this country is to get the economy repaired and recovered, and to get people back to work.  I was interested to hear the comments made last night by Mr. Craig Barrett, the businessman credited with bringing Intel to Ireland.  According to one report, he deconstructed the notion that Ireland could recreate its Celtic tiger economy simply by cutting costs.  He advocated a prescription in three parts: smart people, smart ideas and the right environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">We have been hearing a lot from the Government about the smart economy.  In December 2008, the Taoiseach announced an innovation task force, but did not set it up until June 2009.  It was supposed to report by the end of 2009, but it has not done so and we do not know when it will report.  Last year, the Taoiseach promoted another good idea, which was to establish an international content services centre.  The Labour Party agrees with that idea and in pursuit of it Deputy Quinn tabled a question to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, since seemingly her Department is responsible for initiatives to promote job creation.  We were a bit surprised to receive a query on foot of the parliamentary question asking us to explain what we meant by an international content services centre.  Can the Taoiseach say what progress has been made towards establishing such a centre?  When and where will it be established?  What budgetary investment will be provided for it by the Government and what is the estimated number of jobs it will create?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_42">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_194">I understand that Bank of Scotland (Ireland) is to make the announcement this evening.  I regret the fact that those workers will lose their jobs.  I understand that redundancy terms will be offered.  It is part of a bank restructuring worldwide, with institutions pulling back from markets which are not profitable for them.  I am pleased that a substantial part of the business of Bank of Scotland (Ireland) will remain with 850 jobs involved.  This decision should not affect other players in the market.  I have been assured that all customers of Bank of Scotland (Ireland) will be looked after and will not be disadvantaged by the changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">Boston Scientific has informed IDA Ireland that 175 people on temporary contract will be released from their contracts.  That is against a background where Boston Scientific continues to employ 3,000 people in Galway.  It has a large number of temporary employees to facilitate a ramp-up-ramp-down process as volumes dictate.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">As regards the Deputy's question on the innovation task force, I told him last week during parliamentary questions that the penultimate meeting was last week and it was likely that a report would be available by the end of this month.  That is a month or six weeks later than expected, but a number of groups have been working on it.  That valuable work will be beneficial.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">The international content services centre will be worked on through the digital hub in liaison with the IDA.  They will be working hard to see in what way we can bring that particular project forward.  It is part of a number of projects concerned with identifying new areas, including Internet technologies, internationally-traded services, the green-clean tech area and the food industry.  In such areas, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland can prepare a jobs strategy even in the context of this year when we expect unemployment to peak, although jobs will still be created.  The churning of jobs between losses and gains continues.  There is no doubt that the public finance position we are bringing forward is the best way, and a prerequisite for ensuring that we get more jobs into the economy.  In that manner, these projects can obtain support and be brought from concept to fruition.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">As I understand it, those are the four points the Deputy raised in his question and those are the answers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_43">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_199">Unfortunately, that answer does not tell me any more than I already know about the international content services centre.  The programme for Government states that budgetary support is being committed for six priority areas in the knowledge society report, one of which is the establishment of an international content services centre in co-operation between the digital hub and the IDA.  The Labour Party supports that, but what level of budgetary support is being provided for the international content services centre?  When will it be established?</p>
          <p eId="para_200">In a report dated 23 July 2009, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, announced that the international content services centre would be established in 2010.  Will it be established this year?  If so, where will it be located and how many jobs will it generate?  I am inclined to agree with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, when he says that it has the potential to create thousands of jobs.  It is an IFSC-type idea for digital content and has huge potential.  The only problem is that we have not seen much evidence of the Government doing anything to follow through on it.  Can the Taoiseach answer those questions?  What level of budgetary support has been, or is being, provided for this?  Will it be established in 2010 and, if so, where and what is the estimate for the number of jobs it will create?  Is anything being done about it?</p>

IDA personnel are working on that matter and when it emerges, if they can bring forward a proposal for consideration by the board, it will of course obtain budgetary support though the IDA's grant-in-aid and all the other facilities we have available to assist enterprise supports.  We are providing over €200 million this year for enterprise supports.  When a mature project is brought before it, the board will consider it in the normal way.  It is not a question of picking something out of the air and deciding "Here's the international content services centre".  One must sit down and work with partners to see in what way one can bring forward experts in this area, in addition to the expertise we have identified at home ourselves.  It is not a question of sitting back on any of these projects.</p>

Despite worldwide foreign direct investment being down by 30%, it was up 4% here last year, which was the worst year we ever had.</p>

The economy of the mid-west is very dependent on the tourism industry.  Unemployment in County Clare is on the rise again and this tax is affecting our competitiveness.  I want the Minister for Finance to clarify immediately if he will abolish this tax as it is an unfair tax in an island nation, is destroying the aviation sector and is wiping out the region.

There is a capital budget of €6.5 billion, as I have repeatedly explained, for this year, which will support many tens of thousands of jobs.  Indeed, €1.2 billion is being provided for maintaining and protecting existing jobs and providing training for those who are, unfortunately, out of work.  A very significant investment is being made by the Government, but the idea that a further stimulus package could be introduced that would extend the deficit is simply not a viable proposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">As regards the bank job losses, I have outlined my regret that this has happened.  It relates to the withdrawal from the market by this company in respect of some of its activities.  A redundancy package will obviously be offered to the employees, but it is important to emphasise, based on the considerable losses we have seen in the banking system, that there have been job casualties there, as with other sectors of the economy, where losses have been incurred.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_376">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_377">The Finance Bill 2010 ensures that all sectors play their part in the critical task of stabilising the public finances.  We know from our experience of recent decades that unless we restore order to the public finances, our economy will not recover.  The extraordinary budgetary adjustments the Government has introduced during this economic crisis have halted the deterioration in the budget balance and boosted international confidence in our ability and willingness to put our house in order.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The benefits of these decisive actions can be seen in the sharp drop in our borrowing costs over the past year.  Had we not taken strong measures in December's budget and convinced international markets of our determination to correct the public finances, we surely would not have escaped the jump in borrowing costs that some other euro area members have suffered over recent weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">We must remain steadfast on the path to fiscal correction set out in the budget.  We are setting the seeds for economic recovery and new job creation.  The unemployment rate will peak this year at just over 13%.  This is less than projected last April but it is still unacceptably high.  That is why we must continue to encourage employment growth through targeted measures that will build on our existing strengths and put us in the position to take advantage of the recovery that my Department and the Central Bank are forecasting for later this year.  The Finance Bill 2010 does exactly that.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">The Government remains committed to providing a pro-enterprise environment and to maintaining our relatively low tax burden on business.  This will assist us in maintaining and enhancing our competitiveness.  Unless we sharpen our competitive edge, we will be unable to return to the tried and tested strategy of export-led growth.  With this in mind, the Bill extends the existing scheme of tax exemption on the income and gains of new start-up companies over the first three years of operation.  It will now be available to companies which commence trading in 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The Bill also contains measures to facilitate the development of Islamic finance in Ireland.  Islamic finance covers any financing arrangement that is compliant with the principles of Sharia law.  Islamic finance is the fastest growing sector of the international financial services industry and it is important that we be in a position to attract this new type of investment into Ireland.  Under these provisions, the tax treatment applicable to conventional finance transactions will be extended to embrace Islamic finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">I have received a number of proposals to establish a medium-term national savings product as an additional source of funding for capital investment.  In the budget, I announced the introduction of a national solidarity bond.  The Bill gives effect to that announcement.  The national solidarity bond will be marketed by the NTMA to small investors over the next few months.  Unlike some other NTMA long-term savings products such as savings certificates, the bond will pay interest on a periodic basis over its lifetime in addition to interest at the end of its lifetime.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">In my budget speech, I promised to bring forward a package of measures to improve the effectiveness of the Revenue Commissioners in tackling the shadow economy, addressing smuggling and excise frauds, and dealing with tax avoidance schemes, all of which are a matter of acute current public interest and concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">The Revenue Commissioners' experience from dealing with a series of investigations over the years is that offshore vehicles have commonly featured as a key element of the tax evasion process.  In the context of the property-induced crisis with which NAMA is now involved, we are concerned that similar offshore vehicles have been used to evade tax.  The Bill facilitates access by Revenue to information in the possession of NAMA about any offshore entities or vehicles involved in transactions that are now under its scrutiny.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">There are a number of other Revenue powers or measures included in the Bill.  One in particular will allow for a substantial increase in the fines that a court may impose on those convicted on indictment of certain offences under excise and custom law.  These provisions will be particularly important in the fight against tobacco smuggling which has become a significant problem with serious implications not only for the health of our citizens, but also for the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">While we continue to battle our way through these challenging economic conditions, we must remain aware of the longer term but perhaps even more difficult challenge posed by climate change.  It is the responsibility of governments everywhere to change behaviour to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.  Accordingly, this Bill provides full details of the carbon tax I announced on budget day.  The tax has already been applied to petrol and auto-diesel.  It will apply to kerosene, marked gas oil, liquid petroleum gas, fuel oil and natural gas from next May and the application of the tax to coal and commercial peat will be subject to a commencement order.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">As a result of the European Court of Justice's ruling against Ireland of 16 July 2009, the VAT legislation must be amended to allow public bodies, including local authorities, to be subject to VAT where they engage in activities that lead to a distortion of competition with private operators.  Examples of services that will now be subject to VAT include waste collection, landfill and recycling; off-street parking; toll roads; the operation of leisure facilities; rent from certain lettings of commercial property; and the supply of staff and data.  It should be noted that such services are already subject to VAT where they are provided by a private operator.  This seems to have escaped comment in much criticism of this measure.  The standard or the reduced VAT rates will apply as appropriate.  The changes will apply from 1 July 2010.  Education, health, water and passenger transport services will not, however, become subject to VAT arising from the judgment.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">Business customers who charge VAT will not be affected by this change since they can claim for any VAT charged by a public body.  The impact on private individuals, VAT-exempt entities and other non-registered bodies will depend on whether the VAT is passed on by the public bodies, which in any event should be limited somewhat since public bodies providing the affected services will have entitlement to deduct VAT on their inputs.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The Bill abolishes six tax reliefs, as recommended by the Commission on Taxation.  This is in addition to the announcement in the budget that mortgage interest relief will be abolished on a phased basis and the removal of a number of property based reliefs in the health sector in the Finance Act 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The effect of these changes has been to remove unnecessary costs and distortions from the tax system.  I am committed to continuing this process.  To that end, I will ask each of my colleagues in government to assess the effectiveness of tax expenditures within their sectors, with particular reference to those that the Commission on Taxation recommended should be removed from the tax code.  My Department will review the outcome of that sectoral analysis and I will report to the Cabinet by the end of June 2010.  This new approach will place the onus for objectively justifying the retention of any expenditure on the sector benefiting from the relief.  My Department will then be in a position to present the Cabinet with an analysis on which to make well-informed decisions about the future of tax expenditures in good time for the 2011 budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I will now describe some of the main provisions contained in the Bill in the time available to me.  Part 1 of the Bill covers the income levy, income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.  My budget day announcement that an exemption from the income levy would be provided for certain capital expenditure incurred by farmers in meeting the requirements of the EU nitrates directive is in section 2.  This section also makes a number of technical amendments to the income levy, including placing the levy on the same footing as income tax for double taxation agreements and cross-Border worker relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">Two tax reliefs recommended for abolition by the Commission on Taxation are dealt with in section 4.  It ends the tax relief for long-term care policies and the benefit-in-kind relief relating to the loan of certain art objects.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Section 5 contains a number of changes which will simplify the approval of qualifying health expenses for tax relief purposes.  The requirement for approving medical institutions is removed.  Instead, maintenance or treatment costs will now qualify for relief where they are necessarily incurred in association with the services of a practitioner or diagnostic procedures carried out on the advice of a practitioner.  Nursing home fees will qualify for relief provided the nursing home concerned provides qualified nursing care on-site 24 hours per day.  I am also amending the legislation to clarify that tax relief is available in respect of private contributions made towards the cost of the upkeep of an individual under the fair deal scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Section 6 provides for the changes to the mortgage interest relief regime announced in the budget.  To support those who bought their homes at the peak of the housing market, relief is being extended until 2017 for those who took out a qualifying home loan in 2004 or thereafter.  To provide encouragement to those who may wish to purchase in the next three years, relief will be available at current levels until 2017 for loans taken out between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2011.  This is an extension of six months on my budget day announcement.  It has been made because it is more convenient to have such a cut-off point at the end of a calendar year.  A reduced rate of relief will apply for qualifying loans taken out after this date, but before the end of 2012.  This reduced rate will be 15% for first-time buyers and 10% for non-first time buyers with ceilings of €6,000 for married couples and €3,000 for single individuals applying in both cases.  Loans taken out in 2013 or after will not qualify for mortgage interest relief.  Mortgage interest relief will no longer exist for the tax year 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">Section 9<b> </b>enhances the current remittance scheme which provides an incentive for foreign employees to undertake an assignment in Ireland.  The scheme is being extended to include European Union and European Economic Area nationals while reducing from three years to one year the amount of time they have to spend in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">Section 11<b> </b>provides for the abolition of tax relief on service charges.  This change is in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation.  Provision of such relief is inconsistent with the overall thrust of having persons meet the economic costs of the services provided.  Relief can be claimed this year for service charges paid in 2009 and relief can be claimed next year for charges paid in 2010.  There will be no relief on charges relating to the year 2011 which would have been claimed in 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">An anti-avoidance provision, section 12,<b> </b>tightens up the rent a room scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Section 15<b> </b>makes a number of amendments to certain pension-related tax provisions and introduces a requirement for the electronic delivery of certain information in respect of small self-administered pension schemes.  Sections 16 to 18, inclusive,<b> </b>are designed to prevent abuse of certain types of share-based remuneration schemes for employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">As I announced in my budget speech, the Government wants high earners availing of tax incentive schemes to contribute more in the current difficult economic circumstances.  Therefore, I am abolishing, with effect from tax year 2010, the loss relief available to owners of significant buildings and gardens who are passive investors.  Details of the changes are set out in section 20<b> </b>along with some transitional arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The effective income tax rate paid by persons subject to the restriction of reliefs or horizontal measure is increased from 20% to 30% in section<b> </b>22.  I regard this provision as an important move in ensuring all parts of society play their part in addressing the difficulties facing the public finances.  The windfall tax, a special rate of 80% capital gains tax, which was introduced as part of the NAMA legislation, is amended by section<b> </b>24.  The provision will ensure that material contraventions involving a rezoning are covered by the tax.  The amendment also ensures that the sale of once-off sites below an acre in size and €250,000 in value are not subject to the windfall tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">Section<b> </b>25 provides for the termination of the scheme of capital allowances in respect of child care buildings.  The scheme, which was previously open-ended, now has a termination date of 30 September 2010, unless certain qualifying conditions are met.  This measure is in line with the termination of other capital allowance schemes in the Finance Act 2009.  The abolition was also recommended by the Commission on Taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">Enhancing the attractiveness of Ireland as a location from which to conduct international business is an important theme of the legislation. The tax treatment applying to the new management company passport regime introduced by the European legislation, the UCITS IV directive, is clarified in section<b> </b>27.  The section also exempts investment undertakings from the requirement to obtain and maintain declarations of non-Irish tax resident unit-holders where the investment fund in question is not marketed in Ireland to address the disproportionate administrative burden this places on industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Under section 28,<b> </b>an existing provision which removes the charge to Irish tax on the profits of a trade exercised in the State where it is exercised through an independent Irish resident agent in certain cases is being extended to include companies authorised under the European UCITS legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Finally, section 29<b> </b>removes the requirement for non-resident companies receiving dividends from Irish resident companies to provide a tax residence and-or auditor’s certificate to obtain exemption from dividend withholding tax, DWT, at source. Instead, a self-assessment system will apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The legislation on deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, is amended by section<b> </b>33 in a number of respects.  First, it removes personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, from the scope of the DIRT regime.  Second, it requires a relevant deposit taker to obtain the tax reference number of a person making a specified deposit; this will facilitate the introduction of the national solidarity bond announced in the budget speech.  Third, financial institutions will make accelerated payments of DIRT tax to the Exchequer.  Finally, financial institutions must automatically issue statements setting out the amount of DIRT deducted rather than on request as at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">As a Government we must ensure that, in the face of a growing competitive threat from new emerging markets and the aggressive marketing of established centres, the Irish Financial Services Centre remains competitive in all areas.  That is why section 35 of the Bill contains provisions which will help us to attract our share of the growing market of Islamic finance.  In 2007, Islamic finance was estimated to be worth approximately US $700 billion and is estimated to be growing at approximately 10% per annum.  The measures in the Bill will provide level playing fields for all commercial financial product providers to ensure the tax benefits that accrue to conventional financial products are also available to Sharia compliant products.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">These changes are a first step towards providing equality of treatment to Sharia compliant financial products.  I intend to work with the Muslim community, the banks and interested parties to investigate the market for Sharia compliant retail products in the context of future finance Bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">Ireland's existing, but limited, arm's length pricing rules for manufacturing cease at the end of this year with the ending of manufacturing relief.  The opportunity is now being taken to introduce general transfer pricing legislation in section 38.<b>  </b>This will cover arm’s length trading between associated enterprises for cross-border and domestic transactions, but small and medium enterprises are excluded.  The provisions will align Ireland’s tax code in this area with international norms, namely, the OECD transfer pricing guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">A number of significant enhancements are being made to the scheme of tax relief for the provision of intangible assets introduced last year.  The amendments in section 39<b> </b>include additions to the list of specified intangible assets that can qualify under the scheme and a reduction in the period from 15 to ten years over which the assets must be held to avoid a clawback of the relief.  The aim of these amendments is to increase the effectiveness of the scheme and to enhance its ability to attract international business to Ireland.  Section 40<b> </b>extends from seven to ten the categories of energy-efficient equipment eligible for the existing accelerated capital allowance scheme.  The new categories included in this scheme are refrigeration and cooling systems, electro-mechanical systems, and catering and hospitality equipment.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">My budget speech included an extension of the existing scheme allowing start-up companies three years' relief from corporation tax.<b> </b>Section 41 gives effect to this announcement by including companies commencing to trade in 2010.   It is important that the annual Bill includes measures which ensure that Ireland can continue to attract internationally traded services.  Three consecutive sections — 42, 43 and 44 — are aimed at this objective. Unilateral credit relief, in respect of royalty flows from residents in non-treaty countries, is extended to all trading companies. This relief, currently available to companies entitled to the 10% corporation tax manufacturing regime, expires at the end of 2010.  The measure extends the relief beyond that date and to all trading companies.  Unused credits in respect of foreign tax on branch profits will be permitted to be carried forward and credited against corporation tax in succeeding accounting periods.  Finally, section 44<b> </b>permits a company to carry forward excess losses of a foreign branch that were disregarded under section 847 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Changes are proposed in section 46 to the current tax treatment of dividends received by companies here.  The amendments involve charging tax at 12.5% instead of 25% on foreign dividends paid out of trading profits from countries with whom Ireland does not have a tax treaty; simplifying the arrangements under which foreign dividends are treated as sourced from trading or non-trading profits; and providing tax exemption to foreign dividends forming trading income received by portfolio investors, that is, companies with a holding or voting rights of less than 5%.  I am confident that measures such as this will improve the international business environment here and help to encourage the creation of high quality employment in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Section 50<b> </b>contains a number of changes to the existing research and development tax credit scheme.  The main change deals with a position where a company or company group is carrying out research and development activities in different facilities in separate geographical locations and the activities in one of those facilities is permanently discontinued. Section<b> </b>52 makes two amendments relating to the date of disposal and acquisition of an asset.  The first amendment avoids a position where a person disposing of land under a compulsory purchase order could have been due to pay the liability before receiving compensation for the land.  The second amendment ensures that the proceeds from a compulsory purchase order are liable to capital gains tax where the individual making the disposal dies before receiving the consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">I am aware that there has been some concern among farming organisations that the date of the disposal of lands for a CPO, rather than the date when the compensation was received, should determine the rate of tax applicable to the disposal.  I am pleased to inform the House that the Revenue Commissioners have confirmed that the rate of tax which will apply to land acquired under a CPO is the rate when the land is disposed of, which in most cases will be the date when the acquiring authority enters on the land.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Part 2 of the Bill deals with customs and excise.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The legislation for the introduction of a carbon tax and for the consequential necessary legislative changes arising from this tax are set out in sections 60 to 83,<b> </b>inclusive.<b> </b>Section 84<b> </b>confirms the budget day announcements reducing the rates of alcohol products tax. Sections 85 to 88, inclusive, provide for the updating of excise law provisions to reflect new European legislation on excises including the new computerised excise movement control system. Sections 89 to 96, inclusive,<b> </b>change the penalties applicable to certain offences under excise and custom law, increasing substantially the fines which a court may impose on persons convicted of such offences on indictment.  Included here is section 92, which places on a clear legal footing the arrangements under which Customs can obtain information in respect of goods and passengers in advance of their arrival.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">Vehicle registration tax, VRT, issues are dealt with in sections 97 to 106, inclusive, including, in addition to the VRT items to which I already referred, the introduction from 1 January 2011 of a revised classification system for the registration of vehicles in the State to reflect the broader European classification system.  There will be the introduction of a new requirement for vehicle insurers to inform Revenue where they issue a policy to a foreign-registered vehicle for a period in excess of 42 days.  This will provide a further tool to tackle VRT evasion by State residents who fail to re-register and pay the appropriate VRT on vehicles purchased outside the State.  Sections 102 and 103 confirm budget day announcements introducing a scrappage scheme, extending until 31 December 2012 the existing VRT exemption for electric vehicles and the existing VRT relief of up to €2,500 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">Part 3 deals with, value-added tax, VAT.  Sections 107 to 126, inclusive, set out a range of changes to VAT including, as announced in the budget, the reduction in the standard VAT rate by 0.5% to 21% with effect from 1 January 2010; the application of VAT to services provided by public bodies including local authorities; the introduction of a margin scheme for second-hand means of transport and agricultural machinery; and changes to the VAT treatment of telephone cards and prepaid top-ups for mobile telephones.  Sections 124 to 126, inclusive, make amendments to the Value-Added Tax Act to facilitate the introduction of a VAT consolidation Bill later this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">Part 4 deals with stamp duties.  Section 128 allows for the exchange of data between the Revenue Commissioners and the Property Registration Authority in a new e-stamping regime.  A relief from stamp duty will be provided under section 131 to facilitate fund mergers enabling the re-organisation of funds into structures now permitted under recent European UCITS IV legislation.  The levy on certain life assurance premiums will be amended by section 132 to exclude pensions and re-insurance business.  The payment date for the levy will also be brought forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Part 5 deals with capital acquisitions tax, CAT.  Provisions relating to a wide-ranging package modernising CAT are covered in section 139, the full details of which are outlined in the explanatory memorandum.  Delivered on an Exchequer-neutral basis, the changes will deliver significant benefits to customers and their agents including the elimination of up to 75% of the current quantum of CAT documentation combined with the use of faster, simpler and more straightforward processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">Part 6 covers miscellaneous provisions.  Section 141 gives legislative effect to the domicile levy announced in the Budget Statement in which I highlighted the importance of improving the effectiveness of the Revenue Commissioners in addressing the challenges facing the collection of taxes including dealing with tax avoidance.  The Bill contains several relating measures which aim to achieve this objective.  Section 143 will enable information to be given to Revenue by the Taxi Regulator about persons operating and licensed in the taxi and hackney sectors.  Section 144 will enable Revenue to apply to the Appeal Commissioners for consent to issue a notice to obtain information from third parties regarding a class of persons on the same basis as they have for financial institutions.  Revenue will be able to secure information from NAMA on offshore vehicles under the provisions of section 145.  Where summonses and other such notices are returned unserved by the Garda, Revenue will have the authority under section 146 to serve them.  Section 147 adds to the list of taxes and duties which must be paid before a tax clearance certificate can be issued.  Only taxes within the control of the taxpayer are included, such as the income levy and excise and customs duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Double taxation treaties are widely regarded as critical pieces of fiscal infrastructure for developing substantial bilateral trading and investment opportunities by reducing tax impediments that might otherwise deter cross-border activity.  Since 2007 we have grown our network of tax treaties from 44 to 56.  The provision in section 149 is the final step in the ratification process for new treaties with Bahrain, Belarus, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Moldova, Georgia and Serbia.  Section 149 provides for the ratification of eight tax information exchange agreements with Gibraltar, Guernsey, Jersey, Turks and Caicos Islands, Anguilla, Bermuda, Cayman Islands and Liechtenstein.  Section 152 provides for the introduction of a statutory scheme providing for voluntary deductions from members of the Judiciary to cover pension-related deductions.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">At this stage there are still a small number of matters under consideration for inclusion in the Finance Bill that I may bring forward on Committee Stage.  I will, of course, also give consideration to any constructive suggestions put forward during our debate today and tomorrow.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_211">
          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_423">The economy faces its most serious threat ever.  In the past 18 months we have lost 200,000 jobs, of which 90% were those of persons under the age of 30 years.  They are the people to whom we look to create the dynamism for a knowledge economy and new enterprises for the future, the building bricks of our future economic success.  We cannot afford, through the lack of Government ambition, to allow them to be faced with the bleak spectacle of unemployment or emigration.  Unfortunately, that is what has already happened.  They are the cream of our people who must be helped find opportunities.  However, there must be far greater ambition than is displayed in this Finance Bill if we are to confront this huge underlying problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">The Minister does not seem to appreciate the real danger that we will enter into a vicious cycle of cuts being undermined by rising interest rates and unemployment payments.  This year the Minister admitted that of the €4 billion cuts he imposed, half will be whittled away by additional interest payments and the other half by the need to pay for the 75,000 jobs that he predicts will be lost in the next 12 months.  That puts the economy in a vice-grip.  It is as if we are running hard just to stand still.  Last year, it was huge tax increases; this year, cuts in public service pay.  We are asking people to make large sacrifices without the bigger picture of a strategy as to how we are going to get out of the hole in which we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">My fundamental problem with the budget is that it lacks the ambition and a strategy in which people can believe.  One key concern is that confidence is shot through in our community.  John Maynard Keynes, an economist who has become fashionable again, once said, "If enterprise is afoot, wealth accumulates whatever may be happening to thrift; and if enterprise is asleep, wealth decays, whatever thrift may be doing".  Our problem is everyone in our economy is caught in this move to thrift, this need to pull in their horns, to reduce their ambitions.  That has a large knock-on effect on the rest of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">We needed from this Finance Bill and budget something that would give people confidence and that it is time to think more positively.  It needed to assure people to start getting money together for an investment project or spend on items they have postponed.  That is part of the ingredient of a recovery that we have to envisage.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Fine Gael recognised this early on and put forward significant proposals, even in the taxation area, to address this.  We wanted to cut employer's PRSI contributions, particularly at the low-wage level.  We wanted the airport tax removed to strike a deal with airlines to bring more passengers into Ireland to kick-start the tourism sector.  We wanted to have a once-off cut in low-rate, labour-intensive VAT rates to assure people not to postpone labour intensive decisions such as house repairs.  That is the sort of confidence building that is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">While I welcome the Minister's commitment to a national solidarity bond, I miss the context in which it will be launched.  Fine Gael, by contrast, has been very clear.  We believe the public utilities, assets owned by the people, provide a platform for a tremendous economic revival.  This is the time to say we do not need an electricity network that is bottom of the class in Europe, the most high cost, the most dependent on fossil fuels and the least developed in terms of renewable energy.  Instead, this is the time to say we can build a platform for success if we build a smart grid fit for the 21st century.  Similarly, this is not the time to content ourselves with broadband speeds and capacity that are perhaps 5% of best practice.  This is the time to say, yes, we can develop those assets that we own to provide a platform for the growth of the knowledge economy.  This is not the time to tolerate €500 million in water going down into the ground without ever reaching a household, a family or a business because of leaks and under investment in the water network.  This is the time to say, we can do something with these State assets.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">This takes some courage.  It takes the willingness to say we can afford to let some assets go now, for example, we can afford to sell our generation capacity that is not mission critical to the recovery of Ireland.  We can provide equity for this sort of investment and then one will have a State equity or holding company and the opportunity to start raise money from private pension funds and from private individuals.  Then one will start to see a strategy in which the Government is saying it wants a platform of smart grids, smart broadband, a well-resourced water authority that can start to drive, both investment now and successful enterprises for the future.  That is the key element missing here.  There is no ambition.  There is no understanding of the central employment crisis that we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">It reflects also a lack of ambition in the recent budget to do anything with the public service itself to set an agenda of change.  To give the Minister his due, he put in place the McCarthy process which churned up the ground for the first time and which stated we need to consolidate and to change our high-cost system.  We cannot afford to be replicating grant-giving powers, administration structures, HR structures and finance structures in 850 different agencies.  We simply cannot afford that anymore.  We must develop the concept of centralised shared services where these agencies are obliged to source, which can be done so much more cheaply.  We needed to see in the budget the kick-start of that exciting reform agenda.  Instead, the Minister has set back that reform agenda by the sort of brinksmanship that went on with the social partners at the end.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">There still is no ambition.  I still have not seen the Government, either through the Minister or any of the other Departments, confirm it is taking up the McCarthy agenda, not the social welfare cuts which were taken up but the more difficult heavy lifting of cutting out quangos, closing down agencies, establishing shared services centres, forcing the knock-on changes and contemplating the need for redundancies.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">The Minister needs to create the momentum for change.  That is what this country is crying out for.  People know this will be painful and it will not be pleasant, but they also know that we must go through that.  Dr. Craig Barrett stated yesterday there are now 3 billion new capitalists out there.  Some 3 billion people from China, India and Eastern Europe who, in our heyday ten years ago when we had a successful economy, were not players.  Ireland could be very successful doing what we had and we could be quite smug in our success.  People wanted to get into the bastion of Europe, for example, American companies wanted to get inside the walls and trade in Europe.  Now that world is changed.  On the model on which we built our success, we must realise that we face a much tougher and more competitive environment and the Minister must give people a sense that there is a purpose and a mission here.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I do not pretend for one minute it will not be tough.  Effectively, we will have to mimic a devaluation of our currency.  We will have to drive down costs across the board, not only public service pay costs but business rents, boardroom pay and the rip-off that has scarred this country.  It must go right through the structure.  It must be in public utilities and in the charges for which the Minister and his colleagues are responsible.  Then we will start to hear people saying that there is a strategy here and that the Government is not just about hitting the little people; it is about doing something that is fair across the board.  Later this evening the House will discuss exempting high-paid public servants from the impact of this, which is the wrong signal at a time when we are trying to achieve the change.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">We now need big ambition from Government.  There are tough measures to take but the big ambition, hope and belief is essential to getting through these difficult times.  Instead, there is merely a tidying-up exercise in the Finance Bill.  It falls so far short of motivating anyone to put his hand in his pocket to invest or to do something new to build confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">The Minister did not bring forward the ideas of his Commission on Taxation on its narrow range of proposals.  It had interesting ideas.  Its members wanted to help the unemployed get retraining and this was an area of tax relief that they proposed.  That would start to give some people the opportunity to say that here is something coming back from the taxes they paid all those years.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">They suggested that research and development which is supposed to be part of the feed into a knowledge economy should become allowable, not only against corporate tax but against pay related social insurance, and that such would bring a wider range of companies into thinking about research and development and about investing in the products of the future.  That did not figure either.  We do not see any such extension of the research and development credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">They recommended to us that we should support not just start-up companies but sole traders, giving the sort of break that last year the Minister gave to companies.  There are many people per force of circumstance considering starting up businesses.  Why not give them the same break the Minister offered to companies?</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Some of the commission's recommendations for some reason were ignored while the Minister sought others, which are not anything like as significant or which do not make an impact.  I thank the Minister for the brief from his officials, but the bottom line was that all of these proposals put together would cost nothing.  One cannot achieve a great deal of stimulus with something that costs nothing, and that is a problem here.  This was a tidying-up exercise, with a little given there and a little taken back here.  There was no attempt to say it is time to give people a leg up and a bit of confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">The Minister's non-domicile tax proposal is about as watertight as the string bag we, as kids, used to carry down to the shops in which one could not bring anything liquid back because it would gush out.  I note comics such as "The Beano" are being revived and perhaps it could do a job on the Minister's non-domicile tax.  The exemption is ridiculous.  There is an escape hatch therein that is ridiculously wide.  One must have Irish-located capital, excluding shares held in any company which carries on a trade, greater than €5 million.  One would be caught only if one's private residence is worth over €5 million.  It would not cost such a person much thought to transfer his or her stately home to his or her spouse, and suddenly with one bound this need not be paid.  It is no surprise we got no estimate as to what this will raise.  This will only get payments from persons who want to be seen to pay something.  Maybe there are a few public-spirited people who would recognise that they ought to be paying something, but I just cannot see it working as a tax to put pressure on those who have been avoiding paying tax.  The Minister would not find any of the new income levies he introduced last year having the sort of escape hatches for ordinary persons that are being built into this new tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">The one measure people will see in this — it is no surprise that it was the headline that jumped out at everyone — is the application of VAT.  The only notable measure, or one which one can get one's head around, is that the Minister has decided to extend VAT to a range of public services.  He tells us that this is brought upon us by EU decisions but we are probably talking about €200 or €300 a year that will have to be stumped up by those affected, much of which will come from those who are on their knees and struggling.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">This Finance Bill has followed its predecessor in the budget.  It lacked the ambition needed for this very difficult time.  We must take a tough approach to our public finances, implement cost-cutting across the board in the private and public sectors and become fit, lean and mean again.  However, it had to have the other side.  It had to show the State was willing to match with commitment and imagination the opportunities we have.  We still have opportunities open to us.  The successes that created the Celtic tiger, the enterprise that built up strong sectors, still exists and needs to be nurtured and encouraged.  I am disappointed it has fallen short.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">I refer to the extension of carbon tax to coal and peat.  There seems to be a huge problem in terms of trade from Northern Ireland in these products.  I understand that, effectively, no system has been developed by the Minister or by anyone else on how to keep out much dirtier higher carbon-content coal coming from the North VAT-free.  In regard to this tax proposal for which the Minister is now taking enabling powers, although he is at least holding his hand in terms of the date of implementation, I do not see the corresponding enabling power on how he will police this and make it something which is not unfair to people trading in this space.  Worse still, people will be bringing in more environmentally negative products to be used here.  I do not see the solution that one needs.  This tax needs a corresponding solution on the enforcement and compliance side to match it.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">Not to be entirely negative, I welcome the Minister's decision in regard to mortgage interest relief.  An extension for people who would otherwise have seen their mortgage interest relief disappear this year is welcome because many of those people borrowed in 2004 and in the following years and have been put to the pin of their collars.  They paid at the top of the market and I welcome the relief for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">I welcome a relief we discussed last year, namely, a break for people in the farming community who are trying to comply with the nitrates directive.  Ignoring that as if it were part of their basic income and taxing them on it was very unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">I also welcome some of the decisions the Minister made to bring greater clarity to, and to open up, opportunities in the financial services sector which I hope are successful.  At a time when the financial services sector has taken a hammering, people are encouraged to see there is still optimism and initiative.  For example, people are looking at supporting green finance as a genuine opportunity to develop for Ireland.  This is a growth sector — managing funds that want to concentrate on environmentally sound areas and supporting the markets in carbon trading.  Ireland has developed back office skills.  There is opportunity in these areas.  These are sectors in which we need to sweat those opportunities.  While we seek to rebuild our regulatory structure and to restore confidence, we must match that with a willingness to spot opportunity and to play to our strengths in key sectors.  We still have key sectors and these must be the drivers of our long-term growth prospects.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">I listened to Deputy Gilmore earlier when he asked questions about the smart economy document which has become a bit of an embarrassment to the Government.  If it is serious about the smart economy document, it must have dates which must be driven.  Commitments set out must be honoured and someone must have the sole authority to drive it and give us a sense that the Government is hitting milestones.  People do not believe that is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">People viewed that document on the knowledge economy as putting a big bulldog clip around everything and saying this was our smart economy strategy.  If it is a strategy, there must be deadlines, milestones and someone must be responsible for delivering them and if he or she fails, he or she must be accountable for failing.  Deputy Gilmore put his finger on this and stated that there are milestones in the knowledge economy document and no one is paying any heed to what was said or what was to be delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">That goes to the core of why we are not succeeding on big strategy statements.  Why did we not deliver on our climate change strategy after eight years?  The reason is no one is put in a responsible position and no one is given authority or the budget and if things go wrong, no one is held responsible.  We must move on that.  If we are to believe the smart economy document is anything more than a cover for the Government's nakedness, we must see someone drive it, take responsibility and hit those deadlines.  However, we have not seen that.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">I look forward to Committee Stage which is always an opportunity to learn more about the individual proposals and to tease out the difficult aspects of tax law.  I cannot say I always look forward to it with relish.  It is a period in the dungeons when the only advantage is that the fourth estate is rarely there to disturb us.  I look forward to engaging with the Minister, his colleague or whoever will handle the various aspects of the legislation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_452">This year's Finance Bill is a product of a Government which has run out of ideas about how to restore the economy, get people back to work, get business moving or get credit flowing from the banks.  This Finance Bill, which should mark a turning point in our economic fortunes, is devoid of any real economic plan.  The Government remains locked in denial about the failure of its banking strategy, in particular in respect of NAMA to get credit flowing to businesses and individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Jobs are being lost at the rate of 100 every day.  Just today, 750 job losses were announced by Bank of Scotland Ireland which is closing down its Irish retail banking operation.  I understand it has put forward proposals to the Minister and I would be interested to hear if he has had the opportunity to examine the proposals it has put forward to salvage at least some of the jobs in that company.  Yesterday there were 175 job losses in Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">As unemployment crept to more than 435,000, 60,000 people also emigrated.  However, Fianna Fáil keeps repeating its mantras that we have turned the corner, that we are on the road to recovery and that the economy has stabilised.  Economists around the world have warned of the risks of repeating the mistakes made by the Hoover administration in the USA during the Great Depression, yet this Government seems more intent on following the lead of Hoover rather than Roosevelt.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">While the Government has focused almost exclusively on the banks and its deeply flawed NAMA plan, the real economy of indigenous jobs and businesses continues to take a hammering of historic proportions.  The Government seems to have a strategy that wage cuts as a substitute for deflation is the only recipe it has to offer.  It made €4 billion in cuts in this budget.  The parties in opposition, to support the country's international reputation, loyally gave the Government space to do that.  However, the Government has said this is just the first of three such massive reductions.  Although we gave the Government that space, nothing has been done by it in regard to job retention or job creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">Once again the Finance Bill has little or nothing to offer in the way of a jobs stimulus or confident return to growth.  Once again, the centre piece of the Bill is a series of new tax exemptions for the IFSC, which have been neither costed nor set out in detail, as was promised consequent to tax scandal after tax scandal.  The Government is saying the same thing, namely, "Trust us, and here is a whole bag of tax exemptions and tax reliefs which we will not explain, cost or set out in detail".  To hear the Taoiseach speak, one would think global finance and offshore banking is to be to the recovery in Ireland what the property bubble was to growth during the Celtic tiger era.  He is seriously misled in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">Last night I attended a lecture given by Dr. Craig Barrett on the importance of investing in education, science, research and development.  It was interesting to note that Dr. Barrett, who is the former chairman of Intel, said that we in this country had to move from being average to being excellent.  He said we went around the world boasting that we were in the top percentage of income, but if one examines our performance in critical areas such as education — in mathematics and science — one will find that instead of our performance being excellent, as our income levels would dictate, the Government has brought us down to a miserable average in a country which is famous around the world for its commitment to education.  The Government, during its years in office, has reduced us to being average and not excellent in one of the areas in which Ireland has shone historically, in terms of its commitment to education and a whole generation of people who excelled in education, research and the sciences.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">Dr. Barrett last night warned that the future lies in indigenous start-ups, using smart people and ideas and, above all, an environment conducive to innovation.  What is this Government offering?  It is offering massive support to the banks and very considered support to off-shore banking.  What is in the Finance Bill for indigenous start-ups?  What is in it for the thousands of those with PhDs who were coaxed back to Ireland by various scientific and research programmes, many of whom are in their 30s with young families, who bought houses at the height of the boom and who now, in many cases, will leave the country?  When such people leave Ireland this time they will not return again.  They can be burned once but not twice by this Government.  That is the real loss caused by the kind of fumbling this Government has done regarding economic strategy and policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">Dr. Barrett also said Ireland can no longer depend on inward flows of foreign direct investment.  He is the former chairman of Intel, which carries out a rigorous procedure regarding the location of future investments on a ten to 15-year cycle.  It was a clear and present warning from somebody who is a world expert on Intel locating in Israel versus Ireland versus Costa Rica and all of the different countries which are competing.  He said there was a time when, on the 20 or so headings used by Intel, we were competitive on almost all of them, but we are now only competitive on the tax rate unless we decide to go back to growing the smart economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">The Government seems to be all at sea on this matter.  It does not seem to have any scientists, mathematicians or economists in its number who could come to grips with the nature of the dilemma facing this country.  It has pseudo solutions which will not do very much for many people in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">For many ordinary families and businesses this Finance Bill means they will face additional charges on VAT, as it is applied by the Minister to a range of local authority services.  He proposes to extend VAT charges, on foot of court judgments and European Union decisions, on services supplied by public bodies, including county councils, such as waste collection, recycling, off-street parking, toll roads and the operation of leisure facilities.  Depending on the VAT rate charged for equivalent private services, local authority services will now attract a VAT rate of between 13.5% and 21%.  This is a double whammy, in terms of service charges such as waste collection for ordinary families because the Bill will abolish income tax relief on those charges from next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">In the December budget the Minister told us high earners must pay their fair share — it was one of the headings in his Budget Statement.  However, as Minister he has side-stepped many of the reforms proposed by the Commission on Taxation, in terms of restricting tax avoidance measures used by the super rich to minimise their tax bills.  For example, he has done nothing to curtail tax relief on investments in private hospitals which are now, in many cases, surplus capacity to what the country needs or can afford.  He has not restricted mega pension pots.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_215" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_463">It was abolished last year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_216">
          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_464">The tax relief on private hospitals was not abolished.  It is like the tax relief which is proposed to be abolished regarding child care facilities.  They all have end dates which, under qualifying conditions, can be extended.  They carry a very long tail life in the tax system of a further 15 years.  The Minister should not try to lecture me about what I know is in the tax code.  The Department of Finance might not know but Revenue Commissioners know what is in the tax code and, according to the answer from the Minister's officials, the measures to which I refer cost us at least €400 million per year.  At the height of the Celtic tiger we may have been able to afford that but €400 million is a lot of money now.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">Fianna Fáil launched NAMA to a series of refrains, such as "There is no alternative", or "TINA", "The only game in town", or "TOGIT", and, most importantly, we were told it would get credit flowing.  The revelations yesterday by Mr. Simon Carswell in <i>The Irish Times</i> that the IMF told the Minister for Finance that NAMA would not lead to a significant increase in lending by the Irish banks and that the IMF was encouraged to refrain from making public its estimates of likely losses from the banking crisis indicate that the Government has consciously set out to mislead the House about the consequences of the NAMA project.  When the Minister for Finance spoke at the launch of the debate on the NAMA legislation he said,  “NAMA will strengthen and improve the funding position of the banks so that they can lend to viable businesses and households”.  The Taoiseach said the Government’s objective in restructuring the banks was to generate more access to credit for Irish business at this crucial time.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">At the same time the Minister was claiming the endorsement of the IMF in the House, it is now evident that it told the Minister in private that NAMA would not get credit flowing.  He argued over and over again that the consequence of NAMA would be that a wall of money would come and flow again like blood through the veins of small and medium-sized Irish businesses.  That is the scenario he painted for us and it has not happened.  If the Minister asks any business people walking around on their uppers outside whether they are finding it easy to get credit from the banks they will tell him what the story is.  He should ask many people, including low paid public servants who are currently trying to juggle their credit arrangements if they can be facilitated by the banks even though they have a permanent job, even at a reduced rate.  He will find the banks will not reach accommodations with people which are reasonable unless they go through a lengthy procedure such as MABS, where they may wait for months to start to be able to address the complexity of their financial situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">The comments quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday were made by a senior IMF official, Mr. Steven Seelig.  He has been appointed by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to join the board of NAMA in May.  A serious element in yesterday’s article concerns the fact that a statement is attributed to the senior official in charge of banking in the Minister’s Department which warned against making public any official estimate for the losses faced by the banks, saying that the Department had not made this information public.  The official is quoted as saying, “We naturally shared with the IMF team our informal views on the range of possibilities but would be uneasy about seeing these formalised”.  It is a deeply disturbing revelation that both Government and at least some senior public officials in this country appear to hold the Dáil and the voters we represent in some contempt.  If taxpayers around the country are to bear the losses of the collapse of the banking bubble and fiasco, the least they and their representatives deserve to be told is the truth.  It is extremely disturbing too to find a publication of information which suggests that the said information was to be kept at all costs from this House and from taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">NAMA is an €80 billion project that was sold to the public on the premise that once the banks had been relieved of their distressed assets they would be ready to start lending again.  The scenario the Minister painted is simply not the case.  NAMA was designed as a bailout by Fianna Fáil for its friends in the banks and, particularly, for its friends, the developers.  By acting——</p>

          <p eId="para_478">The Minister's officials obviously knew differently and the Minister decided to keep this House and the taxpayers of Ireland in the dark because, as usual, Fianna Fáil thinks the rest of us are mushrooms that benefit from being kept in the dark.  That is what the Minister wants to do — to treat the taxpayers of Ireland like mushrooms.  If they are kept in the dark, they will be happy and leave the Government alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">By acting with NAMA in such a partisan way, playing politics, the Minister has damaged the economy and the hope of recovery of live and viable indigenous businesses, of the kind Dr. Barrett spoke about.  The Minister has damaged their prospects immeasurably.  These are matters that ought to be made the subject of an inquiry, along with statements by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">I note that the terms of reference of the Minister's inquiry specifically rule out material such as the IMF discussions and advice in respect of NAMA because he stopped the inquiry's remit from the beginning of September 2008.  Fianna Fáil is so clever.  Even when we have a so-called banking inquiry, it will not be empowered to examine these extraordinary revelations.  They are truly extraordinary——-</p>

          <p eId="para_484">——and what the Minister did at the time of the bank guarantee.  Irish households and small businesses are in the grip of a credit famine.  Businesses are struggling to get their hands on the money needed to keep paying wages and suppliers.  Families looking for a mortgage to set up a home now that houses are more affordable are finding the banks will simply not lend.  The banks' reluctance to lend was confirmed in today's survey conducted by the Professional Insurance Brokers Association, just as by the many people who were in contact with me during the past year.  NAMA was a €54 billion gamble that was supposed to turn on the tap of free flowing credit.  I told the Minister at the time that it would never work.  Clearly, the IMF told him at the time that it would not get a flow of credit going again.  NAMA will not get credit flowing but Irish taxpayers are still expected to take on a supersized risk.  It is time for the Government finally to face up to this reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">I wish to refer to a related matter.  Perhaps the Minister might confirm, during discussions on the Bill, that significant difficulty has arisen with NAMA in respect of the lack of proper title held by developers for properties used as collateral for the loans advanced by the banks.  Ironically, stamp duty avoidance by developers, which was common at the height of the boom, resulted in many developers using licensing arrangements.  Does the Minister remember all those schools in our constituency where sites were sold at ransom prices by Fianna Fáil developers to the Department of Education and Science?  Does he remember all the licensing agreements?  We are talking about mega-avoidance of stamp duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">As a consequence, title was not passed on completely or comprehensively.  In 2006, I raised the issue of property developers avoiding the payment of stamp duty by not taking proper title of the property under development and developing it under a licensing arrangement.  The loophole was estimated to have cost €251 million in 2006.  It was not chickenfeed.  The estimated loss to the Exchequer was €36 million resulting from the Irish Glass Bottle site deal alone.  Mr. Bernard McNamara and the other co-investors were the chief beneficiaries of that piece of tax avoidance.  Time and again, I raised this issue with the Minister's predecessor, now Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen.  In 2007, he appeared to relent, inserting section 110 into the Finance Bill of that year.  With this section on the Statute Book the loophole should have been closed but the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, caved in to pressure from the denizens of the Galway tent.  He never signed the commencement order for section 110 which, to this day, remains in abeyance.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_488">With the stroke of a pen the taxpayer would have been in for a bounty of tens if not hundreds of millions from the period after the tax loophole was closed down.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">This is not stupid.  If the Minister knew anything about tax, this is one of the most famous cases of tax avoidance during the height of the Celtic tiger.  The Minister's predecessor, the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, commissioned a special study by a firm of stockbrokers which came up with the figure of €252 million in cost for one year alone.  This is not something I researched on my own but is a matter I pursued in the House month after month for several years.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">A few hundred million euro might be a drop in the ocean when it comes to closing a €20 billion deficit but it would keep special needs assistants in our children's classes or would restore the traditional Christmas welfare payment.  It is highly ironic that the Taoiseach's and Fianna Fáil's decision not to close the loophole has come back to bite the ordinary taxpayers yet again as this and other tax loopholes now frustrate the operations of NAMA, the passage of loans and underlying properties and titles.  The Minister must make a clear and honest statement to the House on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">Sections 55 and 56 of the Finance Bill are anti-avoidance measures to target what is described, properly, as aggressive capital gains tax avoidance schemes where no real economic loss has occurred.  Much as I hate to say to the Minister that I told him so, I could not help but notice the banner headline in the <i>Sunday Business Post </i>last weekend.  This tax loophole cost the Exchequer €400 million in lost revenue.  The Department of Finance seems to have realised that investors were exploiting weaknesses in Irish law to generate fictitious losses against which they could set off actual capital gains from their investments in shares, property and other assets.  This complex manoeuvre involved the creation of back to back derivative contracts linked to the value of Irish Government bonds.  As the gain and the loss cancelled each other out, there was no net loss.  The gain was not taxable but the loss could be set off against gains on other investments.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">These transactions have no legitimate rationale and were designed for the singular purpose of avoiding tax.  With €400 million already down the Swanee as a result of this loophole, closing it in this Finance Bill is a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.  Due to the fact that property and share prices have been sharply down over the past two years, there is now little need to manufacture fictitious losses to avoid paying capital gains tax.  This loophole was closed off in the UK some years ago and was, therefore, well flagged to the tax authorities in Dublin.  However, Fianna Fáil took no action to save ordinary taxpayers from being ripped off by people who specialise in helping very wealthy people to avoid tax, while taxes and levies on people on the lowest level of income are significantly increased by the Government.  Few people are showing profits these days, as evidenced by each month's Exchequer returns.  The question the Minister must answer is why he has waited until the loophole is largely defunct before closing it off.  All loopholes are not treated in an equal manner.  Not all have been closed off, only the ones that can no longer be used to avoid tax.  Talk about a joke.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Following a long campaign by the Labour Party on the issue, the Minister has finally delivered a levy of €200,000 on tax exiles.  However, it remains to be seen how many of the almost 6,000 tax exiles, as identified by the chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners when she appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts, will be affected by this.  I have read the two pages of the Bill dealing with the definition of domicile.  However, as an accountant, I suggest the section offers wide scope for the use of professional advisory services to mitigate its likely impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">The introduction of tax structures to facilitate Sharia law-based lending is largely a measure designed to facilitate activities in the IFSC.  This is one of a number of measures to make investing in the IFSC more attractive from a tax point of view.  If the Minister is doing this, it behoves him to ensure adequate regulatory arrangements are in place, given the destruction of our reputation as a result of what happened in the case of Depfa Bank.  It had a significant number of non-executive Irish directors on its board up to the time it was sold to Hypo Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">The episode concerning this particular bank and the losses it sustained caused tremendous damage to our reputation in Germany.  These losses were subsequently incurred by German taxpayers and the German Government had to bail out the bank.  With regard to the Minister's proposals for the IFSC, where are the corresponding regulatory arrangements that will ensure that what happened in the case of Depfa Bank, and subsequently Hypo Bank, which has been so damaging to our reputation, will not happen again?  Is the Minister sending out or willing to send out a broad signal that the IFSC is not specialising in some kind of tax avoidance, but that it wants to specialise in legitimate and lucrative financial services?</p>
          <p eId="para_496">We should bear in mind that hedge funds and international financial institutions are involved in a major shorting exercise against the euro, in an effort to weaken it and many eurozone economies as a consequence.  Therefore, we need to discuss how we will balance legitimate commercial advantage to draw businesses to Ireland against our regulatory reputation as not being a fly-by-night location or, as described by <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> some time ago, the wild west of international finance capital down on the Liffey.  The Government has not yet addressed that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Section 24 is the major Green Party input to the Bill.  It provides that the windfall tax, introduced as part of the NAMA Act, will be extended from just rezoned land to cover land subject to material contraventions by a local authority.  In almost all jurisdictions, an 80% tax is a joke.  If people are subject to a significant tax rate of 80%, they are usually rich enough to be able to pay tax advisers to mitigate, if not totally avoid, the 80% rate.  Given the state of the property market, this provision is purely notional.  I am interested to know whether the Minister anticipates any tax flow from this measure.  Hypothetical, punitive tax rates are a joke.  This measure is a joke and is, obviously, the fig leaf for the Green Party in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">In contrast, the thorny issue of the significant tax losses being accumulated by banks and property developers as a result of the property crash, which they can set off against future tax liabilities, is not addressed at all in the Bill.  In the debates on the previous Finance Act, on the budget and on several other occasions, the Minister promised he would address this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_500">No.  The Minister has sought to ensure that some banks will pay a minimum amount of tax, but they will be entitled to set off their full losses, whatever way they value them, as will developers.  Therefore, for many people in that situation, it may be 30 or 40 years before they ever pay tax again, other than nominal amounts they choose to pay under the arrangement the Minister set out previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">In contrast with administrations around the world, there are no proposals from the Minister to introduce tax curbs on the supersized remuneration packages of top executives or those working in financial services.  Nowhere does the Bill contain measures to crack down on the dubious remuneration schemes that incentivise short-term risk taking or maximising lending.  It is quite clear the Government has failed to learn from the mistakes of the past.  Barack Obama and Gordon Brown are getting tough on bankers and speculators who are determined to carry on as if the financial crash never occurred.  By contrast, this Finance Bill will introduce incentives for senior executives to trade Wall Street and the City of London for the banks of the Liffey.  This is something that needs to be spelled out in some detail.  What are the advantages to us and what are the costs?  What are the implications for our reputation and for tax revenue?</p>
          <p eId="para_502">Section 152 relates to the levy on judges and is structured in a way which provides that judges can make a donation to the Government.  I repeat what I said before.  Why does the Minister not legislate in this regard?  He could then let the judges who object to being treated like their fellow citizens take a court case.  There is nobody better to take a court case and they have done so in the past.  If the Minister legislated, that would mean judges, as citizens, would be treated as all other citizens have been treated.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Kennedy</from>
          <p eId="para_503">It is good to see a Fine Gael Deputy in the Chair after two and a half years of this Government.  Perhaps the past 24 hours have brought some little transformation within the Fine Gael Party.  Ironically, I just met the Chair's former colleague, George Lee, outside and wished him well.  I never doubted the tenacity of Meath men and Deputy Richard Bruton to hold his own.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  Despite what we have heard from Deputy Joan Burton, there are many positive aspects to this Bill.  I mention in particular the section on nursing home fees.  Relief on fees is now allowable for bona fide nursing homes providing 24-hour care.  I am aware from my constituency work that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act was welcomed.  It is working extremely well and I doubt any Member of the Oireachtas would have a bad word to say with regard to its operation and the benefit it brings to ordinary people.  I welcome the fact the Minister has gone even further in terms of this tax relief, because this is an issue that involves every family in the country.  I also welcome the extension on mortgage interest relief up to 2017.  For those couples who purchase, it will be of major benefit and it will also give a fillip to our flagging house building industry.  I congratulate the Minister in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">I welcome the increase in tax credits the Minister has given in regard to private health insurance premiums.  As the levies have increased, the tax credits for which the Minister is providing are very welcome, particularly for those over 80 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">I welcome the domicile levy of €200,000.  I have no doubt that wealthy Irish people want to contribute to the Irish taxation system and to our country, particularly at a time when finances are a little strapped, to say the least.  The proposed measure is certainly a step in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">I welcome the measure in regard to the disposal of family sites.  The Acting Chairman will have dealt with the same issues with which I have dealt for my rural constituents in Dublin North.  The measure applies to sites of less than an acre and valued at less than €250,000.  Everybody in the country will welcome the change and recognise it as a necessity.  Very often, families who own land are handing over sites to their children.  It would be totally unfair to tax them, particularly at a time when they are experiencing financial difficulty.  Well done to the Minister.  The measure will be welcomed across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Deputy Burton referred to the new financial services measure.  The Minister's plans are welcome.  If one analyses the Irish Financial Services Centre, one will find it has been an outstanding success, a huge employer and a development that has brought great credit to Ireland Inc.  This is an area where we can grow our business and keep the Irish flag flying in the international sphere.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">With regard to CPO lands, the Minister has proposed that, from 4 February, capital gains tax would be paid only when the seller of the land is in receipt of funds.  The Acting Chairman will have had representations asking why people should be penalised up front, particularly in cases where they have not willingly sold their land and where the State authorities insist on buying.  It was a double blow for people to find they could not get their money up front.  At long last, we are recognising that unfairness.  I congratulate the Minister in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">To move to the issue of excise duty, I have received a number of representations from those wholesalers who were taken aback that the Minister had reduced duty because they had bought in huge quantities.  They are suffering as a result, although I recognise it was a bad commercial decision and that, if the position were reversed and they had made gains, they would not be giving back the money.  However, in the context of the current business climate where it is not easy to make a profit, some recognition might be given in this area.  If the opposite had happened, these people would have pocketed the money; we live in difficult times and many companies are experiencing trading difficulties.  If consideration of this issue were to stave off job losses, it would be worthwhile.  I would like the Minister to comment.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">I have spoken to the Minister about the position of the commercial golf courses and hotels which are paying VAT on golf green fees.  Many of these businesses are experiencing a severe downturn in trading, with many struggling to survive.  The suggestion of a temporary zero VAT rate has been made for income up to €37,500, similar to what applies in respect of the private member golf clubs.  A temporary period of perhaps two years would assist these organisations, of which there are 52 involved in the Irish Golf Course Owners Association.  They employ 4,000 people, strange as that might seem to some, and an investment of more than €700 million is involved.  I sincerely hope the Minister will give consideration to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">These organisations are at a complete competitive disadvantage compared to the private golf club.  I am a member of a golf club, as the Acting Chairman may be.  While some clubs might be put out by what I have said, there are jobs involved and we should do anything we can to maintain jobs and boost tourism.  Many of these organisations are involved in good tourism promotion, which the Minister should also consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">The carbon tax will be a direct cost added to the running expenses of haulage companies.  A number of these companies have approached me to ask whether the Minister would consider applying the measure in the same way as the plastic bag levy, whereby the end user pays.  If transport companies can pass on the charge to their customers, it will enable them to trade more profitably than they are at present.  The transport business is going through major difficulties, as the Acting Chairman will be aware.  Effectively, the new carbon tax will impose higher charges on such businesses which they cannot currently apply to the end user.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">The point has been made to me that if this new regulation were implemented, local purchasers would look closer to home in terms of dealing with companies that are nearby because the cost would be reduced.  It is probably an unusual request but it is worth considering.  When the plastic bag levy was introduced and the end user was forced to pay, people decided to use paper bags rather than plastic bags.  Due to the carbon charge, a person living in Cork would have to decide whether to purchase from a company in Donegal in preference to one in Limerick.  I hope some change might be considered in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">To return to a point raised by Deputy Burton in regard to judges and the courts, I am on public record on a number of occasions as stating that I regard it as unfair that judges should not pay their fair share, the same as all other workers.  While I welcome the fact the Minister has now incorporated the voluntary payments system, it is regrettable that 15 months later more than 25% of judges have not seen fit to pay the levy. The Constitution should be amended to allow the Government of the day to dictate the salaries and income of judges.  Judges are well paid and they enjoy a good expenses regime.  As such, they are in as good a position as anybody to pay their fair share.  It is hoped that the Government will in the future endeavour to bring about change in this regard.  I note Fine Gael has taken up my previous public utterances in terms of its introduction of a Private Members' Bill to deal with this issue.  I am glad to note that I influence Fine Gael from time to time.</p>

          <p eId="para_580">Despite much of the negativity we have heard this evening, this Bill deals adequately with the relevant issues.  We need the continued guidance of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Government to get this country moving again.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_299">
          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_581">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The Minister referred to the role of Government as being to create a pro-enterprise environment, a point with which I fundamentally agree.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">This Bill contains many good measures in terms of tax avoidance and multinational companies, which I also welcome and with which I will deal in greater detail at a later point.  However, it does not include measures to deal with the SME sector, the section of the economy which drives growth.  What is important is that we have confidence, credit and competitiveness.  Without confidence, people will not spend.  Without credit, businesses cannot function and without competitiveness we cannot compete on world markets.  We are a small open economy.  We are all agreed that our return to growth must be export driven.  To do this, we must be competitive.  While our competitiveness has improved, we remain extremely uncompetitive in a range of areas.  We must, in terms of the export market, bring about a devaluation of our currency by becoming competitive across a range of areas.  I do not see measures in this regard in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">In terms of the small business sector, I welcome that the Minister has extended the relief in corporation tax for three years.  Why did he not go a step further and extend this to sole traders?  I will explain why.  Most people who set up in business do so as sole traders rather than as companies.  Prior to the introduction of the 12.5% tax relief, there was a 10% manufacturing relief at the normal rate.  Many people went into companies straight away for that relief but now the 12.5% rate applies to all small companies, regardless of their activity.  Most people set up as sole traders and when their tax liability moves them into the higher marginal rate, they normally decide to take the incorporated limited company route.  They need relief in the early years.  It is very welcome for trading companies, but small businesses face the cost of incorporating when setting up.  If they are not making significant money, there is also the cost of salaries, whereas they could have a situation where they pay PAYE and PRSI, but not corporation tax.  It is a recommendation of the Commission on Taxation and it would be a practical measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">We must get an entrepreneurial culture going.  I always advise clients to set up initially as sole traders and to see how they go.  If the business takes off, they can then incorporate.  It is a more tax advantageous way to do it and it is a simpler route.  If people create limited companies initially, it can create major constraints in dealing with the Companies Office and other bodies.  The Minister should bear this in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">Section 50 contains provisions for research and development, which we will examine in depth.  Research and development should be available for offset against PRSI.  Currently it is available for offset against corporation tax, but not PRSI or PAYE.  It would further that high-end value economy, thus bringing about changes in that whole area.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">To give credit where it is due, the Minister has brought in many changes regarding tax avoidance, which I welcome.  In addition, he has amended sections dealing with capital allowances, particularly in technology and similar areas, which I also welcome.  The Minister has brought in a situation where, effectively, mergers will not trigger any tax balancing charge and that is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">The only way we will restore confidence is if we reduce growth in the live register figures.  In the past two years alone, an extra 250,000 people have joined the live register.  That 150% increase is staggering.  We are probably going to breach the 500,000 mark this year.  The only way to deal with that problem is to provide jobs, so we must find measures to do so.  The Bill's measures concerning multinationals are to be welcomed, but the SME sector will be the major driver of our economic recovery.  Small and medium-size enterprises will provide employment and will be the multinationals of tomorrow.  We already have an entrepreneurial culture, but it needs to be fostered so that people link in with universities.  We must move to the high-end market because we can no longer compete in the low-end market.  Steps should have been taken much earlier concerning Dell in my constituency.  We cannot compete on a cost basis in terms of wages so we must go to the high-end market.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">We have an enormous opportunity for the SME sector to become the multinationals of tomorrow as regards export growth, but we must create the environment for it.  One of the key costs for a small business is wages.  We put forward a budgetary proposal to cut employer's PRSI, half at the lower end and 2% at the top end.  That would have reduced the cost of employment to the employer without affecting employees' take-home pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">In 2001, our industrial prices for electricity were at the EU average but, from 2001 to 2008, our industrial energy costs rose almost 50% higher than the EU average.  Can the Minister explain that?  Ireland has the second highest energy costs in the EU, which is a huge burden on both the SME and multinational sectors.  Government regulation must be examined in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">Credit flow to small businesses is another problem.  What do the IMF and the former CEO of AIB have in common?  They both believe that NAMA will not bring about a flow of credit to the economy.  Mr. Eugene Sheehy appeared before the Committee on Finance and the Public Sector, of which I am a member.  He stated emphatically that he expected NAMA would not bring about a flow of credit, and the IMF said likewise.  Are banks going to take NAMA bonds, go to the ECB, get funds and reinvest them in Government stock?  NAMA still has not been signed off on by the European Commission.  Our methodology for the national recovery bank was a simple formula whereby it would serve two purposes.  First, it would bring about a flow of credit through a wholesale bank to existing retail banks and, second, it would have a form of risk-sharing mechanism in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">Recently, the Tánaiste came to the House and flew a kite indicating that she may put a bank guarantee scheme in place.  A bank guarantee has been in place in the UK for the past year and it has worked.  It would not require a huge amount of funding.  In the UK, they put in €1.3 billion which benefited 9,000 business and saved many jobs.  There is now a need for a national recovery bank with a guarantee scheme in place that will bring about a flow of credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">We must have deadlines for particular Government projects.  The Government launched the e-Government strategy which cost taxpayers a fortune through malfunctioning areas.  No deadline dates have been set for the smart economy.  The public want to see that what the Government is providing is fair.  We will soon have a debate on public servants' remuneration, concerning the exemption from pay cuts of higher level public sector employees.  During finance questions last week, the Minister indicated that a Government decision was taken — I presume at Cabinet level — prior to 18 December when the emergency Finance Bill went through the Seanad.  On what precise date was that decision taken by the Government?  The IMF informed the Minister that it had reservations about NAMA concerning credit flow, but he did not make that public during the debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_594">We got it under a freedom of information request, although the Minister may not like to hear what they are saying.  Furthermore, a Government decision was made concerning higher public servants' pay, yet when that measure was going through the House the Minister did not make it public.  He brought it through in a circular on 23 December and he will now ram it through under a specific section in the Bill before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">The Bill as presented does not deal with what I feel is now required, which is an entrepreneurial culture to foster the SME sector.  The Minister could simply extend the exemption for the first three years for sole traders as well as companies.  That would be a practical and welcome measure.  The Minister should also allow research and development tax credits to be offset against PRSI and not just corporation tax.  That would provide an environment for high-end development towards the export market.  It would also reduce the employers' share of PRSI costs.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_602">The Government decision to exempt 655 public servants from the pay reduction announced on budget day was neither fair nor justified.  The unfairness is best exemplified by the fact that it means that people on the lowest level of pay in the public service will see a reduction in their pay of 5% while this category of public servants will see their take-home pay cut by just one third of that amount.  That goes to the heart of the sense of injustice that is felt not just on this side of the House.  Clearly, individuals on the Government's backbenches feel very strongly that this is an unfair approach to public pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">Apart from the unfairness, it is simply not justified.  We hired a higher remuneration group to recommend how people in these high-paid jobs should be paid.  It made a very clear recommendation.  In the full knowledge that the bonus system had been suspended, it recommended that cuts of 8% be imposed on assistant secretaries and cuts of 12% on deputy secretaries.  Those recommendations were taken up and implemented in the budget.  The Minister for Finance and his entire parliamentary party knew that bonuses had been suspended when they made a decision consciously to apply 8% cuts to assistant secretaries and 12% to deputy secretaries and the knock-on effect on 655 individuals in senior privileged positions in the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">For some inexplicable reason within two weeks in the shadow of Christmas, the Minister issued a direction under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act after a decision of Government that the recommendation of the review group and the decision of the budget should be reversed.  No explanation or justification was offered.  The provisions of section 6 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act are very explicit.  This is not a general power to the Minister to do whatever he likes.  This is a power under very significant restrictions.  He must show that a substantial inequity has occurred and that it is just and equitable in all the circumstances to change the position as announced in the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">We are not privy to any such evidence adduced by the Minister.  From the Taoiseach and Tánaiste we have seen efforts to defend this decision that were incredible and downright wrong.  That suggests to me that the Minister did not take seriously his responsibility under the Act only to use this direction where there was a substantial inequity and where it was just and fair to everyone to take this action.  I have not seen any independent commentator take the view that this was just and equitable.  Far from it, people see this as those at the top of the tree circling the wagons to protect themselves from cuts that were being applied to those at the bottom.  It was the worst example possible at a time when the economy is facing difficult decisions and people are being asked to tighten their belts and take cuts.  We then find a privileged few being able to circle the wagons and wriggle out of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">While I am not sure whether the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, knows it himself, I would like to know the procedure for this Government decision.  Was there a memorandum setting out the evidence that supported this change?  How did it happen that the Taoiseach and Tánaiste came in here blissfully ignorant of any such evidence as was absolutely from their efforts to defend it?  I would like to see the evidence that substantial inequity was occurring and that this was fair and just in all the circumstances.  What consultation was conducted with the review group that had done the work and presented a report which had been accepted by Government?  What consultation took place with it before the Government turned tail and ran in the opposite direction under the shadow of the Christmas holiday?</p>
          <p eId="para_607">This stank to high heavens.  It is not surprising that Fianna Fáil backbenchers, who are not represented here tonight, saw this for what it was.  They are not fools.  They may be treated like fools and given the old mushroom treatment — being kept in the dark knee-deep in manure.  However, they are not fools and were willing to face this down and take their Minister to task.  Unfortunately, the Government applied the full strictures of the Whip to silence these people and we are left with just one individual, Deputy Mattie McGrath, who has the courage of his convictions, to come along and vote to reverse this injustice.  I look forward to having his support and it shows that at least there is some responsibility and sense of decorum left in the Fianna Fáil Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">When the cut was proposed, we took a very different view.  We said that people on low pay should be exempted and that the first tranche of €30,000 should not be touched.  That was fair and it was broadly supported that something had to be done for the low paid.  People on little more than the minimum wage should not be sucked into pay cuts of this nature — the second set of pay cuts.  They were struggling to get through this recession, which is very much in contrast to assistant secretaries and deputy secretaries who are on €173,000.  They are not in the same category and struggling to get by.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">For the Government to take a decision to make what was already in most people's eyes an unfair structure even worse and exempt those top earners was really rubbing salt in the wound.  We need to see the evidence laid out so that everyone can have an understanding of this.  Let us see why the Government has turned its back on the review group, a professional body of individuals drawn from not just the public sector, but also the private sector, which fully knowing that the bonus system was gone still recommended cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">What the Tánaiste said in the House was extraordinary.  She pretended that the review group recommended precisely the opposite of what it had recommended.  She said: "the review body on higher level pay indicated that the bonus was indicatively part of their salary."  That was nowhere in the report.  Time and again, year after year, the review group had confirmed that bonuses were not part of salary.  They never are, never were and never should be.  The Tánaiste seemed to take completely the opposite view.  The Taoiseach came in here and asked that we be fair to these people and said that because there were bonuses, their pay had been cut over the years and they had suffered worse than anyone else.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">The evidence shows precisely the opposite.  The highest pay increases in the public service have been at deputy secretary and assistant secretary level.  They have enjoyed the highest increases throughout the public service since 1991.  Indeed, they accelerated in the period since 2001 when the bonus scheme went up to 10%.  In that time those individuals have received a 78% increase in their pay when the increase for clerical officers has been 48%.  That is an enormous gap of 30%.  They have enjoyed much quicker growth.  The differences in absolute terms are startling.  A deputy secretary enjoyed an increase in those eight years of €76,000, which is ten times the increase given to a clerical officer at the bottom of the scale.  How can the Government turn around and claim that not only are they entitled to a €76,000 increase over that period, but on top of that a €17,000 bonus, which should be regarded as their entitlement as if it were basic pay?</p>
          <p eId="para_612">It flies against everything the review group had recommended.  It is ironic that the Taoiseach was so keen to back up the review group when it was telling him and his Ministers that we should have increases.  In effect, he was saying: "We always accepted the independent review group's view as gospel, since it makes its decisions fair and objectively."  However, when those decisions do not suit certain people in the public service, the Minister turns tail and reverses the increases.  It is simply not fair to people and we have to change it.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">The Minister for Finance was no better.  He came into the House and pretended that those bonuses were always part of pay.  He said that the bonus scheme provided for an average payment of salary.  It did no such thing.  It provided that the maximum that could ever be paid was 10% of the salary pool.  It provided that, generally, no increases should be given to anyone who was not exceptional in his or her performance.  This was absolutely clear; it had nothing to do with core pay.  It was for individual public servants who achieved above and beyond normal performance.  That is what the test was.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">Time and again the review body insisted that "awards must not be seen as an automatic addition to pay".  Again, in another year, it stated: "It is particularly important that an award made in one year is not regarded as an entitlement to a similar award in subsequent years."  Again, it said that "award schemes must avoid the perception that there will be something for everyone" and "performance related pay should not be pensionable", yet the Minister has done precisely the opposite.  He has pretended this is core pay and that right across the board every deputy secretary and assistant secretary, every one of the 655 workers in local authorities and the HSE at senior level, are automatically entitled to this as part of their core pay and that it has nothing to do with exceptional performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">The Minister is saying they are entitled to it and they should not be asked for any reduction in their pay because this bonus scheme has been suspended.  That is what the Minister decided.  It flies in the face of everything we learned from the review group in terms of what performance pay is about, which is rewarding people who were exceptional.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">That has been suspended now, as the review group rightly said, because bonus pay has been suspended everywhere else in the economy.  People in the private sector were getting similar, and often much greater, bonuses and they have been wiped out.  Bonus pay is gone, as the review group told us.  The same should apply in the public sector.  The reduction and elimination of bonus pay was not, in the review group's view, a reason for not applying fair cuts to everyone else.  It was absolutely clear in its decision, but not one of the three, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or the Minister, has shown that he or she respects the legislation passed here before Christmas.  This provided that, to make a change such as this, there has to be a substantial inequity and it must be just and fair in all circumstances that such inequity be tackled.  Far from this, however, the Government has given to people at the top something denied to those at the lowest pay in the public service — people who are genuinely struggling to get by, people earning less than €30,000, those on the minimum wage, porters who are trying to support mortgages.  They were told that they had to take the full 5% cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">They are angry at the substantial inequity that has been applied to them, and neither do they figure on the Government's radar when it comes to measuring exceptional and difficult times.  Those who feature on the Government's radar are the people at the top of the tree, earning €173,000 plus a bonus on top of that.  I cannot, for the life of me, see how that can be judged as fair and equitable in all circumstances.  It is simply a disgrace and, what is more, it is going to carry on into pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">By treating non-pensionable pay as a reason for exempting people from cuts, the Government is guaranteeing that for those 655 individuals, where everyone else has not had that opportunity and must look at the prospect, unless they retire in the next 12 months, their pensions will be permanently eroded by this decision, one which is not being applied in the case of those who are better off.  I rest the case that this is an inequity which needs to be reversed.  I am delighted to have had the opportunity to debate this and to get the views of ordinary backbenchers, whose absence is deafening in its scale.  There is no one here on the Government side apart from the poor beleaguered Minister of State who comes in here to listen to us.  No doubt he will rise to the occasion and tell us exactly how these decisions were taken.</p>

          <p eId="para_620">I thank Deputy Bruton for tabling this motion in the name of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party.  Hundreds of thousands of people on low pay are struggling to cope at the moment.  The average family will pay an extra €1,000 this year in stealth charges imposed by the Government and interest rate increases.  They are literally living from week to week, hoping no one gets sick and that an unexpected bill will not have to be paid.  Many public servants, especially those on lower pay, are mortgaged to the maximum, on the basis of the permanent pensionable job that has been shoved down their throats by many people in the media over recent months.  They never envisaged that they would have to face pay cuts when they were taking out those mortgages, as they struggled with the calculations to draw down the money from the banks in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">Like everyone else, they accept we need to work together to get out of the mess that Fianna Fáil has created.  They are prepared to carry part of the burden, as everyone else in society must, which has been created by the Government's incompetence over the last ten years.  The fact that they have to pay twice as much as many in senior management in the public service, however, is totally unjust, especially as these same managers facilitated the irresponsible management of the economy by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">Among the 655 individuals are management personnel in the Health Service Executive who failed to reform the administrative structures within the health system, which has led to a situation where front line staff are being withdrawn in hospitals and community services purely to maintain managers in jobs.  Also included are managers in the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, who failed to curb irresponsible lending by banks and other practices over the years, and managers in FÁS, who brought that organisation into disrepute, in addition to Department of Finance officials, who failed to project the correct receipts in relation to taxation during the good times.  They were supposed to be watching over the banking system and monitoring the value for money reviews which were supposed to be taking place across the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">Deputy Bruton indicated the review body had made it critically clear that performance pay must be linked to successful completion of highly demanding and challenging tasks.  Will the Minister of State explain to me how he can justify people in FÁS getting such bonuses while they were literally stealing taxpayers' money and why management within the HSE, who failed to implement reforms that would assure a quality health service, should get those bonuses while funds for front line staff were being withdrawn?  How can these bonuses be justified?  Bonuses should have been about reform and performance, but the Government and senior management took them to be part of basic pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">Herein lies the fundamental flaw in relation to the bonus system.  It was considered by Government as part of basic pay and not part of the incentivisation process to try to reform and overhaul the public service.  It is enormously frustrating to see people on the lowest income levels within the public service, those who are struggling at the moment, cry out for reforms.  Their jobs are soul destroying because of the lack of leadership within management ranks in the public service.  They now have to carry the can.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">When he articulated the position of the Fine Gael Party regarding public sector pay, Deputy Richard Bruton made it quite clear that anyone under €30,000 should be exempt because such people were on the lowest pay and struggling to cope and manage.  Anyone on under €75,000 would be better off under the Fine Gael proposals rather than the Government proposals introduced by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">What makes this remarkably frustrating is that this decision will set back any plans to reform our public services.  Public servants at the coalface are the very ones who see the flaws within the system and who seek reform.  It is amazing when one goes out to meet public servants.  They raise the issue of the need for public sector reform; they have been working at the coalface, they have put in the long hours and they have given commitment and service to the public.  Their management have collected their bonuses on that basis and now they have received a double bonus, since the original bonus is now being calculated as part of their pay for the purposes of pay cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">How can the Minister of State justify a situation where, since 2000, the senior grades have received 30% more in pay than those at the coalface working on a day-to-day basis?  How can the Government justify a situation where assistant secretaries in Departments received a €76,000 increase during that period, some ten times the rate of pay of a clerical officer?  Clerical officers and lower grades have taken double the pay cut of senior management within the public service.  This decision is seriously flawed.  It will set back reform of the public service for years and will cause complete industrial turmoil over the coming months.</p>

          <p eId="para_628">I am delighted to be able to speak on this motion.  As with the previous speakers, I am very pleased Deputy Richard Bruton has put this motion before the House because it provides us with several opportunities.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, to the House.  He has been a supporter of the Government, for which I admire him.  We are affording his colleague, Deputy Mattie McGrath, an opportunity.  He proposed a motion at the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and could not get a seconder.  He will have no need for a seconder in the Dáil.  All he needs to do is to walk up the steps with us or vote with us tomorrow night and I hope he will do so.  I have no doubt he will do so.  I hope he will not be a lion in the constituency but a mouse in the Dáil.  I trust that will not be the case.  I will be watching him very carefully tomorrow night, as will the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">I know he will vote with us because he knows this is wrong and on this I compliment him.  He knows it is wrong, I know it is wrong and Fine Gael knows it is wrong.

          <p eId="para_631">I refer to the people who were able to get to the Government.  This situation proves who has the power in this State.  It lies with the 655 civil servants who were able to say to the Government and Ministers that they would not take a pay cut, while every other worker in the State, in both the public and private sectors, had to take a pay cut.  This is wrong.  Certain people in local authorities earn a very small income.  There are some who bring home €450 or €500 per week and such people must pay levies and take a reduction in their pay.  However, senior civil servants who are making a fortune and whose jobs are protected do not have to pay it.  It is wrong and it must be reversed.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">We must all take some of the pain and no one should be exempt.  Great anger is being experienced by people on low pay and in the public service at the fact that these 655 people could influence the Department of Finance and the Minister to get their way.  For all my life it has been the case that a bonus is not a salary; it is a bonus.  One get rewarded for the work one carries out.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_634">That is true too.  I refer to the bonus scheme in place.  I have tried very hard to find out more about this area in recent years.  A former Deputy, Mr. Paul McGrath, and I tabled freedom of information requests and we went to the Ombudsman to see how these civil servants were paying themselves and to find out what criteria were used in respect of the payment of the bonus.  It was amazing.  A little fund was in place.  They divvied it up among themselves and everyone got equal pay every year, but at the same time the economy was going down.  The services they were running were being put out of order and they were not doing the jobs for which they were getting paid, never mind the allocation of bonuses.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">I was disappointed that the former Ombudsman, Mr. Murphy, and the current Ombudsman did not reverse that decision.  It is only right because public money was at stake.  We should know why county managers, directors of services, county engineers and principal civil servants were getting these bonuses, what service they did for the State, what money they saved the State and on what basis they were getting the payments, but we could never find out.  Is that not amazing?</p>
          <p eId="para_636">Journalists can come to the House and use freedom of information legislation to get information from the Minister of State or any and every Deputy in the House, and rightly so.  They can use the freedom of information legislation to get information on everyone covered by the Freedom of Information Act, but not the 655 senior civil servants.  They were saved.  There was no freedom of information for them and their information was deemed private.  They received their little fund and divvied it up among themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">There is great anger among low paid workers who wonder why they must take the cuts.  People are suffering, including middle class people and people on low incomes.  Third level fees must be paid, there is no medical card relief and such people have mortgages to pay.  These people are struggling and I fully understand the frustration of those in the public service and why they are angry and upset.  Such people do not mind supporting or helping the State or playing their part.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">Has this Government not learned?  Did we not see this with the builders and bankers?  They were able to get their way with the Government.  We have not seen a banker go to jail yet.  However, there are poor people who collect the bins or who work for the council on a wage of €450 or €500 per week and who must pay this levy, while senior executives do not have to pay it.  This is wrong and I hope Deputy Mattie McGrath and the Fianna Fáil backbenchers who sought a debate on this matter vote with us tomorrow night.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_639">It is very hard to follow that, but I am very pleased to have the opportunity to contribute.  I thank Deputy Richard Bruton for giving all of us the opportunity to discuss the matter on behalf of the thousands of low paid public servants who are very annoyed.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">An announcement was made prior to Christmas that affected many of the people in charge at county manager level, at director of services level in the county councils and in the HSE.  The annoyance of a substantial number of people on low wages who were asked to take a cut is palpable.  Such people were out gritting the roads during the frost, filling the pot holes after the torrential rain and driving ambulances across those roads, bringing sick and injured people to our hospitals.  They were annoyed and frustrated but they had come to the realisation that the economy was in dire straits.  They were aware the Government was very short of money.  After a long period of convincing, such people came around to the viewpoint that they should take the cut to ensure fairness.  On the night of the budget, many such people were shocked to hear of the cuts to be put in place.  However, such cuts were accepted in the hope that it would straighten out the economy and these people were prepared to do their bit, the same as everyone else given that people in the private sector have lost their jobs across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">People had come to accept the change but, lo and behold, some days before Christmas this announcement was made.  I do not know how it came about or from where the influence was brought to bear, but people on the upper salary scales in the Civil Service did not get the same cut as the person who fills the pot holes in my constituency.  It is unfair and unjust.  It is incredible that a Government that spent up to a year preaching to us about the need for everyone to take cuts and convinced people of the need for such cuts would do such a thing to all those people.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">I have never in my life, but particularly in recent weeks, come across so many people who are hard pressed for cash.  They include public servants, particularly the low paid.  Only last week a lady came to my constituency office whose husband had lost his job in the private sector.  She had a public service job paying €25,000 per year and had a mortgage of almost €2,500 per month.  Her position is totally unsustainable.  She told me she was going to hand back the keys of her house in which she has lived for the past number of years.  She was a low-paid public servant and as she walked out of my office she turned and said, "Who in the name of God influenced the Government such that it would allow my manager not to get the same cut as me?"  I could not answer her.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Was influence used to reverse the decision on the pay cuts?  I am extremely concerned that such influence got the better of the Minister.  We should not have allowed this to happen.  As we face more difficult budgets in the years ahead, we must bring the people with us.  Unfortunately, their trust is now broken.  We should not have allowed this to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">A bonus is not a salary, as was said time and again.  There is no justification for doing what was done.  I urge every Member to stand up because it is not too late to change the decision.  The Fine Gael proposal, namely, not to cut the pay of low-paid civil servants, represents an alternative.  Deputy Richard Bruton proposed in his alternative budget that the pay of lower-paid public servants not be cut.  We should accept this because the anger among lower-paid public servants is unbelievable.  If we, as their representatives, are to fight for what they want, it is in this Chamber that we must do so.  Everybody should work together in this regard.  Trust is broken and when one breaks the trust of the public servants on whom cuts have been inflicted, one will not receive co-operation.  I urge everyone in this House to reconsider and change the decision and do what is fair on behalf of the taxpayer, including lower-paid taxpayers.</p>

        <speech by="#PadraicMcCormack" eId="spk_313">
          <from>Deputy Pádraic McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_645">It is unfair that the extremely higher-paid public servants should have a smaller reduction in their wages and salaries than the lower-paid civil servants.  This is a fact of life.  It was deceptive of the Minister, on behalf of the Government, to announce the U-turn on 23 December, two weeks after the budget when he believed nobody would notice and that he would get away with it.  The Dáil was in recess and we could do nothing about it at the time.  Perhaps the announcement was to allow for a Christmas bonus for higher-paid civil servants — I do not know.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">The policy of Fine Gael is that those on wages and salaries up to €30,000 should be exempt from the levy.  Now the Government has singled out the top 650 higher salary earners in the public service for special treatment.  How can it justify its decision to cut the pay of the lower-paid public servants more, in percentage terms, than the pay of higher-paid civil servants, some of whom earn €100,000, €200,000 or €400,000 per year?</p>
          <p eId="para_647">The public was ready at the time of the budget to accept measures necessary to correct the damage to our economy caused by the current and past Fianna Fáil-led Governments, but only if there had been fairness all round.  Fairness was the key to gaining public acceptance.  The December budget announced a 12% pay cut for top earners and an 8% cut for middle and second-level earners, as recommended by the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector in report No. 44.  The supposed cutback in pay for higher-paid personnel was used in the budget to try to justify a pay cut of 5% to 8% for those on middle incomes and a 5% pay cut for those earning less than €30,000.  Fine Gael would exempt the latter.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">The Minister, on the day before Christmas Eve, released a circular announcing the scaling back of pay cuts to an average of 3% for assistant secretaries, deputy secretaries, local authority and health board executives and other higher-paid individuals.  This has led to great hardship for the lower paid and resentment over the fact that their higher paid bosses have been subject to a much lower cut than them.  It has led to bad public relations in those public bodies where the staff have received pay cuts greater than those of their managers.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">I received a letter today from a constituent, a public sector administrator on a moderate salary working in Galway.  She stated her income has been cut by 15% in the past nine months and that the pay cuts are grossly unfair and place an inordinate burden on low-income and middle-income public servants.  She said the cost of diesel, doctors and dentists has greatly penalised people in her position in the past year and that she is at her wit's end.  Many of us have received similar letters, including Government Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">Working-class families and lower-paid workers with two or three children must regularly visit the doctor or dentist.  They are now hard pressed to afford this given the budgetary cutbacks that have affected them.  Those families just do not know where to turn.  Young children must be brought to the dentist or doctor on many occasions.  The professional fees now charged are far in excess of those being charged a few years ago.  I do not know what the Government intends to do or can do to control professional fees.  The fees, as they stand, are crucifying hard-pressed families.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Fianna Fáil and Green Party Members know what they did was wrong.  The parties' backbenchers know this and are being reminded of it in their constituencies.  Their consciences are telling them to vote against the cuts.  They will have an opportunity to do so tomorrow night in this House.  Deputy Ring challenged Deputy Mattie McGrath, who said he would vote against this Bill, to do so.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh, who has now left the Chamber and who is from Deputy Mattie McGrath's constituency, smiled wryly at the idea.  I do not know whether he knows something we do not.  Perhaps Deputy Mattie McGrath will vote for the Fine Gael motion on this occasion.  He promised he would do so in regard to the NAMA Bill and the legislation to reduce the level of alcohol allowed to drivers.  I do not know where he was when those votes took place but he certainly did not vote against the Bills in spite of all his wild talk on the night.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The wage cut for mangers and staff in high-paid positions has been reduced to one of 3%.  Those are the people who are managing the front line services that have been cut back seriously.  The carer's allowance, which benefits those caring in their own homes for 24 hours per day, has been cut and, in many cases, home help has been reduced from nine hours to six hours.  In one case I know, the home help for a doubly incontinent person has been cut from six hours to three hours.  We will have many cutbacks to frontline services but the higher-paid managers, whom the Government wants to protect, have guaranteed jobs.  They are using cuts to frontline services to save money to allow them hold on to their own positions and salaries.  The Government has now given them another bonus in that it is to cut their pay by only 3% rather than 12%, as indicated in the budget two weeks before Christmas.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_679">In deciding how this €1 billion of savings would be applied to the salaries of public servants in 2010, the Government was guided by the need to ensure that those who earned more would contribute more and that office holders and other senior public servants would lead by example.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">The reductions effected range from 5% to 8% in the case of public servants with salaries of up to €125,000.  The reductions provided for are balanced and progressive but they are not painless and they had an adverse impact on all public servants in their daily lives.  We all have to adapt our financial commitments and living standards to our available income and, therefore, any measures which reduce that income require immediate and difficult adjustments.  I am well aware that public servants in many cases are struggling to cope with reductions in their incomes.  This is especially the case for those public servants on modest incomes and, in reality, almost two thirds of public servants earn €50,000 or less per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">Given the numbers of public servants on lower salary levels, it would simply not have been possible to achieve the scale of reduction required in the pay bill by exempting those on lower salary rates.  In deciding on reductions, however, I was conscious of the need to keep the rate of reduction in their salary levels as low as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">I was also aware that, in general, public servants on modest salaries have access to incremental pay scales based on satisfactory performance and service and this can become an important element in their salary.  The Fine Gael policy suggested freezing incremental scales within the public service.  Deputy Bruton and Deputy Kenny regularly held up this measure as an example of how they would deal with the public finances.  Where is the fairness in that proposal?  It is a direct hit on the pay of lower civil servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">We, in Government, rejected that option precisely because it would unfavourably and disproportionately impact those on lower salaries for whom increments can represent a significant element of remuneration over time.  For example, the average value of incremental increases at lower grade levels in the Civil Service range from more than 3% to in excess of 4.5%.  These incremental increases remain in place albeit at the reduced rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">For public servants with a basic salary over €125,000 reductions were generally as follows: 8% on a salary over €125,000 but less than €165,000; 12% on a salary over €165,000 but less than €200,000; and 15% on a salary over that.</p>

          <p eId="para_686">The Taoiseach and the highest level Secretaries General received a pay cut of 20%.  These higher reductions correctly applied to those who could most afford to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">There was one group, however, that caused the Government some unease.  That group was assistant secretaries and deputy secretaries.  They would have been treated exceptionally harshly by the combination of a number of cuts to their remuneration and would have ended up incurring a greater sacrifice of pay than all other groups except the Taoiseach and the two highest paid Secretaries General.  That position would have arisen through a combination of the pay adjustments recommended by the review body and the termination of the performance-related pay that had been an intrinsic part of their remuneration in the Civil Service and for related grades in other parts of the public service since 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">I would like to give the House some background on the performance related pay which has featured in this controversy.  In its report No. 38 of 2000, the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector recommended that the overall remuneration of these grades should comprise a basic salary plus performance related pay.  The review body recommended that an overall pool of 10% of the pay bill for the grades concerned should be set aside for performance-related pay.</p>

          <p eId="para_690">In accordance with the recommendations of the review body, therefore, a pool of 10% of the pay bill was paid each year in addition to basic pay.  The amount paid to individuals varied but, obviously, the average payment for an individual was 10%.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">Some of the commentary about the operation of the scheme of performance-related awards suggests a misunderstanding of how the scheme was operated.  It was overseen by the committee for performance awards which included a majority of private sector members.  The objectives assigned to assistant secretaries, on which their performance was evaluated and the awards for individuals were approved by the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">Performance-related pay has long played a role in driving performance in the private sector, and there could be a role for it in the public service, but current economic circumstances do not permit a performance-related award system.  The Government decided in 2009 to terminate the scheme of performance-related pay but, as I stated at the time, this was subject to discussion with the relevant staff association on the way in which the decision would be implemented.  I met the staff association representing assistant secretaries and deputy secretaries before Christmas and gave consideration to their views in deciding how the termination of performance-related pay should be dealt with in the context of the reductions in pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">In the context of the discussion at Government about the draft legislation providing for the reductions in public service pay which took place at the time of the budget, the position of the assistant secretary grade was considered.  It was recognised that the draft legislation could and should allow the particular circumstances of the grade to be addressed.  However, no decision was taken on the manner in which this might be done.  This was left to me, as Minister, under the legislation once it was enacted.  Ultimately, I decided it was reasonable that the deductions applied to the grades of assistant secretary and deputy secretary should comprise both a reduction in basic pay and a termination of the scheme of performance-related pay.  It must be remembered that the review body did not recommend termination of the scheme of performance-related pay.  The review body stated that it remained committed to this scheme but suggested that payments be suspended until 2012 and reviewed again then.  In deciding to terminate the scheme, the Government has gone beyond that recommendation.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">As I have stated, there were variations in the amounts paid to individuals under the scheme of performance-related pay but the average annual payment was approximately €15,000 in current terms.  It is simply not reasonable to ignore the loss of payments of this sort.  If a reduction of 8% had been applied to the basic pay of the grades in addition to the termination of performance-related pay, the average reduction would have been 18% of salary on this occasion alone, which would be higher than the deduction applying to higher paid grades.  This would have been especially unfair when the review body's own research showed that on a like-for-like examination, the pay of these grades was below that of comparable grades in the private sector and was lower than that in most other countries examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">It is important to understand in the context of this debate that the review group on higher level pay did benchmark the higher level salaries against international comparisons.</p>

          <p eId="para_697">The review body benchmarked their salary against their counterparts in five other countries.  The report noted, when comparison was made on an adjusted income basis, the salary of the Irish post of assistant secretary is behind that of four other countries  The United Kingdom's is 102% ahead, Germany's 29%, Belgium's 6% and the Netherlands' 1% ahead.  Only in Finland was the salary level slightly below that of the Irish post.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">It is unfair and inaccurate to attempt to portray the effect of the reductions imposed on assistant secretaries and deputy secretaries as involving smaller reductions than those applying to lower paid groups.  The resulting adjustments, including the effect of the termination of the scheme of performance-related pay, produced significant reductions in remuneration of 14% in the case of the grade of deputy secretary and 11.8% in the case of assistant secretary.  These reductions are higher than those applying to other groups at the lower salary levels and significantly higher than the minimum reduction provided for under the legislation of 5%.</p>

          <p eId="para_701">The substantial reduction the Government has applied to the pay of persons at this level is starkly highlighted when net reductions are examined.  The Government, in taking the difficult decision to reduce all public servants' pay, has sought as far as possible to protect the pay of the lowest paid and apply the major adjustments to those who can most afford it.  Similar performance-related pay schemes, independently assessed, applied in other sectors of the public service, including the Health Service Executive and the local government sector.  Accordingly, they also were included in my direction on pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">I am concerned about the efficiency of management structures, particularly in the HSE and local government.  Accordingly, the Government intends the McLoughlin group, undertaking an independent efficiency review of local authorities within a tight timeframe, will also review management arrangements in local authorities, as well as taking account of Government policy on local government reform and measures already in train in the transforming the public service agenda.  The group is to complete its work by the middle of this year.  The Government intends that a similar review will be carried out in the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">The Government's policy approach on pay is dictated by necessity not confrontation.  Common approaches and shared solutions remain the preferred policy instruments of the Government to address public service pay issues.  These approaches have served well before at times of serious economic difficulty in the 1980s and have the potential to continue to do so.  The approach is based upon a mutual recognition among all stakeholders, employers, Government and employees, of the scale of the economic problems facing us and an agreed policy response which sets aside short-term interests for long-term economic gain.  The magnitude of the economic problems facing us is greater, but I believe we are in a much better position than in the 1980s in potential, ambition, confidence, achievement and determination.  We have overcome our economic problems in the past and will do so again.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">Budget 2010 was the latest in a series of measures, beginning in mid-2008, to bring order to the public finances.  It is clear the actions taken by the Government are having an effect, the decline in tax receipts has moderated, expenditure pressures have lessened and the cost of borrowing has reduced from the high levels seen in early 2009.  Recent movements in the international markets underline the importance of continuing to take such firm and decisive action to restore stability to the public finances.  They also underline the importance of the decisions the Government took on public service pay in the recent budget.  Decisive action now will return the economy to a sustainable growth path.  While challenges and difficult choices still remain, the Government is determined to continue to take the necessary steps in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_707">This debate has been characterised by a less than scrupulous adherence to the facts surrounding the matters at stake.  Some fundamental points need to be made before a detailed debate on the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">The criticism by the Opposition and much of the media is focused on the public sector pay cuts imposed in the December budget.  However, this presents a misleading picture of what happened in the public finances and public sector take-home pay in the past 12 months.  Last year, we did not have one but two budgets, introduced in extraordinary circumstances.  Both fiscal-type budgets involved serious reductions in pay for civil and public servants in eight months.  One, however, cannot examine the effect of the December budget without examining the April budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">This time last year, as the Minister for Finance pointed out, serious questions were raised about Ireland's ability to make its loan repayments in the international financial and sovereign debt markets.  Then when Exchequer returns stood at €32 billion, Ireland had to borrow €26 billion which was unsustainable.  If allowed to continue it would have become untenable not in the medium or long term but in months.  To dig our way out of that hole required great determination and courage, as shown by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  Then Ireland was portrayed as the sick man of Europe.  Last weekend I looked at European financial reports which all focused on the serious problems in the public finances of Greece, Spain, Portugal and, to a lesser extent, Britain but not Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">Any criticism of the Government's policy cannot be focused on the December budget alone but on both.  Those who have had serious reductions in their salaries and tax increases will look at their take-home pay.  The April emergency budget saw serious increases in taxes and the introduction of a pension levy, imposing serious hardship on everyone, including civil and public servants.  The budget was introduced in emergency circumstances with the sole intent of stabilising the public finances while the second budget in December dealt with the expenditure side most severely.  It did cause severe hardship for people across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">We must examine the cumulative effect of both budgets.  Comparing salaries in 2008 to those in 2010, a Secretary General at level I saw a 33.9% reduction in net salary while at levels II and III the reduction was 29.7% and 28.8%, respectively.  For a deputy secretary, it was 27.3%; assistant secretary 24.9% and principal officer 19.3%.  However, for a clerical officer at the standard scale the reduction was 7.3%.  To claim those in the so-called lower grades in the Civil Service, a term with which I am not particularly enamoured, were asked to contribute more than those at the higher levels is grossly misleading and does no one any service.  Of course I would expect it from the Opposition, but I would ask the media, in particular, to pay more attention to the fact that those on the higher reductions of 33%——</p>

          <p eId="para_717">——and it was characterised by a misrepresentation of the facts.  The problem here is that these are the facts.  The facts, I would readily accept, are simply not capable of being explained in the modern 30-second media cycle.  It is not possible to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">Neither do I accept that these sit easily with the increasing tendency towards the politics of populism that is exhibited increasingly on the Opposition benches.  I detect clearly that the public is getting a little wary of the wafer-thin veneer on Opposition politics and policies such as they are.  When they look at the facts, they see, as the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated, that the severe budgetary measures we are taking are having a real effect.  This is even the case in the international community where they were saying Ireland 12 months ago was the sick man of Europe unable to pay its way, with a big question mark over its sovereign debt and downgraded by the ratings agencies.  Twelve months later, because of this resolute action involving the severe contribution made by everybody, and particularly public servants, we are no longer in that position.  That is to the credit of the Government and that should be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">Every progressive tax system in the developed world is based on a number of simple core principles.  First, the system ought to be transparent so that the taxpayer knows exactly what he or she pays and what everybody else pays, and it is clear and straightforward.  It was not always the case.  Second, the system does not discriminate unfairly between different classes of individuals and does not discriminate unfairly within particular classes of individuals.  Third, and the most important feature which is accepted internationally as being a benchmark for all modern taxation systems, it must be progressive in the sense that it is progressively more burdensome on those who get paid more than those who get paid less, that taxation increases are increased proportionately as one goes higher up the scale.  The figures for the take-home pay of civil and public servants in this country bear this simple fact out, that the measures the Government has introduced, unpopular, difficult and politically difficult to take though they were, have all the characteristics of being consistent with those principles of international budgetary parameters.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">Despite the facts which no doubt bear out the Government's position, there was a preferred approach to all of this.  Clearly, the Government did not want confrontation.  We would have preferred to have a common approach with all the stakeholders, particularly the public and civil servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">I hope this debate highlights two matters, the first of which is a progressive tendency in the Opposition benches towards pure populism at the expense of any fact.  Second, it points out that, progressively, the difficult measures taken affect more those who get paid more — Secretaries General, minus 33.9%; those on the clerical officer level, minus 7.2%.  I accept 7.2% is a great deal if one is on the clerical officer level.  It is a big imposition, especially if one is struggling to make ends meet, but do not insult the Irish electorate and the Irish people by trying to portray repeatedly through the media, which in many respects is willing, the fact that those who get paid more are not shouldering their fair burden; they are actually taking greater cuts than those on lower pay.  Those are the facts of the matter and I would ask the media to portray them more accurately in future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Noel Treacy</from>
          <p eId="para_722">I support the amendment as proposed by the Minister for Finance.  I pay tribute to him for the calm, reasonable, humane and equitable way that he has dealt with this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">We have a serious constitutional responsibility in this House to distribute the resources of the State as available to Government and this House has a mandatory responsibility under the Constitution to distribute those resources.  The challenge in a situation where there are diminishing returns is to distribute diminishing resources in as fair and equitable a way as possible taking into account the first calls that are on those resources.  The Government has addressed this in the past two budgets, and more particularly has given clear leadership in enunciating to the nation at large the responsibility that we as a nation, as a people and as a society led by Government, collectively, on a consensual basis, agree within this House on the best way possible to distribute those available resources.  If the Opposition constantly opposes for long-term, short-term and medium-term political gain the Government on what is a constitutional responsibility, it is only confusing people on the Government's responsibility to this Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">I see from the motion that there is even confusion within the Opposition's own ranks.  One of those whose name appears on this motion is no longer a Member of this House.  He has left in a state of frustration because, he says, there was no consensual approach within Opposition to supporting Government to achieve that which was best in the interests of the common good.  That is basically the theme of the confusion and the demoralised state in which this young man has left this House.  If that is the position with somebody who has come in to give economic advice to one sector of Parliament, and he leaves in that state of confusion, how will the people of Ireland, watching and listening to the Opposition's utterances on a continuous basis over the past two years, feel about the role of this Parliament in discharging its constitutional duty to the people of Ireland on a consistent basis when that confusion reigns?</p>
          <p eId="para_725">There has been a strong commitment over the years on different occasions when there was a crisis in this nation that politicians together in Parliament, elected by the people with a sovereign mandate to discharge their obligations to the people, would do so in the interests of that which was best for the people.  The Minister, led by the Taoiseach, stated clearly over the past two years that faced with the challenges we had, political leadership was required and he was the first person to come forward and say that at the highest level of Government and the highest level of public service there would be a requirement to take a one-fifth cut in salary, never done in the history of this State previously.  That is real leadership and real commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">We take into account then the fact that the Minister for Finance came in and produced a budget here prior to Christmas clearly enunciating the resources available, the challenges that were there and the requirements on us as a Parliament under the Constitution to discharge our duties.  That man, who put that budget before this Parliament, had it ratified by Parliament and had the legislation subsequently ratified by Parliament, went back and looked at how it was best, fair and reasonable to deal with the resources of State taking into account the need to reduce public sector salaries.  Where there was a distortion, an unevenness and an unfairness at a particular grade of public servant, he examined that in totality and specifically, had consultation and ultimately realised that to be fair to everybody the burden had to be shared on an equitable basis taking into account, like the State itself, the capacity of the individual public servant grade to take the required reductions in order to——</p>

The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has done an outstanding job in sustaining that fairness and that equity, and I fully endorse this amendment.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_729">Before we go into what happened and the sequence of events, it is very important that Fianna Fáil recalls the circumstances in which it brought the country, for the second time in as many generations, to the point of economic ruin.  The reason it has had these extraordinarily difficult budgets, which have impacted very heavily on low paid people, people on social welfare, people in receipt of child benefit and people in receipt of early childhood payments, is that it destroyed the economy.  During this crisis Fianna Fáil has taken a relentless approach, assisted by its public relations people, in trying to drive a wedge between the public service and the private sector.  To some degree, it has been successful in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">It was Fianna Fáil that blew up a fantastic housing boom from around 2000 when it created a vast range of tax incentives in regard to property and lending.  The consequence of that was that two civil servants or two public servants on relatively modest wages — for example, a nurse married to a teacher — ended up in a position where, in an inflated property market, they could barely afford to buy a house.  For generations, buying a house was a legitimate aspiration of people on modest middle incomes not only in the public sector but in the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">It is foolish of the Government not to look back at how it brought the country to its knees and how it brought people to the pass it imposed on them in the last two budgets.  Civil Service salaries rose very sharply on the back of a situation where ordinary civil servants found it difficult to buy houses.  It is important to remember that.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">The consequence is that many public servants at high and low levels are heavily indebted because they bought houses and apartments at the height of the property boom when the frenzy to get on the property ladder was so strong.  The consequence of that is that a significant number of public servants of all ranks are trapped in negative equity and will bear the brunt of mortgage increases.  I am sure the Minister and the Minister of State, who have spoken, have had people call to, and e-mail, them to tell them of their difficulties, in particular if the negative equity is accompanied by debt.  Fianna Fáil will correctly say it never told people to borrow to buy houses but, of course, Fianna Fáil through its friends in the construction industry told people to get on the property ladder.  It is important to recognise what drove the huge level of pay increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">In regard to the events following the Minister's Budget Statement and subsequently, two lawyers for the Government have spoken lawyer talk to explain away everything and say black is white.  That is what lawyers are trained to do.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, for brazenly not acknowledging the crux of this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">The crux of this problem lies with the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and, to a lesser extent, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  When the Minister for Finance made his budget speech, he clearly laid out that there would be reductions in public service pay and that those reductions would bear less onerously on people on lower salaries in the public service.  As the Minister said, there is a large number of people in the public service on €50,000 or less per year.  One must bear in mind that many of them have debt problems in regard to mortgages and other debts.  Like other people on low wages, they are hard pressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">When the Minister declared — it was one of the headings in the budget — that those who are well-off would bear more of the burden, English being what we all understand, we thought that meant the people in the higher grades would take a proportionately higher hit.  I do not believe anyone wants to see people take a cut in their wages.  It is painful for Members of the House who have had to do so and, of course, it is painful for everybody in the public service.  However, it was the deceit inherent in the presentation which is the cause of the public grief and anger.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">The Taoiseach, rather like the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, on another occasion, said it was "only €5 million".  When PPARS was a fiasco, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, famously said it was only €155 million, we were good for that and that it did not matter.  However, when we are in such an extreme situation, it matters a great deal.  It is the inherent unfairness.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">In regard to the pay and conditions of assistant secretaries, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment said in the House that the review body on higher level pay indicated the bonus was indicatively part of their salaries.  She accepted that a further reduction which would equal a reduction of 20% would be disproportionate.  However, the review body stated, "we consider that, in the light of the very serious economic and fiscal environment, the developments in relation to such schemes [bonus schemes] in the private sector and our recommendations that reductions in remuneration are warranted, the continuation of performance-related awards cannot be justified in the current climate."</p>
          <p eId="para_738">It may be that the Government, in setting up the performance-related bonus scheme in 2001, was at fault.  It called it "a bonus".  A bonus generally means a reward for exceptional service, dedication and achievement of required outputs where they are measured.  On examination, it appears almost everybody got a bonus.  The Minister for Finance has now backtracked and said, it was an inherent part, or as the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment said, it was an indicative part — I still do not understand what that means — of the pay package.  Lower paid civil servants hear their bosses get bonuses.  A bonus means something for exceptional service.  Perhaps a bonus could be given to people who never have a sick day or to people who get an output over and beyond a required level of service.  What happened with this was the absolute depressing appearance of a sleight of hand for a group of civil servants who had the Minister's ear.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">What is even more disturbing is that remuneration package carries to many other grades.  When I spoke about it at the beginning, people did not appreciate it applied to directors of service, county managers, people in the HSE and so on.  People in the HSE get bonuses as an indicative part of their salaries.  Many people find that difficult to understand because the level of dissatisfaction with the HSE is, at times, very extreme.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">In another sleight of hand, the HSE is demanding of bodies funded by it under the Health Act 2004 to offer cuts of 21.5%, including salary cuts, or to find the cuts by other means.  The question again arises for the Minister.  He has not been forthcoming on this.  Does that mean that the people in the HSE-funded bodies at the affected grades of assistant secretary and director of service also have a different formula to people in the lower levels or do we just have a cut in services?  The House and the public have been treated with a lot of contempt.  A lot of damage has been done by this and by the Minister in the first budget when he made grandiose announcements about reductions in the pay of Deputies and Ministers which turned out not to apply for a long period.  They applied afterwards but did not apply at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">On budget day the Minister was already fully aware of the situation and had been briefed that there was an issue relating to this group of civil servants.  He could have done two things.  He could have stood by what he said or he could have been honest and said these reductions will apply, except in the case of certain categories where they will be calculated in a different manner.

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_742">I support the general thrust of this motion and also call for support for the amendment in the name of the Sinn Féin Deputies, which demands that the Government reverse the pay cuts imposed on public servants earning less than €100,000 per year.  The decision before Christmas to reverse the cuts on the higher paid public servants was the equivalent of rubbing salt into the wounds of those who are on lower salaries, for many of whom the pay cuts mean they are finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">The Minister's rationale for the decision, which is repeated in the amendment to the motion, is that a small number of the people concerned had already lost bonuses, does not stand up given that for others on lower rates the budget cuts were also the second cut in income which they had imposed on them.  We should not forget that such people had no overtime or possibility of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">I noted the self-congratulatory amendment tabled by the Minister, which is an insult to public servants and all those who have been hammered in recent budget cuts.  In it he said he notes the cumulative impact of the reductions in public service pay and refers to assistant secretaries, deputy secretaries and others.  It does not note the cumulative impact of the reductions in public service pay for the tens of thousands of public servants who are now living on the threshold of poverty or below it.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">It is madness that recent budgets have lead to the crazy situation whereby the State admits it is cutting pay to save the Exchequer money while forcing people to accept slave wages.  They are slave wages because the same State admits it by giving the families concerned family income supplement.  That is the proof of the matter.  It is a  ludicrous situation that the State cuts someone's income, supposedly saves taxpayers' money, and then finds itself having to pay it back through social welfare, which incurs administrative costs.  In case an idiot on the other side of the House does not understand the situation, I support a reversal of the cuts to public servants' pay and not a change in the threshold for social welfare payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">Once again I urge the Government, as I did when the two budgets were introduced last year, to look elsewhere.  My party made a substantial submission to the Government on where the Exchequer could find the necessary savings of €4 billion.  We also went beyond that and proposed how the State could find the money to create jobs and increase the tax take by employing people and getting people back to work.  The Government does not understand the situation.  There are very few Deputies on the Government benches who have any understanding of what it is to be unemployed for any length of time or to be a lowly paid civil or public servant on the lowest grades, including general operatives and clerical officers who are trying to make ends meet to pay for overpriced housing which they were encouraged to buy during the Celtic tiger years because the alternative was to overpay in rent.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">One can hear from the Government that the next target is the minimum wage.  The Government and its friends in ISME and IBEC are already building up a campaign to target and lower the minimum wage.  There is a logic to such a decision from the Government's point of view.  If it is willing to kick its public servants and slash their incomes, why not go after another layer of society?</p>
          <p eId="para_748">The politics of this situation are apparent.  Once the Government has broken the back of public servants and public service unions on pay cuts it is set to continue that right-wing agenda to force wages down to the lowest level possible.  The only people who benefit from this are speculators — na hamhantraithe.  That is why it is important that we go well beyond legitimate criticism of the Government for its hypocritical climb down on the cuts for a small number of higher paid public servants and insist, as our amendment does, that the cuts for all public servants earning below €100,000 per year be reversed.  Such a view is not incompatible with the wording of the motion.  In our amendment we are merely attempting to turn the sentiment expressed towards lower paid public servants into a meaningful demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">I hope the Fine Gael Deputies, excluding one who still has his name on the amendment, will accept our proposal as will other Opposition Deputies, including Independent Deputies, so that the word goes from here to the Government benches that we are not accepting this and will oppose any move which excludes those who are higher paid in our society from taking the full share of cuts which are deserved or required.  It is not just about the higher paid public servants but also many others in our society who have lived and still live well beyond the means which any person should.  The greed in our society which was perpetuated and encouraged during the Celtic tiger years is still reflected in Government thinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">There is a clear dividing line between those who believe that those who are least responsible for and able to afford to pay for the current crisis are forced to carry the burden and those who do not.  The attitude of the Government is to make the poor pay for the wrongs and sins of the speculators, bankers and financial planners in the Government.  There is a difference between it and those of us who oppose such an approach and have proposed an alternative.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">This motion highlights the disparity between the manner in which the Government treated those at opposite ends of the salary spectrum in the public service.  It can go beyond that if Fine Gael accepts our amendment calling for the reversal of the pay cuts imposed on public servants who earn less than €100,000.</p>

        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_352">
          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_753">In the debate of the past half-hour on the budget we heard from the Government which, in my view, is being disingenuous with its figures, basing everything on net rather than gross amounts.  Net can be different for different people, depending on their circumstances, the credits for which they qualify and whether they are married or single.  The Government appears to have made a decision and is now going back to plug the holes, working from the decision backwards rather than having prepared that decision.  The assistant secretary grade has had a 3% reduction but in essence the Government has given a 5% bonus because 8% should have been applied.  If one were looking for consistency that is the kind of thing one should look at.  If one considers a gross salary that includes average performance-related pay, it appears that bonuses were paid to everyone at different rates but at an average of 10%.  If that is the case why not deem it to be salary?  One cannot have it both ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">Regarding the Finance Bill, I refer specifically to the Limerick regeneration project.  I brought the matter up earlier with the Taoiseach, saying I would ask the Minister for Finance to consider tabling an amendment to deal with the provision of tax designations for the regeneration areas in Limerick and some adjoining areas to encourage private investment to take place in those areas.  In addition, I would like to see the Government providing the funding that was committed for the Limerick regeneration project over two years ago.  It is at a very sensitive stage and people are losing morale.  This €3 billion project was launched amid fanfare by Government, with €1.7 billion to come from the State and €1.3 billion from the private sector.  Proper government is about providing an environment where the private sector can flourish.  One of the elements in the Limerick regeneration project should be to provide tax designation for investment within the areas in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">In his speech the Minister raised a number of points, one being the solidarity bond.  It is critical for the Minister to indicate in his response exactly how he sees the funds to be raised by solidarity bonds being used.  Fine Gael has launched a ground-breaking document, New Era, which proposes significant job creation potential for up to 100,000 people in the areas essential for competitiveness in this economy, namely, water, energy and broadband.  When we look at competitiveness we must look at it in the context of job creation.  There are three elements to driving the economy forward.  These are the three Cs — confidence, credit and competitiveness.  This Finance Bill and the budget that preceded it lack any incentives in that area.  We need to see the Government addressing these issues across a range of areas.  Fine Gael proposes reduction of employers' PRSI for employees.  We considered halving the lower rate and taking 2% off the top rate which would reduce costs for employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">Energy costs are related solely to Government policy.  In 2001 our cost for industrial electricity was average within the EU.  We are now 50% below that average, with the second-highest cost in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">Research and development tax credit should be available for offset against PRSI.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">The air travel tax is ludicrous.  I would love to know if a cost-benefit analysis was done on the amount of money it brings in and how much has been lost in terms of people coming into the country, hotels, tourism and the general economy.  In Limerick, in the mid-west and along the western seaboard we have suffered greatly from this tax and this fact has been reinforced by people such as Michael O'Leary.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">The issue of credit flow to small business is critical.  In a study done by the enterprise boards 96% of small businesses stated they have more difficulty accessing credit now than they had six months ago.  This is having a detrimental effect on small businesses which are the lifeblood of the economy.  The multinational sector is extremely important and there are measures dealing with it in the Bill that we will look at in greater depth on Committee Stage.  I welcome that but we must have a rounded approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">My worry concerns vision.  My vision of Ireland Inc. is that in terms of sustainability it must be driven towards the SME sector.  The multinational sector is vital in the provision of jobs but we are no longer a low cost economy.  We must provide an environment where an entrepreneurial spirit can flourish.  The rudiments for that are not present.  There must be a practical edge to the way we deal with the SME sector.  It is critical that we have corporation tax exemption for the first two years for limited companies but this should be extended to sole traders.  The majority of people who set up in business set up as sole traders and entrepreneurs, not as limited companies.  We want a situation where people will set up in business and become self-employed.  Shortly, probably over the coming summer, it is conceivable that we will have 500,000 people on the live register.  Of those, 250,000 have signed on in the past two years.  That is an indictment of Government policy, apart from global factors.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">We must provide an environment that gives competitiveness and brings confidence back to people so that they will spend again.  They will do so only if they feel they have security in their jobs.  We must be export driven.  We are a small open economy.  In 2003 we were that economy.  When Deputy Richard Bruton was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, we were that economy.  From 1997 to 2003 our exports increased.  In 2003 they decreased.</p>

If I might encapsulate the situation, we need to have a vision for the SME sector so that it can become the driving force of the economy.  It employs 800,000 people, with 200,000 others involved.  Small and medium-sized enterprises are the future, along with what the multinational sector provides.  The vision must be to have an entrepreneurial culture.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
          <p eId="para_764">I welcome the publication of the Finance Bill and the chance to speak on it briefly in the House.  The Bill, which provides a framework for the budget produced in December, has a number of very important measures, namely, a budget which will provide €1 billion and offers activation for employment during 2010, including a €20 million fund for activation measures specifically targeted at people aged under 35.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">I welcome the commitment in the Finance Bill to framing our legislation to encourage sharia finance to this country.  We have an amazingly good standing as a country within the Muslim community, particularly in the Middle East.  Last year, I had the pleasure of travelling with people from the College of Surgeons to see some of their work in Bahrain.  Their work and the work of our  medical community generally in the Middle East, as in other countries, will give us a great platform from which to exploit this source of finance, and to use our good standing and geographical location as a natural base for that finance.  The commitment in the Finance Bill to introducing those measures is welcome and should be exploited.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">With regard to the new taxes proposed in the Finance Bill, I am intrigued by the level of discussion on the increase in VAT on bin charges.  As someone who lives in a county where there is no choice and where there has been no local authority involvement in bin collection for some time, I have had to pay VAT on bin charges for the past five years.  As far as those of us who pay those charges are concerned, this proposal levels the pitch in the interest of those who have no choice in the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">I endorse the comment made by Deputy O'Donnell — I know he will repeat this on Committee Stage — on the provisions in the Bill to attract further talent from the multinational sector.  He is correct with regard to his remarks on small businesses but we must realise the engine of our economy comes currently from the multinational sector and the work it is doing, particularly in the area of research and development.  The more we encourage those involved in this sector to locate their human talent and physical operations here, the better our chance of exploiting that human talent for our small business sector.</p>

        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_356">

        <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_357" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
          <p eId="para_769">We need to challenge ourselves to come up with a way, for example through partnership schemes or networking, whereby that talent will engage with the small business sector or, as it did in the first wave of the multinationals coming to Ireland in the 1970s, become the small business people of the future.  This measure will help that.  The solidarity bond is a very good response to the current savings phenomenon that seems to have taken hold in the country.  I hope the Minister will ensure it is as attractive as possible to savers and provides the security for which they are looking.  With regard to comments on the small business sector, a number of initiatives were launched in the budget, including the employment subsidy scheme, in which €135 million will be invested this year.  The scheme has been hugely successful, with 2,700 applications.  These are currently being assessed and will guarantee 80,000 jobs.  This is the kind of encouragement business needs.  It is hoped we will be in a position to expand that scheme next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">There is vision in the Finance Bill.  There is a vision to promote human talent and to exploit different sources of revenue and new markets, such as the finance market to which I referred.  There is a vision in it for employment.  What we need now, across Departments and the House, is to exploit that vision and put it into action in our various spends.  The Minister has given us the leeway to do that.  It is now up to those of us in government to ensure we see this through over the next 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">Earlier in the debate we heard ongoing criticism that the Bill does not do enough for the economy and fails to recognise there is still a substantial capital spend contained within the budgetary programme for 2010.  That capital spend will be spent on roads, schools and in the productive sector.  By exploiting that sector and the fact we are now in a situation where we can get lower prices, we should be able to maintain the physical investment and ensure job creation arises from that €12 billion.  We must ensure jobs are created to the best possible employment standards and that there is no race to the bottom within the tendering process.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dick Roche)</from>
          <p eId="para_772">Finance Bills, by definition, are dusty pieces of legislation.  This is no different and there are dusty areas in it.  However, it is a Finance Bill which touches on some very important measures, some of which are very subtle but which will have a major impact.  It is important for a Finance Bill, particularly in the current climate, to strike the right balance.  Therefore, it needs to be more than just a book-keeping exercise.  This Bill is certainly more than that.  The Finance Bill must operate within the difficult economic parameters within which we find ourselves and this Bill does this.  It must also contain measures that enhance Ireland's attractiveness as a place to do business and create jobs.  I accept the point made in Deputy O'Donnell's contribution that SMEs and their inventiveness have a particular role to play.  I also agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, that we must address both sectors</p>

          <from>Deputy Dick Roche</from>
          <p eId="para_774">There are particular measures in this Bill to deal with innovation, research and development, which will be very important.  I will touch on some of those measures shortly.  The Finance Bill must continue the task of stabilising Ireland's public finances and do so in a way that is equitable.  The Bill before us ticks all the right boxes in terms of all of these issues.  Of course, as with any Finance Bill, we can always think of improvements that could be made.  The Minister has shown he is willing to listen and, when provided with persuasive arguments, reverse previous positions.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">I would like to turn now to some of the specific measures of the Bill.  I welcome the wide range of provisions in the Bill that will assist enterprise, some of which are subtle and new.  Those that will assist innovation, research and development are particularly important in terms of creating long-term and sustainable employment and of putting Ireland back on the track to full recovery.  The Bill will amend the existing research and development tax credits to cover situations where a company carries out research activities in different facilities or separate geographical locations.  I am pleased the Minister has taken this step.  It may not seem a huge step to many, but it is critical, particularly for the pharmaceutical industry.  As we are all aware, over the past two years and in the coming years, the pharmaceutical industry has and will go through significant change.  It is going through a period of consolidation.  It is important therefore that bureaucratic procedures which applied previously in this area should be wiped away.  The Minister has proposed changes which will be welcomed by the industry, particularly in this period of consolidation.  I welcome the change and the fact it indicates the Minister was willing to listen.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">I also welcome the enhancements of the existing tax treatment of dividends received for companies here to increase the attractiveness of Ireland as a place for economic activity in general.  The provisions in the Bill in this regard are complex, but what the Minister is seeking to do is to tap a new possibility of bringing financial services into Ireland and consolidating the grip we have in this area.  The amendment he proposes here will mean, for example, changing the current tax rate of 25% on foreign dividends paid out of trading profits from countries with which Ireland does not have a tax treaty.  This will operate to the benefit of Irish enterprise.  The Minister has introduced further complex measures that will have the effect of simplifying the arrangements under which foreign dividends are treated as sources for trading or non-trading profits.  He also provides tax exemptions to foreign dividends forming trading income for portfolio investment.  I suggest these measures will have a significant effect, particularly in the financial services area.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">The Bill also gives effect to an important change in the remittance scheme introduced in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2008.  The scheme will now cover EU and EEA nationals and the period during which they must be based in Ireland is reduced from three years to one year.  This will greatly improve Ireland's ability to attract high-skilled individuals who are innovators in their own field and who will act as magnets to attract economic activity.  The Bill also contains important measures aimed at enhancing Ireland's attractiveness as a base for internationally traded services, particularly financial services.  The Bill's provisions are aimed at bringing clarity with regard to the tax treatment applying to foreign funds that are managed from Ireland under the recent EU directive, Undertakings for Collective investments in Transferable Securities, UCITS.  The change in the Bill is both prudent and timely.  This is a complex area which has not received much attention in the media.  Nonetheless, it is an area that will be more significant in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">I would mention two measures that are particularly welcome in terms of job creation.  First is the extension of the existing scheme of tax exemptions for new start-up companies over the first three years of operation.  Deputy O'Donnell pointed out it is important we do something to help small and medium enterprises.  This measure is aimed specifically at small and medium enterprises, which by nature are small on start up.  The existing scheme is now to be extended to those who commence trading in 2010, which I welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">I also welcome the extension of the scope of the existing scheme of capital allowances for energy efficient equipment to cover additional technologies, including refrigeration and cooling systems, electoral and mechanical systems and catering and hospitality equipment.  In this difficult period, it makes sense to incentivise the application of energy efficient and clean technologies, which this section of the Bill will achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The Bill also contains a number of more down to earth provisions.  We all spoke in this House in the past year of the extraordinary situation that had applied in the motor industry.  An industry that had been booming during the previous five years, perhaps excessively so, had come to a juddering halt.  Thousands of people all over the country were losing their jobs in this industry.  I realise that one can make an interesting economic debate about issues such as the scrappage scheme and whether it would really create jobs.  However, the important point about the scrappage scheme that is in place is that it will help an industry that was brought to its knees by the end of the spend.  The measures introduced in the budget are already beginning to have a positive effect.  While one could ask whether the scheme is wise or the best way to deal with this issue, it has called a halt to the decline in the industry and has had a stabilising effect.  Therefore, I suggest that whatever shortcomings schemes like this may have, it is welcome, particularly in the circumstances of that industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">Moving from general economic issues to more domestic ones, I also welcome the extension of mortgage interest relief for qualifying loans where entitlement to mortgage interest relief was due to end in 2010.  Every one of us in the months since the previous budget will have become aware of people for whom the ending of the relief would cause real difficulty.  Given the dramatic changes that have occurred in the Irish property market, extending the relief to the end of 2017 is very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">On the issue of hard-pressed mortgages, the Minister's efforts to extend the provisions of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears is something we would all welcome.  We have all met people who are in mortgage arrears.  It is an issue that is now presenting itself for the first time in political clinics, irrespective of which side of the House one is on.  Under the existing arrangements, the banks and building societies which were registered with the Financial Regulator under the code, or other lenders covered by the code, had to make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule for borrowers who found themselves in difficulties.  They were required to wait for at least six months from the time of the first arrears before they commenced court actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">I take the view, as would many others in this House and not just on this side, that banks and building societies, which were throwing out money at extraordinary levels, should be certainly more patient with customers.  I strongly support the extension of the stay period in the code to 12 months — in fact, a case could be made for extending it beyond 12 months because it must be asked what banks, building societies or other lenders would do with any properties repossessed given the current state of the of the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">I also strongly support the efforts that have been made recently, somewhat belatedly, by the Irish Banking Federation when it reached a protocol with MABS with regard to couples and house purchasers who find themselves in difficulties.  The arrangements which are coming through in that system will provide help to people who are in real difficulties.  When I was in the Custom House as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, one of the interesting statistics that came across my desk is that the last thing on which the Irish people in general will default is the payment in regard to their houses.  Given the excessive way in which the market developed, it is right, prudent and proper that the degree of support to help people to hold onto their homes should be extended.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">I also believe firmly, as do other Members, that not only should the stay be extended from six to 12 months but that it should apply not just to the traditional lenders — the banks or building societies — but to the non-traditional lenders who entered the market in Ireland in recent years.  I look forward to the regulation and the code extending to them because certainly some of them have behaved in a predatory way, and they should not be given any support in their activities.  I am pleased that on a number of recent occasions in the courts, some of these more predatory actors have been told to put a halt to their gallop.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">There are three other arrangements in the Bill to which I wish to extend a particular welcome.  First, I welcome the idea of creating a national solidarity bond.  Many Members of this House have mentioned this.  I  believe I remember Deputy Bruton referring to it, although I am not sure what he called it.  I am willing to give credit to him because I have been defending him——</p>

          <p eId="para_791">Of course, one could argue that the last thing we need is another savings scheme because savings are at an extraordinarily high level and we need to encourage people to spend, although perhaps not as profligately as they did in the past.  The provisions of the Bill which will facilitate the introduction of the bond are positive.  At present, as Deputy O'Donnell said, people are saving at unprecedented levels.  While this has had the effect of depressing demand, if savings are available, they must be used to enhance the productive capacity of the State.  A solidarity bond, managed by the National Treasury Management Agency, would be clearly more beneficial to society as a whole than a speculative investment by banks or financial institutions whose sole focus is private wealth rather than the public good.  I look forward to the details of the bond being published, and I particularly hope they will  focus on enhancing the creation of infrastructure.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, said, we already have a substantial capital programme, but if a bond were to be used to enhance that, we would all welcome it.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">A second novelty in the Bill which should be mentioned is the introduction of the domicile levy of €200,000 on all Irish-domiciled individuals who are Irish citizens.  This will ensure that the super-wealthy make at least some contribution to the operations of the State.  Persons liable to the levy will have to pay it regardless of where they live or where they are tax resident.  This is an interesting innovation and I would be very interested to see the detail as it comes through.  We will all be interested in assessing it in a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">The third novelty in the Bill which I welcome is the provision which would allow for the introduction of a statutory scheme for providing for voluntary deductions for members of the Judiciary.  I have never taken the view, nor do I believe many people in this House share the view, that the general provisions in the Constitution which were aimed at protecting judges from oppressive activity by the State were ever intended by the drafters of our Constitution to exempt judges, who after all are citizens, from the general taxation provisions or other levies or impositions that the State must from time to time place on its citizens.  Taxes are the price we pay for living in a civilised society.  That price has to be paid by the most powerful as well as the most junior.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">Having said that, I want to acknowledge that the bulk of judges have made their contribution to the pension levy and have come into it in a voluntary way.  However, while that is good, it is not good enough.  All citizens, whether they are in the Judiciary, in this House, the other House, the Presidency or otherwise, have a responsibility to make their contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">I have always taken the view that flexibility is a sign of strength and it is never to be taken as a sign of weakness.  I particularly welcome the decision of the Minister to reverse the decision on the 21.5% VAT rate.  It takes a strong person to say "No, that was not a good decision", which is what the Minister has done.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">I welcome the Minister's decision to remove the life assurance levy on pensions products.  During the past 12 months, I became aware of concerns that the levy could discourage investment in pensions.  It is critical that investment in pensions be encouraged.  Ireland, like the entire world of developed nations, faces the reality that population aging is increasing.  The Minister's change and flexibility in this area is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">In general, finance Bills tend to be dusty.  While this Bill too has its share of dusty corners, it meets all of the requirements which I outlined at the outset.  Is it perfect?  Probably not.  Few pieces of legislation that come before this House are perfect.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, has shown that he is more flexible than has been any other Minister for Finance in recent times.  He is flexible, willing to listen and willing to pick up a good idea and run with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">The Bill reverses a number of previous policies and prudently extends others.  It is a good Bill, on which I commend the Minister.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_800">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I am disappointed with the Finance Bill 2010, which, while big in volume, in terms of detail contains nothing new.  Although the Bill contains some positive measures, there is no clear thrust to it or clear objective in terms of what the Government is trying to achieve.  It is but a reheating of the budget introduced before Christmas.  The Bill provides no clear sense of direction in terms of where the Government is going and no focus in regard to job creation, which is hugely disappointing.  The mantra of this Government is to cut support to those who cannot work, to take away the opportunity from those who want to work and to force those on low pay out of employment.  This Bill does not seek to change any of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">Where in this Bill is the stimulus plan to turn the economy around, get it off its knees and assist people back into employment? Sadly, the Bill contains no such plan.  My constituency, no more than any other, has growing levels of unemployment.  Unemployment figures for my constituency have increased by 155% during the past two years.  This means that in real terms there are an additional 8,500 people in the counties of Roscommon and Leitrim on the dole queues.  In a constituency, which has one of the smallest populations in the country, there are 8,500 additional homes without income.  There is nothing in this Bill to kick-start investment or to encourage investment in infrastructure, which is urgently required.  There is no investment in our people either.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">One in every three men unemployed is under the age of 25.  These people are signing on the dole with little prospect of getting a job.  While this Bill should have provided some direction or focus in this regard, sadly, it has not been forthcoming.  There does not appear to be any direction from Government in this regard.  I discussed during the weekend the impact of this legislation on my constituency and county in terms of club football and so on.  Many young people who would normally participate in the local club senior team have emigrated to London or further afield.  The cores of communities are being decimated.  While there were many ills associated with the Celtic tiger in terms of the economy during the past ten years, young people were at least able to remain living in their communities and to get involved in their local sporting and voluntary organisations.  Sadly, all they are doing now is taking Ryanair flights out of this country to the UK and further afield.  The Finance Bill copperfastens the focus of a budget that has resulted in 75,000 additional people becoming unemployed this year at a cost to the Exchequer of €1.5 billion to be obtained through cuts in social welfare payments and front line services.  The lack of focus in this respect is hugely frustrating.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">Another issue close to my heart is that of agriculture.  I believe, as do many people in the country, that agriculture, which has traditionally been the backbone of the economy, has the ability to lift us out of the mess into which the Government got us.  Rather than supporting agriculture and encouraging investment and the development of high quality premium food companies which can be world leaders, of which we have some and can have more with a little encouragement, this Finance Bill copperfastens as announced in the budget, the carbon tax on farm diesel, which will have a direct impact on the competitiveness of agriculture and the farming sector.  Without the basic raw material to support our food industry, we will not be able to provide the volume of exports needed.  Members on this side of the House, the other side and among the wider public have stated that the only way we will get out of this recession is to trade our way out of it.  While agriculture is the one sector of the economy that can assist us in trading ourselves out of the mess we are in, the policy has been to dumb down agriculture rather than support and develop it.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">Another area touched on in part by Government in this Finance Bill is that of research and development.  The Government is putting many of its eggs into this basket in terms of its belief that research and development and the smart economy can get us out of the current mess.  There is no doubt that a focused co-ordinated approach can assist us.  The report by Mr. Colm McCarthy questions the Government's investment in research and development, the number of PhDs being produced and the benefit of this to the economy.  While there has been huge investment in research and development during the past ten years or so, one must question the benefit of this to the economy given the lack of figures in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">A number of years ago, my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, and I produced for the Joint Committee on Education and Science a report on science and technology in education, which included a number of detailed and cost effective proposals.  As usual, that report is now gathering dust somewhere.  One of the recommendations was that a specific Oireachtas committee focused on the issue of science, technology and innovation be established to provide a forum which would allow people involved in this area to defend to Members of the Oireachtas how they spend their money and to explain on what they spend it.  Coming from a scientific background, I must question my profession in regard to its lack of business focus.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins and I could probably debate some aspects of that.  It is important that people involved in R&amp;D set down a finish line in terms of their work, in particular in the science and engineering area.  They should not engage in research for research purposes.  While it is important we invest in basic research it is also important that the applied research is focused on an end product and that we have credible data to back it up.  Sadly, however, that is not provided for.  Far too much investment is currently focused on universities driving research, rather than having enough private enterprise involvement focused on having an end product, thus facilitating job creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">Academic researchers should not purely consider the value of intellectual property, which may inhibit its commercialisation.  They should also focus on the impact it can have on stimulating our economy, creating jobs and creating the new multinational companies of tomorrow.  I was disappointed that the Minister did not take up the recommendation by the Commission on Taxation on the flexibility of R&amp;D tax credits from private enterprise.  The State is putting in investment so it is important to justify and explain exactly how that money is being spent and how it will be of benefit in the short, medium and long term.  Private enterprise must also put in its fair share of investment but incentives and structures need to be put in place to facilitate and encourage that to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">I acknowledge the sections that encourage skilled professional people to come into the country.  The Minister has reintroduced a tax treatment concerning foreign professionals coming into Ireland, but it is only scratching the surface.  We will have to examine the matter in a far more detailed and focused manner.  Up to now immigration has been perceived as people coming in and taking jobs.  There is huge concern at the moment about that, but there is huge potential for immigrants to create new jobs here.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">I read a report on Silicon Valley in California, which came about as a result of Asian nationals who moved to the United States and turned that idea into a reality.  Last year, we saw the two young lads from Limerick who came up with a very good idea, but they could not get support from Enterprise Ireland.  They went to Silicon Valley in the United States where they got venture capital support.  That is an indictment of our own development agencies.  These sharp young people could not get investment here, so it was better for them to go abroad.  We should examine novel ways to compete.  We should bring people with ideas into this country instead of putting barriers in their way, which is what we are doing now.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">One practical example of this concerns the granting of permission to a non-EU citizen who wants to set up a business here.  In order to get permission from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, they must have €300,000 in their back pocket and must also employ two EU citizens.  Otherwise they will not meet the criteria for business permission and as a result their application is refused.  According to the latest available figures, some 85% of all such applications were refused.  I do not believe that we should allow anyone and everyone to set up a business in every corner of the country.  However, if someone has an idea with a sound business base it should be granted business permission.  It may only employ one person but it will take that person off the live register and it has a potential in the longer term to create four, five, ten or 12 jobs.  The Government should look at the false barriers of red tape that have been created, which inhibit the creation of new employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">The United States has been the expert front-runner in bringing new people into the economy to create jobs.  In 2006, businesses started by immigrants in the USA employed 450,000 people with a turnover of €52 billion.  That is €2 billion short of what we will pay out for NAMA.  The United States is looking at new ways to attract such smart people because the world has become far more competitive.  A new start-up visa system is being developed for those who wish to establish new enterprises in the United States.  The authorities are looking at automatically granting visas to people who hold PhD qualifications in science, technology and other innovative areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">A number of non-EU citizens are currently paying fees to study for doctoral qualifications here.  They will then have to go cap in hand to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to seek permission to remain in this country.  If they want to start up a business they will have to return to the Department again to seek business permission and guarantee that they have €300,000 as well as creating two jobs.  That environment needs to change quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">We should send out clear and unambiguous information on the type of person we need in Ireland at the moment, as well as the type of supports we want to put in place for them.  Information on labour market trends, job skills shortages and oversupply, as well as social welfare restrictions, is available in various Departments in an array of languages.  However, it should also be available centrally on the web so that someone considering coming to Ireland will know what the structure is like.  In addition, they could know about banking, insurance, the rules of the road and how to get housing.  That could act as an advertisement to attract the type of people we badly need in this economy — those who can stimulate and develop small businesses.  They would bring new thinking and ideas to our economy, which could nurture the new multinationals of the future, in the same way as Kerry Foods, Intel and Wyeth.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">We are not, however, making an effort to cultivate such highly qualified people who have come through our education system and because they do not have an EU passport they are turned away and sent home.  After such a significant investment by them and by our universities, it would make sense to hold on to such people and encourage them to stay here, thus helping to turn around the economy which is in a mess at the moment.  That could provide some direction in assisting us to get the economy off its knees and begin to create jobs.  That is why Fine Gael has set out detailed proposals to put the basic infrastructure in place that is needed in the economy, including water, broadband and energy.  The economy will turn around at some stage, whether in six or 12 months, or two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">It could, however, grind to a halt due to the lack of investment in developing basic infrastructure needed for the new economies of tomorrow.  Energy will be crucial to that.  My colleague, Deputy Coveney, has set out detailed proposals to ensure that Ireland will be a net exporter of energy in the years ahead, by putting in place infrastructure to create 100,000 jobs in the next four years.  We need to have the infrastructure in place in order that we can capitalise on the upturn in the world and European economies.  Sadly we have not seen any direction from Government in that area.  The only thing Government has done is to ridicule the Opposition proposals to try to stimulate the economy and get it up off its knees.  Deputy Bruton has set out in great detail proposals that would support small business by setting up a back-office investment bank that could provide the capital needed to the commercial banks to support businesses that are struggling trying to manage their cash flow.  Surely it makes sense to try to support existing jobs rather than letting them go to the wall.  We were told at the end of last year that the €54 billion going to NAMA, which my children and their children will need to pay back in coming decades, would bring the injection of capital needed into the economy.  We now know that the Minister for Finance had in his back pocket the information from the IMF that totally contradicted that and clearly stated the money would not ensure capital would flow.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">It is disappointing that the Minister has missed a golden opportunity with this Finance Bill, which we shall all regret in the long term.</p>

          <p eId="para_820">As a result of the budget, the Finance Bill and the work the Minister has done in the past year we are going in the right direction in that regard.  We have a very challenging economic situation at present.  This budget will be a significant step in restoring stability to the public finances.  The Minister for Finance was very brave and courageous in taking the steps he took in 2009.  He initially took €5 billion out of the system principally through the pensions levy and a reduction in capital expenditure and then in the budget he made further adjustments of €4 billion.  While such adjustments are difficult for some people, they have been generally accepted.  There is no doubt the people recognise the Minister's courage and, as a result, his profile and that of the Government have improved.  As can be seen from the recent opinion polls, the people believe and have faith in what he did in the budget and as expressed in the Finance Bill before us.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">We are in a very difficult borrowing situation, which is disimproving dramatically.  Gross national product was €154 billion in 2008.  The projection for the end of 2012 is €126 billion.  The wealth of each individual in the country has reduced.  Our standard of living has reduced.  When we entered the EEC, the big talking point was that our income was at 60% of the Community's average.  That increased to approximately 120%.  We are now coming back to 90% to 95% of the EU average.  That appears to be the stable sustainable position over the short to medium term.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">Regarding the debt, there is a reason for expenditure having been cut and the adjustments having to be made.  The country is spending far more than it is taking in.  In 2009 the current expenditure was €45 billion and the total current revenue was €33 billion.  That was a €12 billion balance.  There was also a capital expenditure of nearly €14 billion.  We are €26 billion in the hole since last year.  That needs to be clawed back.  Some of it is what one calls a structural deficit which exists because we — all the people of Ireland — allowed the economy to reach a stage where we were spending so much money because we had a lot of income coming in.  Then suddenly our income reduced drastically.  However, it is not as easy to reduce the expenditure.  There is a structural deficit that needs to be dealt with in coming years.  I understand the intention is that it be dealt with by 2014.</p>

          <p eId="para_824">I would hope that date would be set in stone rather than letting it go on any further.  We owe it to our future generations that we, who gained the benefit of it during the Celtic tiger years, should deal with it in our time and not leave it for the generations of the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">Having said that, the budget makes adjustments of €4 billion.  Union representatives have appeared on television programmes claiming it would reduce demand and would push down growth generally.  That is true to some extent, but because of the work the Minister did and the confidence it gave to the people on a domestic basis, yesterday's KBC Ireland-ESRI consumer sentiment index of the domestic market was higher than it has been in the past two years.  There is that positive sentiment among consumers for spending.  It has been stated that if they do not have the money they will not spend.  We all know the savings ratio has increased dramatically.  People are saving because they do not have the confidence to spend.  Fortunately that is now turning around and that confidence exists.  While we do not want people to spend all of their savings, there is certainly room for a significant amount of it to be spent.  We can see that is working.  New car sales in January have increased compared with the previous year, notwithstanding that for a couple of weeks the weather made it very difficult for anybody to go to a car showroom to buy a new car.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, said that at the weekend he read the newspapers referring to the countries in the eurozone that were basket cases.  It is not too long ago — before the Minister for Finance took the steps he took — that Ireland was included among those cases.  However, now Ireland is not near the situation of Greece, Portugal, Spain or Italy.  As the Minister of State mentioned, Britain has a fairly significant debt-GDP ratio of nearly 70%.  There again there are also significant problems with employment.  Ireland is a small and vulnerable country, but the steps we are taking are getting us out of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">There is also the question of excise duty.  The reduction in beer, whiskey and wine has reduced the consumer price index.  There were significant increases and young people in particular, with disposable income, tend to drink more than others.  It does have an effect, and it did, while at the same time it impacted on people travelling to the North to buy their booze for Christmas.  That happened on 9 December, so there was a double whammy, and that will project itself into 2010 and beyond.  It will be a softener, as far as the reduction in wages is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">I am particularly concerned, however, as regards those with big mortgages, which are out of proportion to their incomes.  Whether it is low, middle or relatively high income there are still mortgages out of all proportion to earnings.  Payments per month because of levies, wage and salary reductions or reduced profits in private industry mean that incomes generally are lower than they were two years ago, while the mortgage payments remain the same.  This is complicated by negative equity and whereas it does not affect the money coming in or going out, emotionally it is a distraught subject.  I believe the action the Minister has taken with regard to the banks, with the code of practice stipulating that they do not take legal action against those in default before an extended period of time, is the correct course as far as people on low and medium incomes are concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan put forward some solutions regarding banks extending the length of loans, making them interest repayable only, among other issues, and I was very sorry to see some commentators in Sunday papers at the weekend indicating that the Government should not help out these people with big mortgages.  They argued, in effect, that since they had got into this position through their own fault, their neighbours should not have to bail them out.  However, that is what this Republic is about, and what being a society is about, where in the best way possible those in difficult circumstances at a particular point should be given a dig-out.</p>

          <p eId="para_832">The Deputy is concerned with the word "competitiveness".  We have had problems with competitiveness, as regards the domestic market, particularly with the fall in demand.  We have also had problems in relation to ordinary manufacturing on the domestic front, outside the foreign-owned multinationals, pharmaceuticals, ICT companies, etc.  Overall, exports only fell by 2.5% in comparison with global trade down by 12.5% but unfortunately, there was a bigger reduction in the indigenous type of industries where we need to improve.  That can only be improved by Ireland being more competitive, with lower labour costs, greater efficiencies and lower prices all around.</p>

          <p eId="para_835">——solicitors and professional people who are not lowering their fees sufficiently.  They will lower them if they are in a very competitive situation.  In fact, they will more than halve them, just to keep somebody else out.  However, that is only in a particular situation.  For those already in position, and where they are comfortable, the fees are not being reduced.  The Competition Authority needs more powers to ensure that all fees are published, including the hourly rates, so that people may see what value is available in the marketplace.  At this point, there is no need for professional firms to reduce their costs and this is deplorable because it is the one centre of costs which can be immediately focused on, and it is restraining cost reductions in many other areas as people say, in effect, "Neither the lawyers nor the accountants are reducing their fees".  We must see some action in relation to that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">From a competitiveness viewpoint, I am pleased to see the exemption from corporation tax for companies in the first three years of business.  That is also available for companies which are commencing operations in 2010.  A member of the Opposition indicated earlier that this should be applied to private individuals.  However, it is only for corporation tax, so that PAYE directors who take a salary out of the company will pay tax on that and do not get an exemption.  In the same way, if a profit is made by a sole trader, he or she pays tax on the income taken out of the business.  If an individual wants to avail of this and provided there is sufficient income in the business, then it is not difficult to register a company and get it going.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">The Minister has introduced a  certain fairness to the tax system in relation to the high earners, that was not there previously.  The provision regarding the sum of €200,000 is something of a sop to some members of the Labour Party, if Deputy Higgins does not mind me saying so.  I cannot see the amount that will be got from that as being very significant, but it is fair, nonetheless, and a start in the right direction.  The people this might apply to——</p>

          <p eId="para_840">——can move around very quickly.  One commentator said there is no aggregation of assets between a husband and wife, so if it is a question of a €6 million house in the name of the wife, then it would not apply to the husband since it is all being done on an individual rather than an aggregated basis.  Hopefully, that is not the case.  It can be adjusted if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">The whole idea of companies buying back their shares in order to increase the share price so that the individuals who hold them can make money through capital gains and pay a lower rate of tax than the dividends which would otherwise be payable is an excellent move.  There was an article in a newspaper on Sunday about €400 million being avoided in relation to the capital gains tax on gilts futures contracts, government securities.  There were two transactions in question, one where a gain was made, and a corresponding loss was then made.  On the gain there was no tax because it related to government securities, but the loss could have been applied to other profits for capital gains tax purposes.  I would like to know whether that occurred.  I realise capital gains tax avoidance provisions are in place now, but were they not in place earlier?  Was that article correct?</p>
          <p eId="para_842">This budget has certain initiatives which will improve by a quantum leap the business in the International Financial Services Centre.  Effectively, there are three items of note, including matters related to Islamic finance and principles of Islam under sharia law, which are to be applied to finance.  The way in which this will improve the amount of business transacted is noteworthy.  I understand in the Middle East financial institutions are looking to set up staging posts in Europe at the moment and Ireland could be a good place for such a set up.  There is great potential in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">I refer to the UCITS, undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities, to which the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, referred earlier.  There will be clarity now as far as the taxation of funds managed by UCITS managing agents are concerned.  If a non-resident fund is domiciled in Germany but managed in Ireland, no tax will be applied in Ireland.  This is clear and allows the Irish management company to offer its services throughout the EU.  Deputy Naughten referred to the remittance basis for income earned by individuals seeking highly skilled, value added individuals who could set up here, possibly in the area of sharia finance or the UCITS management business.  The fact that such people may operate now, even if only on a remittance basis for one year, is commendable.  All in all, this is brilliant work by a brilliant Minister for Finance and I commend it to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_381">
          <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_844">I wish to share time with Deputy Arthur Morgan.  I listened with great care to the speeches made.  There are some points with which I find myself in agreement.  In the course of the ten minutes available to me, I wish to put some fundamental questions about what is under discussion in this Bill.  In the past week there has been a considerable debate about what we discuss in the House and how effectively we can discuss it.  In this Finance Bill there is a great inability to face up to some fundamentals of political economy.  At the risk of future political consequences, I might as well state that at this hour of the night, one will not find many of the media interested in what we have to say about the economy.  I find a great limitation in what I hear in respect of the problems in place now.  I have spent a great deal of my life as an academic but as such, one is neither deaf nor blind to what is taking place in one's constituency.  This week in my constituency some 175 people in Boston Scientific lost their jobs.  Whether one has been a lecturer, professor or a teacher, one understands what it is like for people to go home and say that they have received notice that they are to lose their jobs.  What I find rather strange in the analysis taking place is how little political economy is present in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">I will outline some the questions one might put although I realise I have a very limited amount of time in which to speak.  Do we accept that the model of the economy that has been in place for a period has been a significant failure?  If one does not examine the matter in a sharp sense, taking its parts bit by bit, one ends up with rather general statements.  I agree with some of the points made by Deputy Ardagh, but the term he used was "We" were involved in this great excess which brought us to the point at which our expenditure vastly outstripped our income, based on a speculative bubble in the property market.  The fact is the use of "We" is disguising a truth.  Not everyone built dozens of townhouses in bogs in north Leinster.  Not everyone shared in all of this expenditure of a lavish nature which took place.  Not everyone was accommodated personally without collateral by the banks.  After this traumatic week, let us decide in the interests of truth that we will not use the term "We" unless we specify to whom the "We" refers.  However, we may use the term "We" to say that we must all pay for this now.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">There was a tendentious speech given in the previous matter under discussion today that suggested the percentage paid by higher civil servants was in some way a greater sacrifice than that of people we drove practically below the poverty line at clerical officer level in the public service.  This is a great nonsense.  The question of where one stands in this regard was put by one Deputy.  I can inform the Deputy very straightforwardly where I stand on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">There is good and informed political and economic opinion, including from such people as Joseph Stiglitz of the World Bank, which holds that the model was disastrous.  There are things which cannot and should not be supplied in a republic. In respect of the security of citizens, the market cannot supply a guarantee of basic decency and a floor below which no one should be allow to fall.  If one doe not accept this, one finds oneself paying for tax concessions for a minority, while reducing the income of the disabled, the poor, widows and so forth.  In addition, the Christmas bonus was taken off people.  Upon examination, one finds the tax concessions given to a very narrow group of people would have paid for all of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">Now, let us stop the nonsense.  This is an immense political and ideological point.  I refer to getting out of the bind we are in.  The one truth coming through from every Deputy and on every side is that the greatest problem we face is unemployment.  Reference has been made to the loss of jobs, the threat to jobs and the havoc and poverty this creates.  However, there is a great distance between the language and the reality.  For example, I refer to the matter of returning to education.  It is mere idle rhetoric to state we are encouraging people in the construction industry, especially male unemployed people, to get back to education.  The tests in place for jobseeker's allowance are prohibitive and one must claim for a particular length of time to qualify for the back to education allowance, but we disqualify people right, left and centre.  The week before last, an electrician came to see me at my advice centre who was disqualified.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">I refer to an example of getting back to education.  Let us suppose one was on an access course.  In certain circumstances one must qualify twice.  On must be deemed a jobseeker but also, because of the criteria of certain institutions, one must qualify for a maintenance grant which is means tested.  The people going back to such colleges have been told they will not be paid the maintenance grant which is, in fact, a major breach of trust.  It is absolutely disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">I would rather dwell on the more positive things that could have been part of an imaginative Bill.  One helpful development would be the acceptance that this model has failed.  Throughout the world people are considering the proposition.  Let us consider the economy overseen by Mr. Obama.  They are considering a second round of stimulus.  This is what Joseph Stiglitz has advised for the Obama Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">Where is the stimulus here?  I attended Farmleigh and wanted to be positive, as I am, but I must ask where the supports are for the creative economy that could have generated so many jobs in film, design, digital media and music.  I know this area well.  When Ireland had the second highest incomes in the world, it had the second lowest level of social protection.  One could have incorporated all the caring jobs into the economy, the caring economy.  In the green economy, about which we hear so much, we do not see the jobs in terms of technological application.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">Consider the use of loose language and the notion of competitiveness, about which many are speaking.  I agree with Deputy Ardagh on one point, that is, on the cost of services.  He is correct.  However, there is a secret agenda such that competitiveness is being used as a cover for driving down wages.  If one wants to be a real economist, one should show me, in respect of export costs, the contribution of escalated wage costs.  When this occurs, we can talk about what is real.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">Competitiveness is being used as a cover to try to mount a campaign to reduce the minimum wage and get people to accept that miserable 1930s philosophy that one should be willing to come out of the house for anything one is offered simply in order to get out of the house.  This thinking is widespread and people are using the present economic conditions as an excuse and cover for other regressive attitudes.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">It is not only in the property bubble that the magnus of market thinking destroyed things.  It made its way into the universities.  I know much about these because I worked in them for 18 years.  There is no need to make a choice between fundamental research and short-term applications through technology because one can do both.  There are areas in which Ireland is a world leader, as emerged at Farmleigh.  I refer to immunology, nutrient research and other areas.  Ireland was full of opportunities but one found people who were looking for short-term yields from fine places of scholarship and asking them what they could develop in five years.  Anybody who knows anything about medical research knows that it takes more than a decade before one can develop a particular product.  We put at risk our third level institutions by short-term thinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">The Minister for Education and Science referred, at a time when we are to produce tens of thousands of unemployed graduates with disappointed expectations, to the brand that was accepted all over the world, that of the National University of Ireland, NUI.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, referred to the Royal College of Surgeons.  If he respects the Royal College of Surgeons, why does his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, want to dump the NUI brand that is accepted all over the world?  It is not that we are experiencing some great trauma this particular week in the absence of some technical expertise, it is that we are not doing real economics.  That is what we need in the Finance Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_382">
          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_856">I thank Deputy Higgins and the Labour Party for sharing time.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">This Bill does not provide the mechanism necessary to lift us out of this economic recession.  The Government is failing completely to put in place a stimulus package and to incentivise economic enterprise and those entrepreneurs who are vital to getting us back on a constructive course.  The Government has been pursuing the same policy for two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">Deputy Ardagh, whom I hope I am not misquoting, stated the people of Ireland overspent.  He stated this was the big problem.  If so, it is the fault of the people of Ireland that we are in this economic mess and experiencing this catastrophe.  If Deputy Ardagh or anybody else really believes this, he should not be here.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">People did, of course, overspend but they were following Government policy, which not only allowed them but actively encouraged them to do so.  The Government looked the other way when banks were giving 100% and 120% mortgages.  My colleague and Deputy Ó Caoláin, in particular, called on the Government over three years ago to cap mortgages at 90% or, at an absolute maximum, 95%.  This would at least have cooled the market to some degree.  It did not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Where was the financial regulator to address the question of the salary-loan ratio?  The regulator looked the other way and allowed the mess to continue.  One cannot blame the people, therefore, for getting into this mad rat-race or crazy economic race that took place over the best part of the past decade.  Government policy was looking in the wrong direction, as the Government is doing now through this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">To understand what I mean by "the wrong direction", one must ask who the Government is targeting.  Special needs assistants comprise one group.  Although there are many others, I mention them in particular because I have had an avalanche of representations in my constituency offices from them.  I have no doubt but that other Deputies also had significant numbers of representations.  I hope these Deputies feel as bad and helpless about the issue as I do.  Parents, and in some cases single parents, explained to me the huge disability of their children and how those children were getting on so well because of the special needs assistants and the excellent care and love and attention they were receiving, yet they are the victims of the Government's policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">There are other categories of people affected, as we see from the slashing of the social welfare payments to swathes of people.  One should compare this policy with that of cutting the wages of high-income earners by only a fraction, as discussed in the Fine Gael motion on Private Members' business, which I totally support.  The mantra stated regularly by the Government that it is targeting those who can pay and leaving alone those who cannot afford to pay is untrue.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">The Government's taxation policy is crazy.  Through the boom years, the Government was totally dependent on consumption taxes, such as stamp duty and VAT.  The over-dependence on consumption taxes was completely unsustainable because the taxes were indirect and therefore completely unreliable in terms of generating an income stream for the Exchequer.  As a consequence, when the economy began to turn, the Government was caught, a bit like the emperor with no clothes.  It was completely exposed to huge risk.  There is still insufficient capacity to pursue a proper and fair taxation system.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">Every Government decision in the past three years has compounded the damage already done.  One concerns the bank guarantee scheme of September 2008, worth €440 billion.  It was implemented without putting proper terms and conditions in place.  The decision to guarantee the banks was bad enough on its own but the failure to have proper terms and conditions meant that it was ludicrous.  The decision to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank was crazy.  Why would one do this?  It was done because the bank is known as the Fianna Fáil bank.  This is the name it had about town.  We need not waste time this evening elaborating on this.  Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland were recapitalised when they should have been nationalised.  A proper State bank should have been put in their place.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">The most recent flawed decision by the Government concerns NAMA.  NAMA was supposed to be about ensuring a proper finance stream and credit stream for small and medium enterprises.  I am delighted that <i>The Irish Times</i> revealed the truth yesterday.  I congratulate it on obtaining Government documents through a freedom of information request that exposed the lie that the Government told the House.  It totally misled the House when told by the IMF that NAMA would have no input on lending.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_866">It is ironic to talk of social deprivation in my constituency following the Second Stage debate on a finance Bill introduced by a Government that sees no problem in dedicating billions of euro to the broken Irish banking system which, at the same time, cannot give a single euro to a plan it has been committed to for over two and a half years.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">The Limerick regeneration project has ground to a halt because there is no capital from the Government.  The Minister of State is familiar with the project.  It affects areas of Limerick that historically have been bedevilled by crime and social deprivation and which have a very poor housing stock.  Morale was raised and confidence given to the 2,300 families that live in these areas when Mr. John Fitzgerald brought forward his report to regenerate these areas in the city for which he had cross-party support.  All the Deputies contributing here tonight have supported the programme, and there was a sense of excitement throughout the city.  New hope was given to families in these areas.  Staff came in, led by Mr. Brendan Kenny, and things were moving along.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">Obviously, the slump had an effect.  The money which was supposed to come from private investors did not materialise but there was nothing new about that.  However, the money which was supposed to come from the Government was expected, and the tap was suddenly turned off this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">The Minister's Government and his colleagues in Cabinet have said that €25 million is being given to Limerick.  In terms of the breakdown of that, approximately €7 million is for the wages and salaries of the staff of the regeneration agencies; some seed capital is being provided to support social programmes which are under way; and the other €17 million or so is being given to Limerick City Council for the purchase of houses in the city suburbs to be used for social housing purposes.  That €17 million is in line with the kind of allocations every local authority is getting for their housing programme either to build or to purchase and has nothing to do with the regeneration of the city.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">We are at the stage now where the position is worse than it was before the regeneration agencies commenced their work.  Nearly 400 houses have been demolished and not a single brick will be laid or a single sod turned in 2010 to provide a house for a single family who have invested their futures in the commitment made by the local Minister, Deputy O'Dea, his Cabinet colleagues, and particularly by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">This is a disgraceful abandonment of families living in the most deprived areas of the city.  These are decent families who are sending their children to school and doing their best but needing the strong hand of the Government to lift them back to the standard of housing and standard of living expected in this day and age.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">I cannot understand how a Government could turn off the tap completely in terms of funding.  It would be reasonable to say that in times of scarce resources the programmes should be done over 12 years rather than ten years or that the regeneration should be stretched to a 15 year period but to turn the tap off completely so that nothing is happening this year, and the regeneration staff effectively having no continuing work to occupy them in 2010, is appalling.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">I have two suggestions.  First, the Minister of State should ask the senior Minister to provide approximately €50 million this year to ensure that some of the housing projects that are ready to go can be given the go-ahead.  If there was building activity with a prospect of houses in 15 months' time, confidence will be restored.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">Second, the governance structure of the agencies is very poor.  There are two agencies.  They should be amalgamated, given a stronger legal base and the power to negotiate public private partnerships with the private sector, and allowed borrow money.  If that is done the gap left by the Government could be filled by other means but it cannot be done currently because of the weak legal structure of the agencies.  If the Minister examines that he would see it is a cost-free way of proceeding.</p>

        <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_384">
          <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_875">There is a deep sense of betrayal in the regeneration communities in Limerick since the quotations from the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, on the front of <i>The Irish Times</i> on Saturday became public knowledge.  I have had an opportunity to talk to people in those areas and there is a huge sense of despair.  People’s hopes were raised.  Their hopes were raised previously in those areas but they were greatly raised in the context of the regeneration plans.  Those of us who thought those plans looked a little too ambitious asked if it was wise to knock down all of the houses in Moyross and Carew Park.  We raised a number of other concerns at the time but were basically told to shut up and that money was no object.  We were told to stop raising questions because the plans would solve the problems of these areas, and people should go along with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">Since the weekend I have spoken to one of the community leaders who had put her head above the parapet and given up her time to go to meeting after meeting.  She was being told constantly that this regeneration would happen and that the Government said that money would not be a problem.  Even though the people might think they could not change their areas to the extent they said they would change them, they were told it would happen.  That woman has to go back to her neighbours and try to explain that she was not leading them by the nose but that it was the Government that led them astray.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">I lay much of the blame squarely on the back of the Minister, Deputy O'Dea.  There is always somewhere over the rainbow whenever we get bad news from the Minister.  When the Dell job losses were announced we heard approximately 700 jobs would be coming from some fictional company that never materialised.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">Even when the Minister announced on Saturday that the State could not deliver the €1.7 billion for Limerick regeneration, he talked about some builders investing a couple of hundred million euro.  I do not know who they are or from where they are getting the couple of hundred million euro.  In the context of the budget, the refinancing of the banks and the financial fiasco in this country I do not know who will lend them the couple of hundred million euro but the Minister cannot resist presenting these guys riding in on horses on the brow of the hill ready to jump in and solve the problem when what we need is Government commitment to building.  We do not want a commitment to knock down buildings or buy houses in the county or wherever but to rebuild these communities.  They are worse off now than they were before all this started because of the anti-social problems and the rats associated with empty houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">We must be honest about this.  We have got to see a practical response from Government.  We must see houses built in these areas.  A number of senior citizens projects are planned.  I would like to hear from the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, and receive a guarantee that funding will be made available for those projects this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">There are other infrastructural projects, such as a railway station in Moyross and a link road to Limerick Institute of Technology.  There are similar projects in other areas, including an all-weather pitch in the St. Mary's Park area.  These are the kind of projects that will make life better for people.  It is most unfair to people who hoped they would be able to raise their kids or see out their elderly years in a better environment to hear on the national airwaves and read in the national newspapers that the money is not forthcoming.  We need honesty and for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to visit Limerick to explain what can be feasibly delivered in the affected areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">If people are going to get the information filtered through the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, they are not going to get the truth because he cannot resist fiction.  I apologise for attacking the Minister in such a way but one must appreciate that he will present any picture if he believes it will deliver votes.  That is not what the communities affected need.  They need all parties working together to bring about the regeneration project.  All Members from Limerick, including the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, are willing to work together on these issues.  We do not need some guy riding out pretending he is doing the whole thing himself.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">I feel very strongly that the people in these estates have been let down.  We need a proper and complete Government response led by the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Michael Finneran, not fiction.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_385">
          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_883">Apart from unemployment, the Limerick regeneration project is the single most important issue for the city.  When the regeneration project was launched by the Government more than two years ago, it was such a priority and of such importance that it came under Cabinet responsibility.  Now confusion reigns in the media.  Last week, we were told the €25 million allocated for next year was provisional and more would follow.  On Saturday, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, the only Cabinet member in Limerick and the mid-west, said in the national newspapers the project would be stalled unless non-State funding outside of the €25 million could be secured.  This compounded the lack of morale among the people living in the regeneration areas, Moyross, Southill, St. Mary's Park and Ballinacurra Weston.  They have lost faith in the project believing it lacks credibility and is being repeatedly stalled.  Action and a firm commitment from the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, is needed.  As the Cabinet has responsibility for this project, the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, need to visit the regeneration areas where up to 400 houses have been knocked but not one replaced.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">When the project was originally launched with much fanfare by the President, Mary McAleese, on behalf of the Government, those living in the areas had high hopes.  The Government must live up to its commitment and provide the funding.  No one expected the project to happen overnight as it was set down as a ten-year project.  The Government's claim, therefore, that it cannot afford the €1.7 billion required does not ring true.  Projects need to be started in each of the regeneration areas.  Many elderly people in the regeneration areas, for example, have put their life savings into buying out their houses.  Now, they do not know where they stand.  One week they are told their houses will be purchased and the next week they are told the houses beside them will be knocked.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">The Denis Brosnan taskforce established for the mid-west stated one headline project it wanted to see fast-tracked was the regeneration project.  Not only has it a social dimension, it has enormous employment potential for up to 4,000 people.  Limerick has a higher unemployment rate than the national average; the regeneration areas' rate is five times higher at 70%.  Plans are to be submitted at the end of March and many feel the Government is just putting off this.  A firm commitment that the Government will provide funding for the project in 2010 and its subsequent years must be made.  When the Cabinet took responsibility for the regeneration project, it was assumed the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, would have a major influence in advancing the project.  I accept there is a need for private investment but it cannot be expected to be made unless there is a commitment from the State.  The Government is reneging on the project and we will not allow this to happen.  We want positive news from the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, tonight that capital funding for the project will be provided for it to get under way.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
          <p eId="para_886">I thank the Deputies for raising this item and their ongoing interest in this important issue.  Limerick regeneration is an issue with which I am intimately acquainted, not just because of my office, but because of the extent to which my colleagues, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, have acted as powerful advocates for the programme since its inception.  In their engagements with me and the Government, both Ministers have provided strong voices for the communities in the regeneration areas and have ensured the regeneration programme remains a top priority for the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">Many families in Limerick city are working to build better lives for themselves, to overcome the disadvantages of social segregation and barriers to education and other services.  These are the people that I, as Minister of State with responsibility for housing and local services, am committed to helping through the Limerick regeneration programme.  I am glad to have the opportunity tonight to reiterate the Government's commitment to those families and the communities of Moyross, Southill, St. Mary's Park and Ballinacurra Weston.  The Government has maintained the impetus around this regeneration project over the past three years despite the challenges of the changing economic environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">With the active support of both Ministers, Deputies Willie O'Dea and Peter Power, the Government commissioned the Fitzgerald report to examine how the lives of people living in these severely disadvantaged communities could be improved.  The Government took that report and drove the implementation of its recommendations, not least through the establishment of dedicated agencies to lead the delivery on the regeneration project.  As recently as last December the Government also endorsed the vision for that ten-year regeneration and requested the detailed, costed plans for the first phase of the project's implementation by the end of the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">Delivering a successful regeneration project that aims to remedy a long legacy of neglect and decline is not easy and not achievable overnight.  It is not about placing a Band-Aid solution on the problem by simply providing new housing to communities in crisis.  We already know that such an approach does not build sustainable regenerated communities.  Rather, a successful regeneration requires an holistic approach that seeks to address the underlying causes of the social, economic and educational disadvantage that characterises these communities.  It means we must take a whole of Government approach to the regeneration in Limerick to ensure the social and educational supports are available, while at the same time improving the built environment of the areas.  It means that private sector investment must be secured to break the cycle of social isolation and encourage a mix of housing tenures in these areas.  Mobilising private sector involvement is also essential in creating employment opportunities for these communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">This whole of Government approach is at the centre of our work on the regeneration project, with relevant Departments, State agencies and local authorities represented on the boards of the Limerick regeneration agencies.  My Department has also taken the lead on a high-level initiative involving the Secretaries General of key Departments and agencies involved in the social regeneration of the areas to ensure necessary decisions can be taken quickly, with the outcomes channelled into the overall implementation plans for the project.  In addition, the Cabinet committee on social inclusion is regularly updated with progress on these cross-sectoral issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">Since their establishment, the regeneration agencies have developed the strategic framework and vision for the regeneration while simultaneously delivering on an ambitious programme for the stabilisation of the areas.  Despite the significant constraints on public finances in recent years, the Government provided in excess of €50 million for that stabilisation programme in the two and a half years to the end of 2009.  Working with Limerick City Council, this funding has supported a planned programme of demolitions to address anti-social behaviour and to facilitate site clearances for future construction.  It has provided for a programme of appropriate relocation of households, in accordance with locally agreed housing protocols, and it has seen a considerable improvement in the community infrastructure through closed circuit television installations, estate clean-ups, and new community supports and facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">In terms of our whole of Government approach to the regeneration, the past two years have seen significant additional investment from other Departments and agencies.  As part of the broader stabilisation initiatives and to garner community support for the regeneration, 80 additional Garda personnel have been assigned to the city and a range of specialist supporting Garda resources have been deployed.  Co-ordinated education programmes and special education initiatives have been developed for the regeneration areas.  New targeted community-based initiatives are being provided in the areas of health, children, youth and family support, sport, employment and training to combat the effects of social exclusion.  Many of these have been developed and supported with co-funded investment from the relevant Departments, local authorities, the HSE, FÁS and other key stakeholders.  For 2010, I have increased my Department's annual provision for Limerick regeneration to €25 million to maintain the impetus around the regeneration programme and to continue to support these important initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">While much attention to date has been focused on demolition and other essential works associated with the preparation of the areas for physical regeneration, the agencies and Limerick City Council acknowledge the importance of progressing new-build projects at this stage in the process.  In that context, I want to confirm to the House the Government's commitment to facilitating such new build projects within the overall resources available for 2010.  In fact, work has been progressing over the past year on the detailed planning and design of two housing projects which will provide up to 100 new homes, primarily for older people living in the Moyross and Ballinacurra Weston areas, with a view to advancing the projects to tender stage in 2010.  Design work will also progress this year on two further projects for Southill and St. Mary's Park.  All these projects provide tangible evidence that work is well under way to move the programme forward and to start building on the solid foundations that have been laid by the essential demolition and other preparatory works undertaken over the past two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">Once again, I emphasise the importance of an holistic whole of Government approach in delivering successfully on regeneration.  Regeneration is all about balancing the social and educational needs of communities with employment opportunities, all in a high quality built environment.  New houses for socially disadvantaged families do not, on their own, build sustainable communities, any more than delivering community supports with no employment opportunities will do.  Our challenge for the regeneration in Limerick city is to deliver an enduring, sustainable, high-quality outcome incorporating the crucial social, physical and economic ingredients.  That is why we have spent the time building a strong foundation for the regeneration in Limerick.  We have invested in clearing sites that will be ready for public and private sector construction projects.  We have invested in social, community and educational supports to empower and support the communities of these areas.  We have mobilised a public sector network that is committed to supporting the next steps.  With this foundation in place, we are now ready to start building these new regenerated communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">As I mentioned earlier, the Government has requested that the Limerick regeneration agencies prepare detailed fully costed plans for the first phase of the implementation of the regeneration project in Limerick by the end of the first quarter of this year.  The agencies, with expert advice from the National Building Agency and in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, are working intensively to arrive at a prioritised plan that will provide us with a roadmap for the social, physical, and economic regeneration of these communities for the next three to five years.  To do this, the agencies have been charged with determining the intended mix of refurbishment and new build and the projected costs having regard to the better values now available in the economy generally.  In doing this, they will be informed by the wider strategic planning environment and a full consideration of potential private sector funding mechanisms.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">Notwithstanding the current limitations on the availability of public funds, I extend a guarantee to the House that the Government will once again step up to the mark for the regeneration project in Limerick in a full review of how Government resources can best be deployed to deliver this crucial first phase.  Across Government, there is a wide range of investment programmes from which funding can be channelled to meet specific actions under the first phase plans.  We are committed to establishing the appropriate mechanisms for doing this and to ensuring the necessary support is available to invest in Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">Once again, I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue.  The need to regenerate these areas goes beyond party divides and local differences.  We must work together to ensure this regeneration project is a success, but to do that our approach must be both considered and ambitious.  We have spent two and a half years building a strong foundation for the regeneration of these communities.  We have provided the investment necessary to do this, and a further €25 million has been set aside this year from my Department alone.  I look forward to again visiting the regeneration areas shortly to see the work under way and to discuss the programme for the year ahead.  The Government is determined to break the cycle of disadvantage in Moyross, Southill, St. Mary's Park and Ballinacurra Weston.  It is only then that we will be able to look back on the regeneration programme and say we used the opportunity it presented to make a real and lasting difference.  I am very committed and I hope to visit Limerick shortly to meet the different stakeholders in this matter.</p>

        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_387">
          <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_898">The issue of chemical P or phosphates has arisen mainly where stock are out-wintered and in that situation the plan, as prepared on the eREP system, does not satisfy the checks and balances system used by the Department.  Apparently, in the Department's checks, for instance, C should equal A minus B, but in eREPS, with all stock out-wintered, C should not equal A versus B.  The relevant P deduction is done in another way.  That is leading to much confusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">In REPS 4, all plans were prepared on the e-REPS system, a computerised system run by Teagasc and the Agricultural Consultants Association.  I am sure the Department had an input as the system had to meet the REPS specifications.  If the system is wrong, why has the Minister not checked it out and demanded that it be rectified rather than rejecting individual plans?  Why has he not called in the planners and explained the alleged deficiencies, if there are any?  Why do these issues only arise when payments are due?  Plans were all submitted prior to 15 May 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">The administration of REPS 4 is also a major issue.  The requirement that all plans had to be submitted by 15 May was a nightmare for planners and farmers.  That put unreal pressure on planners and Department staff with the result that bundles of plans were submitted together and the Department did not check these out for perhaps six months.  Previous plans were submitted throughout the year and were checked within a week or so of being submitted and any issues were quickly sorted out.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">Likewise with inspections, apparently the Department must carry out all inspections before dealing with any problems encountered with the result that following an inspection in June, the farmer may not be written to until December or January.  It is understandable that REPS 4 must meet the requirements of the nitrates directive but why can the Minister not sit down with the planners and Teagasc and work out this issue?  It is not rocket science.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">The Department staff at local level are very helpful and do their best to sort out the issue but their hands are tied by the administrative requirements imposed on them by their superiors — I found this from my experience of dealing with them.  Surely, it should be possible to find a better way to administer this system.  Brussels is sometimes blamed but if Brussels imposes unworkable requirements, surely it should be possible to go back to it to rectify and simplify them.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">To return to chemical P, in e-REPS when dealing with organic and chemical P, if the stock are out-wintered, the planner ticks a box and then the P fraction is deducted automatically from the amount of P the planner has recommended based on table 3, page 34, of the specs, with which the Minister is no doubt  familiar.  What adds to the confusion is that the planner's full recommendation appears at column 6 of table 1.10.  The total in column 7 is not equal to column 4 times column 6 but has been reduced for this fraction and also for the concentrates fed.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">To further add to the confusion in making this deduction, the fraction about which I speak is divided by the total forage area whereas the P in the concentrates feed seems to be divided only by the areas that are soil tested and for which a chemical P allowance is recommended.  If the stock is not out-wintered, the planner does not tick the said box and then the 18/52 P is not deducted at table 1.10 but is deducted when the planner allocates the slurry.  The slurry is adjusted to give the same fraction of total P produced — for example, it is 18 weeks in County Kerry — irrespective of how long the stock are housed for.  It is highly technical but can be resolved if the Minister sits down with these people or if he comes to County Kerry to meet the planners.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">Even when REPS plans have been completed, are perfect and have been cleared, there is no district superintendent in County Kerry, north or south, to sign off on the applications.  I understand this is happening throughout the country and that there are vacancies across the agricultural and environmental sector which are not being filled.  It is holding up the whole REPS programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">In the case of County Kerry, apart from resolving the chemical P problem, I appeal to the Minister to appoint a district superintendent as soon as possible in order that these plans can be cleared because there is much dependency, as he will probably tell me, on REPS in County Kerry for farm income.</p>

          <p eId="para_909">Gan amhras tá roinnt athruithe ó shin i leith.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">I wish to clarify the situation in regard to REPS 4 plans on which queries have arisen that have to do with nutrient management planning and, in particular, with levels of chemical phosphorus.  The plans in question were produced using the e-REPS system.  This is an electronic system which was developed and funded by my Department to facilitate planners in producing agri-environmental plans to the specification of REPS.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">Some 2,000 cases with apparent issues in this regard were identified during the stringent administrative checks which were carried out by the Department as required under EU regulations.  All of these farmers are being written to and will be given the opportunity to either confirm the accuracy of their nutrient management plan or to submit an adjusted plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">I am well aware of the importance of REPS payments to farmers and farm family incomes, especially at this difficult time, as emphasised by Deputy Deenihan.  However, the Department must operate in the context of strict EU regulations and these issues must be resolved before payment can be made.  Amended plans will be processed for payment without delay.  I assure the House that the Department will process these responses as a matter of priority in order that payment can issue to the farmers concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">In the past week, Department officials have re-examined a number of the files where issues had arisen.  This exercise confirmed that in all cases but one, the apparent error was not caused by any deficiency in the e-REPS programme.  The exception in the sample drawn was the result of a clerical error by an official and this has been corrected.  Based on the examination carried out, the Department is satisfied that the problem has not arisen as a result of a systems failure in e-REPS and that if the instructions for using e-REPS had been followed strictly, the problems would not have arisen.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">The e-REPS system is a complex one, as Deputy Deenihan stated, especially in so far as nutrient planning is concerned, and to assist planners and ensure that problems do not arise again, work is under way on the system to provide additional navigational aids to planners.  This work will be completed shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">Payments for the 2009 REPS 4 commenced on 18 December 2009 and continue to issue on a weekly basis.  To date, 9,823 REPS 4 participants have been paid in full.  A further 6,799 have received the first phase of 75% of their payments and are due to receive the balancing payment of 25% shortly.  Payments will go out this week to a further 800 applicants.  I am committed to completing all payments as soon as possible, including those which are the subject of query in regard to chemical phosphorus levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">The current delays in a number of cases should not in any way detract from the merits of REPS.  The scheme has been one of the most successful operated by the Department since its launch in 1994.  It has delivered multiple benefits to the environment in terms of water quality, biodiversity, conservation and landscape enhancement.  It has also brought welcome income benefits to farmers with more than €343 million paid out to REPS participants last year and a total of more than €2 billion paid since 1994.  In fact, payments in 2009 reached their highest level ever.  The original allocation for last year was just €330 million but additional funds were provided in December last and approved by Dáil Éireann by way of a Supplementary Estimate.  Payments due to REPS farmers this year will continue at this high level.  Notwithstanding the Government's decision to close REPS to new entrants in July last year, which was unavoidable given the state of the public finances, those farmers who are already in REPS will see out their five year contracts.  This means that there will still be farmers in REPS right up to the end of 2014.  By the time the scheme finally comes to an end, payments to farmers will have exceeded €3 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">It is worth noting that on 20 January the Rural Development Management Committee of the European Commission agreed to an amendment to Ireland's rural development programme.  Part of this amendment included proposals for a new agri-environment scheme.  This scheme will be partly funded by the EU but will also get very substantial support from the Irish Exchequer.  The new scheme will focus on the priority areas of biodiversity, water management and climate change.  It will consist of a menu of actions from which farmers can select those that complement the environmental profiles of their farms.  The shape of the new scheme reflects the increasing emphasis at European Union level on having schemes that deliver clearly identifiable and measurable benefits to the environment.  Details of the new scheme are being finalised within the Department and the intention is to launch it once the formal approval of the European Commission has been received.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">Tomorrow I have arranged to meet some of the senior officials who are dealing with REPS who are coming from Wexford.  We will address the issues and questions raised by the Deputy in greater detail at that time.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_935">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that my Department received a statutory lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 16 September, 2009 claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from July 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">Given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for 2009 of 77,001. This figure exceeds the claims lodged for 2008 (40,607) by 90% and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.  Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include:</p>
            <p eId="para_937">the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the Redundancy Payments Section in terms of full time equivalents is 52.5;</p>
            <p eId="para_938">the prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</p>
            <p eId="para_939">the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments;</p>
            <p eId="para_940">The provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;</p>
            <p eId="para_941">Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">The Tánaiste and I are monitoring closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and it is clear that additional measures are required to help reduce the backlog of claims which currently stands in excess of 40,000.  The Department is currently actively engaged in efforts to secure up to 16 additional staff resources deployed to the area in the first quarter of 2010.</p>

For this type of electrical equipment there is an obligation on the Department and other employers to ensure that any such equipment, which is exposed to conditions likely to cause deterioration and consequent danger, undergoes a visual check by the user/employee and is periodically inspected by a person competent to assess the ongoing safety of the equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224">Not all portable electrical equipment used at a workplace requires a test certificate according to the Health &amp; Safety Authority.   In cases where the equipment is subject to conditions causing deterioration then the equipment and associated leads and plug tops must be tested and certified  by a person competent to carry out such tests. If the certificate issued by the competent person indicates that the equipment is unsafe to use, then that equipment must not be used until it has been made compliant and has been certified as such.</p>

It is the policy of my Department to ensure that a competent person carries out inspections on any portable equipment used by relevant staff in the Department and the Offices of the Department following a visual check by a staff member who may have concerns on safety grounds or following a Risk Assessment and any such equipment is not used by staff of the Department until it has been certified as safe to use by the competent person.</p>

I note that this is confirmed by a 2003 report on the implementation of the Directive undertaken by the European Commission's services.  Clause 5.3 of the Framework Agreement is not a mandatory provision.  It requires that, as far as possible, an employer should give consideration to a request by workers to transfer from full-time work to part-time and vice-versa.  Ireland has, accordingly, met its responsibilities in relation to transposition of this clause of the Framework Agreement by way of a Code of Practice implemented under Section 13 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_1233">The Labour Relations Commission prepared a code of practice, based on the provisions in Section 13 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001, following consultation with the social partners.

Under Section 42(4) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990, the code is admissible in evidence in any proceedings before a court, the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Equality tribunal.</p>

            <p eId="para_1235">The industrial dispute involving workers from the company in question resulted from workers' concerns over the company's cost cutting proposals, involving redundancies and the introduction of new contracts of employment for the remaining workforce.  The issues were referred to the Labour Court under section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1969 and the union undertook to be bound by the Court's recommendation. The Labour Court hearing took place on the 28th September, 2009. The company did not attend the Court hearing, but provided a written statement setting out its position on the matters in dispute.  The Labour Court issued its recommendation on 12 October 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">The Labour Court recommended that the company should pay redundancy terms of 6 weeks pay per year of service, inclusive of statutory entitlement. Any outstanding issues that could not be agreed between the parties, including the issue of selection criteria for redundancy, should be referred to an Arbitrator for final decision.  I understand that the company agreed to accept the Labour Court Recommendation.  Subsequently, a resolution to several issues in dispute was achieved at talks between the company and the union.  In November 2009, the Labour Court nominated Mr Finbarr Flood as Arbitrator to consider the remaining outstanding issues.  The Arbitrator met with the parties and issued his final and binding decision to the parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1237">The Labour Court is a court of last resort in the industrial relations process, and it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to give serious consideration to the Court's recommendations.  Ultimately, however, responsibility for the resolution of trade disputes is a matter for the parties involved.  In my view, the experience and expertise of the Labour Court undoubtedly offers the best avenue for resolving the issues in this difficult dispute.  In this context, I would urge the company to give positive consideration to the Court's recommendation on the dispute and to abide by the final decision made by the arbitrator appointed by the Court in this matter.  In view of renewed contacts that I understand to have been pursued in a constructive spirit between the parties subsequent to the Labour Court's recommendation, I would urge all concerned to bring that same spirit to bear on the current situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1241">A consequence of the corporate right to sue and be sued is that a company cannot appear in court except through its solicitor or counsel, (unless the company is being prosecuted on indictment when it may appear in court by a representative appointed by the company).  In the Battle v Irish Art Promotion Centre Ltd [1968] IR252, the Supreme Court refused such an application on the basis that the company was a different person, separate and distinct from its controlling shareholder.  The Court also said that "a limited company cannot be represented in court proceedings by its managing director or other officer or servant.  This is an infirmity of the company which derives from its very own nature.  The creation of the company is the act of its subscribers; the subscribers, in discarding their own personae for the persona of the company, doubtless did so for the advantages which incorporation offers to traders. In seeking incorporation they thereby lose the right of audience which they would have as individuals; but the choice has been their own."</p>
            <p eId="para_1242">As I indicated in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 213 of 26 January 2010, the Supreme Court decision in the Battle's case is settled law here for some time, I am reluctant to undertake any review of the matter in the absence of some compelling grounds or demonstrated need for doing so.  Notwithstanding the foregoing I understand that my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform has with effect from 11 January 2010, introduced new Court Rules to extend the current remit of the Small Claims Court procedure to include certain business claims.  The new rules will facilitate claims from a business against another business in respect of goods or services not exceeding €2,000.</p>

            <p eId="para_1289">The Deputy may wish to note that the 2009 Budget publications announced that arrangements would end whereby the annual payment to the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund would be automatically calculated by reference to the previous year's betting duty or the contribution to the Fund in the year 2000 adjusted for inflation.  On the general question of ring-fencing funds, earmarking revenues for a specific expenditure programme would, in general, constrain the government in the implementation of its overall expenditure policy. In addition, if certain revenues were earmarked for particular projects any projects thus funded would be dependent on actual revenue collected from that source.  Therefore, a fall in revenue generated by that source could imply a fall in expenditure on such projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290">I should point out that the proceeds from CAB are returned to the Exchequer. These funds are held in the Central Fund which is provided for under Article 11 of the Constitution. This fund, except where provided otherwise by law, is the destination of all State revenues and the source of all Government spending.  It is not the policy to earmark funds from particular sources for specific projects. Furthermore, it is indeed a matter for Ministers in the first instance to prioritise their spending programmes in a cost effective way within the resources allocated to them.</p>

All deferred locations will be considered as part of an overall review of the programme in 2011.  Full details in respect of the total number of posts due to move, the posts moved and the posts deferred, as well as the property status of each project, are set out in the attached table.

            <p eId="para_1917">I propose to take Questions Nos. 170 and 195 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1918">Home repossession should be and generally is the last resort for the lender. The preferred method of dealing with cases of arrears should be early intervention and engagement.  In the revised Programme for Government we have stated that we will be:</p>
            <p eId="para_1919">Introducing new measures to protect families having difficulties with their home mortgage payments;</p>
            <p eId="para_1920">Examining ways of expanding the existing options available for dealing with debt situations;</p>
            <p eId="para_1921">Examining ways of expanding existing state sponsored mortgage-support measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1922">I approved the setting up of the Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Review Group, chaired by one of my officials, for the purpose of bringing together all relevant information in Departments and examining options, including initiatives in other jurisdictions, in relation to the matter of support for home owners facing the problems of mortgage arrears and repossessions. The Law Reform Commission (LRC) which is under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality, and Law Reform is addressing the issues of debt management and enforcement. In addition I have been discussing with Cabinet colleagues possible further initiatives in this matter and will in due course be bringing proposals to Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1923">Other arrangements in place to assist consumers who have fallen into arrears or are in danger of falling into arrears include the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme, which provides assistance where the mortgage relates to a person's principal private residence, and MABS which provides a national, free, confidential and independent service.  The Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code requires that a regulated entity must contact the consumer as soon as it becomes aware that a mortgage account is in arrears and that it must have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears.</p>
            <p eId="para_1924">In response to the continuing difficulties being faced by mortgage holders, the Financial Regulator has written to all mortgage lenders informing them that with effect from 17 February 2010, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears has been amended to require that lenders must now wait twelve months from the time arrears first arise before applying to the courts to commence enforcement of any legal action on repossession of a borrower's primary residence.  Contraventions of the Code may be subject to the imposition of administrative sanctions by the Financial Regulator.  The requirements of the Consumer Protection Code, including those on mortgage arrears, continue to apply.  The updated code and letter issued to institutions on Friday is available on the website at http://www.financialregulator.ie/processes/consumer-protection-code/Pages/codes-of-conduct.aspx.</p>

            <p eId="para_1951">The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was established in 1991 to provide finance to help build market economies in the former Soviet Bloc countries following the fall of Communism. In more recent times the mandate of the Bank has been expanded to allow lending in Mongolia and Turkey.  The EBRD provides project finance and equity for banks, industries and businesses, both new ventures and existing companies. It also works with publicly-owned companies to support privatisation, the restructuring of state-owned firms and the improvement of infrastructure.  Ireland joined the EBRD as a founding member in 1991 but cannot borrow from the Bank in view of the Bank's mandate.</p>

         further to Parliamentary Question No. 89 of 3 December 2009, the way a person with a disability ensures that their attention is drawn to vacancies and when they must apply in order that they are considered under the 3% target for employment in the public service for persons with disability. 
        [6169/10]

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1959">As stated in my reply to the Deputy on 3 December 2009, the position in relation to the opportunities for employment to the Public Service generally is limited by the recruitment and promotion moratorium which was announced on 27 March last year, but the moratorium does not apply to the "Willing, Able, Mentoring Programme" and the 3 per cent target for employment for persons with disabilities.  Recruitment to positions in the Civil and Public Service is carried out by the Public Appointments Service, the central recruitment agency for the Civil and Public Service and conducted in strict compliance with the Codes of Practice set out by the Commission for Public Service Appointments.  Codes include the "Code of Practice governing the External and Internal Appointments of Persons with Disabilities to Positions in the Irish Civil Service and Certain Public Bodies".</p>
            <p eId="para_1960">All posts are advertised on the Public Appointments Service website www.publicjobs.ie and in relevant national newspapers.  Candidates interested in pursuing a career in the Civil and Public Service may register as a member of the Public Jobs website.  They can apply for jobs online and register for updates on new Public Service opportunities.  Once registered they can receive job alerts matching their requirements via email and/or SMS text alerts.  Candidates with a disability can apply for any post for which they are eligible.  When registering with the website, applicants can indicate if they have any special needs and every attempt is made to provide the accommodations that might be required during the assessment process.  All vacancies specify in the advertisement the closing date for receipt of applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1961">The Deputy may wish to note that the Public Appointments Service has an Access Officer who can provide or arrange for and co-ordinate the provision of assistance and guidance to persons with disabilities accessing its service.  I can assure the Deputy that the Government gives a high priority to policy on the employment of people with disabilities.  All reasonable measures to promote and support the employment of people with disabilities continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1962">The Public Appointment Service, on behalf of the Civil Service, has held recruitment competitions confined to persons with disabilities.  The most recent competition was at Executive Officer level advertised in March 2007.  In an effort to attract as many applicants as possible for this recruitment competition the advertisement was sent to a number of voluntary organisations representing people with disabilities.  It was also advertised on the Public Jobs website, in national newspapers and was issued to each Government Departments' Disability Liaison Officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1963">Officials in my Department consult with organisations that provide sheltered and supported employment to persons with disabilities.  As a practical example, all Government Departments and Offices in the Civil Service participated in the Irish Association of Supported Employment Annual Job Shadow Initiative 2009.  This national project is designed to bring together people with disabilities and local employers in the spirit of collaboration to enable job seekers explore the world of work.  The initiative gives people with disabilities the unique opportunity to shadow a workplace mentor as he/she goes through their working day.  It is envisaged that through exposure to a work setting, job seekers throughout Ireland will learn more about job requirements and employers expectations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1964">In addition, a number of Government Departments and Offices in the Civil Service are involved in a work experience graduate programme for persons with disabilities, known as "Willing, Able, Mentoring" (WAM) for the past six years.  This programme gives practical effect to Government and Civil Service policy on improving employment prospects for persons with disabilities.  This programme is not subject to the moratorium.</p>
            <p eId="para_1965">As the Deputy is aware the 3 per cent target for employment of persons with disabilities in the Public Service remains in place, notwithstanding the recruitment and promotion moratorium.  The recent 2008 report published by the National Disability Authority stated that all Government Departments in the Civil Service achieved or exceeded the 3 per cent employment target in compliance with Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005.  In relation to other areas of the Public Sector, each Minister is responsible for compliance with and reporting on the target set in the Disability Act 2005 for the employment of persons with disabilities in public bodies under his or her aegis.</p>

Schedule 1 attached, lists the buildings leased by the Office of Public Works (OPW) since 1 January 2009. The OPW does not hold records of the BER Certificates for these buildings.  The OPW has prepared Display Energy Certificates for the large rented/leased buildings listed in Schedule 2.  Large leased/rented buildings for which Display Energy Certificates are currently being compiled are listed in Schedule 3.</p>

         the designated positions of employment added to the schedule since the Ethics in Public Office (Designated Position in Public Bodies) Regulations 2004; the designated positions of employment deleted by virtue of the Ethics in Public Office (Designated Position in Public Bodies) (Amendment) Regulations 2010; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2161">The schedule to S.I. No. 698 of 2004 (Ethics in Public Office (Designated Positions in Public Bodies) Regulations 2004) lists positions of employment in departments and offices that are prescribed for the purposes of the definition of "designated position of employment" in section 18 of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995.  Typically, these are positions that interface with the commercial sector, or are involved in public procurement, contracts, etc.  This means the Ethics Acts apply, as appropriate, to persons who occupy such positions.  Regulation 4 of S.I. No. 698 of 2004 also prescribes for the purposes of "designated position" all positions of employment in departments and offices, in respect of which the maximum salary is not less than the maximum salary of a principal (general service grade, Class B PRSI) in the Civil Service.  This means some positions will not appear by name in either the 2004 or the 2010 statutory instruments, as the position is prescribed with reference to its remuneration and not by name.</p>
            <p eId="para_2162">Each year since the regulations were issued, the schedule has been updated to reflect organisational changes in the Civil Service and to bring within the remit of the Ethics Acts positions of employment in order to ensure, where a conflict of interest could arise between the public interest and an interest of a jobholder, a function will not be performed without the disclosure of that interest.  Departments and offices inform my Department of the positions to be prescribed on this basis.  This updating process, which keeps the remit of the Ethics Acts up-to-date, has been welcomed by the Standards in Public Office Commission in its annual reports.  This annual update process results in the replacement of the Schedule to S.I. No. 698 of 2004 with a new schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_2163">Appendix 1 lists positions of employment included in the schedule to the Ethics in Public Office (Designated Positions in Public Bodies) (Amendment) Regulations 2010 (S.I. No. 5 of 2010) that are not included in the schedule to the Ethics in Public Office (Designated Positions in Public Bodies) Regulations 2004 (S.I. No. 698 of 2004).</p>
            <p eId="para_2164">Appendix 2 lists positions of employment included in the schedule to the Ethics in Public Office (Designated Positions in Public Bodies) Regulations 2004 that are not included in the schedule to the Ethics in Public Office (Designated Positions in Public Bodies) (Amendment) Regulations 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2165">The inclusion of a position of employment in Appendix 2 does not necessarily mean that the position, or that the functions associated with the position, are no longer within the scope of designated positions of employment under the Ethics Acts.  For example, certain positions would now be designated under separate regulations made under the Ethics Acts that are applicable to public bodies (i.e. S.I. No. 15 of 2010 (Ethics in Public Office (Prescribed Public Bodies, Designated Directorships Of Public Bodies and Designated Positions in Public Bodies) (Amendment) Regulations 2010).  Certain positions may also be described differently in the schedule to S.I. No. 5 of 2010 or may now be prescribed by regulation 4 of S.I. No. 698 of 2004, while other positions may no longer exist.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2643">On 27 February 2009 a Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (the Code) was introduced for all mortgage lenders.  This Code contained a requirement that lenders must wait six months from the time arrears first arise before applying to the courts to commence enforcement of any legal action on repossession of a borrower's primary residence.  In response to the continuing difficulties being faced by mortgage holders, the Financial Regulator has written to all mortgage lenders informing them that with effect from 17 February 2010, the Code has been amended to require that lenders must now wait twelve months from the time arrears first arise before applying to the courts to commence enforcement of any legal action on repossession of a borrower's primary residence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2644">Contraventions of the Code may be subject to the imposition of administrative sanctions by the Financial Regulator.  The requirements of the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code, including those on mortgage arrears, continue to apply.  The updated code and letter issued to institutions on Friday 5 February 2010 is available on the website at http://www.financialregulator.ie/processes/consumer-protection-code/Pages/codes-of-conduct.aspx.</p>
            <p eId="para_2645">While the extension of the statutory code to 12 months is a welcome development, it should be noted that it does not necessarily follow that legal action will commence once the statutory 12 month timeframe has elapsed.  The revised Code on Mortgage Arrears mandates that the lender <i>“must not seek repossession of the property until every reasonable effort has been made to agree an alternative repayment schedule with the borrower”</i>.  Further, even where legal action is being taken to obtain an order for repossession, the Code mandates the lender to maintain contact with the borrower and, if agreement can be reached <i>“the lender must enter into repayment arrangements and put on hold proceedings in the event of agreed regular repayments being maintained.”</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_2646">In addition, the Irish Bankers Federation published a Statement of Intent in November 2009 which provides further reassurance to homeowners who find themselves genuinely unable to maintain repayments on their principal private residence.  The Statement of Intent has been agreed and supported by all IBF members.  The IBF Oversight Committee on the implementation of the Statement of Intent will include a representation from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  Overall, I am satisfied that the new arrangements in place provide strong protections to all mortgage-holders who are genuinely unable to meet their mortgage commitments.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_433">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2650">The Finance Bill, which was published on Thursday 4 February, includes provision to make public bodies subject to VAT in accordance with the European Court of Justice ruling against Ireland of 16 July 2009 in Case C-554/07.  In summary, the VAT Act is being amended to provide that public bodies, including local authorities, are made subject to VAT where they engage in activities that could lead to a distortion of competition with private operators.  More specifically, they will become subject to VAT where they engage in activities (a) other than in their capacity as a public authority (e.g. regulatory functions); (b) in the case of their capacity as a public authority when their treatment as non-taxable could lead to a distortion of competition; and (c) as outlined in Annex I of the EU VAT Directive, unless otherwise exempted, and unless the activity is carried out on such a small scale as to be negligible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2651">Services that will become liable to VAT include such services as waste collection, landfill and recycling services; off-street parking; toll roads; the operation of leisure facilities; rent from certain lettings of commercial property; and the supply of staff and data.  It should be noted that such services are already subject to VAT if provided by a private operator.  The standard or the reduced VAT rates will apply as appropriate.  The changes will apply from 1 July 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2652">However, other services operated by public authorities are not being made subject to VAT by the Finance Bill provision, as they are otherwise exempted.  In that context, for example, the supply of water, education, health and passenger transport services are not being made subject to VAT as they are otherwise exempted from VAT.  Examples of the types of activities by public bodies where a charge applies which will remain outside the scope of VAT, include parking fines, fees for passports, driving licences etc, development levies, casual trading licences and certificates of compliance.  These are purely regulatory functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2653">Business customers that charge VAT will not be affected by this change as they can claim deduction for any VAT charged by a public body.  The impact on private individuals, VAT exempt entities and other non-registered bodies, will depend on whether, and the degree to which, the VAT is passed on by the public bodies, which in any event should be limited somewhat since public bodies providing the service will have entitlement to deduct VAT on their inputs.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2657">The Deputy will be aware that the appointment and promotion of civil servants in Government Departments is regulated by the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.  The Minister for Finance is responsible for all matters relating to recruitment in the Civil Service, including: eligibility criteria, staffing numbers, grading, pay and all working conditions of civil servants.  The recruitment and promotion moratorium announced on Friday 27th March 2009 applies to the civil service; the Minister for Finance has the authority to allow for the filling of some vacancies in very exceptional circumstances through recruitment or promotion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2658">The Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005 was enacted on 9th July 2005.  The Act amended the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956 to allow the management framework set out in the Public Service Management Act 1997 to take effect.  Under this framework, each Secretary General or Head of a Scheduled Office is responsible, by virtue of being the appropriate authority, for managing all matters pertaining to appointments, performance, discipline and dismissal of civil servants below Principal Officer level.  Each Minister is the appropriate authority for civil servants at and above Principal level.  The Government will continue to dismiss directly a civil servant who is the Head of a Scheduled Office or a civil servant who holds a position as a Revenue Commissioner.</p>
            <p eId="para_2659">The Act also introduced a number of other Human Resources Management (HRM) changes.  These include the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_2660">civil servants, other than those dismissed directly by Government, were brought within the scope of the Unfair Dismissals Acts and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts;</p>
            <p eId="para_2661">disciplinary action may be taken in cases of underperformance;</p>
            <p eId="para_2662">any suspension pending the conclusion of a disciplinary investigation will be suspension on full pay;</p>
            <p eId="para_2663">the range of possible disciplinary sanctions have been broadened to include suspension without pay;</p>
            <p eId="para_2664">people aged over 65 years may be engaged as civil servants provided they are new entrants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2665">The practical procedures to give effect to the 1956 Regulation Act are included in a Disciplinary Code which is agreed with the staff side under the Conciliation and Arbitration scheme.  With the new Act, a new Disciplinary Code was required to take account of the emphasis on performance.  This revised Code was officially agreed in June 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2666">Turning to the delegation of powers and functions under section 5 of the Civil Service Regulation Acts 1956-2005,<b> </b>the practical implementation of the powers in relation to the dismissal of staff envisaged in the Public Service Management Act 1997 was constrained by the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956, which provided that all established civil servants hold office at the will and pleasure of the Government; and therefore only the Government has authority to dismiss them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2667">However, the 1997 Act provided for amendments to the 1956 Act, subsections 5(2) and 5(3).  This means that, although the Government retains ultimate dismissal authority, the Government can delegate this authority.  The amended section 5(2) provides that the Government may authorise a Minister to exercise its powers of dismissal in relation to an officer at Principal level and above (who is not a Head of a Scheduled Office, or a Revenue Commissioner); while the amended section 5(3) provides that a Secretary General or Head of a Scheduled Office may exercise the power to dismiss staff below Principal level.  An added protection is put in place for officers at and above Principal level, in that section 5(6) provides that a Minister cannot dismiss such an officer without having received a written recommendation to do so from the Secretary General or Head of Scheduled Office in which the officer works.</p>

However, while the installation of an alternative energy generator may be the construction of a structure, such a structure is not “designed for use solely or mainly for the purposes of a farming business”.  It is designed rather to generate electricity for wherever required.  Consequently, the installation of alternative energy generators does not come within the scope of the VAT refund order.</p>

            <p eId="para_2678">As a condition of State Aid approval, in relation to the recapitalisation by the Irish Government of both AIB and Bank of Ireland, the EU Commission required that the two banks each prepare and present restructuring plans to the Commission.  The plan for Bank of Ireland was submitted on 30 September 2009 and the plan for AIB was submitted on 13 November 2009.  The restructuring plans must comply with EU guidelines in this regard and have regard to EU State aid rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_2679">The commitment to burden sharing by the institution is a key consideration of the EU requirements for restructuring plans.  Drawing on this, the EU issued guidelines in October 2009 aimed at clarifying their position on burden sharing, in particular in relation to the non-payment of discretionary coupons for hybrid capital instrument holders.  The basis to the Commission's policy is to ensure that the amount of State aid should not exceed the minimum necessary and to achieve appropriate burden sharing with bond holders.  Commission practice in this area is guided by the principle that transactions such as coupon payments reduce the total regulatory capital of an institution and this is incompatible with a situation where those same institutions are still reliant on State aid to fulfil regulatory capital requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2680">In response to the Commission's policy in this area, AIB and Bank of Ireland have both had to announce to the market that they cannot make discretionary coupon payments on Tier 1 and upper Tier 2 capital instruments.  Non-payments of these coupons gives rise to a so-called "dividend stopper" which prevents payments on a range of other hybrid capital instruments held by the two institutions including the cash coupon on the State's Preference Shares.  This would result in the activation of an alternative payment mechanism which would give rise to issuance of ordinary shares related to the cash amount of the dividend that would otherwise have been payable.</p>
            <p eId="para_2681">I am determined, in the context of ongoing discussions with the European Commission to secure agreement on the banks' restructuring plans, to resolve this issue to ensure that the State receives appropriate remuneration for the State's recapitalisation of these banks.  Importantly, the European Commission is also open to finding a solution particularly since payment of a cash dividend on the State's Preference Shares was an important element of the Commission's approval for the State aid provided to the banks.  I will keep the Deputy updated on progress in this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_2683">Entities regulated by the Financial Regulator that provide credit include banks, building societies, credit unions, retail credit firms, home reversion (equity release) firms and moneylenders.  These entities, excluding credit unions, must comply, inter alia, with the requirements of the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code, with the exception of moneylenders who must comply with the requirements of the Regulator's Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders.  The Codes set out a number of general principles requiring regulated entities to act in the best interests of consumers and to treat consumers honestly, fairly and professionally and also include specific rules in relation to the provision of credit.</p>
            <p eId="para_2684">There may be other entities, outlets or arrangements through which consumers, including farmers, may receive credit.  These include friendly societies, retail shops where in-store credit is provided and hire purchase arrangements.  In these cases, the credit facilities provided would be outside the terms of the Consumer Protection Code and would not be regulated by the Financial Regulator.  Friendly societies fall under the remit of the Registrar of Friendly Societies while credit intermediaries fall under the remit of the National Consumer Agency.  Examples of credit intermediaries include garages and retailers who arrange loans, leasing and hire purchase for consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2685">The Financial Regulator has no statutory role in the setting of retail interest rates and there are no interest rate caps in relation to the industry categories which the Financial Regulator supervises in this jurisdiction, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector.  Interest rates and products are not regulated so each institution determines the rate it charges its customers, depending on a number of factors such as cost of funds and commercial considerations such as competition, risk pricing and the impact on deposit rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_2686">The principal legislation under which credit unions are regulated in Ireland is the Credit Union Act 1997 as amended.  One of the objects referred to in the conditions of registration of a credit union is the "creation of sources of credit for the mutual benefit of its members at a fair and reasonable rate of interest".  In relation to interest on loans under Section 38 of the Credit Union Act, a credit union may charge interest on loans made to its members under certain conditions, one of which is that the interest on the loan shall not at any time exceed one per cent per month on the amount of the loan outstanding at that time.  The interest on the loan shall in every case include all the charges made by the credit union in making that loan.  The rate of interest charged on any class of loans granted at a particular time shall be the same for all loans of the class.</p>
            <p eId="para_2687">Moneylending firms in Ireland are authorised by the Financial Regulator under the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  Interest rate caps for moneylenders are not provided for in this Act and the Financial Regulator does not have the power to cap interest rates on an industry wide basis.  However, the Consumer Director of the Financial Regulator may form an opinion on whether the cost of credit charged by a firm is excessive.  A person must not conduct moneylending unless they hold a licence and maintain a business premises which is not a residence.</p>

            <p eId="para_2691">The Commission on Taxation recommended the reduction of Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) business relief and agricultural relief from 90% to 75%, and an overall cap on the reduction via these reliefs of €3 million (Recommendations 8.70 and 8.71).  The Commission also recommended that the two reliefs be amalgamated (recommendation 8.72).  In the context of Budget 2010 and Finance Bill 2010 the Government considered these and other recommendations of the Commission but it was decided not to address these matters at this stage.  The Finance Bill, which was published last Thursday, 4 February, contains proposals to reform and modernise the administration of CAT, including provisions that certain complex reliefs, including business relief and agricultural relief, can only be claimed electronically.  This is in line with recommendation 5.42 of the Commission on Taxation report, that taxpayers should be required to file returns electronically where detailed data is needed to evaluate tax expenditures.</p>

            <p eId="para_2741">A number of agencies, including the ESB, Shannon Regional Fisheries Board, relevant local authorities and Waterways Ireland have a specific statutory function or a responsibility in relation to aspects of the control and management of the Shannon basin and its water levels. The National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government also has a role in relation to managing environmental aspects of the catchment.  Future management of the Shannon must take account of relevant EU legislation relating to rivers, in particular, the Water Framework Directive and the Floods Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2742">The Water Framework Directive, which is primarily concerned with water quality, is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, operating through a network of River Basin District committees containing representatives of major stakeholders.  The Floods Directive requires that the level of flood risk in each catchment in the country, including the Shannon, should be identified and that a prioritised plan of measures be drawn up to address the risk in areas where it is significant.  This is to be done by undertaking a Flood Risk Assessment and Management Study (CFRAM) for each catchment. These studies must be completed by 2015, and must be reviewed every 6 years thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2743">The Office of Public Works will take the lead coordinating role in the carrying out of the Shannon FRAM.  The study, which is expected to commence in mid-2010, will involve consultation with all of the main stakeholders, including the ESB, Waterways Ireland, National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Fisheries Board and relevant Local Authorities.  The EU requires that the implementation of the Floods Directive and the Water Framework Directive should be closely coordinated in each Member State. This provides the basis for the development of an integrated, coordinated approach to the management of all matters relating to the River Shannon.  The Floods Directive will be transposed into Irish law by Statutory Instrument shortly.  The effect of this is, rather than creating a single agency as suggested by the Deputy, to give to the OPW the necessary statutory authority to ensure the participation of the stakeholders in the process of effectively managing flood risk in the Shannon catchment.</p>

            <p eId="para_2745">In 2009 the Office of Public Works (OPW) introduced two new initiatives relating to the provision of minor flood alleviation works for rivers and for coastal protection and under this initiative, provided funding to Kildare County Council to complete a programme of flood relief works for the River Toni in Celbridge, Co. Kildare. These works were completed in 2009 and as a result Celbridge experienced no fluvial flooding during the recent flooding. I should also mention that I have recently extended the aforementioned scheme and increased the funding that will be made available by OPW this year. An initial allocation of €6 million is being made available for works and studies to address flooding and coastal protection which can be undertaken in 2010 compared to approximately €2 million which was allocated in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2746">My Officials continue to meet regularly with Kildare County Council to discuss how best to prioritise the areas in the county which have a history of flooding and/or been subjected to recent flooding. As a result of these meetings Kildare County Council will be submitting flood relief proposals from other locations in the county for inclusion in the programme of minor works for 2010. It should be noted that all applications for funding of minor works will be considered by OPW and prioritised as part of the overall strategy for dealing with flooding throughout the country and it will also be a prerequisite that any works considered will take cognisance of the Liffey Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) study that forms part of the National CFRAM programme, which is being rolled out in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2747">Furthermore, the Commissioners of Public Works have agreed to allocate funding to complete a programme of flood alleviation works in the Johnstown area, and Kildare County Council has been successful in obtaining planning approval in accordance with Part 8 of the planning and development regulations for this scheme. It is envisaged that the scheme will get underway later this year subject to the Local Authority being able to resolve outstanding issues in relation to land acquisition and site investigation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2760">I understand the Deputy is referring to the International Monetary Fund's New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) which has not, however, been designed to deal with debt cancellation. The NAB is essentially a set of credit arrangements between the IMF and member countries and institutions to provide supplementary resources to the IMF to forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system or to deal with an exceptional situation that poses a threat to the stability of that system. Arrangements for a new and expanded NAB are currently under negotiation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2761">In April 2009, G20 Leaders agreed to increase the resources available to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by up to USD500bn, thereby tripling the total pre-crisis lending resources of the IMF to USD750, to support growth in emerging market and developing countries. This agreement was endorsed by the International Monetary and Financial Committee, the European Council and Ecofin Ministers. The increase in IMF resources is to be made in two steps:</p>
            <p eId="para_2762">(i) through the immediate provision of bilateral loans up to USD250bn from IMF member countries to the IMF; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2763">(ii) by subsequently rolling over these loans and making additional provision into an expanded and more flexible New Arrangements to Borrow NAB), increased by up to USD500 bn.</p>
            <p eId="para_2764">At the Spring Council 2009, the EU agreed to provide temporary bilateral loans of €75bn to the IMF. Ireland agreed to provide its share — a loan facility of €1.3bn — based on Ireland's new IMF quota.  On 17 September 2009, EU Heads of State agreed to further increase support to the IMF by increasing the €75bn to €125bn (approx USD175bn) by rolling over EU bilateral loans into the new NAB and making further financial commitments to NAB. The result of this agreement for Ireland is that our share of the new and expanded NAB (based on Ireland's IMF quota) would be approximately €2bn, inclusive of Ireland's bilateral loan of €1.3bn.</p>
            <p eId="para_2765">On 13 January 2010, the Government decided in principle to approve Ireland's participation in the IMF's New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), for increasing IMF resources, and Ireland's provision to the NAB of a loan facility of approximately €2bn, subject to agreement on terms and conditions.  Like a number of EU countries, Ireland's provision of the bilateral loan to the IMF and participation in NAB will be met using Central Bank resources. Legislative provision for the bilateral loan and Ireland's participation in NAB will be required.</p>

            <p eId="para_2783">I have responsibility for the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which was introduced in January 2010.  A higher capitation rate of €75 per week (€2,850 p.a.) is available to sessional playschool services in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the scheme.  To qualify for the higher capitation rate all pre-school leaders in the service must hold a qualification in a relevant discipline at a minimum of Level 7 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) and have 3 years experience working in the sector.  All pre-school assistants must hold a relevant FETAC level 5 qualification or its equivalent.</p>
            <p eId="para_2784">The AMI (Association Montessori Internationale) Montessori College offer both a 2 year and a 3 year Montessori course with entry to the third year being dependent on a student achieving a distinction at the end of year 2.  Neither of these courses are currently placed on the NFQ although I understand that the College has applied to the Higher Education and Training Awards Council to have them accredited and placed on the NFQ.  In the meantime, as the Department of Education and Science gives restricted recognition to AMI Montessori qualifications awarded on completion of the 3 year full time course, this qualification is being accepted by my Office as meeting the qualification criterion for the higher capitation rate.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2790">I propose to take Questions Nos. 212, 218, 233, 235 and 283 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2791">The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and its associated regulations control the import, export, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the Schedules to the Act. Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with Ireland's obligations under international conventions and/or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland.  The list of scheduled substances is kept under ongoing review. For example, in 2006 psychotropic ("magic") mushrooms were banned and their possession and sale is now illegal. On 31 March 2009, BZP was similarly subjected to legislative control measures and criminal sanctions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2792">In the light of the health risks associated with some of the products being sold in so-called "head shops", I intend to make regulations before the end of June which will introduce controls, similar to those introduced recently in the UK, on a range of substances which are currently on sale in head shops. These regulations will make the possession and sale of these substances illegal and subject to criminal sanctions.  Some of the substances in question have legitimate uses  — for example, in the production of plastics and industrial solvents. It will be necessary to assess the level of use of these substances by industry in Ireland and the implications for industry of placing these substances under the ambit of Misuse of Drugs legislation. In accordance with EU law, it may also be necessary to notify the Commission of the proposed regulations in case they impact on legitimate industrial activities and this imposes a 3 month stand still period on implementation of the regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2793">Minister of State John Curran, who has responsibility for co-ordinating the National Drugs Strategy, has identified head shops as an area of concern, and is currently considering the options available to more effectively control the activities of head shops.  A Research Advisory Group (RAG) has been established to identify possible options for the regulation of head shops. The RAG held its first meeting on 13 January 2010. It has representatives from the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, the Departments of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children, the Health Research Board, Revenue Custom's Service, the Forensic State Laboratory and other relevant stakeholders. The RAG will report incrementally until its work is complete.</p>

It is my intention to extend Breastcheck to women in the 65-69 age group as soon as resources and capacity allow.

         asked the

         the background and rationale to the decision to centralise the medical card application service to the primary care reimbursement service; the connection of this centralisation to the budget 2009 decision to means test all persons applying for a medical card aged 70 years and over which is enshrined in the Health Act 2008; the preparation undertaken and consideration given to the initiative prior to the announcement to centralise on 24 December 2008; the effect of the centralisation on persons over 70 years; the success of the centralisation; if problems have been encountered to date in 2010; the extent to which the medical card application process has been improved to be more efficient and faster; the extent to which it has deteriorated; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2828">Following the change in medical card eligibility for persons aged 70 and over in the Health Act 2008, the Health Service Executive (HSE) through its Service Plan for 2009, advised the Department of its decision to centralise the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications and renewals to the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin. The HSE has indicated that this decision was taken in the context of the Executive's  requirements to make efficiencies in business practices that could realise savings in a very challenging economic environment and provide a modern service to the public within sustainable levels of expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2829">I fully support the HSE's decision to centralise the processing of all medical card applications and reviews. I wrote to all Oireachtas members on 19th January 2010 outlining a range of measures being employed by the Executive to address issues arising from this initiative and I also referred to the various enhancements that this process will facilitate upon completion.</p>

If, however, a person applies for the Nursing Home Loan but subsequently chooses to sell the family home, the amount loaned on the basis of that asset up to that point must be repaid within six months of the sale. Thereafter, the proceeds of the sale would be treated as Cash Assets and would not be subject to the 7.5% (member of a couple) or 15% (single person) cap on property/land, as appropriate. Cash Assets are taken into account at a rate of 5% per annum for as long as the person remains in nursing home care.</p>

The HSE indicated that this decision was taken in the context of the Executive's  requirements to make efficiencies in business practices that could realise savings in a very challenging economic environment and provide a modern service to the public within sustainable levels of expenditure.</p>

As aspects of the  Deputy's question refer to operational matters, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address these matters and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy John Moloney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2939">My Department is currently working closely with HIQA and the HSE with the view to commencing the Health Act 2007 to allow for the independent registration and inspection of all residential centres and respite services for children with a disability. The intention is to have this registration and inspection system in place by December 2010, as committed to in the Ryan Commission report Implementation Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2940">Children with disabilities in generic residential centres under the Child Care Act 1991, are already covered by the standards and inspection regimes applying to those centres. The new registration and inspection system will incorporate all centres providing residential or respite care to children with disabilities, including those centres run by voluntary organisations that are currently excluded from inspection under the Child Care Act 1991.</p>
            <p eId="para_2941">In respect of residential services for adults with disabilities, I will shortly be bringing detailed proposals to Government with regard to the protection of vulnerable adults with disabilities who are currently in institutional care.</p>
            <p eId="para_2942">As Deputies will be aware, "National Quality Standards: Residential Settings for People with Disabilities" have been published by HIQA. Following a public consultation process initiated by HIQA they were formulated by a Standards Advisory Group that comprised officials of HIQA, my Department, the HSE, service providers, organisations representing people with disabilities and service users. These standards will provide a national framework for quality, safe services for persons with disabilities in a residential setting. At present the standards apply only to adult services but work is at an advanced stage to develop standards for children's services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2943">Given the current economic situation, to move to full statutory implementation of the standards, including regulation and inspection, presents significant challenges at this time.  However, notwithstanding the difficulties of immediate statutory implementation, my Department, the HSE and HIQA have agreed that progressive non-statutory implementation of the Standards will now commence, and that they will become the benchmark against which the HSE assesses both its own directly operated facilities and other facilities that the HSE funds. Discussions are ongoing regarding the development of self-assessment tools, providing awareness training for service providers and the introduction of an appropriate level of external validation for relevant settings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2944">A number of preliminary processes are already in place within the HSE to facilitate this work. For example, compliance with the HIQA standards is included in the Service Level Arrangements being implemented between the HSE and service providers.  As part of the ongoing review of Service Level Arrangements, service providers will now be required to demonstrate compliance with the standards through the provision of audit outcomes.  I am informed by the HSE that the majority of service providers have already commenced a review of their services within the context of the HIQA standards and many service providers have also achieved external accreditation over the past number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2945">In addition, I am assured by the HSE that it has a robust system in place to deal with any complaints made in relation to the treatment of persons with disabilities in residential care. This includes ensuring that all HSE funded service providers of residential care have appropriate complaints procedures that are in line with HSE policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2953">On 1 July last, I made regulations under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 to specify the fees and other payments to be made to pharmacists who dispense drugs and medicines under the GMS (medical card), the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS), the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI) and other community drugs schemes.  The main changes were: A new dispensing fee structure based on a sliding scale as follows: €5 for first 20,000 items, €4.50 for next 10,000 items and €3.50 for the remaining items.  Retail Mark-up was reduced from 50% to 20%.  Wholesale Mark-up was reduced from 17.66% to 10% of the ex-factory price of drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2954">It is my view that the fees and mark-ups set out in the regulations should be applied to all transactions where a person produces a DPS card, including transactions where expenditure has not reached the €120 monthly threshold under the DPS scheme.  I have been disappointed to learn that some pharmacists are not applying the fees and mark-ups in this manner.  I have raised this matter with the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU) and intend to pursue it further.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2956">I have consistently emphasised the need to improve facilities and services to persons with cystic fibrosis.  Following publication of the Pollock Report in 2005, the Health Service Executive established a Working Group to undertake a detailed review of cystic fibrosis services.  The Group, which was multi-disciplinary in its composition and included representation from the Department of Health and Children, was asked to review the current configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis in Ireland.  The report was published in October 2009.  Many of its recommendations had already been implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_2957">Some 50 additional staff including consultant, nursing and allied health professionals, have been appointed across the hospital system in recent years to enhance the level of services provided for persons with cystic fibrosis.  The HSE was asked to place a particular focus on the development of services at the National Adult Tertiary Referral Centre at St. Vincent's Hospital.  The hospital currently treats over 50% of the CF adult population.  A number of capital projects have been completed at the hospital and have helped to improve facilities. These include a new ambulatory care centre, the refurbishment of St. Camillus Ward, and a new Emergency Department which includes single room accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2958">The refurbishment of accommodation to provide eight single en-suite rooms for patients with cystic fibrosis was completed in August 2008 and the beds are now operational. This brings the total level of in-patient accommodation for the treatment of respiratory patients (including people with CF) at the hospital to 63 beds.</p>
            <p eId="para_2959">A new ward block to replace existing accommodation is being developed at the hospital. This facility will provide single room en-suite in-patient accommodation (100 rooms) and a dedicated day unit for people with CF, including 10 single day treatment rooms with en-suite sanitary facilities. Tenders for this development are currently under consideration. It is estimated that the construction, equipping and commissioning of this block will take approximately 18 months. It is intended that the development will become operational as early as possible in 2011.  The new facility will include accommodation for cystic fibrosis patients with appropriate isolation facilities for the treatment of their condition.  The HSE is now working with St. Vincent's to identify opportunities for patients who do not require tertiary level care to be treated close to home where adult services have been developed in the other specialist centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_2960">A number of other significant capital developments are being progressed for cystic fibrosis patients throughout the country, including in Beaumont Hospital.   Capital funding has been provided for the development of outpatient facilities for patients with CF treated at Beaumont Hospital.  The project is in two phases and the first phase (decanting) was completed at the end of 2009.  The second phase is due for completion in the second quarter of 2010.  HSE funding enabled the construction of a three storey building consisting of two floors each of 14 single rooms, and 8 bed HDU and two additional ICU rooms (within existing ICU).</p>
            <p eId="para_2961">Services for patients with cystic fibrosis are also provided at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, Tallaght Hospital, Cork University Hospital, Waterford Regional Hospital, Mid Western Regional Hospital, Limerick, University College Hospital Galway and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  The Cystic Fibrosis Registry of Ireland (CFRI) receives support funding from the HSE.  Ireland is the only European country to commit public funding to a CF registry.  The CFRI is now in a position to produce relevant data on 90% of people with CF in Ireland.  The average enrolment of people with CF in other country registries is approximately 80%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2962">The Newborn Screening for Cystic Fibrosis Steering Group was established in June 2009 under the Chairmanship of Professor Gerry Loftus, Professor of Paediatrics, Galway. This group has a broad membership from key stakeholders and experts in the field of cystic fibrosis.  The screening programme will commence implementation in 2010 provided all the necessary general and specific screening programme governance arrangements are in place.  The Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland has made representations to the HSE in respect of people with Cystic Fibrosis living in Donegal for whom attendance at the CF centre in Belfast might be more convenient.  The HSE is pursuing this through Co-operation and Working Together (CAWT).</p>
            <p eId="para_2963">I am conscious that further improvements are required, including the need to develop community outreach services to facilitate the treatment of patients outside of a hospital setting where appropriate. Taken together, the planned developments represent a tangible improvement in the quality of services for people with cystic fibrosis.</p>

            <p eId="para_2967">All pre-school services are required to make reasonable accommodation for children with special needs, as required under the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2004.  The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which was introduced in January this year, and provides for a free pre-school year for all eligible children in the year prior to commencing primary school, includes a number of provisions specifically intended to assist children with special needs.  One of these is that, while the age range in which children qualify for the scheme is, generally, between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months in September of the relevant year, exceptions are allowed where a child has been assessed as having a special need which will delay his or her entry to primary school.  In such cases, the pre-school year relevant to such children will be taken as their qualifying year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2968">Additionally, the general requirement under the ECCE scheme that a child would be expected to attend 4 or 5 days each week will not apply to children with special needs where a shorter week would be more appropriate to their needs.  Many specialist pre-school services arrange for children attending their services to also attend a mainstream service for 1, 2 or 3 days a week.  As a result, 1 full week place in the mainstream service could cater for 2 or more children with special needs on a pro-rata basis.  Where appropriate, children with special needs attending a mainstream pre-school service on a pro-rata basis can avail of a second free pre-school year.  Should additional flexibility in the arrangements for the scheme be required by specialist pre-school services for children with special needs, these will also be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_2969">As the Deputy's question also relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_3032">The Adoption Bill 2009, is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Inter-country Adoption.  The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child.  Future inter-country adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted.</p>
            <p eId="para_3033">The current policy position, as set out in the Adoption Bill 2009, is that for an adoption to be registered under the Bill it must be effected in a contracting State to the Hague Convention or in a country with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement.  For non-Hague countries only those adoptions effected prior to the commencement of the new law can be registered on the Register of Inter-Country Adoptions to be established under the Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_3034">I announced on 26 January my intention to bring forward on Committee Stage an amendment to the Adoption Bill 2009 that will enable prospective adoptive parents to proceed with an adoption from a non-Hague or non-bilateral country, if prior to the establishment date, they have been issued with a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability to adopt.  The proposed amendment requires that the Adoption Authority (to be set up under the Act) would be satisfied that the particular adoption meets all the standards of the Hague Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_3035">Applicants for inter-country adoption must undergo a detailed statutory assessment process, which is undertaken by professional social workers, and must be approved by the Adoption Board before a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability to adopt abroad can be issued to them from the board.</p>
            <p eId="para_3036">I acknowledge that persons applying for inter-country adoption are currently experiencing unacceptably long delays as regards waiting times for assessment.  Requests for assessment for inter-country adoption are continuously increasing and Ireland currently has one of the highest rates for inter-country adoption in Europe.  The Health Service Executive has responsibility for the assessments of applicants for adoption through its social work service.  I have asked the Health Service Executive to do everything possible to reduce waiting times and assessment times for prospective adopters which currently are excessively long.  In addition, Part 13 of the Adoption Bill 2009 provides for the registration of accredited bodies to carry out aspects of the adoption process, including assessment.</p>

            <p eId="para_3044">Under section 31(1) of the Health Act 2004, the HSE is required to prepare an annual National Service Plan.  The plan must indicate the type and volume of health and personal social services to be provided by the HSE.  I approved the HSE National Service Plan 2010 on 5 February 2010 under section 31(8) of the Health Act 2004.  In approving the plan, I highlighted to the HSE the necessity that it delivers at a minimum, the levels of service set out in the plan as well as operating within the limits of its Voted allocation.  During 2010, the HSE will provide me with detailed information related to service activity levels by way of monthly performance reports against the plan.  The plan was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on Monday, 8 February 2010 in line with section 31(13) of the Health Act 2004 and was subsequently published on the HSE's website at <i>www.hse.ie. </i>

            <p eId="para_3047">I propose to take Questions Nos. 272 and 273 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3048">I have always accepted the consensus view of the relevant expert bodies that the introduction of a universal high uptake vaccination programme in young girls, in conjunction with population based cervical screening, could significantly reduce overall cervical cancer incidence.  The issue was not, therefore, whether the case for a cervical cancer vaccination programme was accepted by myself and the Government — because it always was — but how to place such a programme in order of clinical priorities for the allocation of scarce resources available for public health services and for the cancer programme in particular.</p>
            <p eId="para_3049">Recently I requested the HSE to initiate a tendering process for the procurement of a HPV vaccine with a view to commencing a HPV vaccination programme for all girls in first year in secondary school and until this process was completed I was not in a position to say if or when I would introduce this programme.  This tendering process for the vaccine is now complete.  We can now purchase the vaccine at a price much lower than we expected to pay in 2008 and at a price much closer to what is being paid in other countries.  In these circumstances, the programme can now be delivered from the extra resources committed in this year's budget to the overall cancer programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3050">The HSE is committed to starting this campaign during the current school year.  This will involve the free vaccination of up to 30,000 girls mainly in school settings and an announcement of the details of the full programme involved will be made by the HSE in the near future.  The programme will continue with vaccine being offered to all girls in first year in secondary school each year but it is not proposed to extend the vaccination programme to other classes at present.</p>

Details are available on the Adoption Board website at <i>www.adoptionboard.ie. </i>  The Adoption Bill 2009, is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of inter-country adoption.  The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child.

            <p eId="para_3055">The current policy position, as set out in the Adoption Bill 2009, is that for an adoption to be registered under the Bill it must be effected in a contracting State to the Hague Convention or in a country with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement.

The proposed amendment requires that the Adoption Authority (to be set up under the Act) would be satisfied that the particular adoption meets all the standards of the Hague Convention.</p>

            <p eId="para_3063">The ongoing regulatory programme undertaken by my Department has seen the introduction of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, providing for statutory registration for 12 designated health and social care professional grades.  The structure of the system of statutory registration will comprise a registration board for each of the professions to be registered, a health and social care professionals council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system and a committee to deal with disciplinary matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_3064">As a first step in the implementation of the system of statutory registration, I launched the Health and Social Care Professionals Council in March 2007.  The CEO and an administrative staff member were appointed in 2008 and an additional two senior administrative staff took up duty with the council in late 2009.  These appointments will greatly assist the council in its ongoing work in preparing for the establishment of the individual registration boards, the first of which (the Social Work Registration Board) is to be established shortly.  The council is currently working to put in place the necessary structures for registration, education and fitness to practise for the 12 health and social care professions designated in the Act and it is hoped to bring additional registration boards on stream in late 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_3065">The Health and Social Care Professionals Council will enable health and social care professionals to practise in a regulated, controlled and safe environment and in a manner which will ensure the provision of high-quality interventions, meeting the challenges of increasingly complex and evolving care for service users.  While the proposed system of statutory registration applies, in the first instance to 12 health and social care professions, the legislation empowers the Minister for Health and Children to include, on the basis of specific criteria, additional health and social care professions in the regulatory system by regulation over time, as appropriate.  However, the priority for the Health and Social Care Professionals Council is to establish statutory registration for the 12 designated health and social care professions in the first instance.  The issue of inclusion of other grades, such as psychotherapists, within the scope of statutory registration will be considered after the initial designated 12 professional grades have been fully dealt with.</p>

            <p eId="para_3075">The issue of the presentation of the mandatory nutrition declaration is currently being considered in the context of the EU proposal for a regulation on the provision of food information to consumers.  This proposal was introduced in January 2008.  Since then, it has been discussed at an EU working group, on which Ireland is represented by the Department of Health and Children and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3076">The proposal makes allowance for a mandatory nutrition declaration.  This will compel the Food Business Operator to display the food's energy value, the amounts of fat, saturates, carbohydrates, sugars, proteins and salt.  During the course of the working group's discussions, consideration has been given to the best way in which to present the declaration.  Two of the main forms of presentation are Traffic Lights and Guideline Daily Amounts (GDAs).  The former involves the use of red, yellow and green colours on the label to indicate if a product is healthy or not.  The latter is a more detailed system, involving the display of the percentage of the consumer's Guideline Daily Amount contained in the food, for each of the main nutrients.</p>
            <p eId="para_3077">The group considers that it is difficult to determine a preference for one method of presentation over the other.  While the proposal may not be finalised until late 2010 at the earliest, it seems likely that the group will recommend that both schemes of presentation should be permitted.  Ireland considers this to be the best course of action.</p>

            <p eId="para_3083">My Department meets with Dublin City Council on a regular basis in relation to a number of cycling projects, including the Sutton to Sandycove route, which I am anxious to progress.  I am pleased to report that progress is being made on the route.  A key section of the Sutton to Sandycove route (i.e. from Sir John Rogerson's Quay via the Samuel Beckett Bridge to Fairview) forms part of the Dublin City premium cycle route from Portobello to Fairview Park that I have pledged to support in 2010.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is also providing funding for this section.</p>
            <p eId="para_3084">With regard to other sections of the route I have previously expressed my concern to Dublin City Council about the potential cost of proposals that are emerging in relation to some of these.  I am particularly concerned in relation to any expectation that the provision of premium cycling infrastructure along this route must necessarily involve very substantial costs associated with design approaches which are not appropriate to the current economic circumstances or are primarily related to coastal protection works.  My officials will continue to engage with Dublin City Council to get solutions which offer the best value for money for cycling and walking.</p>

            <p eId="para_3086">My Department, through the then Dublin Transportation Office, supported in 2008 and 2009 the provision of cycling parking facilities in schools which actively participated in An Taisce's Green-Schools Travel Programme and which demonstrated a commitment to the promotion of cycling.  790 spaces in 39 schools were provided in 2008 and a further 1,790 spaces in 114 schools were provided in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3087">Data from that programme indicates that the best results are achieved from providing cycle parking in schools in conjunction with cycling training — which, along with other alternative sustainable travel options, my Department also supports through the programme.  Where this was done, a six-fold increase in cycling rates was achieved in urban schools and almost a three-fold increase in rural schools.  I envisage that support for cycle parking in schools in 2010 will be channelled through the Green Schools Travel Programme and through a number of projects that will be delivered with support from the Smarter Travel Projects Fund.  I am pleased to say that I am making €2 million available this year to support the Green Schools Travel Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3120">As Minister for Transport I feel it is important that the market offers a diverse range of viable maritime links in and out of the State.  This is vital to facilitate trade and tourism.  Ireland has one of the most extensive short sea networks in Europe with multiple operators and various alternative modes of shipping available.  Our roll-on roll-off and ferry services between Ireland and the UK are amongst the most frequently served services in Europe.  Any new services must be market driven.  Over the past decade we have seen a 68% increase in the amount of freight capacity services serving the Ireland to UK and European markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_3121">Ireland is well served by ferry links to the UK and continental Europe.  These links are frequent and competitive.  The services can be viewed on an interactive map on the website of the Irish Maritime Development Office <i>(www.imdo.ie).</i>  The Irish Government encourages intra and inter port competition for ferry services which has been facilitated by the infrastructural and capacity developments at our ports.   Shipping operates in a highly liberalised global market environment, which has enhanced competition on the key Irish routes.  The ongoing development of our shipping network has provided the Irish market with more competition, choice and frequency in accessing the global market place.</p>
            <p eId="para_3122">My Department through its agency the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) continues to support and assist Irish and foreign owners establish new shipping services, providing them with expert market intelligence and analysis.</p>

            <p eId="para_3124">Since 1 December 2009, rail investment in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) is a matter which comes under the remit of the National Transport Authority (NTA).  In regard to rail investment outside the GDA, we have made clear in our renewed programme for Government that we remain committed to the provision of a safe and efficient network of rail services.  A major focus of rail investment in the coming years will be continued investment in the safety of the rail network through the Third Railway Safety Programme, 2009-2013, and I am pleased to say that I have been able to allocate €96 million to this programme in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_3125">In general, given the current difficult funding environment, it will not be possible to progress all the projects in Transport 21 in accordance with the ambitious timescale envisioned at its launch.  I am committed however to maintain investment to the maximum amount possible, and to progress planning where possible so that we are in a position to move swiftly to construction as and when funding becomes available.  This applies in particular to phases 2 and 3 of the Western Rail Corridor, and to the second phase of the Cork commuter rail project, on the Cork-Mallow line.</p>

The carrying out of works on these roads is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_3131">Since 2000, road grants have been paid from my Department's regional and local road grant allocations to local authorities under the Low Cost Safety Improvement Works Scheme for regional and local roads.  Funding is allocated to locations which show possible contributory factors or accident patterns which may respond to low cost road improvements.  In 2009, grants totalling €5.86 million were paid under the scheme to local authorities.  I will announce the 2010 regional and local road grant allocations shortly.</p>

Passenger charges levied at the six regional airports, which are owned and operated independently, are a matter for each airport concerned.  In relation to comparable charges at other European Airports, I have been informed by the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) that independent research indicates that charges at Dublin are towards the lower end of a broad comparison group of the top airports in Europe.

            <p eId="para_3135">In Transport 21, the Government identified the programmes and projects in the national roads, public transport and regional airports sectors that it wished to see prioritised for implementation in the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015 within an overall capital provision of €34 billion.

            <p eId="para_3139">for public transport, the priority is to deliver significantly increased long term capacity to the network through:</p>

            <p eId="para_3181">The persons concerned, a mother and two children, arrived in the State in late 2007 and formally applied for asylum on 27 November 2007. The two children were included as dependants in the mother's asylum application meaning that any decision made in relation to her case applied equally to the children. The asylum application was refused following the consideration of the application by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. A third child was born in the State in early 2008 and this child's application was also refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_3182">Arising from the refusal of the asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, the persons concerned were informed, by letter dated 6 March 2009, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of them. They were given the options, to be exercised within a period of 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to deportation or of submitting written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why Deportation Orders should not be made against them. They were also notified of their entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006. The persons concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection and also submitted representations pursuant to Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999.  The application for Subsidiary Protection was examined following which a decision was taken to refuse the application. This decision was communicated to the persons concerned by letter dated 20 May 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3183">The case of the persons concerned was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 on the prohibition of refoulement. Consideration was given to all representations submitted by and on behalf of the persons concerned and due regard was had for all national and international jurisprudence in terms of the humanitarian aspects of this case.  On 27 May 2009 Deportation Orders were signed in respect of the persons concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_3184">Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) provides the Minister with powers to amend or revoke a Deportation Order.  An application to revoke the Orders in respect of this family was made by its legal representatives on 1 February 2010.  For such an application to be successful it would need to set out new facts or circumstances which have arisen and which were not capable of being advanced at the time the decision to deport was made.  This application will be considered as soon as possible and a decision will be taken to either affirm or revoke the Orders  based on all the information at my disposal.  Once such a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the persons concerned.</p>

The  figures available at the end of 2009 show that there are 1,058 members of the Garda Síochána specifically assigned to community policing, out of a total attested strength of 14,547.  By comparison, at the end of 2007, 630 members were assigned to community policing, and the present number represents an increase of almost 68% on that figure.  Personnel attached to Community Policing are eligible to go forward for promotion through a competitive process which is regulated by the terms of the Garda Síochána (Promotion) Regulations (Statutory Instrument No 485 of 2006). There is no provision for a special promotion system for Community Gardaí.</p>

These members are specifically tasked with the duty of liaising with communities within their policing Districts. The new Garda Síochána National Model of Community Policing was launched early in 2009. This new model is about  renewing, re-invigorating and re-structuring  the community policing function within the Garda Síochána to deliver a consistent national structure to the community policing function; a  more coordinated and efficient Garda service to the community; and the spread of good practices and quality service in community policing on a national basis.  The national strategies for Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert, both of which were launched in 2007, will also inform the organisation on how best to implement future crime prevention programmes and community policing programmes.</p>

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_565">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_3228">The situation with regard to cash escorts and the recovery of costs from the banking industry has developed over the last few years from a situation whereby the banks made a flat contribution, regardless of costs, to the situation that currently obtains, whereby an agreed formula is used to calculate the costs incurred by the State and a mechanism employed which secures close to full recovery of these costs from the banking industry.  In 2005 the costs incurred by the Garda Síochána in respect of cash escorts were in the order of €6.1 million.  The flat contribution made by the banking industry to these costs was €4.25 million (this amount was paid in 2006 — the banks' contribution to the costs of one year is paid in arrears the following year).  The net cost to the Exchequer in respect of cash escorts in 2005 was therefore in the order of €1.85 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_3229">In respect of the costs of cash escorts incurred in 2006 onwards, these are dealt with by the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in May 2007.  This MoU allows for the recovery of the costs of cash escorts from the banks.  The costs are calculated using a formula which takes into account a number of factors including pay and allowances, subsistence, overtime, fuel and transport costs.  The total arrived at is then discounted by 10%.  This discount was agreed on the basis that the Government has always taken the view that there is a public interest issue in relation to the secure movement of cash.  In addition, the decision to provide an escort is made by the Gardaí on an operational basis, not at the request of the banks and the discount acknowledges this.</p>
            <p eId="para_3230">The amounts received from the banking industry since the MoU was signed, in respect of the banks' contribution to the costs of Garda cash escorts, as calculated using the formula described above, are listed below:</p>
            <p eId="para_3231">2006 — €4,997,126;</p>
            <p eId="para_3232">2007 — €4,881,265;</p>
            <p eId="para_3233">2008 — €4,823,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3234">Please note that, as with the 2005 figure of €4.25 million, these payments were all received in the following year to that in which the costs were incurred.  The figure for 2009 is not yet available.</p>

I have been advised that on 5th February 2010 there were 613 prisoners in total serving sentences of definite duration on temporary release.  The numbers of such prisoners on temporary release fluctuates on a daily basis and to date in the year 2010, the numbers have fluctuated between slightly above 500 to slightly above 600.</p>
            <p eId="para_3698">The Criminal Justice Act 1960 as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 sets out the framework for the temporary release of prisoners.  Prisoners may be granted temporary release to assess a person's ability to reintegrate into society, to prepare him or her for release, to assist the Gardaí, on grounds of health, on other humanitarian grounds, to ensure the good government of prison and to maintain good order and humane and just management of the prisons.   All prisoners on temporary release are subject to conditions and are returned to prison if their behaviour gives rise to concern.  Public safety is the paramount consideration in any decision on granting temporary release.</p>

            <p eId="para_3774">The Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for two Votes — Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs), and Vote 29 (International Cooperation) under which most of Ireland's expenditure on Official Development Assistance (ODA) is provided, and which is administered by Irish Aid, the Development Co-operation Division of my Department.  In the case of Vote 28, there are currently three (3) external consultants who provide the following services:</p>
            <p eId="para_3775">Bianconi Research Limited (trading as RITS) provides the Department with high-level expert advice on ICT and communications security which is critical to maintaining the security and integrity of the Department's ICT and communications infrastructure.</p>

            <p eId="para_3778">In the case of Vote 29, at present there are thirty eight (38) consultants under contract to Irish Aid. These provide independent appraisal, audit, monitoring and evaluation of Irish Aid's programmes and projects which involve a wide range of areas and activities. Some of them also provide highly specialised knowledge and advice on matters such as HIV/AIDS, tropical agriculture and climate and other sectors relevant to development cooperation with a focus on African experience.</p>
            <p eId="para_3779">I am very conscious of the need to achieve value for money on consultancy expenditure. The Department commissions consultancies only where specialised knowledge and/or skills are not available within the Department and, particularly in the case of Irish Aid where an independent evaluation of programmes and projects is required. Given the overall scale of the Irish Aid Programme, this level of monitoring, review and evaluation is both prudent and proportionate.</p>

            <p eId="para_3781">The query referred to by the Deputy relates to funding under the Government's aid programme for an Irish Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), which received funding of €200,900 from Irish Aid in 2004 for a two-year training programme to benefit young adults with disabilities in Eastern Europe. In response to concerns about how aspects of the programme were being managed, Irish Aid carried out a detailed evaluation and audit review, which was completed in February 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3782">The evaluation and audit review highlighted a number of management issues and found that a proportion of the Irish Aid funding had not been sufficiently accounted for. All the recommendations in the report were followed up in detail with the NGO, resulting in the reallocation of funding identified as not allowable under the terms of the original grant, to support substantial additional training programmes agreed with Irish Aid. These programmes were completed in August 2009. Final reports have been received by Irish Aid, and all funding has been fully accounted for.</p>
            <p eId="para_3783">In this case, the evaluation and audit review initiated by Irish Aid found no evidence of misappropriation of funds, or of fraud. Irish Aid, which is managed by the Development Cooperation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs, operates on the basis of very rigorous audit procedures, which are designed to ensure that all funding under the aid programme is used for the purpose intended, achieving value for money for the taxpayer. The Irish Aid internal audit unit is an independent unit which operates to the highest professional standards and in accordance with best international practice. Its work programme is shared with the Comptroller and Auditor General and is overseen by the independent Audit Committee of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which also follows up on the implementation of audit recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3784">The Fraud Policy of the Department of Foreign Affairs requires that, following investigation, and where appropriate, instances of suspected fraud are reported to the Garda, the Comptroller and Auditor General, or to the relevant authorities in other countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_3788">The Irish World Heritage Centre in Manchester is operated by the Irish Diaspora Foundation Ltd. (IDF). The organisation is in the process of developing a new facility intended to replace the existing Irish Centre in the Cheetham Hill area of Manchester.  The Government has provided extensive capital funding totalling €2.01million to the organisation for this project over recent years.  This included separate grants provided under the Emigrant Support Programme of €775,000 and €600,000 in 2007 and 2008 respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_3789">Funding was not provided in 2009 as progress in advancing the project slowed against the background of the difficult financial and economic situation.

Our Embassy in London is in regular contact with the Irish World Heritage Centre and has reported that significant progress has been achieved over recent months.  Applications for the 2010 Emigrant Support Programme grant round can be submitted on-line between mid-March and mid- April.  The precise opening and closing dates will be advertised in due course.  The organisation referred to by the Deputy will have an opportunity to submit an application for additional funding through this process and all applications will be given full consideration by this Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_3791">I am deeply concerned about the disappearance of Mr. Gao Zhisheng, a prominent Chinese human rights lawyer.  As has been reported in this House on many previous occasions, human rights issues in China, including individual cases, are regularly discussed on a bilateral basis with the Chinese Government, both in Beijing and in Dublin.  The Government continues to stress at such meetings the great importance attached by Ireland to human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, and to urge the Chinese authorities to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_3792">A broad-ranging EU-China human rights dialogue enables the EU to engage with China on such issues as freedom of expression, the death penalty, the independence of the judiciary, prison conditions, freedom of religion and minority rights as well as individual cases.  I note with deep concern that Mr. Gao Zhisheng has now been missing for over a year from his home in Shaanxi province and that on the two occasions on which he has been sighted since that time, the last of which was June 2009, he was accompanied by police officers. Since June, it has not been possible for either members of his family or his professional colleagues to make contact with him.  In the period since his disappearance, the EU has repeatedly called on the Chinese authorities to reveal his whereabouts. His case has been raised during the last two meetings of the EU-China Human Rights dialogue, held in Prague on 14 May 2009 and in Beijing on 20 November 2009 respectively.  We have called on the Chinese authorities to give Mr Gao Zhisheng access to legal advice and to allow him to maintain contact with his family. We have urged them to clarify without delay his present situation and to open a fully independent and transparent investigation into his disappearance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3793">Unfortunately, no firm response has been received from the Chinese authorities to our representations. Mr. Gao Zhisheng's current location and physical condition remain unknown, a year after contact with him was first lost. I am very concerned about this case and have instructed that it be raised bilaterally with the Chinese authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_3795">NGOs operating in the Occupied Palestinian Territories perform a vital role in trying to mitigate and ease the burden of the occupation on the Palestinian people, provide for their physical well-being in circumstances where economic life and opportunities are severely constrained, and attempt to redress some of the injustices of occupation policies. Without their work the likelihood of the increasing pressures resulting in renewed violence would be very much greater, and they are therefore clearly of benefit to both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, and help provide the breathing space in which the current search for a peaceful settlement can take place.</p>
            <p eId="para_3796">Experienced and highly qualified international staff form the backbone of international NGOs and UN operations, and international staff and volunteers contribute strongly to the work of Israeli and especially Palestinian NGOs.  Despite difficulties, in general it has been possible up to now for staff working with international NGOs to obtain B1 visas, allowing them to work in Israel and Palestine, but staff with Palestinian NGOs have had to work under much more varied and irregular status, or sometimes none.</p>
            <p eId="para_3797">In recent months I have become aware of reports of more restricted practices by the Israeli authorities in issuing visas to staff of international NGOs.  They are being issued, often with considerable delays, with B2 visas entitling them to visit but not to work in Israel, with the implication being that working in Palestinian areas is a matter for the Palestinian Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_3798">In addition to the increased bureaucracy and lack of transparency of the changed system, which seems to reflect a greater pressure generally on NGOs, the issuing of B2 visas causes a real difficulty in relation to East Jerusalem, which is considered by the Israeli authorities to be part of Israel. Many NGOs work among the predominantly Palestinian population of East Jerusalem, while international staff working in other parts of the West Bank often live there.  The position of both NGOs and staff, and movements through the maze of restrictions around the greater Jerusalem area, are made considerably more difficult by this change.</p>
            <p eId="para_3799">The Irish Missions in Tel Aviv and Ramallah have been closely following this development in concert with our EU partners and through contacts with the NGO community.  The exact scope and effect of the new rules are still being established. Together with our EU partners we are considering what action we can take.  A very important consideration in this regard is that we should be careful that any action in this highly complex area does not make matters worse.  The basic position of principle is quite clear: for as long as Israel remains in occupation of the Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, it should facilitate unhindered access to those areas by international staff seeking to help the Palestinian people living under that occupation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3801">The consolidation of peace in Northern Ireland and the promotion of partnership and co-operation between both traditions on the island of Ireland is a key policy priority for the Irish Government. In this regard, mutual understanding of the history and culture of the two main traditions is an important building block in fostering reconciliation on the island.  This rich historical and cultural heritage is not the exclusive preserve of the communities in the North alone but is also shared on an island-wide basis.  This is manifested in the numerous historical buildings, local museums and interpretative centres, many of which are owned and operated by the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3802">The Government is committed to deepening the understanding of our shared history. Of particular importance has been the construction of a visitor centre at the Battle of the Boyne site in Oldbridge, Co. Meath, in recognition of the historical significance of the site.  The Centre was opened on 6 May 2008 and has already made a significant contribution towards breaking down the barriers of misunderstanding and mistrust and fostering lasting reconciliation between the traditions on the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_3803">In addition to the Government investment in the Oldbridge site, the Reconciliation Fund, administered by my Department, aims to assist organisations involved in reconciliation work and efforts to create better understanding between people on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.  Some of the projects funded in recent years have explored the history and culture of the two main traditions on the island. Examples include:</p>
            <p eId="para_3804">The Saint Patrick Centre, a permanent exhibition in Downpatrick dedicated to Ireland's Patron Saint, which provides reconciliation and education programmes to thousands of children in Northern Ireland every year as well as running cross border and international youth programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3805">Support for organisations such as Cooperation Ireland, Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation, Meath Peace Group and the Irish Peace Institute, which facilitates cross border exchange programmes that explore cultural differences between the communities on the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_3806">The Commemoration Initiative Fund, operated by the Department of the Taoiseach, provides funding to assist individuals or groups in organising the commemoration of individuals or events of historic importance.  Funding under this scheme in 2009 was committed towards the cost of the Mayo Peace Park, a publication to mark the 150th anniversary of the founding of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the commemoration of the bicentenary of the birth of William Gladstone and a conference on the plural Protestant traditions in Ireland.  Previous initiatives included marking the 90th anniversary of the Easter Rising and the Battle of the Somme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3807">Finally, as the island moves into a decade marking the centenary of historical events which have been seminal in the evolution of the history and culture of the two main traditions on the island, the Department of the Taoiseach is engaged with other Departments and agencies on the preparation of a centenary commemorative programme.  While centred on the Easter Rising, it will also include the centenary of the start of World War I in 2014 and the centenary of the Battle of the Somme in 2016. The Minister for Defence is chair of the Oireachtas all-party consultation group on centenary commemorations.</p>

            <p eId="para_3823">Under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, which is administered by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism grant aid to a maximum of €3.8 million is provided to Local Authorities towards the capital costs of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost.  Proposals must comply with the standards set out in the Department's "Procedures for the Planning, Approval and Financing of Swimming Pools and Technical Guidelines."</p>
            <p eId="para_3824">Under the Guidelines there are four principal stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study.  These, in order of progress, are: Preliminary Report; Contract Documents; Tender and Construction.  Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and is capped at the time of allocation.  The Department and its technical advisors, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and Local Authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from the Department of Arts, Sport &amp; Tourism.  The current round of the programme has been closed to new applicants since July 2000.  An allocation of €7.5m has been provided to meet commitments under the current round arising in 2010.  No decision has been taken on the timing of a new round of the programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4783">I propose to take Questions Nos. 384 to 389, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4784">Under the current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme which closed to applicants on 31 July, 2000, no application was received from Dublin City Council on behalf of Crumlin, Coolock or Sean McDermott Street swimming pools.  Since then a number of discussions have taken place with Dublin City Council relating to a number of pool projects, which the Council wish to develop in the event of a new round of the Programme being opened.</p>
            <p eId="para_4785">The question of the management of these swimming pools is entirely a matter for Dublin City Council.  The current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, operated by my Department, provides grant aid to a maximum of €3.8m to Local Authorities, towards the capital cost of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools.  As already stated, the current round of the programme closed to applicants on 31 July 2000.  Under the programme, 45 pools have been opened throughout the country with a further 12 pools at various stages of development.  In the administrative area of Dublin City Council, new pools have been opened in Finglas, Ballyfermot, St. Michael's House, Belcamp Lane Dublin 24, Ballymun and work is underway on a new pool at Rathmines.  No decision has been taken on the timing of a new round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.  When a new round of the Programme is launched it will be open to all Local Authorities, including Dublin City Council on behalf of Crumlin, Coolock and Sean McDermott Street Swimming Pools, to submit an application under the terms that will apply.</p>

            <p eId="para_4787">The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulation S.I. No. 299 of 2007 and in particular Part 3 of said Regulation dealing with Electricity matters sets out the required levels of compliance in relation to the operation of electrical systems and appliances.  Section 75 of this Regulation specifies to whom it applies. As it relates to this Department there are two applicants. In relation to the design, installation and maintenance of electrical systems for the Department's office premises, the Office of Public Works have responsibility for ensuring that all electrical installations conform to the required standards and for testing and certification of these installations as necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_4788">Regarding the general usage of electrical equipment and, more specifically, portable electrical equipment, the Regulation also applies to staff of the Department. In accordance with Section 81 of the Regulation, which addresses portable electrical equipment, the Department ensures that such equipment is maintained in a manner fit for safe use and is not used for work activities precluded under the Regulation. The Department has engaged external risk assessors to consider all aspects of health and safety, including the usage of such equipment, as part of the production of the required Safety Statements for its offices and has appropriately addressed issues as highlighted.</p>
            <p eId="para_4789">The Department, through its Health and Safety structures and mechanisms, also carries out its own periodic risk assessments and the results of these assessments are available to staff and State or other authorities as required.  In respect of the agencies under the aegis of the Department, the question as raised is an operational matter for the agencies themselves.</p>

The SIDOs were appointed on two-year contracts to provide opportunities for persons with a disability to participate in sport and physical activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_4792">A network of 33 LSPs have been set up throughout the country by the Irish Sports Council (ISC) to coordinate and promote sport at local level especially amongst specific target groups such as older people, girls and women, people with disabilities, unemployed people, and those who live in identified disadvantaged communities.  The special dormant accounts funding was in addition to the annual funding provided to the LSPs by the ISC for programmes and initiatives aimed at increasing participation in recreational sport.  Of the €2.5 million allocated from the dormant accounts fund for the SIDO scheme, €800,000 was provided through my Department's Vote in 2008 and over €1.3 million in 2009.  The final provision of €395,000 from the dormant accounts allocation is included in the 2010 Vote of my Department.  The continued funding of the SIDO scheme is being considered by the ISC in the context of the distribution of its budget for 2010.</p>

All staff who availed of the scheme signed up in 2009.  There is no discernible cost to the Department's vote in administering the scheme.  The bicycles and equipment are paid for by way of salary sacrifice.  There would be minor costs in processing forms and in carrying the upfront costs until such time as those are offset by the gradual deductions from salary.  Neither of these is quantifiable.  The only material cost to the State is the tax relief inherent in the scheme.  The total amount sanctioned to date by way of cycle purchases for staff of this Department is €5,133.</p>

            <p eId="para_4796">Expenditure on various aspects of the National Drugs Strategy in 2009, across a range of Departments and agencies, was in the region of €275m.  All of the organisations involved are committed to the implementation of the Strategy and, in this context, my Department will be monitoring the overall implementation of the Strategy through progress on individual actions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4797">Departments and agencies are in the process of finalising their allocations to the relevant areas of the National Drugs Strategy at present and my Department is pursuing the completion of this process.  With reductions in the level of public spending generally, it is likely that the overall spend in the drugs area in 2010 will be marginally down on the 2009 level.  However, through my co-ordination role across the Strategy, I am working to ensure that the optimum use is made of the available resources, which will again total a substantial amount.  As part of this, every effort will be made to protect front-line services to the greatest extent possible.</p>

The average annual grant is €20,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_4810">This funding initiative has proved extremely successful in raising the profile and perceived status of the Irish language at home and abroad, and in opening up opportunities for personal and career development for young Irish language teachers and other professionals. It also develops positive links at Governmental and university level between Ireland and other participating countries, as well as the interpersonal contacts that are so important in the long-term in ensuring a positive awareness of Ireland among our EU partners and further afield.</p>
            <p eId="para_4811">I would mention in particular the two-way exchanges promoted via our participation in the Fulbright Commission's programme and in partnership with the Ireland-Canada University Foundation. Aside from the value in terms of promotion of the language, there is a direct economic return in cultural tourism terms, as many of the international students who study Irish in their home institutions will continue their studies here in Ireland.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_4813">My Department is responsible for the delivery of Axes 3 &amp; 4 of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP) for which overall funding of the order of €425m is available. The €40m allocation for 2010 represents an increase of approximately 120% on expenditure in 2009.  In order to maximise the impact of the funding available to communities on the ground, the administration/animation budget has been capped at €12m this year. In overall terms, this is roughly 10.5% less than that available for 2009. As a result, all groups will see a percentage decrease in the level of such funding available to them this year and, while I accept that this may present a challenge to some groups, my Department will continue to keep the matter under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_4814">The Deputy will appreciate that it is imperative, particularly in the current economic climate, that the RDP maximises the funding available for projects on the ground that will improve the quality of life in rural areas and will ensure the diversification of the rural economy. In this regard, my Department is working very closely with individual Local Action Groups to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of the RDP. I am confident that with prudent financial management, groups can continue to deliver an efficient and effective service to their local communities within the administration/animation funding that has been made available to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_4815">Co. Kilkenny LEADER Partnership Ltd has been allocated administration/animation funding of €345,712 for 2010 and was notified of this funding on 1st February last. Taking account of unspent 2009 administration/animation funds retained by the group, the overall 2010 allocation amounts to approximately €366k, which represents a decrease of a little over 8%.  Payments of administration/animation funding commenced to all groups in early January and will continue on a regular basis throughout the year.  Payments for projects are continuing on an ongoing basis as claims are submitted and I expect that all project commitments properly made for 2010 will be met.</p>

            <p eId="para_4819">My Department was established in June 2002 and this reply covers the period from that date onwards.  No companies have been granted contracts by my Department for projects worth €10 million or more in the period in question.  However, for the sake of completeness, I should inform the Deputy that my Department has entered into certain contracts with aggregate values of over €10 million with a number of Local Action Groups under the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013, but such contracts relate to programme measures, rather than to individual projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_4820">In addition, my Department has paid amounts in excess of €10 million in total to both Galway and Mayo County Councils towards the development of Caladh Mór pier, Inis Meáin, and Cill Rónáin pier, Inis Mór, in Co. Galway, and Clare Island and Inishturk Island piers in Co. Mayo. In those cases, the relevant contracts to the companies carrying out the works were awarded by the local authorities, rather than by my Department. A breakdown of this expenditure on an annual basis is provided in the table.  It should be noted that further payments will issue to Galway County Council in 2010 in respect of Cill Rónáin pier, where works are ongoing.</p>

            <p eId="para_4857">On 4 February 2010, I announced that I had approved the release of the company <i>Tithe Saoire Chléire Teo</i> from its contract with my Department to provide subsidised passenger and cargo ferry services to Cléire with effect from 28 February 2010.  The decision to terminate the contract was taken on foot of an application made by the company itself and had regard to my Department’s assessment of the feasibility of seeking to enforce the continuation of the contract or, alternatively, of making other arrangements for the provision of the ferry service.</p>
            <p eId="para_4858">In this regard, I also announced on the same day that an interim arrangement has been made by my Department with the consortium <i>Naomh Ciarán II Oileán Chléire Teo/Thar Tonn Teo</i> to provide a ferry service for Cléire for a nine month period from 1 March to 30 November 2010 at a total cost of €209,322.  <i>Naomh Ciarán 11 Oileán Chléire Teo</i> had provided a subsidised ferry service for the island prior to the existing contract coming into effect on 1st March 2007 and was the only other company to compete for it at the time.  It is my Department’s intention to seek public tenders during the interim period in order to put a long-term ferry contract in place for the island from 1 December 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4859">It is my view that the interim service, together with a grant of €35,000 approved by me in 2009 to enable the Sherkin Island Development Society to establish a new heavy cargo service for Cléire, Sherkin, Heir and Long Islands, will ensure that the Cléire community enjoys ferry services on a par with those provided to other islands off our coast. I understand that the heavy cargo service commenced late last month.</p>

Due to the success of the campaign, I have again made funding available in 2010 to keep the phone line open and, already this year, there have been a further 138 calls.  Over the coming months I will be reviewing various options for further promotional campaigns, perhaps through a more centralised approach or though potential linkages with other campaigns and fora.</p>

            <p eId="para_4863">My Department is responsible for the delivery of Axes 3 &amp; 4 of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP) for which overall funding of the order of €425m is available. The €40m allocation for 2010 represents an increase of approximately 120% on expenditure in 2009.  In order to maximise the impact of the funding available to communities on the ground, the administration/animation budget has been capped at €12m this year. In overall terms, this is roughly 10.5% less than that available for 2009. As a result, all groups will see a percentage decrease in the level of such funding available to them this year and, while I accept that this may present a challenge to some groups, my Department will continue to keep the matter under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_4864">The Deputy will appreciate that it is imperative, particularly in the current economic climate, that the RDP maximises the funding available for projects on the ground that will improve the quality of life in rural areas and will ensure the diversification of the rural economy. In this regard, my Department is working very closely with individual Local Action Groups to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of the Programme. I am confident that with prudent financial management, groups can continue to deliver an efficient and effective service to their local communities within the administration/animation funding that has been made available to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_4865">The group to which the Deputy refers has been allocated administration/animation funding of €345,712 for 2010 and was notified of this funding on 1st February last. Taking account of unspent 2009 administration/animation funds retained by the group, the overall 2010 allocation amounts to approximately €366k, which represents a decrease of a little over 8%.  Payments of administration/animation funding commenced to all groups in early January and will continue on a regular basis throughout the year. Payments for projects are continuing on an ongoing basis as claims are submitted and all project commitments properly made for 2010 will be met.</p>

            <p eId="para_4924">Jobseeker's Allowance is a means tested social assistance scheme operated by my Department. For means test purposes, account is taken of the income and assets of both the claimant and his or her spouse/partner including the earnings of the spouse.</p>
            <p eId="para_4925">Where a spouse/partner has earnings from employment, earnings less PRSI contributions, pension contributions and trade union subscriptions are assessed as means. In addition, the first €20 per day is also disregarded, subject to a maximum of €60 per week and 60% of the balance is assessed where a claimant or a spouse/partner has income from employment. This means, for example where a spouse/partner is working three days a week and earning €200 per week, only €84 is assessed as means thereby ensuring that there is always an incentive to take up, or remain in, employment. The provision of any further disregards in relation to health insurance premiums or travel expenses would have to be considered in a Budgetary context and having regard to the level of existing incentive to take up employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4926">No account is taken of mortgage repayments in calculating means for social assistance schemes generally, including jobseeker's allowance. This would be inappropriate given that there is a specific social assistance scheme, the mortgage interest supplement scheme, which provides, subject to certain conditions, support for people who have difficulty meeting their mortgage repayments and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The mortgage interest scheme takes into account all of the person's income, including social welfare income when calculating levels of entitlement. Accordingly, the net effect of disregarding mortgage interest repayments in calculating means for jobseeker's allowance purposes would be to reduce the level of entitlement to mortgage interest supplement as the income of the person would be higher due to a higher level of jobseeker's allowance being in payment. Mortgage Interest Supplement is not payable to people in full time employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4927">There are no plans to change the assessment of means for jobseeker's allowance or any other scheme so as to take mortgage interest repayments into account and it is appropriate that the mortgage interest supplement scheme remains the primary mechanism for supporting people who have difficulty making their repayments.</p>

            <p eId="para_4944">The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme is administered on behalf of the department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE).

The HSE has advised that the person concerned appealed against the decision to refuse her SWA to the HSE Appeals Officer.  The HSE Appeals Officer upheld the decision in December 2009 to refuse SWA and the person concerned was advised of her right to appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).  She lodged an appeal with the SWAO in December 2009.  The person concerned will be advised of the outcome as soon as a decision has been given in this case.  In the meantime, SWA is not payable.</p>

In addition, the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme provides support for persons who are unable to meet their needs.  If entitlement to this payment was to be removed, this would mean that the welfare system would not be in a position to provide support to a person even when they were unable to meet their basic needs in a given period.  Such a step would represent a major change to the underlying principles of the SWA scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4991">Child benefit is payable to the person with whom a qualified child normally resides.   The detailed rules in relation to ‘normal residence' as set out in article 159 of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Claims, Payments and Control) Regulations, 2007.  In summary, child benefit is normally payable to the <i>mother</i> (or stepmother). However, where the child is living full-time with the father (or stepfather) only, then child benefit will be payable to the father. Where the parents reside in separate households child benefit is payable to the parent with whom the child resides the majority of the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_4992">There are very few child benefit claims in payment to the father in situations where the parents live together. (Approx. 40-50)  These payments are made in circumstances such as where the mother is terminally ill or is an alcoholic or drug addict.  Since June 2008, with the introduction of EIT payments, this is facilitated by issuing a letter to the spouse allowing him to collect the payments at the Post Office using the mother's Social Services Card.  He has to produce this letter and the SS card at the Post Office in order to collect the payment.  In EFT cases, the spouse would normally have access to the bank account or the mother would agree to transfer the payment to his account.</p>

This payment is made to families whose child(ren) aged 18 are getting a Disability Allowance or if:</p>
            <p eId="para_5027">In receipt of a social welfare payment which includes an increase for the child aged 18;</p>

            <p eId="para_5029">The compensatory payment is €15 per week and will be paid on the 3rd Monday of each month by the Child Benefit section.  Budget 2010 revised downwards the rates of payment of Child Benefit.  In compensation for this reduction, an increase of €3.80 per week in Qualified Child Increase for people who are dependent on a weekly social welfare payment was also introduced, thereby ensuring that overall child related payments to these customers remained the same.

            <p eId="para_5039">The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme is administered on behalf of the department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  A person may qualify for basic supplementary welfare allowance:</p>

            <p eId="para_5049">Claims under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme, which includes the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme, are dealt with by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive.  Each claim under the SWA scheme is decided by the Community Welfare Officer based on the particular circumstances of each case.  A person who is not satisfied with the decision of the Community Welfare Officer can appeal the decision to the HSE Appeals Office.  The person, if not satisfied with the decision of the HSE Appeals Office may make a further appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office in most instances.</p>
            <p eId="para_5050">In relation to jobseekers allowance a self-employed person is not required to cease trading before they can qualify for jobseekers allowance.  A self-employed person can apply for Jobseekers Allowance if their business ceases or if their income falls as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  Jobseekers allowance is a means-tested payment and any person who satisfies the means test and the other conditions of entitlement will qualify for a payment.  As with claims under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme it is open to an individual, if he or she is dissatisfied with a decision made on their jobseekers allowance claim to appeal the decision.  In the case of jobseekers allowance claims, the appeal can be made to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_5051">Family income supplement (FIS) is designed to provide income support for employees on low earnings with families.  This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments.  Self employed people do not qualify for FIS.  Any extension of FIS to other categories of persons such as self-employed persons would have to be considered in a budgetary context.  There are no plans for such an extension in present circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_5055">The Child Benefit (CB) scheme has, in recent years, experienced significant expansion in the volume of claims received, the rates of payment and the diversity of the customer base.  The primary reason for the various types of review is to ensure that CB customers are made aware of their obligations with regard to their continued entitlement.  A fraud and error survey on child benefit highlighted in the case of 500 Irish Nationals surveyed, the extent of fraud that arose was 1.7% as compared to 13.9% in the case of 500 non-Irish Nationals surveyed, giving an overall level of fraud of 2.3% when weighted against the scheme client base.</p>
            <p eId="para_5056">The control policy for the child benefit scheme was reviewed to ensure that controls against fraud and abuse of the scheme continue to be effective and relevant.  As a result of this review, enhanced and updated control measures have been devised, which include the automated issue of forms (certificates) to sub-sets of selected groups of customers for completion to confirm they continue to satisfy the conditions for receipt of Child Benefit.  Employment certificates are issued every three months, to everyone paid under EU regulation 1408/71, irrespective of nationality (and including Irish nationals), to ensure that such customers continue to qualify for Child Benefit from this State.  Residency certificates are issued every three months to all non-Irish national claimants, living with their children in Ireland and to all nationalities who are paid Irish Child Benefit based on their entitlements under EU regulation 1408/71.  Information on a customer's nationality is provided by the customer.</p>

            <p eId="para_5110">The statutory requirement is that equipment "exposed to conditions causing deterioration liable to result in danger" and with a rated voltage exceeding 125 volts, requires testing.  Typical office equipment used in the Department would not fit into this category.  The Department has the matter under review, however, having regard to the degree of risk involved and will put a more formal system of inspection in place if this is proven to be necessary.  In the meantime, the Department has in place a system of risk assessment designed to identify at an early stage equipment which is not fit for purpose and which should either be taken completely out of service or repaired.</p>
            <p eId="para_5111">With regard to agencies operating under the aegis of the Department or entities to which it gives grant aid, implementation of the provisions of the regulation is a matter for the relevant agencies as part of their normal operational activities.  In accordance with Department of Finance Public Financial Procedures, the Exchequer carries its own insurance and the State Claims Agency manages delegated claims and counterclaims on behalf of the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_5328">The intention of the Social Housing Leasing Initiative is to widen the range of supply options available to authorities to meet housing need and to maximise the level of social housing that can be delivered from within available public resources.  Under the initiative housing authorities and approved housing bodies can procure properties on long term leases of 10 to 20 years in order to meet housing need.</p>
            <p eId="para_5329">The procedure for allocating units acquired under the leasing initiative will be the standard allocations procedure used for the letting of any local authority housing — the local authority's "Scheme of Letting Priorities."  The only exception to this will be where an approved housing body has agreed with the local authority to let the properties via a choice based lettings model. In these cases the approved body will advertise the leased properties to eligible households once the lease agreement has been finalised and signed.  Households accommodated under the leasing arrangements, as with any social housing, will be deemed to have had their housing need met and therefore households will not remain on the local authority housing waiting lists. Notwithstanding this, households will be able to apply to transfer to alternative local authority properties, including housing provided for the Incremental Purchase Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5330">In relation to the cost or level of payment that is allowed for under the leasing initiative, the cost to a local authority of a leased unit is determined by a variety of factors, including type and size, location and the average rent of properties in the area.  The primary focus in negotiating leasing costs is the delivery of value for money and I expect that authorities should be able to secure leasing costs of at least 20% below market value.  This reflects the element of risk, such as the vacancies and management and maintenance responsibilities, being transferred to the housing authority.  The property owner will remain responsible for any structural matters.</p>

            <p eId="para_5390">The European Court of Justice in July 2009 delivered its judgment in a case against Ireland in respect of the charging of VAT by public bodies on certain economic activities.  The court ruled that public bodies must charge VAT on a range of services to avoid distorting the market between private and public operators.  The judgment has implications for all public bodies in Ireland, including local authorities.  The Finance Bill 2010 includes legislation to amend the current legal provisions in this area and the proposed commencement date is 1 July 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_5391">My Department is participating in an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of Finance and including the Revenue Commissioners, on the interpretation of the judgment and its implications for local authorities.  A working group of departmental and local authority Finance Officers has been established also to deal with implementation issues in the local government sector.  Businesses that are registered for VAT are entitled to recover VAT incurred on their business inputs. Consequently, the extension of VAT to local authority provided services will have no impact on those businesses.  Local authorities will be entitled also to deduct VAT on their inputs from the commencement date which should enable them to minimise increases in service costs to be passed on to their customers.</p>

            <p eId="para_5393">It should be noted that planning permission granted since mid-2008 would generally remain valid for a period of five years, beginning on the date of the grant of permission.  Section 42 of the Planning and Development Acts 2000–2009 provides that the duration of a planning permission may be extended, subject to certain conditions, where substantial works have been carried out before the expiration of the original permission.  The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill amends section 42 to provide, subject to certain conditions, for the possibility of an extension of permission, for a period of up to five years, in circumstances where substantial works have not been carried out, but there are commercial, economic or technical considerations, beyond the control of the applicant, which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works.  It is intended that this provision should apply to applications for extension of permission received after the commencement of the said provision of the Act.</p>

            <p eId="para_5399">More than 1,400 prospective purchasers formally registered interest on the dedicated home choice loan website with 44 applications being made over the course of 2009.  Of these, four loan applications were approved with a combined value in excess of €800,000.  In terms of available budget for the scheme, it is important to note the scheme is demand led.  As such, no budget has been set and no moneys that could be deployed elsewhere have been ring fenced for the scheme.  The extent of the loan book arising will depend solely on the level of uptake over the duration of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5400">Loan finance is drawn down, as appropriate, by local authorities from the Housing Finance Agency and on-lent to successful applicants.  Costs of approximately €280,000 were incurred in 2009 in establishing the scheme, including the setting up of the central processing unit within the Affordable Homes Partnership.  These costs were met fully from within existing resources within the partnership.  A total of four people across the entire system, which covers all local authority areas, have been employed to roll-out the scheme.  A significant element of the staffing costs was incurred in the development of the loan processing model which applies to the Home Choice Loan but which has also now been used in the development of revised systems for processing and credit checking of normal local authority house purchase loan applications under other schemes such as affordable housing, shared ownership etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_5401">The scheme has already been revised this year with the inclusion, as of 1 January 2010, of second hand houses to reflect the recent shift in first time buyer preferences, possibly as a result of improved affordability given price decreases and historically low interest rates. I also reduced income limits from €40,000 to €35,000 for single applicants and from €50,000 to €45,000 for joint applicants.  I do not expect additional administrative costs to arise from the extension of the scheme.  I will continue to review and monitor all aspects of the scheme. Once I am satisfied that the current constrained mortgage market has improved the scheme will be discontinued.</p>

            <p eId="para_5426">I have received correspondence from a number of stakeholders regarding certain aspects of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 and proposing specific amendments; these are under consideration in my Department.   The Bill is currently at Second Stage in the Dáil and may be further amended as it passes through the remaining stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The interaction between the Planning and Development Act and the Regional Planning Guidelines (RPGs), which are currently being reviewed, is set out in reply to Question No. 598 on today's order paper. I have also recently written to the Cathaoirligh of all regional and local authorities regarding the ongoing review of the RPGs and addressing concerns regarding the impact of the new RPGs on future growth across the regions.</p>

            <p eId="para_5438">The Planning and Development (Regional Planning Guidelines) Direction 2008 which issued on 19 December 2008 under section 21 of the Planning Acts, instructed regional authorities to review and update Regional Planning Guidelines (RPGs) for their regions.  The review and update is due to be completed with the adoption of new RPGs within each region by mid-2010, including for the south-west region.  These guidelines will set a strategic planning framework for development plans within each regional authority area over the 12-year period from 2010 to 2022.</p>
            <p eId="para_5439">The Planning and Development Act requires that the RPGs must address, <i>inter alia</i>, projected population trends and in this context the 2004 RPGs, having regard to the population scenarios set out in the National Spatial Strategy, proposed population distributions for key urban centres in the respective regions in order to guide development within the overall regional and national strategic policy framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_5440">To inform the review process and assist regional authorities, my Department published new national population projections in January 2009 including regional population targets for the years 2010, 2016 and 2022 which take account of the changed economic climate and the likely impact of reduced in-migration, rising unemployment and a more constrained financial situation on demographic trends.  In October 2009, my Department published specific Gateway and Hub population targets which were derived from the January 2009 national and regional population targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_5441">It is a matter for each Regional Authority together with the constituent City and County Councils to determine population targets for county towns, other smaller towns, villages and rural areas, within their respective regional targets, which will in turn inform the demand for housing over the period and the requirements for development land, taking account of such matters as available vacant housing units within their area.</p>

            <p eId="para_5443">The Report of the Irish Energy Research Council identified the need for Irish research funders and researchers to engage in co-ordination, networking, and collaboration in relation to their energy research activities.  The Council recommended that the development of such links with relevant institutions and bodies should be encouraged and promoted on the island, at both EU and IEA level and internationally.  Irish energy researchers collaborate internationally on an ongoing basis and, in some cases, Irish third level institutions are partners in formal arrangements with such international institutions for the purposes of specific research projects, particularly where EU research funding is concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_5465">There is currently 1,260 MW+ of wind power generating plant connected to the national grid.  These projects have already secured planning permission and connection offers.  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) Decision on the "Gate 3" process provides for a further connection offers for 3900 MWs of additional renewable electricity capacity (mainly wind power).  Connection offers for Gate 3 began to issue in December 2009 and will continue until mid 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_5466">Matters relating to planning permission for wind turbines are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I can however, inform the Deputy that in February 2007 exemptions from the requirement to apply for planning permission were introduced for small wind turbines under Statutory Instrument S.I. No. 83 of 2007 "Planning and Development Regulations 2007").  A number of restrictions applied to these exemptions which are set out below.</p>
            <p eId="para_5467">The Statutory Instrument amends Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 (S.I. No. 600 of 2001) by the substitution of the following for Class 2:</p>

            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_5471">3. The rotor diameter shall not exceed 6 metres.</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_5472">4. The supporting tower shall be a distance of not less than the total structure height (including the blade of the turbine at the highest point of its arc) plus one metre from any party boundary.</p>

            <p eId="para_5475">The Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government published a Consultation paper on additional proposed planning exemptions for micro-renewable energy technologies for industrial, commercial, public and agricultural buildings in October 2007.  Following consultation, Statutory Instrument 235 of 2008 ("Planning and Development Regulations 2008") introduced further exemptions for certain classes of renewable energy and CHP installations.  These further exemptions for wind generators and related restrictions are as follows:</p>

In relation to the 16 sites included in the project, 14 were in the Republic of Ireland and two were in Northern Ireland.  Of the fourteen sites in the Republic, a combination of native woodland restoration work and new planting was carried out at thirteen sites while restoration work only was carried out at one site.  An audit of the sites during Autumn 2007 indicated that sites were well managed and forests planted in 2000 are progressing well.

It is not known how many of these students would qualify under any extension of the Free Fees Initiative as this would be determined by the eligibility criteria that would apply to such a scheme, including for example, residency, nationality, previous higher education attainment etc. The availability of free fees would also be likely to impact on future demand for access to higher education on a part-time basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_5651">Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that any estimate of costs is very tentative depending on the range of variables referred to. The annual revenue that is currently generated by part-time tuition fees amounts to some €40 million. In addition, taking into account the associated unit funding cost implications for colleges as well as the likely growth in numbers, it is tentatively estimated that such factors could bring costs up to €100 million per annum.</p>

            <p eId="para_5653">I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to the Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) pilot scheme funded by my Department which funds 13 stand-alone autism centres.  The scheme was set up in the absence of the current national network of autism-specific special classes in our schools.  The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children including those with autism can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including ABA, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. As each child with autism is unique it is important that children have access to a range of interventions so their broader needs can be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_5654">In excess of 380 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level by my Department in conjunction with National Council Special Education (NCSE), while more are being set up as required. At primary level there are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants. Extra assistants are provided where the children need them on a case by case basis. In addition, there are in the region of 3,300 children with autism who are receiving additional teaching and/or special needs assistant support in mainstream schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_5655">The Deputy will be aware that the 2007/2012 Programme for Government commits to the long-term funding for the centres that are currently in the ABA pilot scheme subject to agreement with my Department on standards that will enable them to be supported as primary schools for children with autism.  I am pleased to advise that broad agreement has been reached on the core conditions to enable these centres to be recognised as special schools for children with autism and applications have been received for special school recognition from the centres in question. These schools, once recognised, will provide education for children with autism in line with my Department's policy. Detailed modalities relating to the transfer of staff are under consideration.</p>

This is an exercise in identifying surplus posts which are in the system and which do not meet the current criteria — posts that have been  retained when a pupil's care needs have diminished or where the pupil has left.</p>
            <p eId="para_5673">The allocation for any school, and any adjustments to that allocation, depends on a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care/medical needs leaving, the number of new pupils, the changing needs of the pupils and any surplus identified. Furthermore, schools can make applications at any time with the result that the individual situation of any school can change and allocations are not static for a school year in the same way as are, for example, classroom teaching posts. The NCSE is independent in the making and issuing of its decisions relating to SNA allocations.  The NCSE has advised that the review will be completed by end March 2010.  At that point, the NCSE will provide me with a report on the outcome of the review.  I wish to assure the Deputy that SNA support will continue to be made available to schools which have enrolled pupils who qualify for such support.</p>

            <p eId="para_5682">Having considered submissions regarding proposals to prescribe the primary school curriculum by regulation and following discussions with Irish language interests, I am proposing to introduce a regulation that will prescribe the primary curriculum. The regulation will stipulate that the teaching of English may be delayed in Irish-medium schools up to the end of the first term of senior infants, subject to the approval of the school's board of management and following consultation with the patron, teachers and parents' association. However, Irish-medium schools will be required to provide the stipulated provision for English for children whose parents request that provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_5683">The approach that is being adopted seeks to strike a balance that ensures that the practice of Irish-medium schools in providing immersion programmes can continue while at the same time respecting the position of those parents who seek to have access the national curriculum in English.  I intend to provide a copy of the draft regulation to the education partners and Irish language organisations prior to laying it before the Houses of the Oireachtas over the coming weeks. This will be done when legal work on the  preparation of the regulation is completed.  It is envisaged that the regulations would be effective from September 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_5691">Enterprise Education forms part of the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme Link Modules, and is an examinable part of the Leaving Certificate taken by some 15000 students annually. In addition, as part of the Transition Year Programme, mini-company activities are supported whereby students plan, develop and manage a mini enterprise or organise a major event such as a trade fair or fashion show. Teamwork, multi-disciplinary learning, interpersonal and communications skills, planning, evaluation, and mastery of business concepts are all part of this process. The Transition Year Programme, which is taken by 50% of the student cohort, provides key opportunities for these types of skills to be developed through other measures also, such as school musicals. Some 5000 students annually take part in the Young Social Innovators Programme which promotes these skills as well as social awareness and active citizenship.</p>
            <p eId="para_5692">In a further development the Student Enterprise Awards run by the County and City Development Board has a participation of some 10,500 students annually under which students plan, market and operate a real business. The Smart Economy strategy provides for a major strengthening, expansion and marketing of mini-company and student enterprise awards under the title of the Sean Lemass Award.</p>
            <p eId="para_5693">The Leaving Certificate Business syllabus, which is studied by some 18400 students annually, also places a strong emphasis on enterprise. The syllabus covers the relationships of people in a business environment, handling  conflict, identifying, marketing and starting a business, the domestic and international environment, entrepreneurs and enterprise skills, and their application to different situations.  The BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition is also testament to the investigative and innovative skills of students in our schools, with over 1,135 students and 509 projects taking part in the 2010 exhibition.</p>
            <p eId="para_5694">As part of its ongoing work, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is embedding key skills in all senior cycle subject areas. The key skills identified are information processing, communicating, critical and creative thinking, working with others and being personally effective. The Council has also developed a short course in Enterprise Education for consultation. The proposals for reform of the junior certificate programme will provide more opportunities for embedding key skills, and for school-based innovation and creativity. I agree that it is vitally important that all students develop key skills and engage in innovative learning, creative and entrepreneurial activity. Opportunities to develop these skills are already embedded in various programmes and subjects. This work will be further strengthened, while at the same time meeting the diverse needs of the student cohort. EU policy in promoting enterprise as one of the 8 key competencies which students should develop, takes a wider view of enterprise as being a willingness to welcome change, take responsibility, set objectives and meet them, plan, organise, evaluate, manage a project, and work effectively and flexibly with others.</p>

In order to be eligible, children must live at least 3.2 kilometres from, and be attending, their nearest national school as determined by my Department. Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme, on behalf of my Department, have advised that the pupil referred to by the Deputy, in the details supplied, resides 1.9 KM from the school of attendance and is therefore not eligible for free school transport. Pupils who reside less than 3.2 kilometres from their school of eligibility may avail of fare-paying concessionary transport to that school, provided there are spare seats on an existing service and they pay the annual charge. Concessionary pupils from families with valid medical cards are not exempt from this charge.</p>

            <p eId="para_5746">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is established under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 as the statutory body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework which promotes regular school attendance and tackles the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that every child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</p>
            <p eId="para_5747">Special Report No. 8 of the Comptroller and Auditor General published in 2007 dealt with lapses in internal controls at the National Educational Welfare Board. The lapses identified in the Special Report occurred at the earliest phase of the development of administrative structures within the NEWB. Since the publication of the Special Report my Department has taken steps to reduce the risk of similar lapses occurring in the State Sponsored Bodies and Agencies under its aegis in the future. In this regard, my Department issued correspondence to the Bodies under its aegis highlighting the need for the Bodies to ensure, through internal audit and by other means that all necessary controls are in place and that procedures are documented and are implemented in keeping with guidelines on governance for the body. My Department also highlighted the requirement for each agency to be compliant with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, the necessity for the relevant authority to be fully aware of its responsibility with regard to its oversight role in the disbursement of moneys and that the Chief Executive Officer/Director is the person accountable to the Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_5748">I would like to advise the Deputy that the revised and updated Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies issued to the NEWB in June 2009. The revised code sets out the agreed governance framework for the internal management as well as the internal and external reporting relationships, of commercial and non-commercial State Bodies. My Department has advised the NEWB that the Board is required to comply with the content of the revised code and that all internal procedures should be reviewed and updated as required to ensure compliance with the new provisions in the revised code.</p>

            <p eId="para_5759">I propose to take Questions Nos. 678 and 705 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5760">Under the Water Framework Directive, the payment of water charges is required with effect from 1 January 2010. The legal advice available to the Government is that schools, like other non-domestic water services users, must pay the full cost of water services used on a metered basis. The Directive required that transitional measures be in place up to 2010 to move towards full cost recovery.  It is not possible to maintain these per capita transitional rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_5761">Circular 64/2009, to which Deputy O'Shea refers, advises schools that data from local authorities indicates that water consumption levels in many schools remains too high. With the introduction of full metered water charges, costs may increase substantially if schools do not put in place water conservation measures. The circular details also the benefits to the school if it reduces water consumption to a recommended per capita usage of 2.1 cubic metres. Schools were advised of actions they could take to reduce water consumption in Circular 46/2008, which was issued by my Department in April 2008. They were advised to develop a water management plan, in order that they would be familiar with the water distribution systems serving the school and the areas where water is used along with potential areas for wastage and leakage. Practical suggestions for reducing water consumption, along with examples of best practice, were also included.</p>
            <p eId="para_5762">I wish to draw the Deputies' attention also to Circular 57/2009, which is available on my Department's website. Circular 57/2009 outlines the funding available through the Summer Works Scheme 2010 for water conservation measures, which will have the effect of reducing schools' water charges and of contributing to environmental sustainability. The Deputy will be aware that my Department, as is the case for all Government Departments, has had to identify efficiencies in all areas of its budget. Schools can play a role in that regard also by reducing their water consumption and thereby their water charges. I do not propose to provide a specific increase in capitation to take account of metered water charges.</p>

Students who are entering approved courses are eligible for financial assistance where they satisfy the relevant conditions including those relating to residence, means, age, nationality and previous academic attainment. The assessment of means under my Department's student maintenance grant schemes is based on gross income from all sources. Therefore, all income is assessed from the same starting point, eliminating any distortion which might arise from different spending decisions. The income thresholds are stated on a gross income basis — the average industrial wage by reference to which the thresholds are calculated represents gross pay before any deductions for income tax or PRSI. The means test arrangements of the student maintenance grant schemes are applied nationally. In the case of both employed and self-employed applicants, gross income is assessed with certain specified social welfare and health service executive payments excluded.

            <p eId="para_5770">I understand that in relation to the individual referred to by the Deputy, his seconded service with the European Schools has been taken into account for pension purposes in accordance with the terms and conditions of his pension scheme.  I also understand that his pensionable remuneration reflected the grade on which he was originally seconded to the European Schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_5771">On the question of Article 40(<i>c</i>) of the 1987 European School Regulations for  members of the teaching staff of the European Schools, this Article provides  that “A Headmaster who served as a secondary school teacher in a European  School, prior to his appointment shall, when his period of appointment expires,  be re-integrated by his national authorities, who shall ensure that his record  at the European School is not overlooked in his subsequent national career”.   This provision has no application in this instance.   I wish to advise the Deputy that this case was raised by the Pensions Ombudsman with my Department in July 2008 and no basis was established to amend the awarded pension.</p>

         if all portable electrical equipment in his Department and subsidiary or grant-aided companies have portable appliance test certificates as required by the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulation S.I.

            <p eId="para_5789">The Third Level Access Measure provides support for disadvantaged students through two sub-priorities: the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities.  The objective of the Student Assistance Fund, is to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.  The Fund for Students with Disabilities provides funding to both further and higher education institutions for the provision of services and supports for full-time students with disabilities. The fund is managed by the Higher Education Authority on behalf of my Department and is funded under the National Development Plan, with assistance from the European Social Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_5790">The Deputy will be aware that the need for budgetary adjustment has made it necessary to discontinue the Millennium Partnership Fund from the 2010/11 academic year.  The fund was disbursed by local Partnership Companies, mostly in the form of small grants to individual students to cover costs of items such as books and travel. Most students in receipt of support from the fund will continue to be supported under the means-tested student maintenance grant schemes and many will benefit from the significantly higher special rate of grant.  In addition, third level students in difficult financial circumstances will continue to have access to the Student Assistance Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_5791">The Higher Education Authority also provides institutions with recurrent funding to develop the necessary infrastructure and programmes to support wider access for people with a disability, mature students and young people from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.  The table below outlines the funding provided under the Student Assistance Fund to Dublin-based institutions for the 2009/10 academic year.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_5828">I propose to take Questions Nos. 693, 695, 696 and 715 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5829">As the Deputies are aware the Magdalen Laundries were privately owned and operated institutions which were not subject to State regulation or inspection and, as a consequence, are not scheduled institutions for the purposes of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002.  However, in recognition of the fact that some children were transferred from institutions specified for the purposes of the Schedule to the Act, to laundries, section 1(3) of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 provides that a child who was resident in a scheduled institution and who was transferred to a laundry where they suffered abuse while so resident, will be deemed, at the time of the abuse to have been resident in the scheduled institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_5830">My Department does not hold information on the number of applications made to the Residential Institutions Redress Board where applicants were transferred from scheduled institutions to laundries.  The Board is entirely independent in the performance of its functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5831">My Department does not have details of every child who was placed in a laundry. In relation to the number of children that were transferred to a Magdalen Laundry from a State regulated institution (scheduled institution), my Department only maintains records on those children who were admitted to Industrial &amp; Reformatory Schools via the Courts.  Some of these records may indicate instances of children being transferred to Laundries. My Department is currently reviewing these records in an attempt to identify the incidence of this practice within the records available to the Department.  My Department does not generally hold any records in relation to children who may have been otherwise placed in the Industrial and Reformatory schools, e.g. voluntary placements, Health Authority referrals, etc. nor indeed would my Department hold any records in respect of former residents of the remaining scheduled institutions. Consequently, any records which my Department holds would not be a true reflection of the numbers involved and could not be relied upon to accurately quantify the numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5832">I wish to advise the Deputies however that officials at my Department recently met with a delegation representing the Justice for Magdalenes Group. At that meeting, my Department indicated its willingness to facilitate requests from individuals who were transferred to a Laundry from either an Industrial or Reformatory School subject to confidentiality requirements for personal data.</p>
            <p eId="para_5833">Turning to the question of records held by the religious congregations who owned and operated the Magdalen Laundries, like my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have no legal authority to instruct them to provide full access to their records. It is a matter for each individual congregation, having regard to any requirements of the data protection legislation. The Deputies will be aware that when recommending the continuation of family tracing services, the Commission noted that the right of access to personal documents and information must be recognised and afforded to ex-residents of institutions. In this context, my Department continues to provide individuals access to their personal records under the terms of the Freedom of Information Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_5834">As can be seen from the above, while it is not possible for my Department to account for each child confined to a Magdalen Laundry since the foundation of the State, my Department will assist individuals in respect of whom it may hold records.  My officials are continuing to liaise with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding its ongoing inquiries in relation to the role of the criminal justice system in referring individuals to Magdalen Laundries.</p>

            <p eId="para_5844">The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is at present carrying out a review of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) allocations in all schools with a view to ensuring that the criteria governing the allocation of such posts, as outlined in my Department's Circular 07/02, are properly met. This is an exercise in identifying surplus posts which are in the system and which do not meet the current criteria — posts that have been retained when a pupil's care needs have diminished or where the pupil has left.</p>
            <p eId="para_5845">The allocation for any school, and any adjustments to that allocation, depends on a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care/medical needs leaving, the number of new pupils, the changing needs of the pupils and any surplus identified. Furthermore, schools can make applications at any time with the result that the individual situation of any school can change and allocations are not static for a school year in the same way as are, for example, classroom teaching posts. The NCSE is independent in the making and issuing of its decisions relating to SNA allocations. The NCSE has advised that the review will be completed by end March 2010. At that point, the NCSE will provide me with a report on the outcome of the review.  I wish to assure the Deputy that SNA support will continue to be made available to schools which have enrolled pupils who qualify for such support.</p>

        <b>Deputy Alan Shatter</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a family (details supplied) that moved to Dublin from Cork in December 2009 has been unable to obtain school places for their children having applied to seven second level schools in the vicinity of their home in Dublin 16 and that the earliest places offered to the children are for September 2010; if his further attention has been drawn to the fact that these children have now not attended school for two months; the educational facilities that will be provided for these children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5902">The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_5903">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  Under section 15(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</p>
            <p eId="para_5904">Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5905">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. If the NEWB is furnished with the family's contact details, the Board will contact the parents in this regard. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.  Home Tuition support may be provided, on application, as a temporary interim measure, for pupils who do not have a school placement or are unable to secure a school place.</p>

        <b>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         the number of north Tipperary schools that have applied for and are awaiting capital funding for school building projects; the band rating and stage of these projects; the works that are to be carried out; the date of first application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5907">Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works are now available on the Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>. Details are attached for the particular schools to which the Deputy refers.  The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on the Department’s website.</p>
            <p eId="para_5908">The progression of all large scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme. However, in view of the level of demand on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of individual school projects at this time.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_6174">I can inform the Deputy that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) which is administered by NEPS.  NEPS in common with other psychological services encourages a staged assessment process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a student be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more students indirectly than could be seen individually.</p>
            <p eId="para_6175">Students who manifest very special or urgent needs in school and who have not been previously assessed by a psychologist and are brought to the attention of a NEPS psychologist by the Principal teacher will usually be assessed by the psychologist as soon as practicable. Normally, principals of schools prioritise those students in need of psychological assessment in consultation with the assigned psychologist.  I have checked on the matter with the NEPS service and the student in question has not been brought to the attention of the assigned psychologist by current school authorities. I would suggest that an approach be made to the relevant school principal in the first instance in this connection. Obviously the exchange of any information in relation to the student's education or medical condition would be a matter for the student, his parents, the school authorities and the relevant medical practitioner(s).</p>
            <p eId="para_6176">The Deputy will be aware, that under Section 29(1) of the Education Act 1998, where a school Board of Management permanently excludes a student from school, suspends a pupil from attendance at a school for a period as prescribed in the Act (20 days), the parent of the student may appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education, and have that appeal heard by a committee appointed for that purpose.</p>

This Strategy Group Report provides a clear direction to inform actions to further the integration of ICT into teaching and learning in our schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_6192">The Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal, Building Ireland's Smart Economy, re-iterates Government policy to enhance the role of ICT in the education system, working in partnership with industry, to invest further in the provision of equipment and connectivity. The Joint Advisory Group was set up with industry to explore initiatives in regard to this.  The Joint Advisory Group, in producing the Smart Schools = Smart Economy Report, did not carry out individual ICT needs assessments but reviewed the Strategy Group Report and drew on existing verified data regarding level and use of ICT in schools, in reaching its conclusions. In particular, the Group reviewed the following studies —  the European Commission's 2006 survey on the use of computers and the internet in schools, the 2005 census of schools carried out by the National Centre for Technology in Education, and the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 6 study in 2006 which contained some questions on computer use in schools.</p>
