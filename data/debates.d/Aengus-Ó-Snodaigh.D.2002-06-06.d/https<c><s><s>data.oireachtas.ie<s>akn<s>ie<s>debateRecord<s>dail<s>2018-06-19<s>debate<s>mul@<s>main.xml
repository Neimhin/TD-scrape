        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1">People will have been shocked and horrified by the revelations on last evening's "RTÉ Investigates" programme of appalling levels of environmental criminality, pitiful regulatory enforcement and a governance regime which allowed the wholesale and destructive pollution of lakes, rivers, sea, land and forests. It is without question that human health has been placed at risk as a result of the environmental damage being done by this criminality. The programme makers deserve great credit for their work. They revealed a darker and more dangerous aspect of the Wild Atlantic Way. A fragmented and ineffective national waste enforcement regime was laid bare, in particular in the west. We saw issues in Clifden, Tuam, Bray and Moville, County Donegal and much more. Appalling stories were told about the illegal dumping of commercial, construction and household waste, yet the total number of enforcement staff across all local authorities is only 150. What emerged from the programme was that enforcement had to be resourced far more effectively. Funding must also be allocated for a clean-up and waste recovery where illegal dumps are discovered, as illustrated, in particular, in the case of the Bray landfill site. The particular issue of the performance of Donegal County Council's in waste enforcement and management must be investigated. I do not say that lightly. The breach of licence conditions by the operation in Killarney was staggering, yet it appears there was passive tolerance of it early in the journey of the company involved. There was dumping in a special area of conservation near the River Barrow in an extraordinarily brazen way, threatening groundwater, the environmental purity of the area and human health through the leaking of leachate and the presence of asbestos. We saw waste being moved illegally from the South to the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> Does the Taoiseach accept that the regulatory system governing waste collection and disposal is fragmented, ineffective and poorly resourced? We have had many inquiries but the "RTÉ Investigates" programme is the tip of the iceberg. Will the Taoiseach facilitate a form of fact-finding inquiry to get a truly national picture of the story around waste collection, disposal, enforcement and the application of the regulatory regime right now in the country so that we can find out what is going on in the sector to inform future policy? Will the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, make himself available to the House this week specifically to answer questions on issues that arise from the "RTÉ Investigates" programme? The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, might accompany him as well, if it involves areas of local authority enforcement that come under his remit.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T14:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_3">I thank the Deputy for raising this question. I had the opportunity to watch the programme last night. It was an excellent programme. What we saw last night on "RTÉ Investigates" was a disturbing picture that tells us that we have a long way to go when it comes to waste enforcement in Ireland, and that what is happening in some - perhaps many - parts of the country is seriously harming our environment and certainly harmful to human health.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> We have come a long way in Ireland when it comes to waste management and waste enforcement. Only 20 years ago, this was a matter that was solely controlled by local authorities and almost everything went to landfill. I remember those landfills, one such being Dunsink in my constituency where everything was just thrown into a landfill and there was almost no recycling or efforts to reuse or reduce at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_5"> It is evident to me, however, and I imagine everyone in this House, that compliance and enforcement is not what it should be. There is significant variation in enforcement from local authority to local authority, as the Deputy Micheál Martin pointed out. He singled out Donegal County Council in particular where enforcement is low. We need to bear in mind that local authorities have a responsibility to decide how they allocate their own resources. Donegal allocates the least compared with other counties and Deputy Micheál Martin will be aware that the largest delegation on that local authority is Fianna Fáil. The second largest is Fine Gael. Of course there are councillors from my party too.</p>

          <p eId="para_18">On compliance, while our compliance rate has improved beyond measure in recent years, our system is far from perfect and it would seem that a certain minority continues to feel that flouting the law is worth the risk. Enforcement is beginning to pay dividends and several important environmental and criminal outcomes in the past year represent a roadmap to put potential illegitimate waste operators permanently out of business. I am informed by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment that several enforcement actions have been initiated and that all of the cases that were raised in "RTÉ Investigates" last night are either under investigation or constitute closed cases. As the programme highlighted, enforcement action against illegal waste operators, including unauthorised collection of waste and illegal dumping, is led by local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, under section 63 of the Waste Management Act 1996, and the Minister is precluded from exercising any power or control in the performance of an agency or local authority in particular circumstances of a statutory function vested in it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_16">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T14:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_19">I am quite disappointed with the Taoiseach's response and the pettiness of it in terms of pointing out the make-up of a council. The Taoiseach will be aware that waste management is exclusively an executive function.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> The Taoiseach implies a certain complacency, stating that we have come a long way. I do not believe we have. In some respects we might have but watching last night, the householder thinks he or she is recycling. The householder is doing his or her duty in terms of waste but many of these companies are not. What we thought was going into proper facilities is not going into them. Groundwater is being contaminated.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">Land is being contaminated and human health is at risk. We cannot be complacent about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> The Environmental Protection Agency is not governed by any councillors or group of councillors. It has issues in terms of transfer stations, the degree of enforcement, regular breaches of licences and the lack of any forceful impact from the regulatory regime. This cries out for a more urgent response than the Taoiseach demonstrated in his reply. I asked him if he would facilitate the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, coming to the House to take a longer series of questions some time this week because this is an important issue. I also asked if he would have a fact-finding inquiry to try to get a national picture of what was revealed yesterday in the "RTÉ Investigates" programme. We can say we have come a long way and we should move on but a tipping point has been reached, if the House will excuse the pun, and we need to deal with it legislatively. As an Oireachtas, we need to turn a corner and make sure the kind of stuff revealed last night never happens again.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">Waste management is an executive function of local authorities but it is the role of elected members to hold the executive to account. Those of us in politics who have served as councillors or Deputies should be well aware that it is the role of elected members to hold the executive to account. It is also the role of elected members to set the budget for waste management and enforcement and that budget has to be voted through every year. I am disappointed that Deputy Micheál Martin would seek to absolve elected members of his own party-----</p>

          <p eId="para_33">The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, report on the operation of the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, which was brought by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, to Cabinet has just been published. As we know, the report was initiated on foot of Tusla's catastrophic mishandling of allegations made against Garda whistleblower, Maurice McCabe. I understand the report is damning and outlines dysfunction and deficiencies within Tusla in the areas of staffing, systems, reporting and governance. I understand it highlights the alarming reality that Tusla has serious difficulties in recruiting and retaining specialist staff, in particular, social workers. The report also points to resourcing problems and the inability of Tusla to respond appropriately to cases of alleged or suspected child abuse. The unacceptable result of this catalogue of failure is that the Child and Family Agency is not adequately protecting children at ongoing risk. This means that children are knowingly being left in danger.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> The Taoiseach may recall that when I raised the horrific Galway foster home rape case with him in April, I said the State's failure of children was a damning indictment on our political system. I also said it would not be long before we would be back here to discuss yet another failure, and here we are. There are children at increased risk today due to the culture of dysfunction in Tusla. This has been compounded by the Government's failure to act and properly resource a responsive and effective Child and Family Agency. It is clear that we need to see a radical step change when it comes to recruiting and retaining social workers. In January last, the Committee of Public Accounts highlighted the high staff turnover rates at Tusla. Despite hiring 250 new staff, the net gain was only 18 due to the high numbers of staff leaving the agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">This is an issue we have raised time and again with the Minister. In May we learned that over 4,000 children referred to Tusla were waiting to be allocated a social worker. We need to see dramatic improvements, but we also need to see accountability for the litany of failures contained in today's report. In order to change the culture in Tusla there first has to be accountability. All of this is happening on the Taoiseach's watch. The diagnosis is clear: Tusla, as it stands, is not fit for purpose and what we now need are solutions to ensure the children at risk will be properly protected. What does the Taoiseach plan to do to address the chronic shortage of social workers in the system? The HIQA report published today was commissioned a year ago. The Government and all of us knew at that stage that there were very big problems. We also know that a year is a very long time in the life of a vulnerable child. What measures were taken in the interim to minimise the danger to children at ongoing risk?</p>

          <p eId="para_36">The report does not deal with matters before the disclosures tribunal. It was, however, prompted by issues being dealt with by the tribunal. The Government accepts the report that was approved by the Cabinet today. Tusla accepts the report which will be implemented in full and its representatives will be before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs this week to account for it. I commend the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katharine Zappone, for commissioning the report in the first place and HIQA for carrying it out.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> As a Government and a society, we have many obligations and responsibilities towards our youngest and most vulnerable citizens, paramount among which is ensuring they are not subject to abuse, whether sexual, physical, emotional or neglect. Therefore, having a properly functioning child protection system is a concern for us all, which is why the report was commissioned. I appreciate that it was published in the past hour or so and that Deputies have not yet a had a proper chance to read or study it, but in respect of recruitment and resources, it is important to quote from the report. It states there was abundant evidence of considerable financial investment that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla's board and executive had made in staff recruitment and training and developing a more service demand model of staff allocation across its service. While it does raise issues surrounding the difficulty in recruiting and retaining social workers, the report acknowledges in black and white the fact that there is abundant evidence of considerable financial investment made by the Government and the agency in staff recruitment. Tusla's Exchequer funding for this year is €753 million, a €14 million increase on the figure for last year, a considerable increase by any measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> The Deputy asked what specific actions were being taken or which had already been initiated or set in train. The Minister has directed Tusla to produce an action plan as recommended by HIQA setting out the steps required to implement the recommendations, together with clear timelines for doing exactly this. She is also going to appoint an independent expert quality assurance and oversight group to drive and monitor implementation in order that we will know what is happening. The group will publish regular updates on its work. The Minister has also advised that, in line with HIQA's report, she is prioritising several major initiatives to reform the way Tusla and An Garda Síochána deal with historical allegations of child sexual abuse and to support Tusla's workforce needs by creating formal career path mechanisms for students and graduates. She will meet the board of Tusla in the coming days. Many of the actions needed to implement the report's findings were already under way at the time the investigation was started and I might be able to go through them in my next time slot.</p>

          <p eId="para_39">The McCabe incident which, of course, we are not going to discuss here triggered the report and investigation, but the difficulties in Tusla were well known and had been well recorded in advance of them. What is of deep concern is what seems to be the scale of the systems failure within the agency on matters people would regard as the basics.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">It is not that sophisticated systems seem to have failed here but that even the basics were not right in terms of reporting, recording and proper communications and standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> I appreciate that an action plan will be published. I understand it will be made public and will be available on the Tusla website. I assume the Taoiseach and the Minister are giving an absolute commitment to ensure the action plan is actioned. However, a question remains on the issue of accountability and I ask the Taoiseach to address it. I will study the report carefully but I understand it catalogues massive failures at every level. I want to know who is to be held accountable for that.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">The report catalogues failures and enormous shortcomings in Tusla and in child protection. The Deputy is right that these are often problems that we have known about for some time. It is a major job and effort to do the transformation that has occurred in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> We cannot make these improvements soon enough, but I will give the Deputy an idea of where we have come from in only the past seven or eight years. We established a Department for Children and Youth Affairs and a dedicated agency, Tusla. When Tusla was set up it took on the full legacy left by the Health Service Executive and the health boards. We have put the rights of children in the Constitution. As I pointed out, we have increased resources for Tusla by €40 million in the past year. We successfully brought in mandatory reporting only at the end of last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> The Deputy is right that the problems that exist around child protection are well known. However, they are being dealt with over time and we will continue to deal with them. I will give examples of some of the things done in recent months. In April a new chief social worker was appointed, so there is someone now very much in charge of social work. That person is key to ensuring that policy is being developed and implemented. In July a new information and communications technology recording system for child protection and welfare went operational on a nationwide basis for the first time. Joint work with the Garda is very important, especially when it comes to retrospective allegations, and improvements have been made in this area. The report finds that good governance arrangements are now in place at corporate and executive levels.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_45">I will start with a statistic from the Road Safety Authority, namely, the number of road fatalities in 2017, which was 157. While this was regrettable, it showed a decrease on the figure from the previous year. We know the extent of the campaigns by the RSA. They are high-profile impactful television campaigns. The RSA maintains they make a difference and its surveys suggest adults are affected and influenced by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> I want to compare and contrast the figure on road deaths with a different statistic, namely, the figure for drug-related deaths. It is not a direct year-to-year statistic because the statistics do not work that way. In the most recent recorded year, the figure for drug-related deaths was 695, which is 3.5 times higher than the figure for deaths on the roads. EUROSTAT published a statistic this morning indicating that the number of drug-related deaths in Ireland is three times higher than the European average. How seriously are we taking the drugs issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> We know the facts. We know the increase in the rates of drug use in Ireland, especially among young people. We know about generational drug misuse and abuse. We know about the unhealthy relationships Irish people have with drugs and alcohol and the extraordinary damage done to families and communities. We know about the bills in health and crime and we know the links with sexually transmitted illnesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> The Taoiseach launched the national drugs strategy in Dublin Castle last year. He said all the right things, recognising that the problem was a public health issue and the need to combat the underlying reasons for drug use and for effective intervention. He also recognised the importance of community participation in key decision-making structures. Two recent events highlighted the need for communities to be involved in the decision-making process. While both events took place in Dublin, the issues I am raising concerning drugs are national. On Friday last, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, launched an initiative to get specific on prevention and education. A strong recommendation was made highlighting the need for a collaborative and agency approach involving community, youth projects and schools working together as well as listening to young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">At a conference yesterday at Croke Park, hosted by the north inner city drugs and alcohol task force and the programme implementation board, on drug related intimidation we heard very frank accounts from those who were experiencing intimidation to pay money and attack homes and houses. There was one very frank account of intimidation to carry out a murder and all because of drug-related debt. Even though we see a strong commitment between the community and the Garda division, various surveys have found that such is the fear of reprisal, there are low numbers of people reporting. There is a strong recommendation that there be a multi-agency approach with statutory personnel who could make decisions with the community, linking the community involved in the decision-making process. This would recognise good practice in communities and the wealth of experience and knowledge in them. I ask that we commit to such a collaborative approach, with communities being part of the decision-making process.</p>

        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_32" as="#Taoiseach">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T14:25:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_50">I thank the Deputy for raising the two very grave matters of road safety and drug related deaths. We are aware that the number of deaths on the roads and related to illegal drug use runs into hundreds each year. One death is one too many, with people being struck down long before they should be, often in their 20s, 30s, 40s or 50s. The number of road deaths has fallen considerably in the past few decades. Previously, the number had been in the region of 600, but it is now around 150, which is still too many. There is evidence that the number may be rising again this year. I shall outline what is required in that regard. We must continue to support the Road Safety Authority and fund it well to continue its road safety advertisements and other information programmes. We must step up the level of Garda enforcement. There are 600 more gardaí than two years ago. We must ensure some of the extra gardaí are allocated to the traffic corps in order that we will have increased enforcement. We must also focus on legislation. The Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017 is before the House and I encourage Deputies to support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> I do not believe it is right to say road and drug related deaths are directly comparable. The phenomenology and reasons behind drug related and road deaths are very different, but the Deputy has made the point well that there are many more people in Ireland dying from drug related issues than on the roads. On what we can do about it, there is the new national drugs strategy which was published just a few months ago and is being implemented. There is also greater availability of naloxone, which is very important in helping to rescue people from an overdose. In time it will demonstrate and help to bring about a reduction in the number of deaths as a result of an overdose because the more available naloxone is to paramedics, key workers or even family and friends, the more people can be rescued from an overdose.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> We are reviewing our overall approach. The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, has appointed a commission to examine the issue of decriminalisation. It will look at whether we should move away from the current approach of criminal justice to decriminalising minor possession of what are illegal drugs in an effort to move away from a criminalising system to one that may be more health oriented. We also have approval for and are making good progress in putting in place Ireland's first injecting room in Dublin. This will allow people to inject safety and people will know the health benefits and the number of lives that may be saved as a result. I agree with the Deputy that communities must be involved in dealing with such issues and integrated into the decision-making and implementation processes. She is absolutely correct and the Minister of State will take up this issue and run with it.</p>

          <p eId="para_53">The one point of comparison is that nobody wants deaths, but where there is a will, something can be done about it and road and drug related deaths can be prevented. I ask myself how much hope and confidence the people who are watching this debate, those who have heard the Taoiseach's reply, those who see what is happening, those with an addiction, their families and communities, those in recovery, community workers, youth workers, counsellors and teachers who are all at the forefront in dealing with these issues will get from what the Taoiseach has just said.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">We are rightly horrified by child abuse, but there are young people who are the victims or perpetrators of drug dealing. That is also a child welfare issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> We know the extent of the cuts - 30% to 37% - since 2008 to projects that are working directly at the forefront. They are now dealing with more complex, difficult and traumatic situations. Most of the task forces agree that they are seeing a doubling of the numbers. The slogan yesterday in Croke Park was "This is not a talking shop". It is time for the talking to stop and for the implementation of the new strategy.</p>

          <p eId="para_56">I assure the Deputy that this is something that Government is very aware of and something that Government is very concerned about. The Deputy is right to say that the political will to bring about a reduction in road deaths made a big difference. Although the phenomenality around road traffic deaths and deaths related to drug use is very different, it required some similar things. It required education, political will, legislation and a change in approach and tolerance for certain behaviours like drink-driving, speeding and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> We have a national drugs strategy. That is being implemented. I mentioned how the greater availability of naloxone was saving lives and will save more lives into the future. I have mentioned how we are reviewing the approach to criminalisation and whether we should move away from a criminal justice-based approach to one that is about health. I look forward to the report of that body on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> Regarding task forces, they have had their budgets cut over the years, although in recent years the budget has either been held steady or has been increased in some cases. Certainly, the budget for social inclusion within the HSE has been increased and was increased in the previous budget. We always need to bear in mind when it comes to any of these local implementation bodies, irrespective of whether it is a drug task force, that we need to compare one with the next and see if some are getting better results. We know from so many things in society that more resources do not necessarily mean better outcomes. We need to make sure that we put the resources behind policies and implementation bodies that produce results.</p>

          <p eId="para_59">We need to restore our climate reputation as a country, not just because we are facing €500 million in fines every year but because moving from worst in class to best in class, which is possible, would make this country better in many ways. The Dáil has a role to play. We should pass Deputy Pringle's divestment Bill, which will be up for discussion in two weeks. Similarly, we should pass the Green Party's Waste Reduction Bill 2017 which would help us to deliver a circular economy. We should pass Deputy Bríd Smith's climate crisis Bill, which would keep those fossil fuels in the ground. Goldman Sachs, Coca-Cola and ExxonMobil would not like that, but the Irish people are behind it and want to see it happen. We have the numbers in the Dáil. The only problem is Fine Gael. Fine Gael is the climate laggard, not the Irish people, and it needs to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> The problem is that this change is greater than anything that the former Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass, and Dr. T.K. Whitaker tried to do in the late 1950s and we have no one on Merrion Street willing to show such leadership now. That is what the Climate Action Network report and Citizens' Assembly said, and they were right. It is the Government that is in the dock.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> To tackle this problem, we should think global and act local, which is an old green adage. The new economic model will be dependent on building healthy communities where quality housing is within walking or cycling distance of local services. To do that, we need strong local government, which means putting to the people next May the question of having directly elected mayors in every city. I have someone in mind, a modern Whitaker, who could lead Limerick into becoming a climate treaty city. I have someone in mind who would set Cork free from Dublin rule. I have someone in mind who could lead Galway in setting the west awake and someone who could make Waterford the true capital of the south east. In Dublin, we need a mayor to solve our terrible transport and housing crises. The Ministers for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, are not solving them.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> We need to say to the St. Michael's estate team that we will go the cost rental route. We need to stop Transport Infrastructure Ireland building ever larger motorways into Dublin and bringing more cars in, resulting in us having to dig up our front gardens when what we should be doing is using those engineers to build greenways everywhere and turn Dublin into what it should be, namely, a great garden city.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> The same applies in rural Ireland. We need a national land use plan that treats the whole country as a national park rather than the illegal dumping ground we saw last night. That is necessary if we are to plant 20,000 ha of new forestry and create a national rainforest. To make all of this happen, the Oireachtas committee on climate change that we are about to establish needs to work. It must start in September, finish by the end of the year and have the seven Secretaries General attend on Wednesday afternoons in October and November.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">It must build a new national energy and climate plan, which we have to do for Europe, because the Government's current plan does not work. I do not believe it. Internationally, no one believes it. It needs to change. Is the Taoiseach willing to change or is Fine Gael sticking with the <i>status quo</i> with fossil fuels and with turning Ireland's reputation brown rather than the green it should be? We need to be orange and green in reality, not just as marketing spin.</p>

We are much more likely to see it produce a valuable outcome if it adopts an all-party, consensual approach rather than an adversarial or prosecutorial one. I hope it will start in that vein.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> Tomorrow, the Minister, Deputy Naughten and I, and others, will launch the climate action fund. It is a €500 million fund that we are setting aside, funded by the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, levy that we place on oil. That fund will be worth €500 million, to be drawn down over the next ten years. We will encourage businesses, ITs, universities, NGOs, the community sector and anyone who has good ideas as to how we can bring about step changes in how we treat our climate to bid for that money. I look forward to the launch of that tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> We will also outline in greater detail how Project Ireland 2040 will help us to meet our climate change obligations and to move from where we are now to a low-carbon economy and society. The kind of measure we will pursue is that, from next year, any new bus bought for Bus Éireann or Dublin Bus will have to be a low emission or zero emission vehicle. We have also confirmed that, by 2025, we will take coal off the grid entirely, becoming one of the first countries in the world, certainly in Europe, not to use coal, a very dirty fuel-----</p>

          <p eId="para_69">-----to power our electricity system. The phasing out of peat subsidies is under way. Peat is a very dirty fuel and burning that contributes considerably to climate change. We are also going to see real, substantial investment in transport now that we can afford to do it, with things like the electrification of more of the commuter rail network around Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow and Louth in particular reducing emissions. People have seen the plans for ambitious projects such as MetroLink and BusConnects in Dublin, Cork and Galway, and the impact that will have on climate change by reducing bus times by half. Many more people will get out of their cars and use public transport. Those are the kinds of things the Government is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> We have fallen behind for a number of reasons. The economic crisis which was inflicted on this country meant that we did not have the money that we needed to invest in infrastructure. The fact that our economy has recovered so fast has led to a rise in emissions. Now that we have a plan and the resources to do it, we can make some meaningful progress in the period ahead and I intend to make sure that happens.</p>

          <p eId="para_71">That plan is not ambitious enough. It has to change. I hear what the Taoiseach said at the start. I would agree to work on a cross-party basis. Let us not make this a fight because we will be stronger when we work on it together. To do that, the Government needs to move too and recognise that some of the suggestions on this side of the House, the sorts of Bills that I mentioned, would restore our direction within months. There would not be huge costs and they could be done. They are not easy. It is complex and difficult, and we will make mistakes, but doing nothing is not an option and what the Taoiseach has on the table is not enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_72"> I am glad that the Taoiseach is doing that community event tomorrow but I have one question on where we should go. It is about strong local government, trusting communities and allowing them to make decisions for themselves. It should be for every city and town. Will the Taoiseach not trust his own instinct? I have heard him say many times, as did the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, that he believes in directly elected representation and mayors. He has said it clearly. We need to be radical, to think big, put aside some of the fears that the public servants have, be political about this and say that we trust our people in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick. Just like Clonakilty has been a huge success with its own mayor, why would we deprive every town of the same success?</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> Will the Taoiseach, in his community event tomorrow, say whether he will trust communities and allow them to get local leadership to make this transition? We will work with the Taoiseach on this new plan in the committee. We will not be easy to work with because we will demand real change. I hope the Taoiseach is open to that because we need to do that. The Taoiseach's plan is not enough. We will make this work. This Dáil has a job to do. Let us stick with it, not pull a quick election, and do the work we have to do. We are the ones to do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">However, it is important to bear in mind that we will always need a certain amount of oil and gas. We need it for medical devices, some plastics which are necessary, and we need it for aviation fuel. It is important to bear in mind that we may always need, for the foreseeable future anyway, some amount of oil and gas, and it might make more sense if that is our own rather than being imported. Gas is recognised in the energy White Paper as a transition fuel and as we move away from very dirty fuels such as coal and peat, for example, we may need to use natural gas for a period.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> I am in favour of directly elected mayors. I have said that before. I do trust people, and the way one trusts people is by putting it to a plebiscite. One does not impose it on people, one puts it to a plebiscite and that is what we intend to do. It is relatively straightforward for Cork, Limerick and Waterford but not so straightforward for Dublin where there are four local authorities. We will need to look at what model might work there, but it is the Government's policy to put plebiscites to the people. We intend to do that next May at the same time as the local and European elections, but one thing we need to work out before that is what it means to have a directly elected mayor. That is what the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, is working on now and he will come to Cabinet with it before the recess. If directly elected mayors only have the powers of existing mayors and cathaoirligh, they will not be able to do any of the things Deputy Eamon Ryan mentioned, so what we will need to do at the very least is to transfer the executive power of county and city CEOs to those mayors because it is not the fact that it is an elected position or a five-year position that makes the difference-----</p>

It is important to have a cross-party perspective on this matter to give the US Government a very clear message that it is unacceptable.

The cases that are being taken do not prevent the Government from bringing the legislation into the House for debate. If we were to take the Government's position to its logical conclusion, there could be Supreme Court appeals, etc.</p>

I welcome the motion and the notion of an apology to those who were convicted under what was, frankly, an abhorrent and disgusting law. Given that homosexuality was only decriminalised 25 years ago, we know that there are men who still hold convictions. Senator Fintan Warfield has tabled an amendment which calls for the establishment of a system to quash those convictions, as well as a ban on what is called conversion therapy and for the LGBTI community to be protected under hate crime legislation. Will the Taoiseach support these three things?</p>

The Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017 which is based on the Law Reform Commission's proposals deals with a number of things, including cyberbullying, revenge porn and upskirting. The Minister has indicated that he will work with us to progress it. He might update us on where exactly is the legislation. Is there any prospect of having it debated in this session?</p>

          <p eId="para_159">In April the Dáil passed Solidarity-PBP's Provision of Objective Sex Education Bill 2018 on Second Stage. The Bill provides for the introduction of progressive, LGBTQ+ positive and factual sex education, with consent at its core. Crucially, it also provides that the religious ethos of a school will not stand in the way of the provision of such necessary objective sex education. It is in line with the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee on the eighth amendment. In the referendum the people clearly expressed a view on the repeal of the amendment and also broadly having a progressive and secular society.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">We received a letter from the Ceann Comhairle last week saying that a money message would be necessary for the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage. Unfortunately, this has become a favoured method of the Government in blocking the progress of Bills like the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill. The Ceann Comhairle wrote that he expects an answer within three weeks. I ask the Taoiseach to give a commitment that the Government will not block our Bill, particularly as June is Pride month. The money message that is required is extremely simple. The Taoiseach simply needs to sign it to enable us to proceed with debating and implementing this necessary legislation. </p>

          <p eId="para_161">I can only issue a money message for legislation on two grounds. First, the legislation must be quality legislation or of sufficient quality that it can become law. Second, money must be voted by the Oireachtas for its implementation. That is the basis on which I make a decision on whether a money message can be issued. We have a wider problem with legislation that is queuing up or stuck at money message stage which should probably never have reached Second Stage in the first place because of its flaws. We need to agree on an all-party basis a much better mechanism to make sure legislation that could never become law because it is poorly drafted or of bad quality does not get to Second Stage in the first place.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">The programme for Government contains a commitment to improving the provision of mental health services. Tipperary, the county I represent, does not have one mental health bed. When will the Taoiseach cry "halt"? What does it mean when Dr. John Hillery, a consultant psychiatrist and president of the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland, says that he has been forced to resign his role within the Health Service Executive and he and his colleagues are being ethically compromised? This is not the first time Dr. Hillery has raised these matters. Last year, he pointed out that the recruitment issue facing the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and general psychiatry services was crippling the service and that the terms and conditions of those working for the HSE were a major issue. When will the Taoiseach do something about the HSE? Mental health is a serious issue. Dr. Hillery visited the Houses twice at the invitation of the Ceann Comhairle. His prowess and stature on this issue are well recognised. He has now resigned because of the chaos in the HSE and its inability to recruit people. How could he remain in such a dysfunctional organisation?</p>

          <p eId="para_181">In regard to the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, which is inching its way towards completion some six years after it was first proposed, the Government has backed down on a number of features of the original Bill. It seems the Minister for Health, along with some other parties in the House, is looking to reduce the size of the health warning on alcohol containers. Why is the Government doing this at a point when we know the evidence is very clear in regard to the link between several serious health conditions and overuse of alcohol? Why is the Taoiseach supporting this approach? People are talking about having this in Irish and the Labour Party wants to go even further and abolish it altogether. Surely we should stick with that basic warning, with a third of the label being devoted to a very clear warning about health concerns, as we did so successfully in regard to cigarettes.</p>

If I recall correctly, the legislation, which I published as Minister for Health, required that there be health warnings on all alcohol products. I do not think it was ever a requirement that they be a particular size. The important thing is that we have the label and that it warns people about the adverse health effects of consuming alcohol.</p>

          <p eId="para_184">On page 86 of the programme for Government, in the section dealing with education, a commitment is given to provide annual increases in primary and secondary capitation grants. On page 90 a commitment is given to set out capitation rates to schools on a rolling three-year basis, allowing for forward planning. To date, there has been no increase in capitation grants for either primary or secondary schools. When will the Taoiseach honour the commitment made in the programme for Government more than two and a half years ago?</p>

          <p eId="para_185">On the same issue, the Government did give commitments. This is causing extreme hardship in our schools which are having to make up the shortfall by fundraising. It is very difficult for principals, teachers, parents associations and parents to try to make up the shortfall of funding to run the schools. Of course, the capitation grant should be increased at this time, given it is one of the most essential things that keep our schools running smoothly. I support the call made here today. When is the Taoiseach going to honour the commitment in the programme for Government?</p>

          <p eId="para_186">It is always a case of having to prioritise, as Deputies will appreciate. The education budget this year is €10 billion, the highest education budget in the history of the State. What does that mean in practice? It means 5,000 more teachers than we had two years ago. It means we now have 15,000 SNAs, so there are more SNAs in Ireland than gardaí, even though the number of gardaí is increasing as well. It means new school buildings throughout the country. It means new subjects, like physical education and computer science at the leaving certificate, for example. Extra money, in education at least, is resulting in real improvements.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> We were not able to provide for an increase in capitation in the budget for this year as the priority was additional staff, reducing the pupil-teacher ratio and all the things I mentioned, but it is certainly something that is under consideration for budget 2019. As is always the case, however, it is not good enough for Opposition parties just to demand more spending on everything everywhere. We need to prioritise. If the priority for next year is going to be capitation, obviously, that makes it hard to do other things.</p>

          <p eId="para_191"> Two months ago, almost to the day, the Minister for Education and Skills announced the biggest spending promise by Fine Gael so far this year. He announced a programme of 42 school buildings for new areas from September next year at a cost of €500 million, not including land costs. This also relates to page 86 of the programme for Government. To date, parents on the ground have no information whatsoever about where these schools will be or how they enrol their children. They are looking for schools for September next year, when half of these schools are due to open. The money has not been allocated and parents do not have the information, although the summer holidays are coming up. Will the Taoiseach give the parents of Ireland any more information on this €500 million promise by Fine Gael?</p>

          <p eId="para_193">Page 86 of the programme for Government contains the statement that education is the key to giving every child an equal opportunity in life. Unfortunately, that does not always happen. A situation has arisen in St. Declan's community college in Kilmacthomas, County Waterford, a school under the patronage of Waterford-Wexford ETB. For the enrolment year 2018-19, demand has exceeded capacity for 21 students who attend local primary schools. A parent whose family lives 426 ft from the school contacted me this morning to say demand had exceeded capacity. The school simply is a victim of its own success. A couple of years ago it was a 120-pupil school, whereas now it takes in 150, but the demand is for 171 places. I had hoped to raise this matter with the Minister for Education and Skills. In the short term the solution is the provision of additional accommodation in the form of prefabs. Will the Taoiseach give the matter his best attention?</p>

          <p eId="para_194">I am afraid that I do not have any particular information on the school in Kilmacthomas to which the Deputy refers. Generally, if a school is oversubscribed, additional accommodation is provided or children are given the opportunity to attend other schools in the locality which might have vacancies. Without knowing the details, I cannot comment on the matter further. Certainly, I will inform the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, that the Deputy has raised the matter in the Dáil and ask him to furnish her with a detailed reply.</p>

          <p eId="para_195">The provision of housing is vital for many. Many of those who have sought and been granted planning permission by their local authority to build their own homes have subsequently been affected by appeals to An Bord Pleanála by serial objectors. Likewise, farmers who want to build roads to bring timber from their forestry lands are given permission by their local authority and the forestry service, but, again, the decisions are appealed by the serial objectors. Will the Government do something about them by placing some charge on them which they would have to pay when objecting? It is fine if someone is affected by a planning decision, but people from far away who are not connected at all are lodging appeals.</p>

On the issue of people objecting to the granting of planning permission, we have a very robust planning system which has done a great deal of good to protect us from things which should not happen. However, bearing in mind an increase in the number of vexatious objections and observations, reforms will be made to the system, the details of which will be published in the autumn.</p>

        <heading>Emergency Homeless Accommodation and Direct Provision Independent Inspection Bill 2018: First Stage<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T15:10:00+01:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#EoinOBroin" eId="spk_155">

          <p eId="para_211">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_212">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Health Act 2007 to grant the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) the power to inspect all emergency homeless accommodation funded by the Department of Housing, Planning and Community and Local Government. The Act also grants HIQA the power to inspect direct provision centres funded by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">There are over 10,000 people, including more than 4,000 children, in emergency and domestic violence refuge step-down accommodation funded by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs at a cost to the taxpayer of more than €140 million a year. There are also approximately 4,500 people, including 1,500 children, in direct provision accommodation, the approximate cost of which is approximately €67 million a year. Periodically, we have seen widespread reports of complaints from families, in particular those living in private emergency and direct provision accommodation. The Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, received over 300 such complaints about emergency accommodation in Dublin. Issues raised included damp accommodation, insect infestation, limited facilities, drug use and, in many cases, soiled bedding. I live in a constituency in which there is a large direct provision centre and engage with the residents at that location regularly. They have spoken to me about chronic overcrowding, with multiple individuals or families in a room and limited play and education facilities which I have seen for children. There are also ongoing issues with food, in particular for those with specific dietary requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> Part of the problem is the absence of independent inspection regimes for direct provision and emergency accommodation. While some inspections are carried out by the DRHE of some facilities in Dublin and the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, carries out some inspections of direct provision centres, neither body is independent of the funding bodies which fund what they do. Last July I called for an inspections regime and was told by the then Minister with responsibility for housing that the DRHE was undertaking the development of quality standards and such a regime. I met representatives of the DRHE and acknowledge that much of the work it is doing looks very positive. I support its efforts. The problem is, of course, that the proposals have yet to be progressed and there is no outcome from the Department. The proposals are also limited in that they would only apply to voluntary sector emergency accommodation, not to private sector accommodation. There is no guarantee that the inspections regime would be fully independent of the funders of these facilities and we have no timeline for roll-out. Even the timeline suggested by the DRHE to me at the end of last year was far too slow. To the best of my knowledge, there are no plans to have a fully independent inspections regime for direct provision accommodation. In fact, I have seen the form used for standard inspections undertaken by the RIA. Not only is it a box ticking exercise in a metaphorical sense, the form literally consists of a set of boxes, with no real facility to set out an appreciation of the difficulties experienced by many families living in direct provision accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> The Bill I propose is in no way perfect. It proposes to give the responsibility for inspecting both direct provision and emergency accommodation centres to HIQA. I am more than open to the suggestion that there is a better body to make responsible for such an inspections regime. The purpose of the legislation is to say very clearly that it is time we had a fully independent inspectorate operating with clear quality standards to inspect all emergency accommodation in the voluntary and private sectors, as well as all direct provision centres. The inspections should commence as a matter of urgency. Whatever body is made responsible, whether it be HIQA, some other independent body or a new agency, it must be given adequate funding and resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> Members across the House, including the Minister and me, speak to people living in emergency accommodation regularly and they tell us about a wide range of problems in some instances. While a great deal of emergency accommodation is of very good quality and run to a very high standard, that is, unfortunately, not the case with all of it. I am sure the Minister for Justice and Equality has, likewise, heard the many concerns of people living in direct provision accommodation. While the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, is doing good work to address some of the issues which affect people living in direct provision accommodation, there is still a great deal of work left to be done. I move the Bill to highlight the need for an inspections regime. I urge the Minister to fast-track the work undertaken by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive. I ask the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Minister for Justice and Equality to work together to ensure we will not have to wait another year before an independent inspectorate for quality standards in these two forms of accommodation are introduced.</p>

            <p eId="para_248">As the Taoiseach will be aware, documents released under freedom of information show that the procurement of a new website for the Department of the Taoiseach and a new overall web portal was rushed through last year. This happened before a single piece of research had been undertaken on what the users of the sites might want. The Taoiseach will also be aware that the one uniform finding from the small piece of work carried out by the strategic communications unit on international practice stated that all initiatives should emerge from a clear public demand and not from politicians or officials. Is it acceptable practice to commission major work such as this in advance of developing specifications informed by users?</p>
            <p eId="para_249"> The Taoiseach committed to the research being published. When will this happen? It is the near uniform experience of such projects that a failure to start with consultation and research leads to wasted effort and money.</p>
            <p eId="para_250"> It is more than six months since the Taoiseach told the Dáil that parties would be consulted in advance of the public opinion commissioned by the strategic communications unit. Will he explain why this extraordinary delay has occurred? I am informed that it is viewed as bad practice to undertake major opinion research during holiday periods. When will the research that the House has been discussing for a long time be carried out? There was meant to be consultation with all of us but for some reason that has not happened in six months.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_251">I echo Deputy Martin's question. Is it intended to go ahead with the research or has it been abandoned?</p>
            <p eId="para_252"> In a similar response last year, the Taoiseach stated that as part of the eGovernment strategy, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer had been working on the development of a digital service gateway. This, the Taoiseach stated, would allow for "a single digital point where citizens can easily access information about the Government services that are available to them." We would all welcome that as a means of providing a more user-friendly experience for citizens, the users of Government websites. The MyGovID service has been a welcome addition in this regard, as has the <i>gov.ie</i> portal, but the Taoiseach should not take this as an endorsement of his strategic communications unit. It simply makes sense to harmonise the Government's online presence. In fact, it should have been done years ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_253"> The Department of the Taoiseach's website, in fairness, is not bad and is fairly easy to use and navigate. Like all of the Government websites, however, it could do with a makeover. Is it envisaged that the Department's website will be changed in line with the <i>gov.ie</i> concept?</p>
          </speech>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_254">It makes sense to have a single Government website. I have explained previously my view that Government is too fragmented, that every Department and agency has its own website and web officer and it makes sense to have a single portal. MyGovID works well and <i>gov.ie</i>, which will be the single portal for Departments, will work well too. It should not be necessary to expend public money on expensive research to tell us why it makes sense to have a single Government website. It simply makes sense to me because that is the direction in which the world is moving and this has been done successfully in other countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_255"> The reason for the delay in undertaking the citizen survey is that it has not been a priority. My Department has many tasks and the citizen survey has not been a priority. I was only briefed on the matter in the past two or three weeks. It is planned to consult Opposition leaders on the questions before the survey is in the field and to publish the results when it is complete. As I stated, with so many things going on, the survey has not been a priority. While it is still intended to carry it out, it may well be the autumn before that happens.</p>
            <p eId="para_256"> On the role of <i>gov.ie</i>, with due regard to international practice, as part of the eGovernment Strategy 2017-20 and in line with the Our Public Service 2020 report, the Government Information Service, GIS, has been working with the Office of the Chief Information Officer to develop <i>gov.ie</i>. The website will serve as a single digital point where citizens can easily access information about Government services that are available to them and provide the digital face of the Government to the people. The OGCIO is responsible for the technical development of the site in line with its responsibility to lead on the implementation of the public service ICT strategy. The Government Information Service is responsible for ensuring the website is developed and is citizen focused in design and content and consistent with international best practice and overarching Government communications. Consultation, trialling and testing are ongoing and will involve the rationalisation of existing Government websites and online services over time.</p>

            <p eId="para_266"> I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 8, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_267"> On Monday, 28 May, I met the Prime Minister of the Republic of Korea, Mr. Lee Nak-yeon, in Government Buildings. This was the first visit by a South Korean Prime Minister to Ireland since 1990, and an opportunity to discuss strengthening bilateral relations between our two countries and a number of developments at European Union and international level. We discussed the strong growth in trade between Ireland and South Korea in recent years, which has been enabled by the European Union-South Korea international trade agreement. We also discussed progress in reopening access to the Korean market for Irish beef. I look forward to further progress on this issue during the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_268"> The Prime Minister and I also discussed increased co-operation in the area of education and research and we noted the increasing number of Korean students in Ireland. We discussed the latest developments on the Korean Peninsula. I reiterated Ireland's support for the Korean Government's continuing efforts to build peace and achieve denuclearisation of the peninsula. The meeting was an excellent opportunity to progress our bilateral relations, which I expect will continue to strengthen in the months and years ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_269"> I spoke by telephone with Canadian Prime Minister, Mr. Justin Trudeau, on 26 May. He called me to convey his congratulations on the outcome of the referendum on the regulation of termination of pregnancy, which he described as a significant milestone for women's rights.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_169">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_270">In the context of the Taoiseach's meeting with the South Korean Prime Minister, businesses and workers throughout the country have been looking on with growing concern at the chaos that appears to be about to hit global trade. The wild and indiscriminate attacks being directed at America's trading partners pose a direct threat to our economy. This point has been made repeatedly by independent commentators. Did the South Korean Prime Minister and the Taoiseach discussed that issue?</p>
            <p eId="para_271"> Clearly, the European Union must respond when unilateral and unfair trade sanctions are imposed on European businesses. The European Commission's response thus far has been measured and restrained. No one here is naive enough to believe that Ireland on its own has any chance of influencing events. However, we must be on top of the issues and assist sectors which are disproportionately hit. What action has the Taoiseach taken to assess the specific impact on Ireland of President Trump's unilateral actions on trade?</p>
            <p eId="para_272">Has anybody in the Taoiseach's Department or across Government undertaken any analysis of the impact of President Trump's decisions to date in terms of tariffs on specific trade, if it involves the sectors that are most likely to be hit and undermined and has the Taoiseach prepared any measures to assist sectors which will suffer short and medium term damage?</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_273">In terms of the Taoiseach's international contacts with people like the Prime Minister of Canada and the Prime Minister of the Republic of Korea, has he had an opportunity to get some advice or seek some experience from what they as countries have learned in terms of addressing issues like the housing crisis and the crisis and difficulties in the HSE? In particular, I would like to know if they have discussed how countries invest for the future. The Taoiseach and his Cabinet have produced a 22-year capital programme which is unusually long. On paper there are a great deal of proposals by the Government but in practice that plan will probably extend over the period of three to five Governments and in the meantime our housing crisis, particularly in social and affordable housing, is getting worse. It seems that part of the problem with this Fine Gael Government is that it has, at a minimum, a delicate apprehension which is negative on social and affordable housing as though somehow or other people might get a greater sense of entitlement than the Taoiseach's party would traditionally see people who rely on social housing as having. Has the Taoiseach taken the opportunity to share experiences with countries like Canada, a country of major immigration, which has had big house building successes in its different provinces, but also with the Republic of Korea, which has a significant public investment record so that just as we often advertise Ireland for what we have done well, we might gain some knowledge from them as to how they have addressed those problems in housing and health which are currently besetting the Government?</p>

            <p eId="para_274">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Taoiseach as ucht a chuid freagraí. The press release which followed the Taoiseach's conversation with Prime Minister Trudeau said that they discussed the recent referendum to repeal the eighth amendment. He has referred to it in his answer. I know this had been an item of discussion between them when they met last year so he might give us some more detail as to Mr. Trudeau's reaction. I know that he expressed congratulations and that was welcome. I also note that the British Prime Minister tweeted her congratulations to the Irish people on their decision, Together for Yes and the successful campaign, which is extremely welcome. It would of course be more welcome if she could take the issue up with the DUP who continue to bury their heads in the sand on this. I will see Mrs. May tomorrow and I will raise it with her directly myself.</p>
            <p eId="para_275"> With regard to the Taoiseach's meeting with the Prime Minister of South Korea, was the recent deal between the United States and North Korea discussed? Moves towards peace and stability in the region are obviously very welcome. However, there appears to be a valid concern in South Korea about their omission from the process and I wonder if that was raised in their discussions.</p>

            <p eId="para_276">The Taoiseach may have noted that Prime Minister Trudeau's Canada has today decriminalised cannabis and that follows the fact that in Canada, cannabis for medicinal use was previously decriminalised. In light of the Taoiseach's great admiration for Canada and all things Canadian, might that prompt him to stop trying to sabotage Deputy Gino Kenny's medicinal cannabis Bill which is being buried by his Government in what I think is cynical game playing with completely inaccurate references to it being poor legislation-----</p>

            <p eId="para_278">It is relevant to the discussions that were had with Prime Minister Trudeau and whether we might learn something from Canada in its attitude towards the issue of cannabis and specifically medicinal cannabis given that there are thousands of people out there suffering from pain and other conditions who could benefit from it.

            <p eId="para_279">As we have heard, the Taoiseach spoke on the phone to the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau, in the aftermath of the Irish referendum. Since the phonecall, the G7 meeting descended into total acrimony with extraordinary things being said by the American President about the Canadian Prime Minister and the American administration has subsequently begun to impose tariffs on global trade and products coming out of Canada and other allies on the extraordinary pretext that it was being done on the basis of security. I ask if there has been any analysis done on the likely impacts of the tariffs imposed to date or the likely escalation of a trade war on Ireland, an open trading economy which is vulnerable to the closing down of markets and imposition of tariffs. Are there any contingency plans? The Taoiseach might indicate to us what exactly the Irish Government's submission to the European Commission is on the proper and appropriate response to be made by it to such tariffs being imposed.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_176" as="#Taoiseach">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_280">The meeting with the Prime Minister of South Korea was a good meeting. We now have an EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement in place which has been very successful and has helped us to increase trade between the two countries. The Republic of Korea is now the ninth largest trading country in the world and offers considerable opportunities for Ireland, particularly in the context of the free trade agreement. Bilateral trade between Ireland and the Republic of Korea doubled between 2013 and 2016 to reach a value of €2.6 billion per annum. There have been regular visits to the Republic of Korea to promote Ireland as a trading partner and a location for investment in the EU. When I spoke with the Prime Minister I strongly encouraged him to increase the number of ministerial visits that happen in both directions. It is always on the St. Patrick's Day itinerary for us outbound but we do not get as many inbound Ministers from the Republic of Korea as we would like and hopefully that will increase into the future. The EU-North Korea summit which happened in Singapore was not discussed because it had not happened at that stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_281"> On the trade issues between the EU and the US, it is disappointing that the US has ended the temporary exemption on new steel and aluminium tariffs which had been granted to the EU. The measures cannot be justified on the grounds of national security in our view and they are an inappropriate remedy for real problems of overcapacity on which the EU has offered the US its full co-operation in multiple fora, including the OECD, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. We will continue to support the Commission in its determination to protect fully EU commercial interests, including through World Trade Organisation, WTO, legal proceedings and appropriate rebalancing measures. This issue is before the European Council, which will meet next week. It was discussed in March and I expect it to be considered again when we meet later this month. In March, the European Council restated its commitment to strong transatlantic relations as a cornerstone of peace and prosperity and underlined its support for a dialogue on trade issues of common concern. The view of the Irish Government is that we would prefer to avoid the imposition of tit-for-tat trade restrictions on tariffs between the EU and the US. Those that have been imposed to date will have a relatively limited impact on Ireland but were it to spread to other goods and services it certainly could impact Ireland. The particular concern we have is for the potential impact on Aughinish Alumina. My Department, with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, are engaging intensively on this. I have spoken with the CEO of Aughinish personally and made it clear that the Government will do everything possible to assist it. Similarly, the IDA has been liaising closely with the firm's senior management since details of the sanctions first emerged.</p>
            <p eId="para_282">The matter is also being raised through diplomatic channels and with our international partners. As has been widely reported efforts are under way on the part of the parent companies to restructure their respective ownerships. If this proves successful and the US authorities expressly agree it could result in the sanctions against the companies in question being lifted meaning that Aughinish may no longer be impacted. That would be very welcome given its value to the area in terms of employment. There is no guarantee, however, that this will happen and that is why the Government will continue to engage very closely with Aughinish and provide any support or assistance we can.</p>
            <p eId="para_283"> In response to Deputy Burton's question on my engagement with other Heads of Government and whether we compare notes on domestic problems, yes absolutely, I always take the opportunity, if there is time, when I meet another Head of Government to talk about some of the domestic challenges we have, whether around health or housing and ask about their domestic challenges and compare notes. For example, most recently when I met the new Prime Minister of Spain I learnt that Spain's health service does not have access issues as severe as ours yet it spends much less on health than we do. I was trying to explore with him what Spain had got right that it spends considerably less per head on health care than we do but does not have the kind of access issues, long waiting times and so on, that we have. We agreed that there should be an exchange involving Spain's department of health and ours on that. He looked for something in return from me because Spain has a problem with structural long-term unemployment. It has very high youth unemployment rates, with 20% long-term unemployment, or something close to that figure, whereas it is approximately 3% in Ireland. I spoke about how that had been the case in Ireland for decades and how we had resolved that and we agreed that there would be an exchange between our Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Spain's on that issue. </p>
            <p eId="para_284"> I often find, which is interesting and mildly reassuring but not very that when we do speak to other Heads of Government and Prime Ministers about the domestic problems we face it is very often the case that they face the same domestic problems, to a greater or lesser extent. It would not be unusual in other member states or other countries for the same kinds of problems we have in the health sector to be problems there as well, perhaps not on the same scale but certainly issues such as recruiting staff, waiting times and increasing overcrowding in emergency departments are problems in other countries, even in France. It can often be the case with housing shortages as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_285"> The capital programme is not a 22-year programme, it is a ten-year programme. The national planning framework runs for 22 years, between now and 2040. The capital programme runs for ten years, that is €116 billion to be invested in public infrastructure, in housing and transport, broadband, new health care facilities and new schools. It will not take ten years to start. It has already started. Investment in public infrastructure is up by 18% this year alone. It will increase by another 25% next year, that is an additional €1.5 billion. We are getting this programme done and it is very much under way. The ten year national development plan provides for us to grow our social housing stock by 110,000 units over the next ten years. We grew the social housing stock, by different mechanisms, by 7,000 last year. It will be similar or more this year and will go up to 10,000 a year and more after that, adding to the social housing stock by 110,000. That is a considerable------</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_302">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 14, inclusive, and 99 together. On Monday, 11 June I launched Global Ireland,<i>
							</i>the Government's strategy to double the scope and impact of Ireland's global footprint by 2025. This represents the most ambitious renewal and expansion of Ireland’s international presence ever undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_303"> Investing in our international presence in this way will enable Ireland to be more ambitious in advancing its strategic international objectives, promoting its values and exerting its influence, both within and beyond the European Union. Global Ireland 2025 sets ambitious targets to accelerate progress in diversifying and growing Ireland's exports, inward investment and tourism, particularly in response to the challenges posed by the UK's departure from the European Union. </p>
            <p eId="para_304"> Under the initiative we will expand and strengthen our diplomatic and enterprise agency presence across the European Union and its neighbourhood, as well as in the UK; strengthen our presence in the United States, including a new flagship Ireland House in Los Angeles, and increasing our presence elsewhere in the Americas, including Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean; expand our presence in the Asia-Pacific region, including a new flagship Ireland House in Tokyo; develop our relationship with Africa beyond our traditional focus on aid to building new multifaceted partnerships; strengthen our presence in the Middle East and Gulf region; deepen and widen our connections with our diaspora throughout the world; ensure that our distinctive culture and heritage reaches new generations and audiences across the world; enhance our digital footprint through a communications strategy to increase visibility, raise awareness and enhance Ireland's reputation; publish a White Paper on Irish Aid, reaffirming our commitment to delivering 0.7% of gross national income, GNI, to development assistance by 2030; and promote Ireland's values of peace, humanitarianism, equality and justice, including through our campaign for election to the UN Security Council, which the Tánaiste and I will launch at the United Nations in New York on Monday 2 July. </p>
            <p eId="para_305"> The rationale for and urgency in undertaking this initiative now is abundantly clear. Technology is transforming lives and driving change in every corner of the world. Geopolitical and economic power is shifting south and east. The global trading environment is turbulent, with challenges to the rules-based systems on which we as a country rely. Closer to home, the United Kingdom, our nearest neighbour and trading partner, is preparing to leave the European Union. </p>
            <p eId="para_306"> In addition, the challenges that the world faces, whether climate change, security, tax in the digital age or migration, demand multilateral responses. Global Ireland will equip Ireland to shape and influence these critical debates and to take full advantage of new opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_307"> Implementation of the plan is already under way and will be overseen by a Cabinet committee, supported by a senior officials group chaired by my Department. Priority actions each year will be identified with corresponding decisions about investment to be finalised in the annual estimates process.</p>
            <p eId="para_308"> A number of significant decisions have already been taken since the initiative was announced last year, including the establishment of new embassies in Chile, Colombia, Jordan, New Zealand, Ukraine, Liberia, Morocco and the Philippines and new consulates in Vancouver, Mumbai, Frankfurt, Cardiff and Los Angeles.</p>
            <p eId="para_309"> Being a citizen of the world in the 21st century requires a strong and effective international presence, both physically and virtually. Global Ireland sets out the building blocks for Ireland to achieve that. The initiative will, of course, inform the Government's approach to overseas visits and engagement. For example, while my visit to Madrid last week was primarily an opportunity to meet with the new Prime Minister, I also attended an event with the Spanish-Irish Business Network and met our agency staff who are working there on the ground and had an opportunity to give them our thanks for promoting trade, tourism, inward investment and education in Ireland.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_187">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_310">We waited nearly a year for the Global Ireland document to be published but last week's document was more than a bit of a let-down. Fundamentally, there is no implementation plan and there are no costings in the plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_311"> I and my party have been calling for a significant expansion in our diplomatic, commercial and cultural footprint since well before the Brexit referendum. We have argued strongly that we do not have the personnel available to develop the scale and depth of relations which we need, particularly in the aftermath of Brexit. We do not have an issue with supporting the expansion as announced.</p>
            <p eId="para_312"> There are two major problems with the document launched last week. First, it is a stitching together of individual proposals from different Departments and agencies. There is no real clarity as to exactly what our strategy is for operating where we have representation and there is too much focus on headline projects which are welcome but secondary to how we use our presence in general. Second, and incredibly, there is no implementation plan setting annual targets and committing funding. I know the Taoiseach said he will budget for this but I find it strange that a year on we do not have an implementation plan or any costings. In the past two months the Taoiseach and his party have extensively briefed newspapers about a supposedly secret committee that is costing Opposition proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_313">The Taoiseach said he would have zero tolerance for uncosted promises. Of course, this misses the fact that many of the proposals the Taoiseach was criticising have also been made by Fine Gael Ministers and the Taoiseach himself. It is okay for the Taoiseach to make these promises uncosted but not for others to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_314"> Why is there no specific year-by-year implementation plan or detailed costings for this plan? Without these there is no basis for assessing the credibility of the plans or the level of real commitment being made for the future by different Departments. Will the Taoiseach address this immediately and publish the costings behind the plan?</p>

            <p eId="para_315">I welcome the eventual launch of the Global Ireland 2025 plan. It had been mooted in public on no less than two occasions by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. Fair play to them for getting a couple of bites at the cherry.</p>
            <p eId="para_316"> I agree with the Taoiseach, especially in light of Brexit, on the need to extend our reach for the purposes of investment, tourism, trade, links with our diaspora and valuable cultural exchanges. I support all of that. The Taoiseach referred to the opening of new missions and embassies. Of course, this had been announced previously. When will they become operational? The Taoiseach referred to other agencies like IDA Ireland and Fáilte Ireland. What additional supports and resources are planned for them?</p>
            <p eId="para_317"> I have a question on a similar matter. John Concannon headed up the strategic communications unit in the Department of the Taoiseach. I understand he is now working on the State's bid to secure a seat on the UN Security Council for 2021-22. Will the Taoiseach confirm what that work entails?</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Farrell<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_318">As has been said, the publication of the report is welcome, as are the improvements in cultural and business opportunities the State will be afforded once the plan is implemented. There is a fair question, however, on when some of these proposals are to be implemented, especially in respect of the new missions announced. As the Taoiseach has pointed out, opportunities will present in terms of the State broadening its footprint in the coming years, especially in the event of Brexit, and there will be implications for certain sectoral employment firms in this State and their ability to branch out further afield.</p>
            <p eId="para_319"> I wish to inquire about Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland. Will their footprints be included in this as well? I appreciate that with missions and embassies come personnel. Are there any additional proposals for IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland offices? This is especially relevant in Asia where complementary services should be provided to the counties with which our trade has increased substantially in the past two or three years. I would welcome a comment from the Taoiseach on that point.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_190">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_320">The Taoiseach listed several new locations for diplomatic missions to be opened. Are we preparing the additional staff now so that we will have a sufficient, robust, trained and experienced cohort to move into these missions? Some of these are small missions and would not have a cohort of mentoring staff available.</p>
            <p eId="para_321"> I note the proposal for Japan includes a new Ireland House that will cost €23 million. I was in Japan and I saw the two buildings we have currently in Tokyo. I know the price of building land there. In fact, if a building is devoted to a diplomatic purpose, the occupier gets a decrease. Is the concept of Ireland House to be a uniform concept now? Are we going to migrate to that concept everywhere?</p>
            <p eId="para_322"> The perception of Ireland is relevant for our footprint. Everywhere I go, including at international conferences I attend within my political group, I constantly have to address the issue of tax haven Ireland. Recent academic research and analysis from the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Copenhagen suggest €100 billion in corporate profits were shifted into Ireland in 2015. The research estimates that Ireland is the biggest recipient of such corporate shifts, bigger than all the Caribbean islands together. These are real issues. I realise they have been rejected by the Department of Finance, but perception is very real and we need to formulate a robust answer to that charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_323"> The Taoiseach might recall that his predecessor, Deputy Enda Kenny, believed in one of the perceptions of Ireland derived from our peacekeeping role through our military. Certainly in my time in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform he was a champion of the replacement of the flagship of the Naval Service with a multi-purpose vessel that could have a hospital facility. He believed that move could project positivity for Ireland in conflict zones. The Taoiseach wears a dual hat as he is Minister for Defence as well. Is there any progress on that as part of the global positive footprint for Ireland?</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_324">I welcome expanding diplomatic trade and cultural links with countries around the world. Undoubtedly, that is a good thing to do in an increasingly globalised world, especially in a world where people like Donald Trump are trying to dig people back into nasty little nationalist trenches.</p>
            <p eId="para_325"> In tandem with those links, our reputation is important. I heard the discussion earlier about Trump and I welcome the criticisms of the barbaric treatment of young children being separated from their parents. Some 12,000 of these children are now encaged in the most horrific conditions. The Taoiseach did not answer Deputy Coppinger's question about whether he considers this as a line that has been crossed or action that goes too far. She asked whether the Taoiseach should withdraw the invitation of the Government to Donald Trump to come to this country if we want to improve our international reputation. Reference was made to our humanitarian reputation and our reputation for humanitarian values. Is it not time to make a firm statement that Donald Trump is not welcome in this country and will not be invited to put his footprint, to use that term, in this country while thousands of children are encaged in a most barbaric fashion, separated from their parents and criminalised for simply being migrants?</p>

            <p eId="para_326">It does not appear in the document, as published, but Global Ireland 2025 is costed. I gave the figure at the launch event. The plan is costed at €300 million. That is not in one year. That is €300 million increasing incrementally every year until it reaches €300 million in 2027. The expenditure will not necessarily be exactly one eighth of the total every year, if that makes any sense. It will go up. The full cost by 2025 will be €300 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_327"> There are certainly targets although not annual targets. I will give three examples.</p>

          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_194" as="#Taoiseach">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_329">There is a target to double our exports to the eurozone. There is a target to double the number of international students studying in Ireland. There is a specific target around tourism to treble the revenue coming from the new markets in the Gulf and Asia.</p>
            <p eId="para_330"> I do not think Deputies need to be concerned about implementation. This is something that I am going to drive. My Department and the Tánaiste will drive it as well. Let us consider what is happening. The plan lays out our intention to increase the number of embassies and consulates throughout the world by 26. All those I mentioned in my earlier reply will be done within the next two years. In fact, ambassadors have been appointed in some cases and are training up. They are ready to go and be deployed to some of these new locations. We look forward to seeing that happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_331"> Deputy Farrell asked about the agencies. They are very much at the centre of this. We are expanding our diplomatic presence in Frankfurt because it is the emerging economic capital of Germany. It makes sense for Ireland to have a much stronger presence there for IDA Ireland and for Enterprise Ireland. This is just one example of that. There is also the appointment of cultural attachés to some embassies and the appointment of Bord Bia staff to some agencies, especially in places where Ireland wants to increase its food exports.</p>
            <p eId="para_332"> There is also the Ireland House approach in Tokyo and Los Angeles, which is where the embassy is on one floor and the agencies on another floor. This is to try to integrate our entire presence in those countries. The Ireland House concept, which is a very good one, has to be considered on a case-by-case basis, which often depends very much on the country. The United States of America, for example, has its political capital in Washington DC but economic activity happens in places such as New York, Texas and Los Angeles, so it does not make any sense to have everything under one roof in the United States of America. This is similar to Australia, where the political capital is Canberra but the economic and business activity tends to happen in Sydney and Melbourne. It does make sense in a place such as Japan where Tokyo is the financial capital and the political capital.</p>
            <p eId="para_333"> John Concannon will be working on the UN Security Council campaign from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and his role will be to lead on the promotional and communication aspects of it, but not the political aspect, obviously, which will be handled by politicians and diplomats.</p>
            <p eId="para_334"> There is no recent progress to report on the multipurpose vessel, but Ireland is renewing its fleet. This is very much happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_335"> With regard to the invitation issued to President Trump, the invitation was issued by my forebear and the invitation stands. There is, however, no date for a visit and no preparations have been made for a visit.</p>

I am aware that a number of US states have legalised cannabis, all the way down the west coast in places such as Oregon, Washington state and Colorado. The predictions from those who opposed the legalisation generally have not come true. It has been reasonably successful in the US states where it has been legalised. It has not been done in any European country yet, except for some special arrangements around coffee shops in Amsterdam. I have no doubt it is an issue we will consider. The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, has appointed a group, which is now sitting, to examine more broadly the issues around the decriminalisation of cannabis. The group has asked for public submissions and I will be interested to see what recommendations this group comes up with.</p>
            <p eId="para_342"> Medicinal cannabis is now available in Ireland on licence. The Minister for Health has issued seven-day licences. He has not refused a single licence when that application has been made with a prescription from a specialist. It is our intention to expand the medicinal cannabis access programme, based on prescriptions from medical specialists who are willing to take the risk of prescribing it as a medicine and who will monitor the patient. This aspect is very important because if cannabis is to be treated as a medicine, we must make sure it has the same standards as a medicine with regard to production, supply and monitoring.</p>

            <p eId="para_344">This is being worked on by the Minister for Health. The Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016 was rejected at the Joint Committee on Health which decided the proposed legislation was not fit for purpose and should not go forward. Amendments have been promised, but the last time I checked with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, the amendments that had been promised from the author of the Bill had not succeeded. It should be borne in mind that among the major problems with that legislation is the fact it goes much further by proposing the amendment, in effect, of the Misuse of Drugs Act. It does not establish cannabis as a medicine to be regulated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority like any other medicine. The Bill proposes to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act and may have the effect of legalisation. It also proposes to create two new Government agencies, one an institute for cannabis and the other a regulatory body. If cannabis is to be a medicine, surely it should be regulated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority like any other medicine.</p>

            <p eId="para_348">My question concerns recent comments made by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, that she was prepared to look at the question of child benefit payable to people on salaries of more than €100,000 per annum. When the Minister says she will look at something, I presume she means that she will either means test it or tax it. I have tabled this question to give the Minister an opportunity to state unequivocally the Government's position in this regard here and on the record of the House.</p>

            <from>Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection (Deputy Regina Doherty)<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_349">Given the week I have had, I appreciate the Deputy putting this question.</p>
            <p eId="para_350"> Child benefit is a monthly payment made to families with children in respect of all qualified children up to the age of 16 years. It is designed as a universal payment in recognition of the costs involved in raising children and plays an important role in tackling poverty. As a universal payment, it does not rely on a means test or social insurance contributions. The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education or who have a disability. Child benefit is paid to almost 629,000 families in respect of nearly 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of more than €2 billion in 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_351"> In recent days I have made my position on the child benefit payment very clear. I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to explain it on the record of the House. I will not, and I have never intended to, introduce a means test for child benefit. Means-testing child benefit is not being considered by Government and is not provided for in the programme for Government. Government policy is to provide additional supports for parents and their children through increased services rather than through increased cash transfers. This includes such services as free early years education through the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme, and enhanced provision of affordable childcare.</p>
            <p eId="para_352"> As the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, I genuinely and wholeheartedly support the universality of the child benefit payment, the system we have, and the principle that all families with children should receive this income support.</p>

            <p eId="para_353">I thank the Minister for making the position crystal clear so now we all know exactly where we stand. Would she agree with me that the universality of child benefit stems from the fact that we are talking about horizontal equity?</p>
            <p eId="para_354">In other words, resources are taken from people without children and given to those with them because the latter obviously have more expenses. Any means-testing or taxing of the benefit would be contrary to the principle of horizontal equity.</p>
            <p eId="para_355"> The Minister stated that her focus was on increasing services such as childcare rather than increasing cash benefits. Does that mean that we are entering a situation in which the amount payable in child benefit will effectively be frozen for the foreseeable future as resources are directed more and more towards child services?</p>

            <p eId="para_356">The universality of the payment is a recognition of the fact that families with children have higher costs than those without. That has always been the principle and, given that it is enshrined in my personal belief, will remain so for as long as I am Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_357"> My comments do not mean that anything will be frozen. Rather, we are using whatever money we have to try to improve and expand the range of public services. We all recognise that these are badly needed, in particular financially supported childcare, of which there is a major deficit. Stemming from the conversation that gave rise to the reporting, addressing that deficit is one of our country-specific objectives in the current EU semester, but there are also other measures, for example, medical care for children. We have free GP access for children under six years of age. The programme for Government would like to extend that. We added a second year to the early childhood care and education, ECCE, year that was introduced by the Deputy's Government. We would like to maintain and extend that scheme, increase capitations and improve quality. This is all about increasing and improving the range of services that the public service can offer people.</p>

            <p eId="para_358">Can I take it that the Mangan report is effectively a dead letter now? Does the Minister have plans to make further changes? I am not referring to increases, but to structural reforms in the child benefit system. For example, one of the suggestions in the Mangan report was for larger amounts to be paid to lower income families. However, I recognise that this would be a form of means testing.</p>

            <p eId="para_359">When I was asked about the Mangan report at the Institute of International and European Affairs, IIEA, conference, I said that I would be open to reading it and considering its contents. I have never read it but would not be arrogant enough not to see the value in examining something. The Government and I have no plans to means test. It is probably with good reason that the Mangan report was not acted upon when it was given to the then Minister for Social Protection in 2013. I am reading it, but only out of curiosity, not out of intent or will to make specific changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_360"> To help prevent child poverty, particularly through the payment's universality, my Department will ensure that child benefit remains as is and that we increase the spread of the working family payment. Last year, I started increasing children-specific qualified benefits. It was the first such increase in eight years. With everyone's co-operation, I hope to be able to do so again this year. Next week, we will announce the back to school and clothing allowances for 2018. My Department handles a myriad of supports for families with children. I would like to see us collectively extending those so as to ensure that such families are supported financially where they are not in a position to look after themselves.</p>

            <p eId="para_363">As we are all aware, all Irish defined benefit pension schemes have a rule that allows the employer to cease contributions, usually after a notice period. There is no legislative obligation on an employer to make contributions or any further liability on that employer where contributions cease, nor is there an obligation on an employer to give notice to members or to consult in advance of ceasing contributions. Accordingly, neither the Pensions Authority nor I have the power under legislation to intervene to compel an employer to continue to make contributions into a scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_364"> Even when a scheme is closed to new members or to the future accrual of benefits, the sponsoring employer role continues in respect of that scheme. Where a defined benefit scheme is closed to future accrual of benefits, which is not the same as being wound up, the scheme remains subject under EU and Irish law to the funding standard requirements and to the Pensions Act in general. It must continue to satisfy minimum funding standards into the future. It is important to note that the closure of a defined benefit scheme to future accrual does not mean its members will not receive a pension in line with the benefits that they accrued before the date of closure.</p>
            <p eId="para_365"> While it is not appropriate for me to comment on individual pension schemes, I am aware of the announcement of the closure of the Irish Life pension scheme to future accrual. I understand that the scheme is financially secure and its assets adequately cover all liabilities that would arise in the event of the trustees taking the decision to wind up the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_366"> As the Deputy is aware, I am finalising work to introduce extra protections for members of defined benefit pension schemes. I hope to be in a position to table those necessary legislative amendments on Committee Stage at the earliest possible opportunity. I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_367">I thank the Minister. Unfortunately, this is another case of an employer reneging on its employees' pension scheme. It has been happening consistently in recent years. It is also a case of the Government reneging on its responsibilities, given that this issue has been widely debated, including in the Chamber and by Oireachtas committees. There is considerable frustration. Irish Life workers have been left high and dry by the Government. The Minister is aware that the company's scheme is €240 million in surplus. The lack of action by the Government has not only given a green light to Irish Life to close down its defined benefit pension scheme, but to many other businesses as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_368"> The Minister alluded to the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017, which we are still awaiting. She stated that the Government was aware of the concerns and issues but did not have the power to intervene, so where are the necessary protections?</p>

            <p eId="para_369">I am loath to discuss a specific company or scheme, but the Deputy is aware that the scheme in question is not being wound down. Rather, it is being closed to future entrants. The surplus within the scheme is sufficient should the trustees decide to make changes. As such, there is no immediate threat or risk to the scheme's current members.</p>
            <p eId="para_370"> While an obligation preventing employers from closing defined benefit schemes in certain circumstances may appear to provide stability and certainty for members, it might also achieve a less desirable outcome, for example, prompting well-funded schemes to wind up in order to avoid legislation, which is not something that we want to see. It could give a competitive advantage to employers that never provided a risk-free defined benefit pension scheme. It could impact on a company's creditors, including debts owed to other businesses and individuals. It could impact on the value of a company's shares, many of which might be held by other pension funds, credit unions or small-scale investors. As such, we need to be careful in the first instance about what we say about a particular company and, second, about our views on previous legislation, which was passed by a Fianna Fáil Government, and current Government legislation that is before the Houses.</p>

            <p eId="para_371">The key issue is the shifting of pension risk from the employer to the employee. The Government seems to be deliberately dragging its heels in putting protections in place. The Bill passed Second Stage eight months ago and the committee has been screaming for it, but we are yet to see it. In my view and that of the people who are being impacted by this issue, there is a deliberate delaying of the necessary legislation by the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_372">Things will be very grim come 30 June for the 1,200 employees of Irish Life. The Government is standing idly by and doing nothing. It has completely ignored the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, review of Ireland's pension system and recommendations on defined benefit schemes. I ask the Minister to comment on that. Does she believe protections should be in place for employees in defined pension schemes whose employers have taken from the Government's dragging of its heels that they have a green light to close down these schemes?</p>

            <p eId="para_373">The previous Government introduced increased protections for deferred members of defined benefit, DB, schemes that were wound up. The wind-up priority order was amended in the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013. Prior to those changes, pensioner benefits were given priority over the benefits of active and deferred member schemes. The changes to the wind-up priority order deprioritised a portion of pensioner benefits in the manner in which the resources of a scheme are distributed on the wind-up of a pension scheme. Those changes made more resources available to current workers in defined benefits schemes. The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012 required that a DB scheme hold additional funding in the form of a risk reserve by 2023. We have already made significant changes to how defined benefit schemes are managed. The Deputy is well aware that we have current legislation that has passed Second Stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_389">We intend to introduce a total contributions approach to establishing a level of entitlement for all new contributory State pensions from 2020 onwards. The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 sets out how it is intended to implement the total contributions approach, TCA, to calculating entitlement to the contributory State pension. The criteria required for a full pension under that new approach have not yet been determined and are currently subject to a public consultation, which I launched a few weeks ago, on 28 May, and which will remain open until 3 September. Issues the Deputy raises, such as the number of years required for a full pension, are addressed in the consultative questions and the accompanying documentation. The final details will not be decided upon until I have considered all the submissions received in this process. For this reason, it will be important to have industry commentators and representative bodies present at the launch of the public consultation. We also need to receive submissions from many other bodies and I hope to arrange some form of roadshow by September. I do not mean to be disrespectful to the people who attended, to whom I am grateful, but I want to speak to real people and the workers of today who will be pensioners after 2020. I want to speak to people aged over 55 years and those who will be genuinely affected by the new approach. I want to have a proper conversation to ensure that when we all sit down after September we can collectively decide, with the Oireachtas committee, what the new model will look like. We will then be happy to stand over the new system because it will be in the interests of the people. The public consultation is available on my Department's website and I genuinely encourage all interested stakeholders to participate in the survey and make a submission before 3 September.</p>

            <p eId="para_390">It is reassuring that the final determination has not yet been made on whether the baseline will be 30 or 40 years. In view of the fact that the self-employed only started making pension contributions in 1988, no self-employed person will qualify for the full pension in the year in which the new system kicks in. Does the Minister accept that such a scenario would be unfair?</p>
            <p eId="para_391"> The Minister acknowledged that some people may lose out under the new scheme. Let us assume a baseline of 40 years is adopted. Under the current system, a person with 20 years of contributions could receive up to 85% of a contributory pension, whereas under a total contributions system with a baseline of 40 years, that person would only receive 50% of a contributory pension. The Minister stated such a person would have an option to remain in the current system if he or she was adversely affected and worse off under the new system. Would such an arrangement be transitional and, if so, for how long would it last?</p>

            <p eId="para_392">Self-employed people came into our current social insurance system in 1988 and, accordingly, such a person would have a maximum of 32 years of contributions when the total contributions approach becomes operational in 2020. Depending on the final determination of the number of contributions required in our new full State pension, this may pose a challenge for some of the people who will retire around that time. I set out this scenario in the consultation paper and it is possible that a transition period will be needed. I have also included a number of specific questions on this matter, including how we believe we should deal with it, how long the transition period should be and who should be included in the transition period. I genuinely hope that self-employed people log on and subscribe to give us their views.</p>
            <p eId="para_393"> As the Deputy noted, when we make changes to systems, there are normally winners and losers. I would like the system to be designed in such a way that there are no losers. I know that is exceptionally ambitious and will cost us but we do not want to change to a new system which leaves people behind with a bad taste in their mouths. I want everybody to appreciate that the new system we are moving towards is fairer than the current system. The proof will be in the pudding, however, and we must ensure the new system is fair and no one is left behind. Nothing is prescribed. We need to consider everyone's views on how best we can deliver a new model in January 2020 that will see us through the next generations.</p>

            <p eId="para_394">I simply made the point that a 40-year baseline would discriminate against the self-employed who only joined the contributory pensions system in 1988, as the Minister correctly noted. I have another question on an issue about which I and other Deputies are receiving queries. The first hurdle to overcome before qualifying for a contributory old age pension is to have 520 paid contributions. The figure previously was 260. Is the figure of 520 contributions set in stone or is it up for discussion? If it is intended that it will remain in place, will it be possible, when calculating contributions, to count the new credits that will be provided for people who are looking after children, sick people and so forth?</p>

            <p eId="para_399">In recent years, bogus self-employment has become a curse or blight across the economy. We are all aware that false self-employment is prevalent and it has become rampant in certain sectors. We are also aware that self-employment is an important form of employment, which makes a significant contribution to the economy. I have been self-employed for the past 37 years. I have no doubt that the genuinely self-employed do not want people who are genuinely employed and should be classified as PAYE workers interspersed among their number. This practice deprives the Exchequer of the pot to which it is entitled for disbursement to ordinary workers.</p>

            <p eId="para_400">The media campaign on false self-employment was aimed at ensuring there would be better public awareness of the important service the Department provided in determining employment status and helping to develop a better understanding of the scale and nature of false self-employment. The main advertising campaign was run over a two-week period, with digital and social media promotions continuing for a further two weeks. As a first step, the campaign directed people to a dedicated page on my Department's website. The website provides important information on the impact of false self-employment and the criteria used to determine whether someone is an employee or self-employed, as well as contact information for the Scope section within my Department, the Workplace Relations Commission and the Revenue Commissioners. The new web page attracted more than 10,500 visits during the campaign, with an average time of more than three minutes spent on the page, which is regarded as very favourable, given people's reduced attention span these days.</p>
            <p eId="para_401"> The Scope section received approximately 50 calls and 30 emails during the campaign from individuals who had become aware of the service directly as a result of the ad campaign. Feedback suggests the detailed information available on the dedicated website appears to have been successful in addressing issues for many people who contacted us. The majority of callers confirmed that they had visited the website first before contacting the Department. Ten formal applications for a Scope decision were registered in the first week.</p>
            <p eId="para_402"> Staff in the Scope section, the communications unit and the social welfare inspectorate were involved in the campaign as part of their regular duties. An additional executive officer, EO, has been allocated to the Scope section on a permanent basis. The Scope section has six EOs who are deciding officers. Social welfare inspectors are undertaking targeted employer inspections based on the feedback gathered during the campaign. They will focus on the sectors identified and companies reported to the Scope section during that time. While the number of direct contacts with the Scope section has been small, I am satisfied that the campaign has been successful in raising public awareness of the issue of false self-employment, but as the Deputy and I both know, we have a long way to go.</p>

            <p eId="para_403">There is a set of winners and only one loser. The winners are the people who engage in bogus self-employment. Employers save on PRSI and taxation and are dodging the employment laws applicable to normal PAYE workers and the Social Insurance Fund receives less, as does everyone involved. Workers who are categorised falsely lose out on rights set out in employment legislation such as pay, including holiday pay, and redundancy payments - the whole shebang. I am not surprised the Minister did not receive an awful lot, as I do not think it was the right way to go about it. I know that she is into innovation and fair play to her, but my colleague, Mr. Jack O'Connor, dismissed the initiative on the basis that it was about as useful as an ashtray on a motor bike. In effect, an ashtray on a motor bike would mean one would get nothing. How could people take up the initiative? It is no wonder the number was small. There is a genuine fear. People do not become involved lightly. From talking to the Minister, I appreciate that that is what she wants and that she is committed to making various changes. I know that in her heart she wants the initiative to be a success, but if it is not as successful as she wants it to be, is she prepared to consider the legislative route?</p>

            <p eId="para_404">New and legitimate forms of work have emerged and will continue to emerge. It is not just happening in Ireland. In fact, Ireland is probably lagging behind the rest of the world in the uptake of new forms of work, which is not bad. We constantly talk about bogus self-employment and attribute it to a particular industry, as if it were bad. People being made self-employed when they do not want to be and should not be is definitely not good, but the emergence of new ways of working is not bad. What I want to be sure about is that all of the standard employment rights for people with normal jobs are available to those who work in the gig or platform economy, as well as all of the benefits of which employees are able to avail under the social insurance system. We are improving all of them in another piece of legislation that will go through the House next week. I want to make sure the two situations stand equal with each other and will not stop as long as I am in this position. However, that does not directly answer the Deputy's question. I will continue to pursue research that may end up as legislation to address the large number who do it voluntarily or those who are made to do it, namely, those who declare to be self-employed in order to work on a contract basis with a company. These companies are not paying into the Social Insurance Fund for the people concerned and that is wrong. That is something we should pursue and it will have to be pursued with legislation. As the Deputy is well aware, it does not just come within the remit of my Department, but for as long as I am in this role it is something I will pursue.</p>

            <p eId="para_405">I acknowledge that the Minister wants to root out this practice and deal with the primary motivation of rogue employers. A genuine employer does not want to misrepresent the status of his or her workers to avoid paying tax or PRSI, but fraud is fraud no matter where it occurs. If an ordinary worker fails to do something, the entire panoply of the State comes down on top of him or her over a few pence and he or she is named, blamed and shamed. The Labour Party introduced the Protection of Employment (Measures to Counter False Self Employment) Bill 2017 which took an holistic approach to determine and classify employment status. A clear set of rules was to be set out in statute law to apply to all State bodies and enforced across the board by the courts and administrative tribunals. It sought to amend tax law and measures on avoidance to deal with bogus self-employment and apply PRSI. If such a measure was in place, it would be a major deterrent. There would be no fear that anybody would want to classify one way or the other. Employers who might consider forcing a person to go down the route of false self-employment would think twice and probably five times before he or she would do so. I know that is what the Minister wants. Perhaps we might not need to go to these lengths and the Minister's campaign will succeed. I wish the initiative well because it is something on which the Labour Party has been very focused, together with the trade unions, and we will remain so until the issue is finally resolved and everybody is classified appropriately to their employment status.</p>

These companies are not paying into the Social Insurance Fund and not doing anything wrong, but we are still not getting money from them for the State to pay benefits to the people who are self-employed to whom, as the Deputy is aware, they are being extended under the social insurance scheme. There are a number of things we could do and we should look at them collectively. One particular piece of legislation is only going to crack one nut. This is a bigger issue. However, we must be cognisant of the fact that there are new forms of work and that we need to encourage people into them as an entry level for young people in order that they can do so while in college and then move to proper careers once they qualify. However, we also need to make sure they retain the same employment rights as everyone else in a standard working environment.</p>

She will also be aware that there is a section which provides for this in the famous Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017, Committee Stage of which we are still awaiting.

            <p eId="para_411">As the Deputy is well aware, my Department takes very seriously criminal prosecutions against persons who defraud the social welfare system and against employers who fail to carry out their statutory obligations under social welfare legislation. This reflects the Department's specific obligations to ensure the welfare system operates in a fair and cost effective way and that public funds are used for the purposes provided by the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_412"> Section 4 of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 sets out to enable the publication of details of persons convicted of committing social welfare offences. The provision aims to make the Department's work in tackling fraud and abuse more transparent and increase the public's confidence that the social welfare system and the associated annual costs of up to €20 billion are secure from fraud and wrongful claiming.</p>
            <p eId="para_413"> In the debate on Second Stage of the Bill in this House I said the Government had agreed to consider an amendment to provide that only the names of individuals convicted where the fraud was for in excess of €5,000 would be published. The debate on Second Stage concluded on 4 October 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_414">I obtained Government approval to draft provisions for a number of additional items to be included in the Bill on Committee Stage subsequently. These provisions, relating to defined benefit pensions and GDPR, are currently being finalised with the support of the Attorney General’s office and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The Bill was provisionally scheduled for Committee Stage on 31 May but that date was postponed, hopefully for a short period, to allow for the finalisation of the necessary Government amendments. When these amendments have been finalised, I will be seeking an early date for Committee Stage.</p>

It has been suggested to me that there may be some legal or constitutional difficulty with limiting the publication to cases of more than €5,000. Is that the case? If it is not possible to limit publication to cases valued at more than €5,000, will the Minister consider dropping the proposal? Let us face it, these people have already appeared in the newspapers; people know who they are because they are in local and national media when they are prosecuted for social welfare fraud. There is no obvious reason for listing them again on some sort of list.</p>

Deputy O'Dea is aware that we only take people to court in the first instance if the amount by which they have defrauded the State is in excess of €5,000. People who have been overpaid, who forgot to sign off for a couple of weeks and those who are guilty of no more than normal human error will never see the inside of a court room.</p>
            <p eId="para_417"> The Department has given consideration to the proposal and how it might best work. Concerns relating to the threshold and the legal soundness of same are behind the redrafting of the amendment. The impact of a threshold could be that convictions for some of the most serious offences prosecuted would not ever be published while at the same time, convictions for what might appear to be relatively lesser offences would be published. This is considered arbitrary, unfair and contrary to the objectives of the Department. Very serious offences which may never have any monetary value attached to or related to them because they were detected before a claim went to payment would not be published if a threshold is introduced. Employer prosecutions relating to obstruction or non-compliance with PRSI obligations, for example, would not ever have a monetary value. Therefore, we would not be able to publish details on such rogue employers and I believe that is wrong. We should be able to do so and the advice has come back to that effect.</p>

            <p eId="para_420">I take it the Minister agrees with my contention that less than 10% of the money lost by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection relates to deliberate fraud. I think the figure is €40 million as opposed to several hundred million euro, which is lost as a result of errors on the part of the Department itself or of genuine mistakes on the part of individuals.</p>
            <p eId="para_421"> Individuals who are detected for social welfare fraud, who go to court and are prosecuted and sentenced generally have their details published in newspapers. Everybody in their community knows they have defrauded the social welfare system and if that is not a sufficient deterrent to people, I do not see how publication of their names on a list several months later will be a more effective deterrent. I do not see how it will be the straw that breaks the camel's back or the extra thing that stops people from defrauding the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_422"> During the Second Stage debate on the Bill, the Minister gave an assurance to the House that there would be no question of the list being available for other purposes or to other organisations. She said that appropriate measures would be taken to ensure that the list would not be more widely disseminated. What practical steps are being taken to honour that commitment?</p>

            <p eId="para_433">I am considering giving up my day job, such is the level of complaints being received in our offices regarding the conduct of Seetec. What is the status of the personal progression plan? It appears that people are being coerced into signing forms and that their experiences with this private company are utterly demoralising, with potential data protection issues also arising.</p>

            <from>Deputy Regina Doherty<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_434">It is interesting to note that the personal progression plan does not belong to Seetec. Whenever we have conversations in here on such plans, nobody every complains about them in the context of Turas Nua or Intreo offices. The personal progression plan belongs to the Intreo service in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. When individuals present as jobseekers, that is, as people who are seeking work, they enter into arrangements with my Department through which we will help them to find work and part of those arrangements is the personal progression plan. When jobseekers get that plan, they sign it and they sign up to working with their individual agent, who may be in an Intreo office, a Turas Nua office or a Seetec office.</p>
            <p eId="para_435"> If Deputy Daly knows of genuine cases where people feel they are being coerced, she should forward the details to me. Coerced is an awful word to use because nobody is being made to be a jobseeker. If people want to be jobseekers, they present to that part of our Department that will assist them willingly and they seek our help. If they do not want us to help them to find work, they do not have to stay. Nobody is being made to sign a personal progression plan; it is something to which people willingly sign up in the context of being helped to find work. The language the Deputy uses worries me. If she genuinely has specific cases that justify the language she uses, I ask her to bring them to me. I will make sure they are investigated and will revert to the Deputy on them. </p>
            <p eId="para_436"> I reiterate that the personal progression plan belongs to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. It is fed through our Intreo offices and is not the property of any agency working on our behalf. It is a directive from the Intreo service and forms part of the engagement we have with people who present voluntarily to the Department who are actively looking for work and who want our help.</p>

            <p eId="para_437">It is fair to say that these are people who present voluntarily and who would like to get work. These are people who, in many instances, are capable of trying to get work for themselves but for whatever reason, they are currently out of work. In many cases, they do not feel they need to be dictated to or talked down to by a private, for profit organisation. The difference here is that Seetec is a private, for profit company which is getting paid on the basis of the numbers of cases it handles.</p>
            <p eId="para_438"> One woman phoned our office to tell us she did not sign a personal progression plan but was told that it had been signed on her behalf. What service is this organisation supposed to be providing? I know Deputy Shortall raised this issue in the House previously.</p>
            <p eId="para_439">The person on whose behalf she raised it has been in contact with us and also written to the Minister. The man who is 46 years old has said he felt utterly demoralised and depressed as a result of the treatment he received. He is willing to find and capable of finding work for himself. He wants to know why a private company was looking for the right or power to contact a future employer on his behalf. If his employment needs to be confirmed, it should be done by the Department, not by a private company. That is the difference or difficulty.</p>

            <p eId="para_440">Obviously, the Deputy is right when she says everybody presents voluntarily. Nobody is made to stay or coerced to sign anything. Nobody can sign anything on behalf of anybody else. Whoever told the person who contacted the Deputy that his personal progression plan had been signed on his behalf was inaccurate. It cannot be signed by anybody. If someone does not sign up to his or her personal progression plan, it is not worth the paper on which it is written. It lists the activities on which someone and the person assigned to him or her will work to try to find work. In January the Department published a cohort performance report for the service which showed that 25% of jobseekers who had begun to engage with it in the first four quarters after its commencement had obtained work, 18% of whom had found full-time work and 4% part-time work, while 3% had started up their own jobs. After someone involved in the service finds a job, there is a six-month period of contact between him or her and the new employer. Obviously, it has to be voluntary. It is not something that can be forced on somebody. The reason for the contact with the person being employed over the six-month period is to support him or her in his or her new employment. It is not a case of big brother looking over people's shoulders. We have to remember that the individuals in these cases were out of work for more than 12 months in a single period before they were sent to JobPath. There is a reason they were out of work. In many cases, they were out of work because there was no work available in recent years, which is fair enough. Others may have been out of work for more than 12 months for other reasons. Many of the people concerned value and genuinely appreciate the relationships they build with their sponsors over a 12-month period. In many cases, they want to keep these relationships going to maintain their new found levels of confidence. In others they do not want to do so, which is fine too.</p>

            <p eId="para_441">If somebody wanted this kind of contact, obviously, he or she would not be complaining about it. The issue at stake arises after people secure employment. Seetec, which is a private, for-profit company, has been given consent to contact the future employers of such persons in order that details can be confirmed or otherwise. It is one thing to ask John how he is getting on and whether everything is going okay, but it is quite different to require him to sign something that will give Seetec permission in these circumstances. People like John have to sign these documents and will lose their benefits if they do not sign them. This process is making people feel very uncomfortable. Many of the individuals in question are older and have specialised in particular areas of work. Some of them have been offered positions of employment that they consider unsuitable for their skill sets. They believe they are being forced into jobs for which they might be overqualified, even though they want to explore other avenues to find employment in their own spheres of expertise. It is intrusive and demeaning for people like John to know that employers who take them on will be contacted to see how they are getting on.</p>

            <p eId="para_442">I assure the Deputy and anybody else who happens to be listening that the system is not in place for the reason suggested by the Deputy. We are engaged in finding sustainable employment for people. The system is in place for six months after somebody finds a job to ensure the employment is sustained. The person who helped the jobseeker to find the job in the first place has a responsibility to make sure the job is maintained. It is not a reflection on the person; rather, it is a reflection of the company and the fact that when people are being placed in jobs, we need to know that the employment is actually sustainable. It is not about checking whether Johnny is doing a great job. It is certainly not as prescriptive as that; rather, it is about ensuring Johnny is in the job and okay. It is about ensuring the supports he needs from the person in the Intreo office, Turas Nua or Seetec who has been assisting him will be maintained. It is genuinely that simple.</p>

            <p eId="para_445">The Department is committed to making decisions on entitlements as quickly as possible. In general, applications under social welfare schemes with a number of complex qualifying conditions, including those mentioned by the Deputy, take longer to process. Before a decision can be made on entitlement to domiciliary care allowance, evidence of the additional care needs of the child must be provided and examined. Similarly, before a decision can be made on entitlement to carer's allowance, evidence of the care recipient's care requirement, the level of care the carer provides and the carer's means must be provided. In respect of disability allowance, evidence of the person’s medical condition, the extent to which it restricts him or her from taking up employment, his or her means and habitual residency must be provided. The target in processing applications for domiciliary care allowance is to finalise 90% of new claims within ten weeks. This is being achieved. The target in processing applications for carer's allowance is to finalise 70% of new claims within 12 weeks. Currently, the average waiting time in processing new carer's allowance applications is 15 weeks. Obviously, the target is not being achieved. The target in processing applications for disability allowance is to process 75% of new claims within 12 weeks. Currently, the waiting time in processing new disability allowance applications is 13 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_446"> My Department recognises that the current processing times for carer's allowance and disability allowance must be improved and is working to achieve this. Staff resources have recently been reassigned to work in claims processing. A redesigned application form will be available shortly to try to simplify the application process. The new form will allow carers to provide more information on the type and level of care they provide. The aim is to provide deciding officers with the information they need to expedite decisions on entitlement. The implementation of a new information technology system to process illness benefit claims, as part of the ongoing modernisation programme in my Department, will support the deployment of additional staff to support the processing of carer's allowance applications. It is hoped this will help to reduce the average waiting time below the current level of 13 weeks. The processes in place and resources assigned to these areas of my Department, with the number of medical assessors available to provide medical opinions, are kept under constant review to ensure delays are minimised.</p>

            <p eId="para_447">We are blessed with our carers. They provide 24-hour care for some of our most vulnerable citizens. They do so for a fraction of what it would cost the State to provide the same level of care. I understand it was recently estimated that it would cost approximately €4 billion a year, which is a lot of money. Carers keep tens of thousands of people out of State care and free up crucial beds for those with more urgent or life-threatening health care needs. I shudder to think what chaos the healthcare system would face if carers were not keeping thousands of beds available. We must do more for carers. The current waiting time for an application to be processed is between 16 and 18 weeks, which is nothing short of an insult. I spoke today to a number of staff members who had been following up on carer's allowance applications since 2012. They told me that the average waiting time back then was 16 weeks, which means that we are seeing no long-term improvement. This contradicts what the Minister said. The process is cumbersome and tedious. We force carers to jump through hoops and endure red tape in order to receive payments such as domiciliary care allowance and disability allowance. This is consistent across the board. Will the Minister give me a commitment that she will do everything in her power to reduce application processing times and streamline the application process for those seeking these crucial payments?</p>

            <p eId="para_448">I agree with the Deputy. I acknowledge the value of the work of carers and their commitment to the people for whom they care. The Deputy and I are well aware that this country could not afford to pay carers if it wanted to do so. There is a huge debt of gratitude owed in everything we do. To be fair to the Government and its predecessor, we have taken some small measures to try to show our gratitude. Most recently, we introduced medical cards for persons in receipt of carer's allowance and reinstated the respite care grant. We can do such small things to show our gratitude. As the Deputy suggested, the payment carers receive on a weekly basis is the real sign of our gratitude. The statistics I have are accurate. They were compiled in the past couple of days. Thankfully, they have changed. We are still a week behind, but that is only in 75% of cases. There may be 16 or 17-week cases coming to the Deputy's office. A number of years ago we had a very serious issue with applications for domiciliary care allowance. That gave rise to the establishment of a wonderful organisation, DCA Warriors, which most of us know and work with. We reformed the application process by streamlining it and making it much easier for applicants and the Department. The application process is now working well. We are in the process of doing the same in the case of carer's allowance. The application form has been changed and we are making online applications more available.</p>

            <p eId="para_451">I speak to many applicants for carer's allowance, domiciliary care allowance, disability allowance and other payments. They believe the State is fighting them every step of the way. That is what I am hearing from them. Of course, I understand the application process has to be stringent and diligent, but I believe we have gone way over the top with red tape. I will give an example from my constituency. In December 2017 a woman was awarded full-rate carer's allowance in respect of her son. She then discovered that she would have an additional entitlement to a half-rate carer's allowance in respect of her daughter who had just been approved for receipt of domiciliary care allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_452">She was getting one and then she was applying for the half one. The Department had assessed her means for the first one in respect of her son and it had the medical for her daughter's domiciliary care allowance yet the application for an additional half rate carers allowance was treated as a new applicant. That is a waste of time and space. It is so simple. These are just a few examples. I could give several. She was already assessed for her son and then her daughter's case came along she had to go through the whole lot again.</p>
            <p eId="para_453"> I also want to raise the issue of undocumented carers. Applicants who are just over the means or just outside the medical requirements and miss out on a payment, GP visit card and carer support grant are still having to leave work anyway to care for a loved one with a severe illness. Can the Minister look at this?</p>
            <p eId="para_454"> Has the Minister any plans to increase the carers allowance, domiciliary care allowance or disability allowance payment in the coming budget? That has been asked but I will throw it in anyway.</p>

            <p eId="para_455">The Deputy would have to ask.</p>
            <p eId="para_456"> The carers allowance and all of our schemes are statutory schemes. I appreciate that it does not seem to make sense to the lady who has already applied successfully for the full carers allowance for her son. When she makes an application for her daughter, despite the fact that it is only half a carers allowance it is still a new application and under the law it has to be deemed to be adjudicated in exactly the same way as if the Deputy or I or somebody we knew applied for the first time. Each application has to be taken on its own merit. That is just the way the law is.</p>
            <p eId="para_457"> Budget negotiations for this year have not started so I cannot answer the Deputy's second question. Obviously, it will be defined and determined by the amount of fiscal space available from the Department of Finance. The only thing I can say to the Deputy is that there are 6,000 people working in my Department. They are there to serve the people who need help at certain periods of their life. They do not take 20 weeks to go through an application just because they want to annoy somebody. We have times and targets available based on either the volume of applications we get or the length of time needed to do the work. For these three particular payments, most have to go through a medical assessor or there is a requirement to really genuinely assess the care that is being given to a person. It takes times. Some cases are taking longer. Sometimes a reason for that is that we do not get the information in the first instance. We want to make sure that we streamline it and make it as easy as we possibly can so that we reduce the numbers of weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_461">This is to ask the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection when she plans to progress the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017, which the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection facilitated on 31 May 2018 at the request of the Department. The heads of the Bill were brought in on 9 May, including defined benefit, DB, protection to particular areas. It was published on 6 July. There have been numerous stops and starts and we are still waiting. It was an affront not to have that legislation before the committee on 31 May after all indications had been given that it would be there.</p>

            <p eId="para_462">I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 75 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_463"> Second Stage of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 concluded on 4 October 2017 and Government approval to draft provisions for a number of additional items to be included in the Bill on Committee Stage was obtained from Cabinet. These provisions are currently being finalised by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. They include, among other matters, provisions related to defined benefit pensions and measures related to the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR.</p>
            <p eId="para_464"> A key priority for the Government is to provide additional protections for scheme members’ pension benefits. However, it is essential that any new measures recognise the current pension landscape in Ireland so that a balanced, proportionate approach is developed and that unintended negative consequences do not arise. Under existing pensions law, there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions to a scheme. However, the provisions of this Bill will introduce a new regime into the Pensions Act 1990 which will, among other things, enable the Pensions Authority to make a funding obligation direction specifying payments to be made by a sponsoring employer to the pension scheme where no agreement was reached, within a specified time period, to resolve a funding deficit.</p>
            <p eId="para_465"> In order to achieve a balanced approach it has been necessary to consult with and obtain numerous legal advices from the Office of the Attorney General in respect of the DB provisions. The Bill was provisionally scheduled for Committee Stage on 31 May. This has been postponed to allow for the finalisation of the necessary Government amendments. These provisions are quite technical and complex. However, work is at an advanced stage and when complete an early date for Committee Stage will be requested from the committee. </p>
            <p eId="para_466"> Finally, many of the provisions contained within the EU directive on institutions for occupational retirement provision, IORP II, will also support positive reform of the Irish occupational pensions sector. Implementation of the directive will require legislative changes and my officials, together with the Pensions Authority, are working on the transposition process to ensure that the necessary amendments to existing laws, regulations or administrative provisions will be made to give full effect to the directive. </p>

            <p eId="para_467">Over a year is rather a long time to check that all the t's have been crossed and the i's have been dotted. I know it is important legislation. Thousands of workers are waiting for it to come through for some protection. Irish Life workers in a scheme that is healthy are potentially affected by their defined benefit scheme being wound down. There is also Ryanair and Independent News and Media. This was flagged last May in the heads of the Bill in respect of the two areas, the 12 months' notice to trustees from the bosses to cease contributions, and provision that if trustees and employer cannot agree a funding proposal, the Pensions Authority would intervene and set a contribution schedule. Many workers saw that as a protection and they are hugely disappointed. It is disgraceful that over a year later we are still waiting for the legislation to come through.</p>

            <p eId="para_482">My question is very similar. The real tragedy here is that we are missing an opportunity to do what they do in Britain and elsewhere in Europe and that is to put manners on companies that are in very good health when it comes to their pension schemes yet decide to move workers off defined benefit and onto defined contribution schemes. That is exactly what is happening in Irish Life and it has happened in Independent News and Media and AIB. It is a money grab by these companies. They are not struggling. They are not underfunded or in trouble. What they are trying to do is offload what would be very good futures and healthy pensions for workers so that they maximise their profits.</p>
            <p eId="para_483"> That is what is missing from this tiny little amendment to which we have been reduced. Has the Minister been lobbied by Irish Life, Ibec or any of their representatives to reduce what was substantial to something very minimal? The provision has been watered down very substantively and I do not believe it will return to the original proposals that the Minister made. Has there been any lobbying on behalf of the pension companies, Irish Life itself or Ibec?</p>

            <p eId="para_484">I can categorically say "no", but I am not sure to what the Deputy is referring. Nothing has been watered down. The amendments have not been drafted. I do not know what the Deputy is referring to or what she is holding in her hand. What we released in the heads of the Bill are currently being drafted in amendments. There are no changes, no lessening, no meetings with anybody.</p>
            <p eId="para_485"> I have to put on the record that my husband works in Irish Life but he works in IT. I have not been lobbied by anybody in Irish Life. To my recollection, I meet Ibec regularly but it is usually with regard to the Employment Bill and not this particular Bill. I will have to check my records but I do not recall having been lobbied on this particular Bill. Let me be very clear; it would not make a blind bit of difference to me because the intentions are set. They are clear. They were set a year ago, as Deputy Collins has said.</p>
            <p eId="para_486"> Yes, we are all waiting for the amendments. I am awaiting them as eagerly as the Deputies are. I am told they are very close to being finalised. I am also told they are very complex. When we talk about pensions people put on that kind of pinchy face as if it is complex and most people do not understand it. What I understand is that the obligations and objectives of this legislation are to ensure there is a set of rules that is fair to both the employers and employees in defined benefits pensions going forward. The sooner we get the amendments and get to Committee Stage the better for all of us.</p>

            <p eId="para_487">With all due respect, there are no persons more eager for these amendments to come through than the workers themselves whose pensions are being attacked in healthy funds by companies that can well afford to keep defined benefit pensions going.</p>
            <p eId="para_488">It is a money grab by many of these companies. The Minister is awaiting the amendments. When it was published on 6 July, the Bill did not include any amendments relating to defined benefit schemes. This is why people are concerned that it is not on the agenda and has been pulled by the Department or the Minister. This needs to be brought in quickly. The workers in Irish Life are eagerly awaiting the introduction of this measure so there would be some sort of protection for them. It was very remiss of the Department and the Minister not to have brought this in even more quickly than has been the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_489">I do not think I argued that the heads of Bill were cast iron but I do think they were more elaborate than what we have. I know the Minister said it is complex and we all pinch our faces when we talk about pensions. I probably do more than pinch my face because I do not have a great understanding of them not having been involved in a pension scheme to date. It cannot be as complex to do something in Ireland that has already been done in Great Britain and across Europe, which is to protect workers in defined benefit schemes from being pushed into defined contribution schemes by companies that are completely solvent and that are in fact very healthy. Other Deputies have named these companies, as have I, and other Bills have been submitted by Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin and Labour that would do the same job but have been held back because the Government Bill goes forward. It is being delayed to the point of utter frustration and probably huge disappointment on the part of workers. Since the Minister's husband works there, the Minister will know that this is the biggest pension organiser in the country. If it gets away with this, it is leading by example and so will the 110 other schemes that control defined benefit.</p>

            <p eId="para_490">Could I be very careful with language? I ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to give me a teeny bit of latitude if I ramble on. No one is getting away with anything. What is happening in Irish Life is entirely legal so no one is getting away with anything. Second, we do not have the proposed amendments. What we have are the draft heads of a Bill. We do not have the amendments yet. This is what we are all anxiously awaiting with me being first in the queue. If and when the new legislation is enacted, it will not stop what is happening in Irish Life because it is currently legal. All that will happen is that a scheme will have to give a minimum notice period of 12 months before the contributions can be stopped. That is the only thing that will happen. Irish Life gave well in excess of 12 months' notice so even if the legislation were passed, it would still not be breaking the law.</p>

            <p eId="para_498">Tackling poverty remains a fundamental aspiration of all of Irish society. In particular, A Programme for a Partnership Government includes a firm commitment to develop a new integrated framework for social inclusion to tackle the inequality and poverty that, unfortunately, still exist in society. This will be a successor to the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 and its 2015 to 2017 update, which concluded last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_499"> My Department is developing the new four-year plan for the period from 2018 to 2021. Like its predecessor, the plan will have a whole-of-Government approach that aims to improve outcomes for vulnerable and marginalised people while recognising a shared responsibility across Government to implement actions to achieve the overall objectives. The theme of the new plan is one of active inclusion, which will enable every citizen, most notably, I hope, the disadvantaged, to participate fully in society. This includes having a job.</p>
            <p eId="para_500"> The primary focus will be the reduction of consistent poverty, which was 8.3% in 2016, a figure none of us is happy about. This will be achieved through a three-pronged approach: supporting incomes through a level of employment that is as high as possible and encouraging and assisting people to enter the workforce; setting targets for the level of relevant welfare payments designed to reduce relative poverty among those who cannot work or cannot find work; and improving access to quality services such as health, education, childcare, training, housing and community supports to minimise deprivation for all groups, in particular those who are on relatively low incomes. Officials in my Department are working with their colleagues, both internally and in other Departments, to identify specific actions for inclusion in the plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_501"> As a Department, we place a high value on our engagement with those who need to access our services and with the range of organisations that represent those experiencing poverty and social exclusion. Consultation regarding the development of the new plan began last year with the 2017 social inclusion forum where the new plan was the main topic of discussion. This was followed by an online public consultation process in February and March 2018 and further discussions that were very robust at the 2018 social inclusion forum. This allowed my Department to gather responses from individuals who have real-life experience of poverty and social exclusion as well as from NGOs and those working in the community and voluntary sector and academia, which will inform the development of the plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_504">Why has it not been published to date? I welcome the fact that there is an anti-poverty strategy. Even though the economy is in better shape, problems persist and poverty does not seem to be reducing in tandem with economic growth. For example, 10,000 people are homeless, 50,000 lone parents are classified as living in deprivation, 102,000 people are considered to be the working poor, and 780,000 people are on incomes below the internationally accepted poverty line. The strategy is to run from 2018 to 2021. We are more than halfway through 2018 so when will the strategy be published?</p>

            <p eId="para_505">My apologies. I missed the very last line of that whole spiel. The strategy will be published in the autumn. The key element of the national action plan for social inclusion involves the national social targets for poverty reduction, which the Deputy mentioned, which set out the Government's ambition to reduce and, it is hoped, at some point in the very near future, to eliminate poverty. The headline target is to reduce consistent poverty to 2% or less by 2020 with an interim target of 4% by 2016 from the 2010 baseline rate of 6.3%. In addition, there are subtargets relating to children for Ireland's contribution to the European 2020 poverty target. Meeting these targets or at least making significant progress towards meeting them by the 2020 deadline will be a challenge that will require the combined efforts of all Departments boosted by the resources and commitment of civil society. This does remain, however, a key commitment of the plan to address the poverty target and to make sure we put in specific actions, timelines and dates towards those actions to make sure we achieve our overall target.</p>

            <p eId="para_507">Much of the money we use or that we spent towards the last plan was ring-fenced for certain schemes. I do not see any difference with regard to achieving the objectives in this plan. As I said, it is a whole-of-Government approach. The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is not going to wipe out poverty on its own. As much as social transfers have an enormous impact on people's weekly incomes, they certainly do not wipe out poverty. The only way we will be able to wipe out consistent poverty is to provide not only the income supports people need, the activation into work and the continuous support for people in that work until they achieve such levels of income that they do not need support from the State, but also public transport, public health and child care that is supported financially by the State. There are myriad things that will reflect around the lives of people living in consistent poverty to improve them.</p>

            <p eId="para_512">The Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 completed Committee Stage in the Dáil on 17 May and is back for Report Stage next Tuesday and Wednesday. The Bill includes a provision to prohibit zero-hour contracts except in cases of genuine casual work, emergency cover or short-term relief work for the employer. It is worth recalling that the University of Limerick study, commissioned by the former Minister of State, Senator Gerald Nash, found that zero-hour contracts were not prevalent in Ireland. The provisions in this Bill dealing with zero-hour contracts will help to ensure this remains the position.</p>
            <p eId="para_513"> It is important to understand, however, we are not saying in the Bill that all casual or flexible working arrangements are wrong and should be prohibited. On the contrary, flexible working arrangements are an essential requirement for any modern economy. I note the University of Limerick study acknowledged that genuine flexible working arrangements can be mutually beneficial for both employees and employers. To prohibit outright all casual work or all flexible working arrangements would have very serious unintended consequences for many businesses and service providers across the country. Our schools and hospitals, for example, simply could not function. Businesses in the retail, hospitality or care sectors would be unable to operate without the ability to employ certain staff on flexible working arrangements to satisfy peak demands and fill staffing gaps on a short-term basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_514"> The Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is important legislation. It contains a range of measures designed to improve the security and predictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours. We will continue to work with colleagues on all sides of the House, as we have done to date, to progress this Bill as quickly as possible so we can deliver legislation that is fair, balanced and works in the best interests of both employees and employers.</p>

            <p eId="para_515">I thank the Minister. To ban zero-hour contracts except in the case of casual work defeats the purpose as it is precisely the case that these people are abusing the notion of casual work.

            <p eId="para_517">Okay. He said, "Throwing around terms like zero-hour contracts, which we do not and never have had, is deliberately divisive". However, if one speaks to the workers directly, as I did, it is a different story. Mandate has produced a copy of the contract on its website, which states, "Your normal hours of work are flexible as agreed with your manager, spread over up to 5 days between Monday and Sunday and may include late night and weekend work." There are no guaranteed hours and, in any normal language, that is a zero-hour contract. Imagine trying to plan life like that, when a worker only knows a few days in advance how many hours and what hours they are going to do the following week.</p>
            <p eId="para_518"> Zero-hour contracts are just one of many issues in that dispute. It is about low pay, the absence of a real payscale, the absence of a proper sick pay scheme, the absence of annual leave and the attempt to stop workers organising in their union. It is a vital strike.</p>

            <p eId="para_519">All of the issues the Deputy has just outlined will not be legal when we pass the new Bill because of all of the other sections of the Bill, not because of permitting casualised work in certain exceptional circumstances. It is because of the banded hours and the look-back period that will be introduced, as well a whole range of measures within the Bill that will prohibit what the Deputy has just described from happening in any organisation. However, it is important to remember there are benefits to having certain casualised work.</p>
            <p eId="para_520"> To give one example, in a recent high profile case an RTÉ reporter was found to have been discriminated against by being dismissed on the grounds of age while she was on a casual contact when presenting a radio programme. The Workplace Relations Commission found in her favour and she was awarded €50,000. Similarly, cover is necessary in an emergency and, for example, fire brigades have auxiliary firefighters on call for urgent situations. Obviously, not every situation is an emergency, so cover is also needed for routine absences. For example, transport companies would have to employ a relief driver during exceptionally busy periods or to cover the annual leave of other employees. Pharmacies cannot open unless there is a pharmacist present so if a pharmacist rings in sick, they have to be able to provide locums. There are a number of genuine exceptional circumstances that permit what we and the Workplace Relations Commission call casual work. To prohibit that in any way, shape or form would shut down certain industries, which is certainly not what we want to do.</p>

            <p eId="para_521">The company involved in these practices of gross exploitation of its workers is not some small pharmacy. It is part of the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world, McKesson Corporation, which has an annual revenue of €169 billion, more than double the revenue of the Irish State. Workers themselves organising is the way that proper terms and conditions can be won. That is why I salute those workers and Mandate for taking the initiative of organising. That is seen in the response of the company, which has spent €10,000 on setting up a bogus, so-called colleagues representative committee in flagrant contravention of ILO conventions.</p>
            <p eId="para_522"> Another heinous transgression by Lloyds since the dispute began has been the targeting and intimidation of pharmacists with the claim that they do not have the right to strike, which every worker obviously has the right to, because of the company's community pharmacy contract with the HSE. We will get it in black and white from the Department of Health before the week is out to reassure totally the pharmacists at Lloyds, who want to stand with their colleagues on the pickets. I want to state that pharmacists who participate in the ballot and-or subsequently join Mandate have the constitutional right to strike and the threats of disciplinary action by the company are without foundation. I hope the Minister will echo that point to provide clarity for those workers.</p>

            <p eId="para_523">I thank the Deputy. The Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 does not make rules for any one company that the Deputy is here to make representations about today. It is to make sure we have a fair and balanced approach for workers and their employers in every single company in the country. The benefit that casual employees will see when we pass the Bill is that, if they are on an if-and-when contract and they have worked an average number of hours over a 12-month reference period, they will be entitled to be placed on a band of hours that reflects the reality of their working hours. Therefore, it will not be as the Deputy has described in his reflections. Employers will also be obliged, by the fifth day of employment after starting, to give employees a list of detailed information with regard to who they work for, what their contract is and whether it is fixed-term, as well as the expected hours of work - all of this before day five. Employees on if-and-when contracts will also benefit from the new minimum compensation provisions so when they are given notice of work but they do not receive those hours of work, they will have to be paid, and we agreed during Committee Stage this payment will be for three hours. Finally, employees on these contracts will also benefit from the reinforced anti-penalisation provisions so, if an employer penalises them or even threatens to penalise them, or gets one of their friends down the road to penalise them when they are on their way to work, they will be entitled to exercise their rights under the Act, bring a case to the Workplace Relations Commission and have that case adjudicated on and the employer reprimanded in the most effective way possible, which is through its pocket.</p>

            <p eId="para_526">Community employment scheme supervisors are employees of private companies in the community and voluntary sector who receive public funding and are not employees of my Department or public servants. While the motion calls for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to meet with unions with a view to addressing the issue of CE supervisors’ pensions provision, the issue is currently being examined by the community sector high level forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. A number of Departments, including my own, sit on that forum, as do the unions and Pobal.</p>
            <p eId="para_527"> A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the community and voluntary sector. The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents a very significant issue for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of €188 million per year in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State-funded community and voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate <i>ex gratia</i> lump sum payments of pensions as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to €318 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_528"> I am very conscious that while the issue relates to community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors, such individuals comprise just one small group within the wider community and voluntary sector. Any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the potential level of liability.</p>
            <p eId="para_529">Any solution to the issue will require careful consideration given, in particular, the implications for scarce Exchequer resources. As soon as the high level committee meets, we will refer it back to the Dáil for further discussions.</p>

            <p eId="para_538">The fuel allowance is a payment of €22.50 per week, paid for the duration of the fuel season from October to April. Over 364,000 low income households will benefit from this allowance at an estimated cost of €227 million in 2018. The purpose of the payment is to assist these households with their energy costs and it was never intended to meet those costs in full. My Department's schemes, including the fuel allowance scheme, are constantly reviewed to ensure that they are fulfilling their objectives. Recent changes to the scheme which helped increase its effectiveness include extending the duration of the scheme to 27 weeks and the introduction of an option to receive the fuel allowance payment in two lump sums, thereby allowing people to buy fuel in bulk and potentially avail of special offers or discounts. My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance at an estimated cost of €237 million in 2018. Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. Exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his or her own resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_539"> In 2016, the Government launched a comprehensive strategy to combat energy poverty following extensive public consultation. This strategy, which is being spearheaded by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, sets out the Government's commitment to protecting vulnerable households from energy poverty through a combination of supports, investment in schemes to improve energy efficiency and energy efficiency awareness initiatives. One of the best ways to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling through proper building and household insulation. The warmer homes scheme administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is designed to do that. Earlier this year, this scheme was expanded to include recipients of domiciliary care allowance and a further expansion to include carers is under consideration. The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is reviewing the scheme and my officials will participate in that review.</p>

            <p eId="para_540">Fuel poverty is a reality. That is not based merely on the anecdotal evidence of old-age pensioners trying to keep warm in public buildings across the State in the winter months; it is based on the evidence and on facts. The latest SILC report demonstrates that 29% of people living in consistent poverty are unable to keep their homes adequately warm. In January, I asked the Minister, on the basis of numerous debates and submissions to her, about the need to carry out a review of the fuel allowance payment within the Department. The payment is a key measure in addressing fuel poverty. The Minister replied to me that there was an issue with the incidence of fuel poverty. She further stated that while she was requested during the passage of the Social Welfare Bill to conduct an inquiry as to the changes the Government might make regarding social transfers, she could not agree to do so as it was not within the remit of her Department. However, she said she had found a back door to do what was sought to be achieved and would conduct the review over the coming weeks with a view to examining the rates of payment and the periods of time during which they are made. The Minister said that it had to be acknowledged that the price of fuel had increased. Where is the review and can we see what was contained in it? What recommendations, more importantly, came out of it?</p>

            <p eId="para_541">I agree with the Deputy that the vast majority of households experiencing fuel poverty do so because they are unable to keep their houses warm. As such, income supports are only part of the answer. In many cases, in fact, they are not even a big part of the answer. The best way to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of houses through proper building and retrospective fitting of insulation. Initiatives like the warmer homes scheme operated by the SEAI under the aegis of the Department of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, have a very valuable role to play in that context, as does funding from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to improve the quality of existing local authority houses. I told the Deputy during conversations at the social welfare committee at the beginning of the year that I would inform myself on any changes I might make with regard to budget negotiations this year and am in the process of doing that. Part of that information was the report I was waiting on from Maynooth. There was no point creating the wheel when it was already there and the college was already reviewing fuel poverty. We are waiting for the final outlay from that. The report will feed into other information we have in the Department and prove valuable in our budgetary discussions and deliberations later in the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_544">That is not what the Minister said in her contribution in January. She said she had found a back door to assess this. The evidence is all there and we know fuel costs have increased. In its pre-budget submission, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul told us that 48% of people went without heating in 2017 due to the cost. The society spends in the region of €4.3 million trying to help people in consistent poverty to keep their homes warm. While it is administered across a number of Departments, the fuel allowance is a key measure to alleviate fuel poverty. It could be done in a number of ways. Following cuts made over a number of years, the payment period for fuel allowance is down to 27 weeks. A key and quick measure would be reintroducing a 32 week period. A cold weather measure could also be introduced. Is that something which could be looked at, not on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis annually, but on a statutory basis?</p>

            <p eId="para_545">The fuel allowance this year will amount to €227 million while €237 million has been provided for electricity and gas payments. Further millions have been provided under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and the exceptional needs payment scheme. The problem here is that heat is going straight up the chimney. The real way to future-proof people living in consistent fuel poverty is to ensure the heat stays in their houses. The only way to do that is to upgrade our local authority housing stock retrospectively, which can be done through the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and to ensure there are SEAI grants for everyone else with an older house which requires proper insulation using the great stuff that will keep us warm. If the money is increased, that is great, but when people pay for coal or gas, the heat must stay in their houses.</p>

            <p eId="para_546">For 18 years, early bird breakfast clubs have been a huge success in Ballymun. Last year alone, 58,840 breakfasts were served at five DEIS schools in the Ballymun area. Some of the funding for the scheme was provided through the Ballymun local drugs and alcohol task force as well as from other funding sources in different Departments. The BEST project was tasked with managing the scheme and 18 staff, most of whom are working on a part-time basis, administer and operate it.</p>
            <p eId="para_547">Children who are served a wholesome breakfast in the morning are better equipped to face a day of learning and concentration in these schools. Some of the children come from highly deprived backgrounds and they need all the supports and help they can get. The loss of the breakfast clubs is a considerable blow, not only to the children but also to their families who rely on these supports and help.</p>
            <p eId="para_548"> The staff employed by the service receive special training and attend courses in all aspects of child protection. They are trained to the highest standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_549"> The social interaction between children, who meet friends, teachers and staff, has helped to shape their future. The benefits of sitting down together and having a proper meal in a proper environment should not be underestimated. There is a real fear that standards, which have been improving, will fall and children may lose out, especially those from minority backgrounds.</p>
            <p eId="para_550"> The BEST project has sought to secure funding but has run into a brick wall. The excuse given is that employing staff is not necessary and schools can handle the service by providing a snack and a lunch. I have spoken to some of the schools and they will struggle hard to do this. It will place significant strain on the schools in question, some of which do not have the necessary resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_551"> The withdrawal of funding by the task force is regrettable, especially as no other funding stream has been identified. Is funding available from any other source, for example, the Department of Education and Skills, Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection or Tusla? Could funding be found elsewhere to continue employing these staff and help alleviate the problem? The threat is immediate as notices have been served on staff. We will lose the project in Ballymun shortly, which would be a disaster. It has worked well for 18 years in spite of considerable problems in the area where many children are at risk.</p>

            <from>Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection (Deputy Regina Doherty)<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_552">I thank the Deputy for raising this Topical Issue. I also acknowledge that Deputy Noel Rock has been in discussions with me on this issue for more than a month.</p>
            <p eId="para_553"> To give the Deputy some background, my Department is providing funding for school meals in more than 1,580 schools and other organisations. The programme, which supports more than 248,000 children, will cost approximately €54 million in 2018, which is an increase of €6.5 million over the previous year. It is important to make that point because it makes a valuable contribution and its effect on the lives of the children who avail of the programme is, as Deputy Ellis described, tangible. It is not something fuzzy or woolly. The objective of the scheme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, perhaps due to the lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education being provided to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_554"> In recent years, priority for new applications for funding has been given to schools that are part of the Department of Education and Skills initiative for disadvantaged schools, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, in line with the national policy framework for children and young people, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures. The schools in Ballymun, which are affected by the proposed closure of the breakfast club, all have DEIS status and receive funding from my Department under the school meals programme. That will not change. The breakfast clubs in Ballymun, which Deputy Ellis described as "early bird clubs", are operated by the Ballymun educational support team school completion programme, BEST SCP, and have been part of the Ballymun local drugs and alcohol task force funding provision through Department of Health funding for the past 18 years. The channel of funding is the City of Dublin Youth Service Board and City of Dublin Education and Training Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_555"> According to the Ballymun local drugs and alcohol task force, the allocation for the 2017 school calendar year was €122,716, and €87,716 to the end of June 2018. The funding provided is used for food, staffing to prepare the food and supervise the breakfast clubs in seven schools during school term, insurance, training, etc., and has been administered centrally by BEST SCP. The rationale for the Ballymun local drugs and alcohol task force funding these clubs was to support school retention and participation, especially for those families struggling to provide basic supports for their children in the mornings. In an effort to maximise its funding and to focus more sharply on individuals, children and families with the most acute needs or at most acute risk due to drugs and alcohol issues, the task force in its allocation for 2018 only approved funding until the end of June and wrote to BEST SCP and local school principals to advise of this.</p>
            <p eId="para_556"> The task force also allocated additional resources to engage an independent contractor to work with each school to provide support to make the necessary applications and arrangements to ensure breakfasts continued in their schools through the school meals programme, and that they were embedded directly in each school going forward. The contractor has met the Ballymun principals' network and has been in touch with each school to assist in assessing how the breakfast clubs could be provided by the respective schools in future.</p>
            <p eId="para_557"> The school meals programme has a particular focus on the provision of breakfast clubs because they provide positive outcomes for vulnerable children in terms of their energy levels, punctuality and school attendance. The scheme provides funding for either a breakfast or a snack for all children and lunch for up to 90% of children in DEIS schools for the entire school year from September to June. At present, all of the schools affected are funded for all children for a snack club and a lunch club. If individual schools wish to receive funding for a breakfast club, they will lose their funding for snack clubs and obviously children would get breakfast instead of a snack.</p>
            <p eId="para_558"> My Department provides funding for food costs to a number of school completion programmes, SCPs, throughout the country. The SCP co-ordinator, who is generally based in one of the larger schools in an area, submits an application on behalf of the schools under its remit. The co-ordinator distributes the funding to the constituent schools and the schools operate the clubs. Occasionally, the SCP will operate the club in one school drawing in the pupils from the other schools under its remit.</p>
            <p eId="para_559"> My Department has not received any application from BEST SCP to participate in the school meals programme to date. If an application is received, it will be considered favourably. A new round of school meal programmes is to be announced next week, for which BEST SCP can certainly apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_560"> A meeting scheduled for today did not take place. I can only encourage Deputy Ellis, if he has any influence, to ensure this meeting takes place and an application is made.</p>

            <p eId="para_561">I acknowledge that the Ballymun drugs task force has made it clear it will not continue to provide the funding of €122,000. I spoke to many of the principals of the affected schools and most acknowledge they can handle a certain reduction in funding. </p>
            <p eId="para_562"> It is clear this scheme has worked well over the years. I note the Department provides a snack and a lunch, which is reasonable. The parents to whom I have spoken have said these breakfast clubs have been remarkable in how they shaped and engaged with the children in the area. Their benefits have been considerable.</p>
            <p eId="para_563"> The figure involved is not nearly €122,000 because it is an acknowledgement that it will be possible to obtain the food required for the clubs in the five DEIS schools in the area. The issue is the staff who are employed in the schools for this purpose. One of the principals made clear to me that it will be extremely difficult to manage without these staff. That must be taken into account. If the benefits of the programme are as great as what I have heard and seen over the years, it would be crazy to allow the clubs to close for the sake of the small amount of money needed to retain the necessary staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_564"> Once again, I plead with the Minister. I will try to speak to BEST and others about engaging, although the organisation has indicated it has engaged. I acknowledge that Deputy Rock spoke to BEST and the Minister. BEST was informed, however, that there is no other Department to which it can turn for funding for staff. This has impacted heavily on its approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_565">It is a shame and I urge the Minister to see if she can look at it again, engage and see if the funding can be provided.</p>

            <p eId="para_566">It is obvious how emotionally engaged Deputy Dessie Ellis is on this matter. I do not mean to be patronising, but it is really lovely to see. I am not refusing anybody's help. The first thing my Department does is give money for food, which we gladly give. We already know and appreciate the impact it has and that will not change. The second thing we do is provide money through community employment schemes. We have not reduced it either. If anybody wants to approach us on new initiatives or move places, that is certainly something at which we can look.</p>
            <p eId="para_567"> The crux of the matter is that for some reason Dublin City Council and the education and training board have decided to stop funding what they have been funding for 18 years, with no explanation and for no obvious reason. I am not shirking my responsibilities and will gladly go with the Deputy and organise a meeting. That is not a problem, but the question has to be asked as to why the task force saw fit to stop doing something in which they saw value for 18 years? The only thing I can do in the short term is to genuinely encourage those involved through the school completion programme to apply for the exceptional needs money where there are cases where SCP co-ordinators help in schools. If I can assist in that way, I will gladly do so, but the real elephant in the room is why an organisation that is funded by the State through the Department of Health saw value in doing something for 18 years and now no longer sees the value in it. It needs to be made responsible to at least answer to us why it has stopped providing the service, what it expects the people who were going to be employed to do. It needs to answer serious questions about why it saw fit to stop funding the service, what it will use the funding for in the future if it will not use it for the seven schools in Ballymun, but, within in my personal remit, they will continue to be supplied with food. That is a given. If Deputies Dessie Ellis and Noel Rock could work together to make sure the meeting that was scheduled to happen today will happen in the next couple of days and an application is made to the SCP, we will look at it on its merits, but it has to be reflective of the practice, goodwill and positive outcomes achieved in the seven schools in Ballymun. The Deputies know that I grew up there and attended one of the schools years ago.</p>

            <p eId="para_568">I am disappointed that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, is not taking this matter because I understand from the rules of the House that if a Minister is not available to Deputies on a particular day, a matter such as this can be deferred. I was not informed that the Minister would be unavailable.</p>
            <p eId="para_569"> The problems associated with Scoil Náisiúnta Bhrighde in Faughart, County Louth have been ongoing for quite some time. My office has been dealing with representations from many of the families with children who have been impacted on by the saga that has been ongoing in the school since May 2017. Neither the Minister, the Archbishop of Armagh, Eamon Martin, nor the patron of the school up until the time it closed its doors in mid-September 2017 could find a solution to what had been an ongoing problem within the school related to leadership and management and the consequent fallout of a drop in enrolments due to falling standards at the school. Dozens of families in the community were left with no option but to withdraw their children from the school, because of the failure or inability of the Department to deal with the issues at the time. The school has remained closed ever since. It operated with three teachers, a secretary and a caretaker. Before it closed there were 23 boys and 32 girls attending, down from a high of over 100 pupils in its heyday.</p>
            <p eId="para_570"> The church closed the school to find a solution to the problems, but at the time it was said clearly both to me and others that it would allow it to be divested to another patron once the problems regarding the poor management of the school were solved. Archbishop Martin has been contacted by me without response, but he did respond to others, including representatives of the parents' group. In a recent reply he stated he had no objection in principle to the possibility of the Department, following due process, making a decision on the opening of a new school under different patronage on the former Scoil Bhrighde site. However, in his letter he stated he had asked the Department for documentation on the process but that he had not received the documentation he had requested. He also said that he was not aware that there had been a demand for a change of patronage or diversity in patronage provision while the school was open. He also believed it was reasonable for any decision on a change of patronage to be made following a plebiscite or other form of wider consultation within the local community.</p>
            <p eId="para_571"> The archbishop cannot but be aware of the requests for a change of patronage since the school closed. He has also stated that, as a trustee of the trust which owns the property and as Archbishop of Armagh, he has a responsibility to the parish of Faughart to ensure the religious education of the children of the parish, including their sacramental preparation, is safeguarded. I have received confirmation from the Louth Meath Education and Training Board that preparation for the sacraments would be carried out in conjunction with the local parish. Archbishop Martin has asked for clarification from the Department on whether such a change of patronage would essentially involve the opening of a new school rather than a transfer of patronage to an existing school. He has said he expects the same criteria of assessment to apply as normally apply in the case of a proposed new school. I completely understand the concerns of the archbishop in that regard and also in regard to religious education, but surely a mechanism can be found to satisfy his concerns to enable the school to reopen to the satisfaction of the parents and community as speedily as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_572">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, to set out for the DáiI the position on voluntary reassignment of patronage under section 8 of the Education Act 1998. As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister has announced new plans aimed at accelerating the provision of multi-denominational and non-denominational schools across the country in line with the choices of parents, families and school communities and the commitment in the programme for Government to reach a figure of 400 such schools by 2030. The previous model of patronage divestment yielded only a very limited number of schools for transfer to multi-denominational patrons. The number was ten since 2013. The new schools reconfiguration for diversity process has the potential to significantly increase patron diversity in the school system. </p>
            <p eId="para_573"> The early movers provision of the schools reconfiguration for diversity process involves voluntary reassignments of patronage under section 8 of the Education Act 1998. This fast-track process is part of the plan to accelerate the delivery of multi-denominational and non-denominational schools. The new process, which supports transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families, is based on the principles of transparency and co-operation. It involves consultation with the school community, the local community and the current patron and reflects their wishes in a request to transfer patronage under section 8 of the Education Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_574"> In the case of the school to which the Deputy refers, the Department will consider any request that may be made by the existing patron for a transfer of patronage to a multi-denominational patron under the early movers provision. The first reconfiguration under the early movers provision of the new process has taken place successfully, with Two Mile community national school opening in September 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_575">In cases such as Faughart, individual early movers are being facilitated with immediate transfers to multidenominational or non-denominational patrons where the community and the current patron have opted voluntarily to do so. If there is agreement on the transfer of patronage, the procedure is that the archdiocese will write to the Department with a request under section 8(3) of the Education Act 1998 for the Minister to amend the patron register in respect of the school on the application of the existing patron, as the person who stands for the time being registered as the patron of the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_576"> I understand there has been some interaction locally with multidenominational patrons, including a meeting between representatives of the former Scoil Náisúnta Bhrighde parents' association and Louth and Meath Education and Training Board, LMETB, in this regard. The Department has been contacted by some of these parties but indicated that this was a matter for the patron rather than the Department at this point. The Department has also responded to correspondence from the existing patron seeking clarification on the early movers provision of the schools reconfiguration for diversity process. The Department has indicated it would view any request to transfer patronage in this case positively. </p>

            <from>Deputy Declan Breathnach<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_577">I understand the transfer of patronage can be fast-tracked in this case. The Louth and Meath Education and Training Board is capable and perhaps one of the best in the country at education and school management. It has said the school could be opened for September 2018. In a previous life I was the principal teacher in a rural school. The Minister of State knows that the rural school is the hub of most communities and it is sad and disappointing, notwithstanding the valiant effort of the parents and families and the community of Faughart, that the school remains closed. My concern is that there is obfuscation and fudge. The patron has written to the Department with questions he wants answered. The Minister of State mentioned an early movers provision but if that is not made within a certain period, people will find other places, as they would in any rural community, and they have done so in Faughart. The patron has written letters setting out what the effects would be on the other schools. It would only reverse the difficulty the school had before it closed.</p>
            <p eId="para_578"> The Minister has sent out a first round of surveys under the consultation plan for the divestment of schools and he is also seeking to outlaw the baptism barrier for entry to Catholic schools. However, as matters stand, the Catholic bishops have the final say on which schools they transfer and what type of school will emerge. It is my clear understanding, having taken advice, that the Education Act 1998 makes provision for the existing patron to transfer patronage to another patron. I have been advised that Archbishop Martin has withdrawn as patron of Faughart. That is an important point.</p>
            <p eId="para_579"> It is the parents' wish to reopen the school in September under the patronage of the Louth and Meath Education and Training Board. The LMETB has confirmed to me that it is willing to open the school this September under its patronage and 30 families have already filled in an expression of interest form to send their children, both returning and new, to Faughart school under that patronage. I implore the Minister to meet Archbishop Martin to obtain from him the letter of request needed to enable the transfer of patronage to take place. Any further delay will weaken the spirit of community in the area. As a former teacher, the Minister of State knows the importance of rural schools as hubs in the community. Allowing this to go beyond September would run the risk of the school never reopening and we would have another Drimoleague. </p>

            <p eId="para_580">The Department has been contacted by some of the parties but has indicated this is a matter for the patron. I take the Deputy's point that he is asking the Minister to meet Archbishop Martin and obtain from him the request necessary for a transfer of patronage to take place. The Department has indicated it would review positively any request to transfer patronage in this case.</p>

            <p eId="para_581">The knock-on effect of the collapse of the Sammon Group on small subcontractors who are owed significant amounts of money is very worrying. This case also highlights a more widespread problem in the operation of public contracts, in this case the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, which contracted for the work on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills. We must question the manner in which public contracts are designed in respect of the apparent lack of protections for subcontractors who are retained by the main contractor to carry out works on public projects, particularly when the NDFA, with Enterprise Ireland, participated in a meet the buyer event to provide information on supply chain opportunities for small and medium sized, SME, companies, in effect encouraging them to avail of these opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_582"> The liquidation of the Sammon Group is very regrettable, particularly for the 200 staff and their families. However, given the number and size of the projects undertaken by Sammon in recent years, the fact that it employed only 200 people directly demonstrates its dependence on subcontractors to undertake most of the construction work on its projects. In my constituency, Sammon recently completed the construction of a brand new school at Tullamore College at a cost to the Government of more than €12 million. I am extremely concerned to learn that a number of subcontractors who worked on the school have been left out of pocket owing to non-payment by the main contractor. In one case, more than €40,000 is owed to a small contractor who spent many months working on the site. This contractor tells me he cannot sustain this level of debt and he will have no option but to cease trading. I have received a large number of representations from local contractors who have been left badly out of pocket by this particular contract and other contracts. History appears to be repeating itself. In 2010, Pierse Construction collapsed leaving subcontractors without payment. They had no option but to protest at the official opening of schools in counties Offaly and Laois, notably in Ferbane and Banagher where I was in attendance. </p>
            <p eId="para_583"> The Government has a duty to ensure that when large sums of taxpayers' money are being paid to the main contractor on public contracts, this money makes its way to the subcontractors who are carrying out most of the work. Most of these small businesses have secured specific lines of credit for the purchase of materials on the strength of their retention on public contracts. These small businesses are then unable to pay their staff and suppliers and the negative consequences continue. The Government is committed to investing in large infrastructural projects under Project Ireland 2040 and we must ensure this results in a positive economic stimulus for the local economy and that subcontractors are not afraid to avail of these opportunities on the basis that they may not be paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_584"> The construction industry was hit very badly by the economic crash. Now that it is recovering and the volume of work is expected to increase significantly in the coming years, it is vital that the State put in place better protections for subcontractors who are the backbone of our local communities. We have to look at the main contractors' track records on previous contracts before they are awarded further public work. If the main contractor has a poor track record of looking after its subcontractors, we must not continue to reward it with lucrative public contracts. Lessons must be learned from the past. From my discussions with contractors, some have suggested that the problem with the business model is that the contract is awarded to the lowest tender and subcontractors are left to bear the risk of non-payment by using their overdraft facilities to fund the work. </p>
            <p eId="para_585"> In additional, subcontractors have asked who will provide the warranty for the work already carried out if only part of the job is completed by whichever company has been awarded the contract to finish the jobs to ensure the affected schools are open in time for September.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Patrick O'Donovan)<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_586">I thank Deputy Corcoran Kennedy for raising this issue. Unfortunately, the issue has been raised on more than one occasion recently. It is not a new development and reflects poor payment practices in the construction industry generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_587"> Former Senator Feargal Quinn's Construction Contracts Act was developed in consultation with industry to address these poor payment practices. The Bill was introduced to Seanad Éireann in 2010 and received cross-party support in both Houses. It was enacted in 2013. The Act applies to all construction contracts entered into after 25 July 2016. Responsibility for the administration of the Act lies with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, whose Department has responsibility for prompt payment legislation. I understand this issue has arisen as a result of the transfer of responsibility within Departments and the movement of responsibilities from one Department to another.</p>
            <p eId="para_588"> That small and medium-sized enterprises were not in receipt of payments due on a construction project was unacceptable at the time of enactment and the same applies today. It must be acknowledged that the contractor in question had been awarded a number of public works contracts prior to its collapse.</p>
            <p eId="para_589"> This issue is not unique to public works by any means. It is more galling, however, when it arises under a public works contract since the State pays the contractor what the contractor is due when payment is due. The conditions of most construction contracts between construction clients and building contractors in the public and private sectors require that payments are made at defined intervals and that payment is contingent on work being completed to a predetermined standard. There is usually no contractual obligation on the main contractor to make payments to subcontractors because this is left to individual commercial arrangements that are contained in contracts. That is a fundamental point. The State and the awarding body, whether an education and training board or a board of management, do not have a contract with the subcontractor. It is the contractor that has responsibility to the subcontractor. I realise it is a moot point but it is ultimately one of the most important points.</p>
            <p eId="para_590"> The issues identified by Senator Quinn during the development of the construction contracts legislation highlighted an absence of formal contracts that set out the necessary commercial terms. In many cases this was exacerbated by sharp payment practices by some, even where a formal contract did exist. This was adverted to by Deputy Corcoran Kennedy.</p>
            <p eId="para_591"> The Construction Contracts Act imposes minimum terms on all construction contracts, whether written or oral, and provides the tools necessary to enforce payment. The tools include a maximum payment interval of 30 days and a requirement to honour payment requests within 30 days for subcontractors, a right of suspension for non-payment, and a right to refer a payment dispute to adjudication. The legislation also outlaws the practice of pay-when-paid provisions that were prevalent in most forms of subcontract.</p>
            <p eId="para_592"> While most of the interest from industry surrounding the Act was centred on the introduction of adjudication, it is the discipline that the legislation imposes on payments that would appear to be have been largely ignored. Arguably, the associated provisions are the most important but they require the subcontractor to enforce his entitlements proactively with the contractor in the manner prescribed in the legislation for payments that are due.</p>
            <p eId="para_593"> The Act does not cut across the normal rules for company liquidation or receivership, and so where this arises, there is no avenue for recovery. The magnitude of the exposure that many subcontractors face upon the insolvency of a contractor would not arise, however, if the provision for payments was insisted upon and the remedies available were exercised where payment is not forthcoming. The non-payment issues associated with the collapse of Sammon would suggest that subcontractors are not exercising the rights provided for in the Act. I know what Deputy Corcoran Kennedy has said. As was said by other Deputies last week, that is not always easy. This inaction is surprising given the welcome it received by all contracting tiers in the construction industry and the support it received from many Members of this House and the other House. I can appreciate a certain reticence to engage in the manner prescribed in the Act. Indeed, I know well why it is not happening. It is for fear of risking business. Subcontractors have to question whether it is worthwhile doing business with someone who is not complying with the law.</p>
            <p eId="para_594"> The matter was raised with me by two Fianna Fáil Deputies last week. I undertook to look at their specific issues. This discussion is part of a dialogue among people in the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_595">Inspired Spaces was the joint venture between Carillion and a Dutch infrastructure fund. The joint venture won the contract to build and manage the schools. A Carillion subsidiary was engaged to build, which in turn subcontracted to Sammon. This means a number of steps are in place before we get to the level of subcontracting to the local small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_596"> I wonder about due diligence. When the financial close on schools public private partnership, PPP, bundle 5 was signed off, the project and financing agreements were signed and all the conditions contained had been satisfied by all parties. That occurred on 22 July 2016. On 10 July 2017, less than one year later, Carillion issued a trading update warning that it had £1.15 billion in losses by June 2017. If this was revealed, how is it that there was no indication of it in July 2016 when the contract had been awarded? Surely some kind of red flag should have been raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_597"> I have received some information from the Department on the matter. Is it wise that the public private partnership companies in receipt of the tenders are not due payment for the construction of the schools until they are handed over? It is no wonder that all these subcontractors are expected to fund operations at local level. It is their overdrafts that are being called on to provide the materials and labour. It is grand for a contractor to get a contract if the company does not need to have overdraft facilities in place and can use those of a subcontractor. The real problem seems to be the fact that no funding is handed over until the school is completed. Where is the funding to come from if the main company, in this case, Inspired Spaces, does not have the funds in place to deliver on the project in the first place? That is a significant issue and warrants further examination.</p>

            <p eId="para_598">I am not going to dispute any of the comments that Deputy Corcoran Kennedy has made. This matter has been raised not only by Deputies on this side of the House but by Deputies on the other side of the House as well. I note the attendance of the former Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin. He was the Minister responsible for navigating the Construction Contracts Bill through the Dáil and Seanad.</p>
            <p eId="para_599"> Unfortunately, there is a limited culture in the construction industry that is not really acceptable. A remedy was introduced that was welcomed by all. It was understood that it would help to alleviate some of the problems. I experienced these problems in my constituency. A national school was held up for months, if not years, by such carry-on. To be honest, it is a cultural issue that needs addressing on several fronts.</p>
            <p eId="para_600"> I referenced that the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has ultimate responsibility for the implementation of the Act as it stands. I am not passing the buck because this matter has been drawn to the attention of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on several occasions recently. There is a discussion group in the Department in the area of construction. We have to be mindful of the fact that existing laws and legislation cover contract law and they have to be examined as well. The contract does not exist between the awarding authority, whether the Department of Education and Skills, the education and training board or the board of management, and the subcontractor. The subcontractors contract with the contractor. Unfortunately, the Department, Government, education and training board or board of management do not and cannot manage that relationship.</p>
            <p eId="para_601"> This is not an issue we are trying to run away from. In fact, the previous Fine Gael and Labour Party coalition Government introduced the legislation as a remedy. Remedies are available. I understand the reason that people may be reluctant to exercise them. Deputy Corcoran Kennedy has raised a specific case with me and I will ask the unit within the Department that deals specifically with this matter to look at it.</p>
            <p eId="para_602"> Unfortunately, I do not have anything positive to say in respect of the matters tied up and to which Deputy Corcoran Kennedy has referred. Certainly, that applies to matters that have been dealt with. Deputy Corcoran Kennedy made a point, however, that we need to try to protect people in future, and I concur with that. What that remedy is and what Department will address it is something we will have to work out, if we can work it out.</p>

            <p eId="para_603">I compliment the producers of last night's "RTÉ Investigates" programme, which really demonstrated the environmental damage that can be done when regulation is breached. Not only is it financially costly, it causes significant damage to our environment and to human health. The RTÉ programme focused on waste and non-compliance with a fragmented system of regulation, how those who flagrantly abuse any system of regulation are dealt with, the time it takes to deal with those who cause such damage and who ultimately picks up the bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_604"> The RTÉ programme looked at waste, but unauthorised development is another area that requires significant attention. A planning system is only as good as the enforcement. While local authorities have responsibility for planing enforcement, on occasions it also requires the involvement of the courts. I want to highlight in particular the issue of quarrying and I will focus on one particular example that is not in my constituency but it is in south Kildare, in Ballysax near the Curragh. The history of this quarry goes back to 1983 when it operated without permission. I shall refer, however, to 2012 when An Bord Pleanála wrote to the owners informing them that the quarry was unauthorised and did not have the benefit of planning permission because it did not avail of a section 261 regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_605"> In August 2014 a new owner took over the quarry and it was clear from the outset that the intention was to scale up the quarrying operation. This drew many complaints to Kildare County Council and an enforcement notice was eventually issued in 2015 stating that they should close the quarry immediately with all equipment to be removed by mid June. That enforcement notice was ignored. Understandably there continued to be complaints from locals which culminated in locals protesting outside at the quarry on a regular basis. Gardaí were called on numerous occasions and, ironically, this resulted in some locals being arrested for breach of the peace. Kildare County Council gave an undertaking to some local Deputies they would take High Court action under section 160 of the regulations. A High Court appearance followed in late 2015 and a temporary closure was to follow, but that agreement was largely ignored.</p>
            <p eId="para_606"> Today in 2018 the quarry is still operating. Not only is the quarry operating to full capacity and breaking every planning law, it has in fact been extended to a massive 20 ha. In 2016 the council took the quarry owner to the Circuit Court. There were seven adjournments in the Circuit Court before a full hearing took place in June 2017, with the reserved judgment to follow. In November 2017 the judge gave his decision stating the quarry was an illegal development without planning permission since 1983. The judge ordered the quarry to be closed and the Kildare County Council legal team agreed a stay of five months, until February 2018. The quarry owner was granted additional time to lodge an appeal for a stay on the judge's decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_607"> Prior to the most recent High Court hearing I contacted the council, which was due to deal with the stay. I was told the expectation was that there would be a full hearing. I understand that the stay had elapsed, and while the judge appeared to favour the immediate closure, the quarry owner sought a recess to apply to another court for a stay. Kildare County Council's legal team did not object to this. The quarry owner came back to the court with a new stay and the judge suggested an October closure. The council agreed to a 2019 closure, as long as the council got its fees paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_608"> A small community settlement is in close proximity, details of which I can give to the Minister of State later. I emphasise the length of time it has taken to deal with this. Do we actually have planning enforcement at all?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (Deputy Damien English)<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_609">I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for raising this important issue on unauthorised developments and how they are not being complied with. I do not have the details of this specific case and I was not familiar with the story, but I am now aware of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_610"> At the outset, I will outline the Minister's role in relation to the planning system. It is mainly to provide and update the legislative and policy guidance framework. The legislative framework comprises the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and the associated Planning and Development Regulations. Furthermore, my Department has issued a large number of planning guidelines under section 28 of the Planning Act to guide planning authorities in the implementation of the wider planning policy framework. Planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála are obliged to have regard to those guidelines in the exercise of their planning functions. The day-to-day operation of the planning system, however, is a matter for the individual planning authorities and under section 30 of the Act the Minister is specifically prohibited from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case, including an enforcement issue, with which a planning authority or the board is, or may be, concerned with.</p>
            <p eId="para_611"> Under planning legislation, any development that requires permission and does not have that permission is an unauthorised development. This is also the case with a development that is proceeding in breach of conditions laid down in the planning permission, or any exempted development that is carried out that does not comply with the limitations of that exemption. The planning code also provides that enforcement of planning control is a matter for the individual planning authorities, which can take action if a development does not have the required permission or where the terms of a permission have not been met. In this regard, planning authorities have substantial enforcement powers under the Act. First, a planning authority may issue an enforcement notice in connection with an unauthorised development, requiring such steps as the authority considers necessary to be taken within a specified period. If an enforcement notice is not complied with, the planning authority is further empowered to enter on the land and take such steps including the removal, demolition or alteration of any structure as is deemed necessary, as well as to recover any costs incurred in undertaking such actions. Second, a planning authority may also seek a court order under section 160 of the Act, requiring any particular action to be done or not to be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_612"> Taking account of the above points, responsibility for enforcement action on any breach of the planning code is a matter for individual planning authorities under the powers available to them under the Planning Act. Accordingly, individual cases of unauthorised developments or non-compliance with planning permissions should be brought to the attention of the relevant planning authority, which can then take the necessary and timely action as provided for in planning legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_613"> I am aware that Deputy Murphy has raised a specific case but it is not something I can get into because it is down to the local planning authority. We constantly review the powers available to the local planning authority through the planning code and the Planning Act, and we issue guidance on that also. A planning Bill is coming through the House currently and a second one is coming in the autumn. If any issues are raised from these cases or other cases we can look at it to see if we can strengthen the law. The enforcement of the law is at a local level and that is being strengthened there as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_614"> In some cases it can be an issue of resources. The Department makes it very clear that we try to work with local authorities to ensure resources are put back into local authorities, and in the context of making up for the last couple of years. The authorities should be in the position to deal with these cases. From a planning perspective the planning code is there and if we need to enhance it further we can look at it through the future planning Bills. I thank the Deputy for raising the general issue in the Chamber.</p>

            <p eId="para_615">This quarry is not a small development: it is 20 ha. A small local community of 11 families lives near to it. Four of the family members in those 11 houses now have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and others are using inhalers. There is a significant problem with dust and on their doctors' advice the families stay inside when the wind blows predominantly towards their homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_616"> Some 150 trucks per day - 40 ft articulated trucks - travel to and from the quarry on small rural roads. They start at 5.30 a.m. and there is a serious problem with sleep disturbance for the families. The road conditions are also dangerous. Because there is no planning permission for the development there is no bond and no possibility of money for the remediation. One could, at this point, predict that the public purse will end up picking up the cost of this. Last night's RTÉ programme showed us the kinds of damage that can be done in the waste sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_617"> If this development had planning permission there would be a regime around it. There are laws in theory but in practice it is going in and out of the courts. People who comply with the law are at a disadvantage against those who break the law because they stretch it out the whole time. This case offers a breathtaking level of non-compliance. Every court, An Bord Pleanála and the local authority are being ignored. While I use this case as a specific example there is a serious problem with planning enforcement. There is great variation in levels of enforcement, depending on where one is in the State. If this site had planning permission there would be a bond and a time allowed for operation. A time would be set outside of which it could not operate. Currently we cannot even insist on the enforcement of planning conditions because there is no planning permission with conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_618"> I ask that the Minister of State look at the theory to see if it is working in practice. I was a councillor since 1991 so I have dealt with the planning system for a long time. I have never once seen the local authority going in to take action or physically remove things using the section referred to by the Minister of State. I do not believe it happens anywhere. The provision is there in theory but it has to be there in practice. The local authority should be there for the public good and I do not believe that what is happening here between the courts and the local authority in this regard is in the public interest.</p>

            <p eId="para_619">The role of the Minister and me in the planning system is to provide and update the legislation and policy guidance framework. The Minister cannot get involved in, or exercise any power in respect of, any particular case, including an enforcement issue with which a planning authority is or may be concerned. Responsibility for enforcement action in respect of any breach of the planning code is a matter for individual planning authorities. Part VIII of the Planning and Development Act 2000 sets out the comprehensive enforcement powers that are available to planning authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_620"> Alongside general issues, the Deputy has raised issues with this specific case, as have Deputy Heydon and others. I have committed to considering whether these powers need to be strengthened in forthcoming planning legislation. They are already strong, though, and I expect local authorities to be in control and, where necessary, to enforce. We feel strongly in that regard. We review local authorities' powers constantly and will do so again under various Acts to determine whether strengthening them is necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_621"> I agree with Deputy Catherine Murphy that there can be delays in planning authorities taking enforcement actions against unauthorised developments. Situations can arise where, for instance, damage is caused to roads by construction activity and, if not acted upon, can become a source of annoyance and inconvenience for local residents and result in a cost to the taxpayer. We need to strengthen our position on enforcement. Local authorities have been strengthened in financial and staffing terms. If we need to strengthen the legislation, we can consider doing so, but existing powers provide authorities with a good opportunity to enforce regulations in the way they should be.</p>
            <p eId="para_622"> Regarding annoyance, inconvenience and taxpayers' money, the earlier that individual cases of unauthorised developments or non-compliance with planning permissions are brought to the attention of planning authorities, the earlier the relevant enforcement powers provided for in the legislation can be activated by those authorities. In the event that it is considered that there is undue delay or failure on the part of a planning authority to address an enforcement issue, a complaint can be made to the Ombudsman. I am unsure as to whether that has happened in this case as I do not know the specifics, but it is an option. We will also consider powers in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_623"> When an issue is causing people distress and inconvenience, the local authority should use its position and powers.</p>

          <p eId="para_647">I am grateful that we all have this opportunity to mark the 25th anniversary of the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Ireland. It can be hard to change laws, and it can be even harder to change hearts and minds, to change what is considered normal, and to change a culture. Twenty-five years ago this week, President Mary Robinson signed into law an historic Act that brought an end to decades of cruelty and injustice. The Fianna Fáil-Labour Party coalition at the time deserves recognition for its courage in driving this change, and a special mention should be made of the then Minister for Justice, Ms Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, who piloted the legislation through this House and the Seanad. I also particularly want to acknowledge the work of Senator Ged Nash in introducing this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> Several pieces of legislation were repealed in 1993. Many were historical and stretched back to the 19th century, and even before the Famine. There was some legislation from 1842 and some from 1847, with the main legislation dating from 1861 and 1885. While that legislation was brought through the House of Commons rather than an Irish parliament, Irish Parliaments and Irish Governments defended it nonetheless for decades. They were very much dogmas of a different time and they dictated how we treated and mistreated our fellow citizens, our brothers and sisters. It is oppressive to live in a constant state of humiliation and a constant state of fear. It is also deeply traumatic to feel that one is rejected by one's own country.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> As the work of Professor Diarmaid Ferriter has shown, between 1940 and 1978 an average of 13 men a year were jailed for homosexual offences. Between 1962 and 1972, there were 455 convictions. I was born in 1979, and in the three years before that, there were 44 prosecutions in this country. It is not all that long ago, and it is very much in living memory. Homosexuality was seen as a perversion and trials were sometimes a cruel form of entertainment for the media and the public. Others saw it as a mental illness, including the medical profession at the time. For every one conviction, there were a hundred other people who lived under the stigma of prosecution, who feared having their sexual orientation made public and their lives and careers destroyed as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> Last summer, I was in San Francisco and I had the opportunity to visit a memorial in City Hall in honour of Harvey Milk. Milk was the first openly gay man to be elected to office, and he was assassinated 40 years ago by those who were offended by, and opposed to, everything he stood for. His portrait now stands in the Taoiseach's office. Milk believed that hope was never silent, but too often in this country we were too silent on too many important issues for far too long. It was the voices of a brave few who gave us all hope and then changed things for everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> I was just a child when Declan Flynn was murdered in Fairview Park, his only crime being that he was gay. He was brutally attacked by five young men, one a teenager, who shouted: "Hide behind a tree. We are going to bash a queer." He died from asphyxia after been given an horrific beating by those men. When the Oireachtas makes something a crime, people believe that they have a licence to punish those whom they believe are committing it. These were young men who grew up in a society that feared and hated homosexuality. They took the law into their own hands, and all too often, people allowed the law to do its bashing for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> A year after Declan Flynn's death, there were huge protests in Dublin, organised by a coalition of groups that were horrified at the lenient sentence given to his attackers. From that, a movement was mobilised in Ireland. The same year, we had the first Pride parade in Dublin. People would no longer remain silent. Pride, as we know, is now a festival of diversity, colour and inclusion, but we should not forget that it did not start out that way. Pride festivals in many parts of the world today are still very much protests, with protestors who get attacked.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> The date of 22 May 2015 is one that I will never forget. It was the day of the marriage referendum, and the bench where Declan Flynn was killed at Fairview Park was covered with flowers and notes. We think of him today on this anniversary, and of the very different Ireland that we live in now. We also remember those who paved the way for this change. We had many tireless campaigners over the decades such as the people involved with the Irish Gay Rights Movement. We had the inspiring example of our own Senator David Norris, who brought his case for decriminalisation all the way to the Supreme Court 35 years ago and who never allowed defeat to dampen his determination or good humour.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> We also owe a debt to Europe. In 1988, the European Court of Human Rights decided in favour of Senator Norris in a landmark case. That created the impetus and provided the momentum for us to change our laws. Some years later, Senator Norris wrote a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> and said that, for the first time, he felt like he was a full and equal citizen in his own country. We should of course acknowledge, as he does, that he did not take the case on his own. A dozen men who could not be named took the case with him. Some of them are in the Gallery tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> So much has changed since then. Three years ago, we helped to transform how this country was seen around the world when we voted so decisively for marriage equality, the first country in the world to do so by popular vote. Last year, I had the privilege of being elected Taoiseach by this House, something that would have been unimaginable to politicians when I was born and perhaps seemed even impossible a few short years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> There are many people who helped change minds and change laws, and their contributions should also be remembered, people who fought for me and other gay people long before we fought for ourselves. I think today of people who are no longer with us - champions like Dr. Ann Louise Gilligan, someone whose courage helped to change the laws in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> We have a long history of same-sex relationships in this country, and it is something we should be more aware of. Indeed, Aristotle wrote that the Celts openly approved of same-sex relationships, and there are many references to such relationships in Irish mythology. They are even provided for in Brehon law.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">It is no secret that a number of patriots who were involved in founding our State, men and women, were also gay. While the State's laws affected gay men in a legal sense, they had a chilling effect on lesbians as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> Today, the people I want to pay a special tribute to on behalf of the Government are the unknown heroes, the thousands of people whose names we do not know, who were criminalised by our forebears. They are men and women of all ages who tried to live and love and be themselves in a society where their identity was feared and despised and who were aliens in their own country for their entire lives because they felt that love that dare not speak its name. We cannot erase the wrong that was done to them but we can say that we have learned as a society from their suffering. Their stories have helped to change us, as a country, for the better. They have made us more tolerant, understanding and human.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> This evening, we mark the anniversary of the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Ireland and the progress made since then. We have come a long way, we remember those who suffered and also acknowledge that we have much more to do. There is always more to do, whether it is promoting LGBT equality on other parts of this island and around the world, combatting bullying in schools or the workplace or working to improve sexual health. Harvey Milk reminded us of the challenge we face in society to "break down the myths, destroy the lies and distortions." He understood why it needed to be done. We do it for ourselves, for others, and most of all, for the young.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_351">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_661">It is important that we take time to remember and reflect on key moments in our history, particularly when they mark a decisive move towards recognising the basic rights of citizens. By any measure, the vote 25 years ago to decriminalise homosexuality is a turning point in modern Irish history. It did not end discrimination, and we have not ended discrimination, but it set off a chain of actions which have changed our country unquestionably for the better. The decriminalisation legislation was first and foremost a victory for a generation of exceptional campaigners. They worked with extraordinary passion and no small amount of bravery to say loudly and proudly that Irish society must end the appalling stigma of criminality which gave force to an almost endemic homophobia. The forerunner of what is today the National LGBT Federation was central to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> As with too many social changes in our country, the spark for change came from a terrible tragedy. The murder of Declan Flynn in Fairview Park in September 1982, as the Taoiseach said, began a movement which suffered many setbacks but ultimately triumphed 11 years later. The decision of the Supreme Court's majority in the case taken by Senator David Norris may well be the worst in that court's history and it is certainly and rightly its most infamous. Even then, a mark of a brighter future could be found in the powerful dissent of Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy. A deeply committed believer in the rights and republican motivation of the Constitution, McCarthy tore apart the idea that imported Victorian morality and legislation should negate the personal rights guaranteed to citizens of this Republic. The subsequent judgment of the European Court of Human Rights put the focus squarely on the Oireachtas to act. After unjustified delays, the programme for Government agreed between the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil in 1992 stated clearly that change would be enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> If one looks back at the Dáil debates as well as general commentary, there are important lessons for us and signals for the progress which happened step by step in the following two decades. It is wrong to see Máire Geoghegan-Quinn as simply the line Minister who happened to be in charge of the Bill. She made two major contributions. First, she insisted that the House should see this as a human rights issue and not as some minor cleaning up of an out-of-date statute. It was, she said, essential that we accepted the inherent human rights of homosexual couples. Second, Ms Geoghegan-Quinn, with the backing of the Cabinet, rejected attempts to keep some inequality in the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> In Britain and other countries, decriminalisation was often done on a piecemeal basis and Governments made gestures to homophobia such as having an unequal age of consent. Importantly, the European Court of Justice left the issue of the age of consent up to national law. A proposal was made on Committee Stage by the Opposition in the Dáil to have an unequal age of consent. The Minister and many others rejected both the proposal and the logic behind it. Some Members of the then Opposition filibustered it out of existence, to be fair, which meant it was never voted on.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> By deciding in 1993 to both decriminalise and have equality in this part of the law, a decisive tone was set which has been central to everything which has come since. My party is proud to have enacted, with cross-party support, the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000, which extended equal protections to citizens irrespective of sexual orientation. This legislation was recognised by the United Nations in 2001 as being among the most progressive in the world at the time. The all-party approach, which has been central to progress, continued with the civil partnership legislation and, ultimately, the marriage equality referendum which was carried so overwhelmingly during the previous Dáil. We should all realise how important it has been that we have worked together in the past 25 years to allow voices in the LGBTI community to be heard in our national Parliament and to ensure a wide consensus. In doing this, we have avoided the sort of damaging political debate seen in other countries. The long-term impact of criminalisation of homosexual relations is something we must continue to address. Even for the youngest generation, acknowledging one's sexuality far too often involves taking real risks. We still have a journey to finish in providing the love and support the LGTBI community so badly needs. We have to deliver health services, including mental health services which meet the needs of the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> We must redouble education efforts to both tackle discrimination and promote active support and understanding. We fully support the all-party motion to pardon all those who were convicted under previous draconian legislation and we also believe that progress should be made on addressing the legislative gaps that still remain for gay couples who have children.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> Internationally, the last few years have demonstrated to anyone who wants to pay attention that the steady march of progress which was so casually assumed at the start of the 1990s has not come about. In fact, this is a very dark moment for believers in human rights. Basic freedoms are under threat and there are many countries where homophobia is actively promoted by governments. Russia's active discrimination is being copied by others. Many countries in Africa have an appalling and worsening record. We have a duty not to turn our eyes away. The repression of LGBTI people in these countries cannot be allowed to become a new norm which carries no consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> Commemorating progress in our own country is an empty gesture if we do not speak up for those in other countries who are suffering. In two weeks, the streets of Dublin will be filled with a joyous celebration of LGBTI identity. Pride has become one of our capital's most inclusive and important annual events. It is something which would have been barely imaginable in the Dublin of 1982 where a young man lost his life because he gave a small kiss on the cheek to another young man as he left a public house. Declan Flynn and so many others who suffered because of the homophobia enabled by criminalisation must always be remembered. They must serve as a warning to us of what happens when a society takes away basic rights from a minority.</p>

        <speech by="#JimOCallaghan" eId="spk_352">
          <from>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_669">The criminalisation of homosexual activity has had a long and cruel history. The Taoiseach referred to Victorian statutes but it went back further than that. In 1533, Henry VIII first made homosexual activity an offence, punishable by death. It was first made a criminal offence in Ireland during the reign of Charles I and was punishable by death on conviction. It was not until 1828 that the death penalty was removed for homosexual activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> The Taoiseach referred to the Offences Against The Person Act 1861. Under section 61, a person would not be sentenced to death but would be sent to prison for life. In 1885, an amendment introduced by Henry Labouchère allowed many men to be prosecuted if they were convicted of what is referred to as gross indecency. That legislation resulted in the conviction and imprisonment of our own Oscar Wilde in England in 1895.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> I recognise that politicians have played a considerable part in decriminalising homosexual activity. However, individuals who are not Members of the Oireachtas played a significant role and they too must be recognised. One person in particular that we should recognise is Mr. Jeffrey Dudgeon who sought to challenge, before the European courts, the criminalisation of homosexual activity in Northern Ireland. In 1976, he brought a case before the European Court of Human Rights, challenging the criminalisation in the North, and succeeded. It was not just an abstract threat for Mr. Dudgeon. This was a man who had been questioned by members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, RUC, for four and a half hours about his sex life. I also acknowledge the role and presence of Senator Norris, who similarly took a case which went as far as the Irish Supreme Court. The decision in that case, as Deputy Micheál Martin stated, is a blemish on the Supreme Court's record. Having read it again, it is unfortunately the case that the Supreme Court failed in its duty to recognise that the enumerated and unenumerated rights of Irish citizens included the right to privacy and sexual privacy. Senator Norris also needs to be commended.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, other members of that Government, and the Oireachtas which voted in favour of the legislation also deserve to be commended, but at this time we must remember the thousands of men and women who could not live their lives openly and who were forced to live a lie by this criminalisation. It is they whom we should remember this evening.</p>

          <p eId="para_673">There is no doubt the reforming legislation introduced by Máire Geoghegan-Quinn 25 years ago was a watershed moment for gay people in Ireland who for far too long had been abused, stigmatised and isolated and were not treated as equal members of society. As a republican party, a commitment to fighting discrimination in all forms is a core value for Fianna Fáil. Our wish is to create a republic where everybody is equal and has a right to dignity. We are immensely proud of the road that Máire, with others, forged, at a difficult time, in a very different Ireland, although it was only 25 years ago. While paying tribute to Máire, the irrepressible Senator David Norris, and to Mary McAleese who co-founded the campaign for homosexual reform, I also pay tribute to the Irish mammies, parents, families and friends who got behind the campaign 25 years ago. While gay people were front and centre of the campaign, it was the support of family and friends who helped make it happen. I refer to mothers like Phil Moore who spoke mother to mother to Máire Geoghegan-Quinn because she could see the everyday acts of exclusion which her son endured and which were then part of our social fabric. It is fitting that mammies, daddies and families are remembered in the theme of this year's Pride festival which is "We Are Family".</p>

          <p eId="para_676">Sinn Féin is withdrawing its amendment. Cuirim fáilte roimh an rún tábhachtach agus stairiúil seo. Cuireann sé éagóir mhór i gceart a rinne damáiste dochreidte do dhaoine agus a rinne coirpigh de dhaoine nach raibh faic as an tslí déanta acu. Homosexuality was decriminalised in the State on 24 June 1993. The move to make homosexual acts no longer illegal followed a 16 year long legal battle which began in 1977, when Senator David Norris began a case against Ireland's draconian laws. In 1988, he succeeded in the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, on this case. I acknowledge the work and campaigning of Senator Norris and also the other men who took the case with him. I also acknowledge Belfast city councillor, Jeffrey Dudgeon, who took an equivalent case in the North, and the Minister of the day who brought forward the legislation, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn. That was done in a context where the homophobic murder of Declan Flynn in 1982, a catalyst for Ireland's Pride movement, was in recent memory, and where due to institutional conservatism the State failed to meet the healthcare needs of the LGBTI community. The apology follows progressive moves in Britain and the North to enact what has been dubbed Turing's Law, which pardoned more than 49,000 men convicted under anti-homosexuality laws. It was aptly named after Alan Turing, the mathematician who was criminalised and chemically castrated for being a homosexual man. He committed suicide two years after his conviction.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> Decriminalisation was a watershed moment in Irish history and allowed the LGBTI community to be more open and public where previously it was harassed and criminalised by the State. An apology for the overall treatment towards the LGBTI community is most welcome and it vindicates those members of the community who were told that on every moral level of society their identities were something that was wrong and of which they should be ashamed. The apology to them is well deserved, as it is to those who had their lives irreparably damaged and violence visited upon them by individuals and the State. It is more than appropriate that the State should apologise for that and for the fact that it mistreated the LGBTI community historically.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> The motion condemns this law to the history books, not as the shame of gay and bisexual men but as the shame of the State. Those same men should have a clean record when asked and should not be obliged to disclose intimate details of their lives so that, in future, gay and bisexual men can live freer of State discrimination. We believe the State should also commit to implementing hate crime legislation and a ban on so-called conversion therapies to protect the LGBTI community into the future. Actions should follow the very genuine sentiment of this apology.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> Sinn Féin had tabled an amendment, which we will not press, for the consideration of the Government. We will not ask the House to divide on the issue. We want the Government, however, to give consideration to the matters raised. Lesbian, bisexual and transgender persons were persecuted by the laws also. While indirectly affected, for many others the law sent a message of institutional discrimination that drove the LGBTI community underground, stigmatised its members and facilitated abuse in numerous ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> The second element of the proposed amendment seeks that the Government would establish a scheme whereby persons convicted under anti-homosexuality laws would be granted a pardon that expunges all convictions of that nature and enables all documentation carrying such a conviction to be corrected. The motion's objective is a State apology towards those so convicted and we very much welcome it. Homosexuality was only decriminalised 25 years ago, however, and there are still many in society who hold conviction records due to those laws. That is the reason we call for exoneration also. Those men deserve a clean slate and history should be corrected.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> The State's apology follows a move in Britain whereby men convicted under those laws are in a position to apply for a pardon from the Home Office. The Taoiseach said the State does not have a system of criminal exoneration or pardon and that such an approach might be difficult due to third party involvement in the offence. While I accept that, it is our opinion that such an approach could be introduced on a case-by-case basis. Court records could be investigated and the Government should take such an approach. Those who were convicted deserve vindication from the State harassment they received.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> In the spirit of the apology, it should be met with action, and I call on the Government to implement future protections for the LGBTI community. The State is the only western European jurisdiction without hate crime legislation. We also believe there is a need for a ban on conversion therapies.</p>

          <p eId="para_683">I am delighted to be able to speak on the anniversary of the decriminalisation of homosexuality. In 1993, the decriminalisation was a fantastic victory for Ireland's LGBTI community and for those progressives and campaigners who fought hard. Ireland has changed since homosexuality was decriminalised in June 1993. In the early years following decriminalisation, however, and until relatively recently, change was slow for those in the LGBTI community. It was not slow because those from the gay and lesbian community and others did not fight, campaign, and agitate for progressive change. It was slow because official Ireland at the time was still a deeply conservative place. Throughout the years the fight for decriminalisation was going on and in the following years, this State remained a cold house for gay and lesbian people, as well as others who did not conform to conservative social codes. It is impossible to quantify how many were affected and how many left the country because of Ireland's draconian laws. That should never be forgotten. On days like today we should remember those people.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> There is no point in pretending that some of the prejudices of that time do not linger on, were not passed on, and do not exist in this State currently. It exists in how sex education is taught in some schools. It exists in certain religious organisations which do not recognise same-sex families. It exists in the exclusion of gay men from blood donation and in other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> Recently, when Ireland played the USA in an international football friendly, the players wore rainbow-coloured shirt numbers to show support for LGBTI rights. The FAI tweeted about this great initiative and it was welcomed by many, but some of the tweets in response to this fantastic initiative were nothing short of disgraceful and revealed a homophobia which still exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> Same-sex couples continue to be discriminated against in registering the births of their children while we wait for Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act to be enacted.</p>

          <p eId="para_688">Today is another one of those significant days in the modernisation of our country and society. We must never forget the past, of course, but we must also recognise that once we learn from and act on the mistakes of the past, of which this State has made some very dark ones, then in this case particularly, the rainbows that will shine into the future will be brighter for it. The decision of the people to embrace inclusivity and choice in the marriage equality referendum in May 2015 heralded a new dawn for Ireland and all of its people. The most recent referendum has proved beyond doubt that the Irish people are committed to an inclusive and compassionate society. The rainbows of tomorrow will shine much brighter than those which shone in the decades gone past. They can shine for trust, pride, equality and inclusivity. The days of marginalisation, shame and of criminalising our citizens for their sexuality and love are over and consigned to the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> I congratulate the Taoiseach and his Government on taking this initiative. An apology is very much welcome but a further step needs to be taken. Those homosexual men who were criminalised in the past for engaging in consensual acts should be exonerated. It has been said that there are difficulties with providing exoneration but such difficulties should be overcome. We have to right what were very terrible wrongs. The Taoiseach or a responsible Minister should put on record in the House tonight that every effort will be made to expunge these convictions without delay. I urge the LGBT community in our changing Ireland to continue to play its part in building towards the true republic of equality for which we all long and a new Ireland of which we can all be proud.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_690">We have moved within a generation from a time when gay men and women were an alien and shunned phenomenon to one where sexuality in all its expressions can be fully celebrated. That change has been dramatic but politicians and political parties can claim only part of the credit. Civil society and civil organisations have been the pathfinders on this reform and none more so than Senator David Norris who is in the Chamber this evening. The Labour Party can claim to have been at the forefront of all of the major campaigns for gay rights, but the eventual delivery at political level was on a unified, cross-party basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> The words "sexual orientation" first appeared on the Statute Book in 1989 in the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act. The then Minister for Justice, Ray Burke, of all people, agreed to a Labour Party amendment, supported by the Worker's Party at the time, to the Government Bill to broaden the definition from racial hatred to include sexual orientation, an amendment that his predecessor, Gerry Collins, stoutly refused to make. We are celebrating today because the Fianna Fáil-Labour Party coalition Government, of which I was very honoured to be a member as Minister for Health, delivered in 1993 on a Labour Party manifesto promise to abolish all criminal offences relating to consensual sex among same-sex couples. It is hard to imagine now how delicately the subject was treated, but I remember those times. It is amazing to consider that the then Minister for Justice, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn brought two options to Government and left it up to her colleagues to choose which of them to adopt, with no statement of ministerial or departmental choice. The second option, almost forgotten now, was that our legislation should legalise same-sex acts but only at 21 or 18, perhaps, rather than the age of heterosexual consent at the time. It required, if I recall correctly, only a very short discussion at Cabinet to agree a principle of a common age of consent. Ultimately, that legislation went through the Dáil with just one voice dissenting, although the Fine Gael front bench under John Bruton was deeply divided on the age of consent issue and remained so afterwards. One or two Deputies here will remember that another battle was fought subsequently when the aforementioned party leader wanted to raise the age of consent generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> To our credit, that story was very different from the far more protracted and divisive debate that took place in Britain which was not finally resolved until 2001. Of course, we know that male homosexual acts were decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967. What is not so well-known is that in the year following the liberalisation of the law, the police brought more prosecutions under the new Act than had been brought under the previous one. In the UK, the age of consent was set at 21 for homosexual acts, in contrast to 16 for heterosexual acts. In 1994, the year after we changed the law here and equalised the age of consent, Ms Edwina Currie proposed an amendment to British legislation to introduce a common age of consent which was soundly defeated in the House of Commons. The furthest they would go in Westminster was to lower the age of consent from 21 to 18 for homosexual acts. As others have mentioned, a 1997 judgment of the European Court of Human Rights held that a different age of consent was a breach of European law. Nonetheless, two efforts to introduce a common age of consent were vetoed in the House of Lords and a final effort was only passed using override powers under the Parliament Act. Reform finally came to Britain in 2001, so we were ahead of our nearest neighbour on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> Meanwhile, back home, my party's Equal Status Bill had been voted down by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government in 1992 when it was an Opposition Bill. It was a Labour Party election manifesto commitment that became official Government policy when the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government was formed. I had the honour in 2006 of introducing my party's Civil Unions Bill which I described at the time as providing a basic human right. I recognise that it was only the first step to what we later achieved, namely, full marriage equality through a constitutional amendment rather than through legislative spearheading. That popular endorsement of the concept of full civic equality was the right approach. The sense of urgency demands consistent, insistent pressure, despite every parliamentary setback, and persistence eventually pays off. I reintroduced the Civil Unions Bill when a new Government was formed which was again voted down. Eventually, however, the Civil Partnership Bill became law in 2010 which paved the way for the marriage equality referendum in 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> A lot remains to be done. When we are confronted with the shocking figures for young male suicide, I cannot help wondering how many of those lives have been destroyed by overwhelming insecurity and the terror of non-acceptance by family and community of a secret identity and sexual orientation. It is, I believe, a greater proportion than the number of gay men and women among the population as a whole. The ultimate goal must be complete acceptance, inclusion and normality and nothing less - the right to be treated as nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> I want to finish my contribution by quoting from a message my colleagues, Senator Nash and Senator Bacik, received today from Mr. Seamus Dooley of the National Union of Journalists, which reads as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_696">Just a short note of personal thanks to you both for your consistent and unswerving support on the issue of LGBT rights over many years. There is every danger you may be drowned out by voices new to the topic but those of us who have been campaigning for decades are especially grateful to Labour Oireachtas members, past and present. It would be good to mention Declan Flynn today. His killing was a significant turning point and brought the LGBT community out onto the streets. In this regard, there are powerful lines from Pearse Hutchinson's poem, Let's Hope: </p>

          <p eId="para_706">The early 1990s was a period in which the gay community, particularly in the USA but increasingly across the world, was being decimated by AIDS.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">It was against this background that much of the discussion on decriminalisation took place. Decriminalisation was an important plank in the Labour Party's platform at the 1992 general election. Fianna Fáil, which was led by Albert Reynolds at that time, accepted it as part of the programme for Government that was agreed early in 1993. Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, as Minister for Justice, took the legislation through the Dáil later that year. There were many rumours that elements in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael would revolt, but that never happened. We were here until very late in the evening. I note that Senator Norris is here. There were many gay people in the Gallery on that occasion. The feeling of celebration and relief was palpable.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> Having complimented Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, I particularly want to mention Mervyn Taylor, who was a Labour Party colleague of mine and of Deputy Howlin in that Government as Minister for Equality and Law Reform. To be frank, reforms were taken out of the Department of Justice to make them feasible. I mean no disrespect to the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, when I say that.</p>

          <p eId="para_710">I would like to quote what Mr. Taylor had to say during the Dáil debate:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_711">For those who have genuine difficulties with the principle of the Bill, it is important to recall that what is proposed is the enabling of persons in the gay community to pursue loving relationships. What could be more important, for us as legislators, than to create a climate and a space in which two people who have chosen each other can express and share their love? </p>
          <p eId="para_712">I do not think it has ever been put quite as well as that.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> Some people suffered dreadfully as a result of what happened with AIDS, but I am happy to say that many of those who were in the Gallery that night were active in the marriage equality referendum and were able to give me a great deal of useful advice when we were drawing up legislation in relation to people who are transgender. When I brought in the Refugee Act, I widened the conditions under which people could seek asylum to include the issues of sexual orientation and gender.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> It is right for us to acknowledge what has happened in Ireland. For me, there is a particular celebration when I visit secondary schools in Dublin West, almost all of which have LGTBI groups, and meet young people who are free to express their sexuality as they choose.</p>

          <p eId="para_717">I want to start by saluting and celebrating the campaigners in the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network for how they took the stand that they took. I note that one of them, Senator Norris, is here. The reality is that such reforms were not won by the great and good of the political elite. The political elite and the establishment often stood in the teeth of opposition to prevent progress for LGBT+ people. They showed apathy, indifference and sometimes derision and hostility in the face of demands for homosexual law reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> I do not think we are here to celebrate what a great little country Ireland is in which to be gay or transgender. The battle for these rights has not ended and cannot end. According to a report that was written last year, some 56% of LGBT+ teenagers between the ages of 14 and 18 say they have self-harmed and 70% of them say they have seriously thought about ending their own lives. The report shows that school continues to be a difficult place for many young LGBT+ people. Just one in five of them believe they belong completely in their schools. Less than half of them feel they have received positive affirmation of their identity in our society. The report also shows that LGBT+ people continue to experience victimisation and harassment in their day-to-day lives. Three quarters of them have been verbally abused and almost one third of them have experienced abuse in the past year. Just one in three of them would feel safe showing affection to a partner in public. Some 15% of them said they would never hold hands in public. One in three LGBT+ people have been threatened with physical violence to their sexual identity, and one in five of them have had hurtful things written about them on social media.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> This cannot be a great country for the LGBT+ community, given that sex education in our schools is overwhelmingly based on one ethos and the great liberals of Fine Gael etc. have blocked a Bill that would ensure we get fact-based non-ethos sex education. When young people hear during sex education that it is perfectly normal to be gay and to be attracted to a member of the same sex, we will have gone a long way towards heading off the psychological damage that the current system is doing to young people in our society. As that system is often based on church denomination and domination of our schools, it imbues in young LGBT+ people a sense that they are less than normal.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> It cannot be a great little country for people in the LGBT+ community given that we are still dragging our feet on the enactment of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and, as a consequence, heterosexual and homosexual couples do not have the same rights in relation to their children. I remind the Minister, Deputy Zappone, that it was supposed to be enacted last year. We were meant to have it within a year of the marriage equality referendum being passed. The failure to enact this legislation means that the partners of women like Fiona Armstrong Astley are unable to register as a parent to their children. This means they cannot get a passport for their children without, in effect, denying them joint parentage.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> Before we congratulate ourselves on how modern and wonderful we are, we should remember those who cannot afford to get the PrEP drug which prevents AIDS over the Internet, those who cannot access mental health services when they need them, those who are struggling with their sexuality in faith-based schools where being gay, bisexual or transgender is seen as less than normal and those who cannot register the birth of their children to get passports for them as a result of our failure to enact the necessary legislation. While I celebrate and salute those who struggled down through the decades in very difficult circumstances and against the odds, we need to celebrate with a certain note of caution and in anticipation of the further changes that are needed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulMurphy" eId="spk_366">
          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_722">We are marking the decriminalisation of homosexuality, which I see as a graphic confirmation of Frederick Douglass's famous aphorism that, "Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will ... If there is no struggle there is no progress." History demonstrates that decriminalisation was won following a struggle by the LGBTQ community that delivered change, just as similar movements delivered changes like marriage equality and the repeal of the eighth amendment. The decriminalisation struggle was part of an international movement that used various political tactics including mass protest, civil disobedience, deliberate defiance of the law and the distribution of contraceptives and information. The movement in Ireland gathered particular strength and momentum in the aftermath of the horrific murder of Declan Flynn.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> While I welcome the Government's apology, which is long overdue, it should go further. Those who were prosecuted under what are now recognised as clearly barbaric laws should be pardoned. We should remember that the lives of countless people were very badly affected by those laws. People were forced to emigrate. People lost jobs. People's lives were destroyed. I suggest that the State, in addition to providing a pardon, needs to undertake to address all of those who were convicted and harmed by the barbaric laws I have mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> It is striking that the LGBTQ community remains at the forefront of the struggle for social progress and equality. One of the most striking features of the exit polls that were released after people had voted on the eighth amendment was that 91% of the LGBTQ community voted in favour of repeal. The oppression faced by that community is not the same as it was before 1993, or even five or ten years ago. Things have improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">Nonetheless, there is oppression. A heteronormative environment predominates in society, a situation where people's sexuality and gender are often not recognised or respected. It is a scandal that young people - all young people born after 1993 - should still face that situation. I am sure everybody is aware of the horrific statistics that speak to the discrimination and impact on mental health still felt by LGBTQ people, in particular young people. One really stark statistic from BeLonG To is that one in three LGBTQ people aged between 14 and 18 years has attempted to take his or her own life because of bullying, rejection and pressure to hide who he or she is. We need action. A movement drove decriminalisation just like a movement drove marriage equality and repeal of the eight amendment. It drove changes in backward attitudes, challenged prejudice and pushed conservative politicians to move, but we still need movement by the Government. </p>
          <p eId="para_726"> A lot of it starts with sex education. We need objective sex education that is factually based, LGBTQ+ positive, not distorted by religious ethos. I was disappointed by the Taoiseach's answer this morning on the money message. It is worrying and indicates that the Government may decide to hide behind the idea of a money message and not provide it. I appeal again to the Taoiseach in Pride month not to block this necessary legislation. We need it to deal with the question of ethos and to have objective sex education provided in schools. We also need action on the provision of trans healthcare to allow people to transition to their correct gender without the current medicalised model. We need a model based on the principles of bodily autonomy and self-determination. There is also a need for recognition of non-binary people and effective gender recognition for those under 18 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> I welcome the statement made yesterday by the Taoiseach, but it does not go far enough. We need action on PrEP and PEP which are extremely effective in stopping the spread of HIV. The Taoiseach has said there is to be a review. I hope we can have it under the HSE in a year's time. However, how many people will be affected during the course of that year? We need action now to roll it out through the HSE. </p>
          <p eId="para_728"> I raise the case of same sex parents who still cannot be recognised on their children's birth certificates three years after the passage of the Children and Family Relationships Act. They and their children have fewer rights than heterosexual families. Last week the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katharine Zappone, told me that an announcement was imminent by the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris. We are still waiting. I hope imminent means that we will hear it this week. It is particularly appropriate, given that the theme of Pride is "We are Family". Pride rightly is a celebration. There is much to celebrate and I will be there celebrating. However, it is also a protest which has its roots in the Stonewall riots. Tens of thousands will be out on Saturday week celebrating but also protesting for action on all of these issues and a society without oppression and inequality.</p>

          <p eId="para_729">I thank the Taoiseach for giving us the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I also welcome his apology. However, it is important to remember that we were brought down this road reluctantly by the courts. Tá ardmholadh tuillte ag mo chomhghleacaí as Gaillimh Máire Geoghegan Quinn agus ag an Rialtas ag an am a thug isteach an reachtaíocht nua. However, it was the end of a very long and painful process. Very few voices were raised in the Dáil on the rights of gay people. It is important to remember that silence and learn from it. Silence and collusion can be as destructive as deliberate acts. When I think about silence and collusion, I think of the 10,000 people who are homeless, including over 3,500 children. I think of the 120,000 nationally who are waiting on housing lists. I think of those in direct provision accommodation. We seem to be going backwards. There has been an increase in the number who have status, which is to be welcomed, but who cannot get out of direct provision centres. The length of time it takes to process applications has increased from 11 weeks in 2015 to 20 months in 2018. I could go on. There is lack of access to basic records such as birth and death certificates. We collude through silence. This is a day on which to celebrate and remember and to ask ourselves in what are we now colluding.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> We need to look at the journeys Senator David Norris took on our behalf to make us a better society and, before him, Jeffrey Dudgeon in Northern Ireland. I also acknowledge and recognise the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, who courageously took a case with her partner to the High Court and the Supreme Court. Those cases tell us a lot about Ireland and us. In 1975 Mr. Dudgeon very bravely filed his first complaint with the European Court of Human Rights. He had to go through such a painful process which Senator David Norris also had to go through over a period of 16 years on our behalf. In a hearing in 1979 Mr. Dudgeon's complaint was declared admissible to be heard in the European Court of Human Rights. That hearing was held in 1981 before 19 judges. It was the first successful case before the European Court of Human Rights on the decriminalisation of male homosexuality. It set the legal precedent that ultimately resulted in the Council of Europe requiring that no member state criminalise male or female homosexual behaviour. I am sure Senator David Norris will acknowledge that the Dudgeon case served as a key precedent in the case of Norris <i>v. </i>Ireland which challenged the continued application of the same legislation in this jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> What strikes me is that, moving forward from 1975 to 1981, this country and the judges knew that the situation was wrong. They saw the result at the European Court of Human Rights, yet Senator David Norris had to start all over again, almost in parallel with the case taken in Northern Ireland. In 1977 he instituted proceedings in the High Court seeking a declaration that sections 61 and 62 of the Acts of 1861 and 1885 should be repealed. We had a High Court case first. In his judgment in 1980 Mr. Justice McWilliam set out that "one of the effects of criminal sanctions against homosexual acts is to reinforce the misapprehension and general prejudice of the public and increase the anxiety and guilt feelings of homosexuals leading, on occasions, to depression and the serious consequences which can follow from" what he called "that unfortunate disease." He dismissed the case of Senator David Norris who was Mr. Norris at the time on legal grounds. On 22 April 1983 the Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision. The various judgments have been referred to.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> I want to put the date of 22 April 1983 in perspective. It was just a few weeks after the death of Sheila Hodgers and prior to the insertion of the eighth amendment into the Constitution. She had died in March that year because she had been refused medical treatment for cancer because she was pregnant and there was a foetal heartbeat. In April the Supreme Court gave its judgment by majority decision. It talked about the preamble to the Constitution, Christianity and so on. It used the terms "Christianity" and "Christian principles" to back up a most unchristian attitude to the way people were treated. Later that year the eighth amendment was inserted into the Constitution and a few months afterwards there was the death of Ann Lovett at a grotto in Granard. I am only mentioning some of the things that happened around that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> Senator David Norris had to continue to fight, although there were two beacons of light at the time, namely, the dissenting judgments of Mr. Justice Henchy and Mr. Justice McCarthy who, unfortunately, died prematurely.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">Mr. Justice McCarthy stated that the Legislature is not free to encroach unjustifiably upon the fundamental rights of individuals or the family in the name of the common good. Notwithstanding that, Senator Norris had to go forward to the court, to which he applied in October 1983. We should remember that the eighth amendment had just been passed because that gives us an idea of the context and environment in which the case was taken. Senator Norris complained about the contravention of his rights under Article 8. It took until 26 October 1988 - 11 years after the proceedings were instituted in the national courts - for the decision to be made and it was a further five years before the law was changed in 1993. The various cases lasted for 16 years, during which time the country struggled with a black and white view of the foetus and the foetal heartbeat that did not reflect reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> It is important to remember today the pain and loss of life, including the murder of Declan Flynn in September 1982, a year when so much happened in Irish society. If this Dáil had asked questions and demanded accountability at that time, many lives could have been saved, whether those lost through suicide or otherwise, and much pain and suffering avoided.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> If there is something to learn tonight, it is that we need to look at ourselves in this Dáil and what is happening in our name. How many other cases exist? We see the case taken regarding the right to work for people living in direct provision. We see a man who was in the mother and baby home in Tuam state on record that basic records relating to a family member are being refused. As the Taoiseach sits here, and I appreciate he is listening, this is happening in our name. The man to whom I refer has been in the High Court many times seeking basic information.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> We need to reflect and take different actions as we move forward. I certainly cannot stand here and watch the mother and baby homes debacle and language being used over and over again to obfuscate, hide and confuse when we know exactly what happened. If we are to learn anything, let us learn to use language honestly and in a straightforward fashion and to empower people to take part in a democracy. We do not need to keep responding to court cases one after the other, as happened with the eighth amendment. With the exception of the Circuit Court, women were brought before or had to go before every single court in the land and then to Europe and a United Nations committee. That is what led to the changes relating to the eighth amendment and changes in the legislation on homosexuality. It was not the Dáil acting in a proactive manner. That is the lesson for us tonight.</p>

          <p eId="para_738">I am happy to make a few brief remarks on this motion. I support the idea of a State apology for past wrongs committed in its name. The State has many things to apologise for. Perhaps the Taoiseach is trying to emulate the late Pope, St. John Paul the Great, who in 2000 made an international plea for forgiveness for the wrongs committed in the name of the church. It seems the State is almost 20 years behind the church on this issue. However, we must acknowledge that the State is now taking actions or allowing actions to be taken for which it will also have to apologise at some point in the future. I think of direct provision, the dozens of children who have died in State care in the past decade, the national housing scandal and the many other issues where human dignity is being trampled upon every day.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> I acknowledge that this particular apology is being offered on the 25th anniversary of the decriminalisation of homosexuality, which was a momentous and great event for many people. I have in mind people like Senator David Norris who, although we may not share similar political or cultural views, is a man of integrity in his own right who has done much to remove the stigma that once attached to this issue. It takes guts to stand against the prevailing cultural viewpoint. We must face the past in all its complexity and not be afraid to admit where we may have been wrong. Zeal for the common good may have inspired some to act with a less than generous spirit and that is to be regretted.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> All human beings, regardless of their sexuality, deserve respect simply because they are human beings. The dignity of the human person is something we must treasure. I fear, however, that for all our so-called enlightenment, it is something we are rapidly losing sight of. The idea that a generation of adults lived their lives in fear simply because they were gay is a deeply sad human tragedy. Nobody in this House can or should tolerate homophobic opinions. I was accused of those abhorrent views simply because I took a different but sincerely held view on the issue of gay marriage. It was a lazy and ridiculous insult that bore no relation to reality. I said at the time of the referendum campaign that the loving relationships that exist between people of the same sex deserve to be protected. I believe that from the point of view of the couple, such relationships do not differ from those of heterosexual couples either in emotional intensity or the depth of their value. They can and do bear witness to the plurality of human relationships that exist in our society. Thankfully, not only has society destigmatised this love, but it is something that can be celebrated and sealed in the public space since the introduction of civil partnerships several years ago. That was my view then and it is my view now.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> While I do not agree with everything in the motion, in the sense that I would like to see more detail about some of the claims it is making, I am happy to support the view that the State should apologise to all those generations of gay men and women it has wounded through its laws.</p>

        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_369">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_742">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the anniversary of this very important occasion marking the decriminalisation of homosexuality and I echo the sentiments expressed by previous speakers. It is also important that we give special credit to the tireless work of individuals such as Senator David Norris and former President Mary Robinson and their incredible efforts over many years. Credit is also due to the former Minister for Justice, Ms Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, who introduced the legislation to allow for decriminalisation and an equal age of consent. However, it should be noted that it took five years, from 1988 to 1993, to bring forward legislation to address the European Court of Human Rights ruling against Ireland that led to decriminalisation. Recent events show us again that, in the main, progress on social issues like this often comes in spite of, rather than because of, the efforts of some in this Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> Decriminalisation, marriage equality and discrimination protections are the bare bones of what LGBTQ people needed in terms of ending legal discrimination. If the Government is serious about protecting and empowering this community, it needs to focus on concrete and tangible issues and service provision, which currently falls far short of what is required. Self-congratulatory speeches in the Chamber do nothing for the people in the Baggot Street MSM health clinic located less than 1 km from this building.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">This is a facility that is unique in Ireland in the services it provides to men who have sex with men, but it is literally falling down around the ears of staff and patients. The speeches do nothing with regard to the frankly baffling ongoing lack of progress on hate crime legislation, which makes it difficult to track and prevent homophobic and transphobic crime. They do nothing to reassure people who are now being affected by the stalled commencement of sections of the Children and Family Relationships Act, which is causing untold distress and anxiety for LGBTQ people who are raising children. Our contributions do nothing to reassure transgender children that their voices will be heard in the review of the gender recognition legislation or those waiting on lists for endocrinology services. Our speeches will do little for those who are buying PrEP online and hoping it will not be seized by customs, which is particularly reprehensible given the alarming rates of new HIV infections being reported.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> I point these things out not to undermine the progress that the LGBTQ community has achieved in Ireland in the past two decades or the work being done by the Government. Rather, I want to remind everyone in this House that we have a responsibility because of our position to rectify the wrongs that were done to this community in the recent past. The legacy of this maltreatment resonates today. Stigma remains and rears its ugly head in many ways. Verbal and physical intimidation of LGBTQ people continues. Homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying is rife in our schools. Outmoded sex and relationship education that is of little use to LGBTQ people is still the norm in our schools and must be addressed urgently. Most tragically, the rates of self-harm and suicide in this community remain alarmingly high. The number of transgender individuals who have engaged in self-harm in particular is stark, with one report suggesting that upwards of 80% of members of this community have experienced suicidal ideation.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> I raised the issue of the poor placing of Ireland on the 2017 European region of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association "Rainbow Map” with the then Minister for Justice and Equality in October of last year. It is important to note that of 49 countries, Ireland is placed 15th in terms of the rights and freedoms of LGBTQ persons. It is noteworthy that Malta, a country not dissimilar to Ireland in terms of its history, went from near the bottom to the top of the European chart when the new government there set out to address decades of neglect for LGBTQ people, proving that radical change in the legal and public policy areas and the lived experience can be brought about with political will in a very short timeframe. I hope the Government would reflect on our comparatively poor ranking and recommit itself to making Ireland a world leader for protecting and enhancing the lives of LGBTQ people here at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> Another thing worth noting is the current programme for Government commitment to develop an LGBTQ strategy for equality. While that is in the programme for Government, it seems there has been very little progress. I understand the Department of Justice and Equality is looking at it but with the change of personnel in recent times, it seems nothing much has happened, and what the Department is doing is very limited. This strategy is going to be critical in determining the future trajectory of LGBTQ equality on a cross-governmental basis. This is what we have to be working towards, not to have this siloed in different Departments. There is a need for a cross-departmental approach to be taken by Government and for one single person to have responsibility for driving that strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> There is no doubt we have come a long way since 1993 but we still have a long way to go. More must be done to ensure our LGBTQ family members and friends enjoy full and equal rights as citizens of this State.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Charles Flanagan)<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_749">Over the past few hours we have had a timely and appropriate discussion in both Houses of the Oireachtas. Many Members have made moving and personal contributions. The fact the Taoiseach was able to speak on this issue in such a personal way is quite a profound reflection of the changes that have taken place in Ireland over the past 25 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> As Minister for Justice and Equality, it is my responsibility to ensure that Ireland is a country where every person is valued equally and that no one faces discrimination simply as a result of who they are. We now know and recognise the damage that discrimination of any kind can cause. The experiences of gay men before the decriminalisation of homosexuality are a living example of how deeply people's lives can be damaged by discrimination. Many generations of LGBTI people felt victimised and excluded from society as a result of those laws. Today, the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas are offering an apology for those laws: an apology for the effect those laws had on the lives of gay men; an apology for how those laws made the LGBTI community feel excluded, isolated and undervalued.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> As the Taoiseach has said, it is a commitment of this Government to prevent discrimination of any kind. I, with the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, am committed to working with the LGBTI community to ensure their voices are heard and listened to in areas which affect their lives and the lives of their families. In response to Deputy Shortall, I note the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, has begun work on the strategy, which is an important development at this time. In response to Deputy Ó Laoghaire and Deputy Paul Murphy, I have taken careful note of the points raised and the issue surrounding the amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> The path to equality has taken some time. Along with the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, significant milestones in the recognition of the rights of gay people are recorded in the motion, including the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2016, the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2016, the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, the marriage equality referendum, the Marriage Act 2015, the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and the Gender Recognition Act 2015. This legislation protects the rights of LGBTI people, recognising their unique needs as members of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> I know those in the LGBTI community have had to work hard to have their rights recognised and to ensure their rights are protected. There are important lessons to be learned from how discrimination has affected this community in the past, lessons which can inform how we address discrimination in the future. I am committed to ensuring that all people in Ireland feel they are free to live their lives as they choose, regardless of ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, disability or ability. It is now 25 years since the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 was passed. Our society has changed hugely in the meantime. The Ireland of today is a more open society. LGBTI people are free to express their identity without fear of losing their jobs or their families. We are a young State in relative terms. We are still moving forward to achieve the type of progress that is both appropriate and necessary. Ensuring a free and fair society is an ongoing responsibility for the Government and, indeed, for all of us in these Houses. Human rights must be established and protected. As Minister for Justice and Equality, I, alongside the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and my Government colleagues, pledge to work to ensure that all members of our society feel they are valued and that the legislation in place will protect all against discrimination.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">We can and should learn the lessons of the past 25 years as to how a society can advance to become more inclusive and diverse and, most importantly, how it can be a society of which we can all be proud.</p>

          <p eId="para_757">I am delighted to be back here this evening. I thank the officials and the Chair for allowing me to come back in. We have come to the Minister, Deputy Ross, numerous times on this Bill. Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom a rá, the reason we are back here is that the Bill was recommitted and the reason for that is the approach of the Minister. The Attorney General described his judicial appointments Bill as a dog's dinner and this Bill is a sow's breakfast. Normally, sows eat everything and this is a bit of everything. It is a mishmash. It is readjusted and renamed. Different amendments were tabled by the Minister himself which we were not allowed to discuss on Committee Stage. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and I are still awaiting an apology for being described as road traffic terrorists. I am still waiting for an apology, not for me for being called a you-know-what, but for my daughter, whom the Minister knows well. He should know better than to use that kind of language in company. However, I am big enough to understand that we are not going to get that.</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> What we should have, at least, is some meaningful engagement from the Minister regarding what he is trying to achieve. We are all with him on many aspects of road safety. Goodness knows, we have had a terrible past week to ten days on our roads. Many of the issues the Minister is talking about here, however, were not involved at all. He has tunnel vision in the direction of soft targets when he should be dealing with a plethora of issues affecting driving conditions across all forms of transports, from sulkies, which are illegal, to bicycles, cars, vans, buses, trains, trams and taxis. The longer the Bill goes on, the more we hear. This week, the train drivers and rail worker unions have appealed for their own safety to be protected while they are at work. I condemn out of hand anyone who attacks any person on public transport. Yesterday morning, we saw people consuming excessive amounts of alcohol before boarding planes. Public servants have a tough job and they must be supported. The legislation, however, is not supportive. It is draconian, discriminatory and inherently unfair to L plate and young drivers, especially in the rural areas represented by myself, Deputy Healy-Rae and our group of Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> There are long delays for driving tests. I have the details here. Even where one has an appointment for a test, it may be dismissed on arrival for the silliest of reasons. If one fails, there should be advisory fail matters in the way there are in the NCT process for certain mechanical defects in a vehicle. I am trying not to be repetitive. Young people have to take lessons. They have to procure a vehicle, which is an expense, and insurance costs are massive. It is obligatory to take 12 lessons, a measure which I support. Young people are now much better prepared for the driving test than I was when I took mine all those years ago. Certainly, they are more prepared than those who benefited from the amnesty when licences were given out to people without a test because the numbers were too great to deal with. The Minister will not accept amendments, but he will have to put in place some mechanism to allow people to get a test within a reasonable time, namely, within two or three weeks. In my county, there is a five-month waiting list, and if something is wrong, a person might be sent home and the test cancelled. I condemn totally those who fail to turn up for scheduled tests without notifying the test centre in advance. That is a waste of time. There is a serious problem, however, with a testing regime in which a person cannot get a test for five months, and if he or she fails for what ought to be an advisory matter, that person prohibited from reapplying for one month.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> Tomorrow is the last day of the leaving certificate for most people. Many of those young people will want to get expertise and a taste of the career they might wish to pursue in college or elsewhere. They might like to get work experience. They can get it given the huge shortages of labour in the hotels sector and among contractors and farmers. How will they get to work, however? Cad a dhéanfaimid feasta gan adhmad? Tá deireadh na gcoillte ar lár. Cad a dhéanfaimid feasta gan charr? Tá daoine ag fanacht sa tír, abandoned, if they do not have a car and live in Hollyford, Carrick-on-Suir, Emly or, indeed, in the villages in the hinterland of Nenagh. They will be unable to get to work or to college without a car. They cannot walk outside as one can from Leinster House to find hundreds of taxis and dozens of buses. If a person is stuck, he or she can use his or her card to take a Dublin bike to cycle home. There is the DART to take a person out to the Minister's country in Bray. We do not have that in Tipperary. As such, the legislation is inherently unfair and it discriminates against rural dwellers and L plate drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> My children and those of my neighbours want to get on in life and continue their education, get a taste of work or of the careers on which they might like to embark. The Minister, however, is condemning them to a life of wastefulness. Their guardians, parents or siblings cannot leave work to be their accompanying drivers at 7 a.m. or at 10 p.m. coming home. I am all for curfews. I do not want them driving around recklessly to discos or parties. I want them to be able to get valuable work experience and to facilitate their families who are hard-pressed as it is. Many people in my county experienced savage rent increases from our reckless county council only this week. They are trying to put their kids through education to give them a good start in life. Tús maith, leath na hoibre. A good start is half the job. The Minister is not listening to any of us or to what we are saying. I am opposed fundamentally to the Minister condemning the young people of rural Ireland to a lesser ability to achieve their full potential in life.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_763"> "That Dáil Éireann:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_764">recognises that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_765">— the Dublin Fire Brigade (DFB) has been providing crucial ambulance services to the citizens of Dublin City and County since 1898;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_766">— DFB now operates with life-saving equipment and over 800 trained firefighter/paramedics working to provide immediate medical assistance to members of the public in need of treatment, 24/7, 365 days a year; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_767">— staff must be lauded for their ability to respond to thousands of emergency calls across the capital every year;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_768">accepts that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_769">— there are concerns that the Health Service Executive is seeking to remove the delivery of Dublin's ambulance service from DFB and instead merge the service with the National Ambulance Service;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_770">— such a proposal could have a huge negative impact on the delivery of services from the DFB call centre; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_771">— removing any element of DFB's fire-based Emergency Medical Service (EMS) system will have an adverse effect on safeguarding those in our community; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_772">calls on the Government to commit to:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_773">— the provision of full support for the almost 1,000 personnel employed, to maximise service delivery and provide greater efficiency to protect those in fire stations across Dublin who provide a full-time fire, rescue, and ambulance service which serves the whole community;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_774">— the design of a direct funding mechanism and the required additional capacity due to the increased population, to allow DFB to continue to operate all areas of their fire-based EMS; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_775">— the full retention of ambulance services provided by DFB across Dublin."</p>
          <p eId="para_776">I wish to share time with my colleagues, Deputies Haughey, Darragh O'Brien and Curran. I will take six minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> I welcome the members of Dublin Fire Brigade emergency medical service, EMS, who are in the Gallery in numbers and who are outside Dáil Éireann tonight, and commend and thank them and their colleagues who throughout the capital - and of course, members of the National Ambulance Service throughout the country - keep us safe and respond so speedily and efficiently, and often heroically, in the service of their fellow citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> It is not a cliché to say we are disappointed on this side of the House to see that the Minister for Health is not here. I suppose that makes its own statement to those in the Gallery, those watching outside and those reading the accounts of this debate, in demonstration of the seriousness or otherwise with which the Government takes this motion from this side of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> My colleagues on this side of the House hope that this will be the last occasion on which this matter needs to feature on the Dáil agenda. My colleagues, Deputies Darragh O’Brien and Seán Haughey in this House, and Senators Clifford-Lee and Ardagh in the Seanad, have raised this matter repeatedly and will continue to raise it because no progress has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> No progress has been made in spite of the subject being previously raised during Private Members' business, Topical Issues and parliamentary questions, and that is merely within the Houses of the Oireachtas. No progress has been made in spite of a review group and an expert panel having been established to resolve the issue. That expert panel was made up in part of eminent servants of this city and State and the great bulk of its findings were accepted by all sides to this discussion with very little left to settle.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> The Minister for Health, in correspondence, has suggested that there are no plans to allow Dublin Fire Brigade EMS to be taken over by the HSE. The Minister is also suggesting that he will support calls to consider future funding mechanisms. I welcome both of these sentiments. However, so much time has passed on this issue, and so many reviews and reports have been done without any action that the Minister, who is not here, will forgive me for being sceptical. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, will accept my scepticism in his place.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> I have to ask why the Minister of State at the Department of Health is even responding for the Government on this issue and ask why the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is not here in her place because Dublin City Council is funded in part by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. The Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service ought to be funded by that Department but it is not, and on this side of the House we will not be satisfied until the Minister of State present here tonight confirms that the future funding mechanisms that the senior Minister has in mind refer to the transfer of the funding of Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service from the Department of Health to the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government. The Taoiseach, in his time as Minister for Health, reinforced this fact in a Seanad debate in 2015, only three years ago, when he stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_783">[T]he Dublin ambulance service has been provided by Dublin Fire Brigade under fire services legislation. Statutory responsibility for this service, therefore, rests [...] within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">However, here we have the charade again of where the Minister for Health and his Minister of State are taking the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> This is about a number of key issues, not least of which are patient safety and a patient-centred approach to emergency response. We support the overriding importance of a person-centred response by emergency services in Dublin and that is why we so strongly support the retention of the fire-based emergency medical service in the hands of Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> When we examine the Government's assertion that there is no threat to Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service, the facts do not support it. The passage of time does not support it. Dublin Fire Brigade certainly does not support the assertion. Events do not support it. Action does not support it. Ministerial and Government inaction, unfortunately, reinforces the opposite view.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> In spite of the Minister's reassurances, there is compelling evidence that the retention of this service within Dublin City Council and, therefore, within the realm of Dublin Fire Brigade is under threat. We recall the HSE plan in 2013 - the first attempt to absorb the services of Dublin Fire Brigade into the HSE. An implementation plan was drawn up — that is an incontrovertible fact. However, for the fact that its existence was leaked to a national newspaper, we do not know where we would be regarding this argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> Around the same time, Dublin City Council and the Dublin Fire Brigade were put on notice effectively that funding for the service was in question. The demand by the HSE to have one national call centre dispatching ambulances and fire services was the next attempt to strangle Dublin Fire Brigade. The idea that a chief fire officer would cede control, and more importantly, responsibility for responding to and dispatching personnel to incidents makes no common sense. Case history informs us that the national call centre does not always dispatch the Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service, even when it is more proximate to an incident than other services. For that reason, the Minister is correct that current call-taking arrangements represent an unacceptably high patient safety risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> Added to this is a recent warning from SIPTU of staffing issues in the National Emergency Operations Centre, NEOC. The headquarters of the NEOC is apparently down 35 workers. If one has an agency of State, that initiated a process, developed that process into an implementation plan for absorbing another service into its own realm and won the support of the so-called custodians of the very same service they were meant to uphold and protect, controlling the budget and unwilling to divest itself of it, which then wants to control the very means by which Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance gets to do its work, which is through calls, then there are at least grounds for suspecting that someone does not want one around.</p>

          <p eId="para_790">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this motion which aims to ensure that the full emergency services provided by Dublin Fire Brigade across the city and county remain as they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> Dublin Fire Brigade, as the House will be aware, has been providing ambulance and emergency services for 120 years. It is worth putting on the record my own personal appreciation for the work that the men and women of Dublin Fire Brigade carry out on a daily basis. Too often, we take them for granted. We see incidents where they put their lives at risk to look after the welfare of the people of this city and I want to acknowledge the work they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> The Minister has indicated that there is no threat to the future of Dublin Fire Brigade and the ambulance service it provides but the evidence, as put forward by my colleague, indicates the contrary. Last year Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service responded to 115,000 calls. I do not want to get bogged down in the numbers but to make the point that the level of service being operated by Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service in the capital is growing significantly year on year.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> The ambulance service operated by Dublin Fire Brigade benefits from the fact that the firefighters are also all trained paramedics. There are 830 of them. That is quite different than many other ambulance services. We have seen reports on the fire service and ambulance service indicating that the standard in Dublin is second to none. Internationally, it is acknowledged to have one of the highest standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> When we look at the level of funding provided, we must question the Government's actions. In 2017, the National Ambulance Service saw an increase in its funding. I know this because I asked the relevant parliamentary questions at the time. However, Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service did not receive such an increase. In fact, it did not receive an increase in 2017, 2016 or 2015. That leads me to ask the following question.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">At a time when the National Ambulance Service is seeing an increase in funding, at a time when the activity, requirement, demand and call-out activity is growing, why is it that the ambulance service operated by Dublin Fire Brigade, funded by the HSE through Dublin City Council is not seeing a marked increase in funding as well? There is an issue there and while the Minister has said it is not his intention and there is no plan to merge the ambulance services, he is not demonstrating it in terms of the funding levels. The questions have to be asked and I specifically ask the Minister of State to look at them.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> Dublin Fire Brigade operates a fleet of 12 ambulances at the moment as I understand it, which is four fewer than it should have. There is a funding deficit. Some of the deficit is clearly made up by the city council but it is insufficient in terms of direct funding from the HSE. Why is it that the HSE is funding Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance services? Why is it not the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment directly rather than the HSE? If those issues were addressed they would allay some of the fears but the concern, as I have demonstrated clearly, is that the funding level to Dublin Fire Brigade's ambulance service has not kept pace with the National Ambulance Service over the last few years. Those concerns need to be addressed in the Minister of State's response to assure the members of Dublin Fire Brigade who are providing an excellent service for the people of our city that the service they are providing will be maintained, enhanced and supported by the Members of this House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Haughey<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_797">Dublin Fire Brigade provides emergency ambulance services in Dublin city and county by arrangement between Dublin City Council and the National Ambulance Service of the HSE. Dublin Fire Brigade has a proud tradition of providing the fire-based ambulance service in the capital. International best practice indicates that combining fire rescue and emergency services greatly improves the response to a crisis. A total of 830 Dublin Fire Brigade firefighters, men and women, are trained paramedics. They are available to provide immediate, emergency medical assistance and the benefits of this integrated service should not be underestimated. Dublin Fire Brigade has been providing the ambulance service in the Dublin area since 1898.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> Dubliners are rightly proud of their fire brigade and ambulance service and regard it with great affection. The chief executive of Dublin City Council, Owen Keegan, has stated that he wishes to see a transfer of all call taking and dispatching for ambulances to the national control centre in Tallaght. He has also stated that this has been agreed by the chief executives of the other Dublin local authorities and the HSE. Three reports have been commissioned recently on the ambulance service: the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, report published in December 2014, a joint review by the HSE and Dublin City Council of the Dublin ambulance service, and the independent Lightfoot Solutions review. I suggest that there are flaws in all of these reports and conflicts of interest in some cases. The Minister of State should be very conscious of that. The then Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, informed the Seanad on 10 March 2015 that staff in Dublin Fire Brigade would be fully consulted before any changes were implemented. Such a consultation has clearly not taken place. Dublin City Council recently passed a motion to the effect that the elected members in all the Dublin local authorities and on the regional assembly should be consulted about any proposed changes. During the same debate on 10 March 2015, the then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, also clarified the position on statutory responsibility for the Dublin ambulance service.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> The provisions of the motion speak for themselves. There are two statutory providers of emergency ambulance services and they should both receive equal treatment and parity of esteem. Concerns in the HIQA report in particular have to be addressed. The solution is not to transfer the call taking and dispatch functions from the Dublin Fire Brigade centre in Townsend Street to the National Ambulance Service centre in Tallaght. In my view, a technical solution, using technology and IT to bring about the necessary co-ordination between the call centres is possible and should be positively examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> There is also the major issue of governance in Dublin Fire Brigade. It must be accepted that Dublin Fire Brigade services are provided under fire services legislation. Therefore, statutory responsibility for these services rests with Dublin City Council and ultimately the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. The HSE and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, must look at this governance issue and accept what I have just said on that. As a result of the governing practice that is in place, Dublin Fire Brigade is being starved of resources and capacity and this is putting citizens at risk. A direct funding mechanism for Dublin Fire Brigade must be put in place. The expert panel on pre-hospital emergency care services in Dublin published its report in December 2015. These findings should be implemented in order to resolve the problems. Why is there no political will to do this? Why has this issue dragged on for so long?</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> Consultation is required under the provisions of section 32 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1993 which states that there must be consultation with local councillors in the four Dublin local authorities and the regional assembly. These procedures have not been followed in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> I will make one concluding remark. Our motion is no reflection on the personnel working in the National Ambulance Service. All we are asking for is that there is parity of esteem between the two statutory agencies in the delivery of these services. If it is not broken do not fix it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Darragh O'Brien<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_803">I welcome the members of Dublin Fire Brigade who are here with us this evening in the Gallery and I welcome the many that I met earlier today. It has been a pleasure for me over the last four or five years to work with both current and retired members of Dublin Fire Brigade. My colleagues have covered in detail a lot of the items within our motion. I ask the Minister of State directly that this be the last time that we debate this issue. I have raised this on numerous occasions. We need to make sure that a clear message goes out from the Dáil tomorrow and this evening that Dáil Éireann supports the operation of Dublin Fire Brigade, the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service and the fire-based emergency medical system.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> What we have in Dublin is being replicated in other cities across Europe and we have a city manager and people within the HSE tinkering with something that is working. Worse than tinkering, they are starving it in certain instances. My colleague, Deputy John Curran, has dealt with the funding aspects of the matter. We should be further expanding Dublin Fire Brigade's role within the greater Dublin area and looking at how it can be expanded into our other cities across the country, not restricting it. This is not a question of the National Ambulance Service or Dublin Fire Brigade. It never has been and those who seek to sow those divisions are being disingenuous at best. This is about the safety of the citizens of Dublin city and county. No more can we allow the foot dragging from this Government and the last Government. This is the last time this should be addressed. We need to ensure that Dublin Fire Brigade is resourced properly and that a clear statement goes out that there will be no unpicking of its independence and autonomy. We cannot have a system such as has been proposed in the HIQA report. I wrote a detailed letter to the Department of Health on 27 March 2018 highlighting a number of my concerns around the expert report and I use the word "expert" loosely in this regard. That letter has not been responded to yet. Answers given under freedom of information to private citizens contained more information than answers I got by way of parliamentary questions and that is simply not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> I want to move on in a positive vein in one respect because we want this issue resolved. I welcome the fact that the Government will not only not be opposing this Fianna Fáil motion but it will be supporting it. The Minister of State might confirm that in her response. If that is the case, that is a significant step forward. I spoke with the Minister, Deputy Harris, this evening and I suggested to him that after the planning of this motion I would sit down with him to work on the next steps forward. Our colleagues in Dublin Fire Brigade want to know what will happen next. A motion and debate in the Dáil and ventilation of the issues are good and well but the Fianna Fáil Party and I want to see a roadmap forward to investing in Dublin Fire Brigade. At the moment there should be 133 firefighters and paramedics and 36 officers on duty at all times maintaining front-line fire appliances. However, there were only 129 and 29 officers due to start work last night. There is a deficit in staff and appliances. We need at least another four ambulances within the service and we should be proud of the service that is there. This is a win win for the Government and the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">We need to send out a clear statement from this House that Mr. Owen Keegan and the executive of DCC do not run our fire service and they do not make policy. The Dáil makes policy and makes decisions on behalf of the people who elect us. Thousands of families in Dublin, including my own, have had experience of being looked after by the members of the DFB. The members of the fire brigade and their families do not deserve to be denigrated, to have funding withdrawn, or to have their service run down. They are immensely committed to their job and they have no down time whatsoever. They look after us 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It behoves Government to look after them now and for the Dáil to speak with one voice to ensure we invest in Dublin Fire Brigade, its staff, crews and paramedics. I hope the Dáil agrees unanimously with the Fianna Fáil motion and early next week moves forward with an implementation plan to ensure this service remains one of the best in Europe and that we further invest in the service.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineByrne" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health" eId="spk_378">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Catherine Byrne)<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_807">I welcome the men and women from Dublin Fire Brigade who are in the Visitors Gallery. I am taking this motion on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, who, unfortunately, cannot be here this evening. It is not any criticism of the Minister because I have a detailed reply to the Deputies and we may be able to settle some of the problems we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> On behalf of the Minister, I accept the motion. I join Deputies across the House to commend the DFB for the excellent ambulance service it provides to the people of Dublin. The Dublin fire brigade has a long and very proud tradition of emergency medical service provision, which the Government is pleased to acknowledge. I assure the House that there are no plans afoot to remove responsibility for the delivery of Dublin's ambulance services from the fire brigade. I fully agree that any such move would have a negative impact on service delivery. Services would likely grind to a halt because the NAS does not have the capacity to take over the provision of emergency ambulance services in Dublin. Even if we wanted all such ambulance services to be provided by the NAS, that would not be achievable.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> We are dependent on the approximately 800 men and women, dual qualified paramedic firefighters, who comprise the DFB workforce. I am happy that the fire brigade's Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC, registered paramedics are available to the HSE through a service arrangement. That workforce is a wonderful resource for all of us. They have been trained at the expense of the State and there is no reason whatsoever to think that the State might decide that we no longer require their expertise and their services. It is difficult to recruit trained paramedics; as in other medical disciplines we struggle to retain paramedic staff. Over recent years we have provided increased funding to the NAS to recruit and train additional paramedics and we will need to do so for many years to come. Even if we had unlimited funding, we would be unable to recruit at the level we require and, therefore, we need to do so on a phased basis. With the best will in the world, the NAS could not recruit at the level necessary to displace the DFB paramedic workforce and so cannot, and will not, take ownership of Dublin emergency ambulance service provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> The Government is mindful of the great service that has been provided down through the years by the fire brigade and long may that service continue. As a former Lord Mayor of this city, it was a privilege to work with DFB. Its members were the escorts of the Lord Mayor and continue to do their duty on a daily basis to support the Lord Mayor in his or her role. The fire brigade provides emergency ambulance services in Dublin city and county by arrangement between DCC and the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> The NAS also provides some emergency capacity in the greater Dublin area, as well as non-emergency patient transport. Over the years, funding issues have arisen between the HSE and DCC. It is timely to look again at how the funding arrangements between the two organisations work in an effort to ensure the service is put on a sound financial footing. The city council should be appropriately reimbursed for ambulance services provided on behalf of the HSE. In recent times there has been much improved co-ordination between the NAS and the fire brigade, particularly in respect of operations and clinical governance. I want both organisations to continue to work together to develop and improve ambulance service provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> In that regard, we must address the current patient safety risk that prevails because of the existence of two separate call and dispatch centres in Dublin. Emergency 999 or 112 ambulance calls made in Dublin are transferred by the emergency call answering service to either the Dublin Fire Brigade east region communication centre or to the NAS's national emergency operations centre, NEOC, depending on where in Dublin the call originated. The NEOC in Tallaght is a state-of-the-art ambulance call centre which uses up to date digital telephony technology and bespoke computers to aid dispatch. The technology allows staff to have visibility of all NAS ambulance resources and, therefore, it can be guaranteed that the nearest available resource will always be dispatched by the service. The NEOC takes calls for the entire country apart from the Dublin area, and it also has a resilience site in Ballyshannon. If there are any difficulties in Tallaght for example, a power outage, the Ballyshannon centre will take over all call taking and dispatch operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> A clinical hub went live in the NEOC in March 2018 and provides an alternative model of care for some patients. Certain low acuity calls are now transferred to the hub and the caller receives medical advice from nurses over the phone, and this may remove the need to dispatch an ambulance. Emergency calls for ambulances in the Dublin area are managed from the Dublin Fire Brigade control room in Townsend Street, Dublin. Fire brigade personnel take calls and dispatch resources for both ambulance and fire services. However, the analogue telephony system in Townsend Street is outdated and in need of replacement; calls are dispatched over the radio.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> DFB has 12 ambulances and 21 fire appliances are available to be dispatched as first responders. In cases where the fire brigade does not have a resource available or where the resources are deemed to be too far away the call may be stacked to await a resource or telephone contact is made with the NEOC with a request that the NAS responds to the call. While mechanisms to transfer calls between the call centres exist this, by its nature, carries inherent risks and can give rise to delays, with potentially adverse implications for patients. In addition, each provider only has visibility of its own resources and, therefore, it is not possible to ensure the nearest available resource is dispatched to emergency calls in the Dublin area. Data from the NAS indicates that DFB requests for its assistance can be in the region of 1,000 per week. Sometimes the fire brigade passes calls in batches which presents challenges to the NAS in prioritising batched calls. This highlights that change is required in ambulance call taking and dispatch arrangements in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> Since the 1990s a number of reports have raised concerns about the existence of two call and dispatch centres in Dublin. The 1993 report of the review on ambulance services proposed that the two organisations should function as a single entity using a single command and control facility. A subsequent review was conducted in 2001 and that also promoted a single command and control centre and no duplication of services. In 2007, the city council and the HSE conducted a comprehensive review which identified 15 key recommendations. These were underpinned by the principle that any member of the public or health professional should have a single point of contact with the emergency ambulance services serving Dublin city and county and that they receive a response from the nearest appropriate emergency care resource in the shortest time.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">Once again, an integrated command and control unit was advocated. In 2014, a review of the pre-hospital emergency care services was undertaken by the Health Information and Quality Authority. The report found that the NAS and DFB were not integrated, and identified poor levels of co-operation between both entities which was not always in the best interests of the patient.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> I am pleased to note that in the following review in 2017, HIQA found evidence of a much better relationship between the NAS and the fire brigade. However, HIQA identified a high risk in respect of Dublin ambulance services stemming from overall capacity deficit and arrangements for call-handling and dispatch. HIQA warned that the current arrangements in place can result in high numbers of potential life-threatening calls being queued by DFB rather than receiving an immediate response. I imagine the House will agree that these successive independent reports over the decades highlight the urgent need for change in the call and dispatch function for ambulance services in the Dublin region.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> The NAS has undergone a significant process of reform and modernisation in recent years. Several important service initiatives and developments have taken place. The significant reform programme aims to reconfigure the management and delivery of pre-hospital emergency care services, and includes plans to develop alternative pathways of care such as hear-and-treat clinical hubs and see-and-treat models as well as transferring patients to alternative destinations for treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> I want the people of Dublin to reap the benefits of these developments and innovations. However, as things currently stand, they do not. Dublin is the only area in the country where we cannot guarantee that the nearest available resources will be dispatched. Callers from certain parts of Dublin do not have access to clinical hubs.</p>

          <p eId="para_828">I warmly welcome the motion, which Sinn Féin enthusiastically supports. While I thank the Minister of State for attending, it is disappointing that neither the Minister for Health or the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government were available given the importance of the issue. Perhaps one or other of them might be in the House to wrap up the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> I echo the comments of others. The men and women of Dublin Fire Brigade save lives and we cannot say that often enough. They do so by putting their own lives at extraordinary risk. I welcome the members of DFB to the Gallery, and on behalf of the constituents I represent, I thank them for continuing to put their lives at risk to keep us safe.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> The motion is similar to motions that have been passed unanimously by several Dublin local authorities, which gives a sense of the strong feeling among many political parties on the matter. The motion speaks to several significant concerns. One concern is that Dublin City Council does not see the fire brigade as a core service. Another concern is that the HSE wants to absorb the emergency medical services. A further concern is that the funding mechanisms are cumbersome and that DFB has not received its fair share of the increase in funding in recent times. Crucially, there are concerns over the proposed transfer of call-taking from fire brigade to the national control centre in Tallaght. Certainly, this proposal is one the fire services staff I spoke to earlier believe could cost lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> What surprises me most of all, however, is that all these concerns fly in the face of the recommendations from the expert panel. The Minister of State rightly listed several reports from 2007 to the present. However, she did not mention the report of the expert group established to work out how best to respond to the concerns of the HIQA report. The fact that it was not mentioned suggests, notwithstanding Government support, the call of Deputy Darragh O'Brien for the Government to enthusiastically embrace the recommendations of this motion, which I fully support, has yet to surface.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> I will outline the key issues I want to raise. The expert group recognised the validity of the two models of ambulance service and it called for parity of esteem among them. It called for full financing for the two services to be derived from the two lead Departments as well as greater co-operation, co-ordination, governance and clinical governance between the two providers. Crucially, the report called for the maintenance of call taking and dispatch of both services. What all of us would like to hear today is that the Government supports the recommendations of that expert group. What was the point of the city council setting up an expert group and giving it this work if it would not accept the recommendations? Since it seems the council does not fully support them at management level, it is time for the Government to step in and join the rest of us in calling on the council to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> The Government should do more than allow the motion to pass. It should ensure that those recommendations become core Government policy. Let us send a clear signal to Mr. Owen Keegan, Dublin City Council and the HSE to the effect that what they are currently trying to do is unacceptable and that we want a properly funded Dublin Fire Brigade with an emergency medical service and adequate funding. This will ensure that the men and women who put their lives at risk on a daily basis can continue to do so with full Government support and resourcing.</p>

          <p eId="para_834">I welcome the members of Dublin Fire Brigade and my former colleagues from the union to the debate. I thank Fianna Fáil for tabling the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> The fire brigade does fantastic work. Much of this work goes unseen but that does not mean it is not important. The motion states that DFB has been providing crucial ambulance services to the citizens of Dublin city and county since 1898. Today the fire brigade provides immediate medical assistance 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Those who have been rescued, saved or transferred by the DFB cannot speak highly enough of them. I have in mind my grandmother. She is not with us anymore, but when the time came and she needed to be transferred to hospital, she was transferred by the DFB. Our family will be forever grateful for the care and compassion the personnel showed us.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> Dublin Fire Brigade has the knowledge and experience to continue to deliver a full range of services to the capital. The provision of a fire-based ambulance service is regarded internationally as best practice. Combining fire, rescue and emergency services greatly improves the response to a crisis. There must be full support not only for the service but for the personnel who deliver that service. Instead of attacking the service, we need to maximise service delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> I echo what has been said by other Deputies. It is unfortunate that none of the senior Ministers could find time in their schedule to be present. I hope that does not send a negative message to the people who are in the Gallery or those who are outside.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> There should be no barrier for staff in the DFB from career progression. We need to enhance the service and attract men and women to the service and ensure they can access continuing professional development.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> I welcome the Minister of State's comment that she believes it is timely to look again at how the funding arrangements between the two organisations work as well as how to put the service on a sound financial footing. However, we need to understand what exactly this means to have confidence that the great service provided by the men and women of the fire brigade to the people of Dublin will continue.</p>

          <p eId="para_840">Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil dóibh siúd a chuir an rún os comhair an Tí anocht, ach go háirithe na fir agus mná Briogáid Dóiteáin Bhaile Átha Cliath, mar thar na blianta, thug siad cuidiú, ní hamháin domsa agus do mo chlann ach do gach uile duine sa chathair seo a bhí i gcruachás agus a tháinig an briogáid dóiteáin chucu agus a thug cabhair cáime dóibh nuair a bhí gá ann, ach go háirithe i mo theanta féin ar an gCarnán nó fiú lasmuigh i dTamhlacht agus Sráid an Phiarsaigh, bhuail mé leo thar na blianta agus bhí siad an-mhaith, an-phroifisiúnta agus bhí an cuma ar an scéal go raibh siad ag caitheamh go maith lena chéile agus nach raibh aon choimhlint eatarthu. Ba mhaith liom a rá thar ceann gnáth lucht Bhaile Átha Cliath go bhfuil éacht á dhéanamh acu agus ba chóir go mbeadh siad an-bhródúil as sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> Like others have done, I acknowledge the commitment, dedication, bravery and heroism of the members of the Dublin Fire Brigade, and other fire brigades in the State. I acknowledge the work they do, in many cases without proper resources. The Dublin Fire Brigade has a proud history.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> There is an adage that if it is not broken, do not fix it. The first document I contributed within Sinn Féin was on the Dublin Fire Brigade in 2006. This is how far back there has been an attempt to undermine the Dublin Fire Brigade. I am aware that there are difficulties and that the model does not fit every aspect or requirement of a small island but rather than enhance it and roll out the Dublin Fire Brigade model throughout the State why does the Government want to change it? Why are other cities in other countries looking at the Dublin Fire Brigade model to roll it out? It is because the model works. It fixes people and it saves lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> In comparison to other public services, the retention levels in the Dublin Fire Brigade are high, which is down to the fact that fire fighters are appreciated by the public. The Government started to undermine the service in recent years, and it looked as though the service was to be picked off bit by bit, to become parts of other services or through privatisation as originally intended with the proposed call-out centres and ambulance services. Luckily that attempt was lost in the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> For years I have believed there is a need for a proper roll out of the model, but there is also a need to properly resource the Dublin Fire Brigade. If the Dublin Fire Brigade cannot answer all the calls it is nothing to do with its commitment, it is to do with years of under investment in it. Its members would love to be able to answer each and every call that comes in; that is their focus and their job and it is why they joined the service in this city. It is why they undertook the huge amount of training, which stands to them when they respond to a call out, be it a road traffic accident or a person in difficulty in a house. The Dublin Fire Brigade wants services and ambulances and it wants additional staff, but the brigade has been starved of these resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> The last piece of the Minister of State's contribution, or what she was trying to get at, exposes the Government's intentions which are to give the National Emergency Operations Centre, NEOC, all the medical call outs rather than enhancing the existing service of the Dublin Fire Brigade. If it is broken in Pearse Street, then fix it, or find another location, but do not take away a service that is used for the benefit of Dublin city dwellers.</p>

          <p eId="para_846">Fire fighters with the Dublin Fire Brigade provide fire and emergency medical services to the citizens of Dublin. The Dublin Fire Brigade has more than 800 paramedics offering a world class service to the citizens of Dublin. These skills allow trained Dublin Fire Brigade personnel to assist ambulance and medical personnel in the trauma care of patients particularly for those involved in accidents. Dublin Fire Brigade personnel each day provide care for people with a range of traumas such as spinal injuries, burns, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, broken bones, oxygen therapy, defibrillation and other medical emergencies. Fire brigade personnel arriving at an incident or medical emergency can immediately begin the process of lifesaving because they are trained to do so. Such early intervention by the fire brigade ambulance services is crucial for both medical and trauma patients and gives them a greater chance of survival. When the ambulance service takes over the responsibility for the patient at the scene the fire brigade personnel can then offer a support role to the ambulance service. When the fire service is first to arrive at the scene of an incident, and where there is an injured or seriously ill patient, it is sensible and logical that fire brigade personnel should have the necessary skills and equipment to provide effective treatment and support for the patient until the ambulance services arrive. Having such skills allows fire brigade personnel to provide an effective and rapid response to life threatening medical emergencies, especially in locations where the fire brigade will be able to get to a call more quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> Why is this service so important? If a person has an obstructed airway, he or she will die in less than five minutes. Simply protecting the airway of a seriously ill patient will save his or her life. A defibrillator is most effective if used within four minutes of a cardiac arrest; after eight minutes have elapsed there is only a very small chance of a successful outcome for the patient. In rural areas such a service is very important because of the greater travel times involved and the delays caused by traffic and weather conditions. The Dublin Fire Brigade personnel are trained emergency service professionals and are the ideal people to carry out the function of first responders. They are not there to undermine the ambulance services but to enhance these services. If the Government is not opposing this motion, it is time for this House to send out a clear message to Owen Keegan in Dublin City Council and the HSE saying hands off, we love our fire service, it is a great service, there is no reason it should be undermined and we need more funding for our service.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jan O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_848">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_849">To insert the following after “ambulance services provided by DFB across Dublin.”:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_850">— implement in full the Report of the Expert Panel into Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Services in Dublin, published in December 2015.”</p>
          <p eId="para_851">The Labour Party fully supports the motion as proposed by Fianna Fáil. It is very welcome that there seems to be wholehearted support for it in the Chamber. I hope this means there really will be a strengthening of the resolve to maintain the service of the Dublin Fire Brigade as it is and to properly resource it, which is the main point that is being made here tonight. On behalf of the Labour Party, I propose an addendum, rather than an amendment, to implement in full the report of the expert panel into pre-hospital emergency care services in Dublin, which was published in December 2015. In proposing the addendum, the expert panel has made a detailed report and a detailed study. I believe it would add to the motion and I hope Fianna Fáil will accept it and add it to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> As other Members have already said, the service is not broken. It does not, therefore, need to be fixed. It needs to be strengthened but it certainly does not need to be fixed or changed in any way. There is a unique advantage in the Dublin Fire Brigade that we may not have in other parts of the State in that all Dublin Fire Brigade fire fighters are fully trained paramedics, many of whom are advanced paramedics. When an ambulance is not available, or when it is on its way to a call out, the fire tender crew can support the person who is in need of medical intervention. This is especially useful when attending road accidents. Some of the crew can attend to the casualties while other crew manage traffic or the other duties required. This is a real positive. It also allows for crews to be rotated between fire service ambulance and fire tenders so they are always out on the road responding to calls. This system reduces crew burnout rates and allows crews, through regular application, to keep their skills finely tuned.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> This is a very good and positive service. The one demand and the one need is to have the service properly resourced.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">My understanding is that four more ambulances and their attendant personnel are required.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> The expert group has made a number of detailed recommendations. The group comprised a retired chief fire officer with 40 years of experience, an experienced chartered accountant, a consultant in emergency medicine and a long-term council official. Clearly, they had a level of expertise. In their recommendation on call taking and dispatch, they wrote that, while there were inherent differences in the approach to this work in both organisations, it was the panel's recommendation that the models in both centres be retained. The panel also believed that the transfer of 999 EMS calls from the Dublin Fire Brigade to the national emergency service would have implications for the safe management of such a large increase in the volume of calls to the latter. Critically, the panel considered that the removal of any element of the fire-based EMS model would detrimentally affect the safe delivery of that service by the Dublin Fire Brigade to the patient. However, it recognised that both providers needed to work together. Following technical advice from Mason Advisory, the panel was satisfied that a technology-based solution would address those concerns and enable mobilisation of the nearest available resource without compromising patient safety. This follows on from the HIQA reported that was mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> There are positive recommendations on how the national service and Dublin Fire Brigade could co-operate, but no one is suggesting that the Dublin Fire Brigade should transfer to the national service. The brigade is doing a very good job and Dublin people are satisfied with its work. It is safe compared with services elsewhere and it should be maintained and strengthened.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> I wish to acknowledge a conversation I had with a councillor, Ms Alison Gilliland, chair of Dublin City Council's special committee on fire and ambulance services and emergency management. On behalf of that committee, she has presented motions to the council, as have other councillors.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> We hope that tonight's debate will lead to an assurance that the Dublin Fire Brigade will continue delivering its excellent service and that it will be adequately resourced to do its important job.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Ryan<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_859">I thank Fianna Fáil for tabling this motion on the most important of issues. The provision of fire safety and critical ambulance services is something that cannot remain unresolved and in limbo. Fire brigade personnel have been in a permanent state of industrial unrest for more than three years. It is not their fault, but the fault of the Dublin City Council CEO and a lack of leadership from the Government. It is a testament to the commitment of the Dublin Fire Brigade to the citizens of Dublin that its industrial unrest has not resulted in large-scale industrial action. We welcome this motion as an opportunity to bring home to the Government the need to resolve these issues once and for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> We are lucky in Dublin to have two ambulance services, one run by the National Ambulance Service, NAS, and one run by the Dublin Fire Brigade. We are especially lucky to be served by the latter. The Dublin Fire Brigade offers a combined service of fire and paramedics, which is a global standard used by 97% of the major cities in the US. We sometimes look at other countries' practices and lament that we do not have them as well, but we have had this service for 120 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> The calls in the motion must be delivered upon. We need to see full and demonstrable support for the Dublin Fire Brigade from the Government. We cannot forget the sacrifices made by the Dublin Fire Brigade when the country was in an economic crisis. It implemented cost saving measures through internal agreement. Difficult measures were agreed upon between workers and management without ever affecting the vital service those workers provided to our city and county. We must not forget that. In this era of distrust in public bodies and institutions and when scandals emerge in many corners of our society, the Dublin Fire Brigade remains an organisation that is trusted by the majority of Dubliners. We cannot put a price on that, and this trust must not be damaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_862"> As per the Labour Party amendment, we ask that the Government and the House support the Dublin Fire Brigade. We ask that the Government implement the recommendations of the pre-hospital emergency care services report, which has been lying on a shelf for three years. Its recommendations need to be implemented immediately. The report's conclusion states that the governance structures as set out previously would provide the Dublin Fire Brigade and the NAS the autonomy to plan strategically and develop operations and training to the level required of a professional emergency service. The panel asserted that the removal of any element of the Dublin Fire Brigade's fire-based EMS system would have an adverse effect on patient care and, therefore, it did not support the proposal to transfer call taking and dispatch functions from the Dublin Fire Brigade to the NAS. It was the panel's recommendation that the call taking and dispatch models in both centres be retained.</p>
          <p eId="para_863"> The panel's main recommendations included addressing operational deficiencies within the Dublin Fire Brigade as well as the implementation of an integrated ambulance service by the NAS and Dublin Fire Brigade. The report also highlighted the need for a new funding structure from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government alongside the necessity for individual improvements and collaboration between the two providers in the area of call taking and dispatch.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> We need to implement these recommendations without delay and provide certainty to the workers of the Dublin Fire Brigade, whom I welcome to the Chamber. We need to provide certainty to the people of Dublin city and county, who trust and respect the service provided. People need to be proud of the service, as we in the Labour Party are. I am proud of the fire service workers from my full-time service in the Swords station and my retained service in Balbriggan and Skerries. We want to let them continue the great work they do on behalf of the people of Dublin.</p>

          <p eId="para_865">I welcome the women and men of the Dublin Fire Brigade. They were like a small army on the plinth in this evening's sunshine. We are all proud of them, given their history - fighting recent hotel fires, the accident on Wellington Quay and the Stardust fire, the memory of which is still fresh in our minds 37 years later. There will be an initiative in Croke Park this weekend to campaign once again for real justice following that fire, which has left a mark on the history of this city and the fire brigade.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> When I was a councillor, an expert group was set up in what I believe was an attempt to take the Dublin Fire Brigade out of the control of Dublin City Council dressed up as an examination of the functionality and efficiency of the brigade. Sir Ken Knight was brought over from, I believe, the Manchester region. He was an experienced firefighter who had been knighted for his work and expertise. If memory serves, Dublin City Council spent approximately €100,000 on producing his report, which then sat on a shelf and was never taken down again because Mr. Owen Keegan did not agree with its recommendations. After returning to the system he had worked under in London and beyond, Sir Ken Knight recommended that the efficiencies the Dublin Fire Brigade had achieved with its combined model of paramedics, ambulances and fire engines be applied in Britain because it was such an impressive system. He estimated that he could save approximately £200 million for the British system, but we wasted €100,000 on this expert's report and left it sitting on the shelf to gather dust because Mr. Keegan did not agree with it. As he had done as county manager at Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, he pushed hard to unburden Dublin City Council's budget of the men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade and their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> This is an important point when one considers the language. Mr. Keegan came into the council not as a manager, but as a CEO. He started to make decisions that were not about the health and safety of the city or the interests of the men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade and those whom they served, but about efficiencies and running a corporate entity as opposed to a city with all of its complexities.</p>
          <p eId="para_868"> The men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade consistently fought to defend the system and won.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">Thankfully, they are here tonight for this motion. They are here because that system is under attack again.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> I welcome the Government's recognition of the role played by Dublin Fire Brigade and its endorsement of the motion. Like Deputy Ó Snodaigh, I am a little worried about what it actually means. The Minister of State acknowledged in her speech, copies of which we will give to the firefighters afterwards, "the National Ambulance Service could not recruit at the level necessary to displace the Dublin Fire Brigade paramedic workforce and so cannot, and will not, take ownership of Dublin emergency ambulance service provision." That is a welcome acknowledgement. Dublin Fire Brigade received 7% of the funding that is used to answer 40% of the calls on a national level. Dublin is home to one third of the country's population and the most complex health and safety issues with which those with responsibility in this regard have to deal probably arise. There is evidence that the number of such issues in the city is going to increase. Earlier, we heard reports of the number of accidents and road fatalities increasing again - year on year and month on month - compared with last year. More importantly, episodes relating to climate change, flooding, wind damage, downed cables, falling trees and sea levels rising are going to cause major problems. Throughout the country, not just in Dublin, we have witnessed the heroism of Dublin Fire Brigade and other firefighters and emergency service personnel during recent flood and storm events. These services are going to be required more and more, not less and less.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> In the context of its review, details of which were published in March 2017 and which involved an examination of the progress made in implementing recommendations of pre-hospital emergency care services - in other words, ambulance services - HIQA states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_872">A key finding of this Review relates to the provision of services in Dublin. HIQA found a high level of risk associated with a lack of collective ambulance capacity and arrangements for call handling and dispatch.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">This short, two-page document does not indicate exactly what that teases out but I suspect that the problem with the high level of risk is not associated with the service delivered by Dublin Fire Brigade but rather with the lack of delivery on the part of the HSE. This is not intended as a criticism of the men and women who work in the paramedic ambulance service of the HSE; it is a criticism of the HSE itself. Such criticism is not unusual. In light of the recent scandal relating to CervicalCheck, the HSE is well deserving of criticism. I worry, however, that the criticism is misplaced. The Minister of State indicated that what is proposed is to transfer all ambulance call-taking and dispatch functions to the NEOC such that all such services across the State will be consolidated in one centre. She also said that this is required because the current call-taking arrangements represent an unacceptably high patient safety risk and give rise to delays in the allocation of ambulance resources to patients, including in potentially life-threatening situations. I do not believe that the evidence shows us that this applies to the delivery of service by the men and women of Dublin Fire Brigade. Rather, it applies to the inefficiencies relating to and lack of leadership and, often, mismanagement on the part of the HSE. I want to offer a caution about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> We live in a society where we sometimes forget to talk to the people who know what they are talking about. I refer to those who are out every day in fire stations, on the streets - where major problems can arise - attending accidents, in houses picking up people who are dying or sick and dealing with the impacts of climate change. Unless we talk to them and hear exactly what they have to say about the changes required - if they are required - and how they can be delivered, then we will run into trouble. We will certainly run ourselves into trouble and towards a lesser standard of service delivery if we rely on what I believe to be a broken HSE. The latter has proven, most recently in its handling and mismanagement of health cases of dying women, that it cannot be trusted. That sounds quite dramatic but I am of the view that before any of this is be implemented, we need to talk in a serious way to the men and women of Dublin Fire Brigade and, indeed, to those who are responsible for operating the National Ambulance Service. My brother, who has since passed away, worked for the service. As somebody who was dedicated to his work, for many years he was frustrated that the workers were never listened to when they put across proposals that might help to deliver a better and more efficient service in order to create a better, safer and healthier city for all.</p>

          <p eId="para_875">I support the motion. I thank Fianna Fáil for tabling it. I support it because of the men and women here tonight and their colleagues throughout the fire service and the ambulance service. I am here tonight to state that intention about the motion. I accept the motion and I will talk to the firefighters between now and any vote taking place on Thursday in order to discover what they think. While the Government is accepting the motion in general, there are parts of the response relating to the NEOC with which I am not happy. I reckon the firefighters are not happy with them either. The Joint Committee on Health could possibly set up a subgroup to work with the firefighters and the ambulance service to look at the report from HIQA in order to ensure that the resources the firefighters need are provided. The matter could then be referred back to the Dáil. It should not be placed on the long finger over a period. There should be a time limit of two or three months; whatever is negotiated with the firefighters and the National Ambulance Service workers. That might work. I would like to hear what the firefighters and ambulance service workers have to say about that but the committee could work to move this matter on. I do not think there would be general agreement with the Government's proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> In 2017, 233 people were rescued by Dublin Fire Brigade. Some 43 persons were rescued from fires, 70 river rescues were attended and there were 79 road traffic collision rescues. All full-time firefighters are trained as paramedics and rotate continuously between firefighting and providing emergency medical services. Dublin Fire Brigade's 12 emergency ambulances, of which it needs more, are staffed by paramedics who are available to respond 24 hours a day, 365 days per year. In addition, there are 21 front-line fire appliances, of which more are needed, with up to 120 paramedics available to respond on a daily basis. All full-time firefighters are trained to paramedic standard and are required to maintain Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC, registration as paramedic practitioners. All trained firefighters are trained to an emergency first responder level. Tangible clinical outcomes in 2017, illustrating the work of fire brigade emergency medical service, include: 61,462 patients treated and transported to hospital - that is a huge number; 3,527 critical medical incidents managed; and 435 cardiac arrests manage. Also in 2017, Dublin Fire Brigade assisted in the delivery of 12 pre-hospital childbirths and mobilised in 86,405 emergency ambulance instances. That is a tremendous response from the men and women of these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> I want to make particular reference to Dublin City Council because it has already been alluded to here. In 2014, the HSE had been attempting to take control of the Dublin ambulance service from Dublin Fire Brigade. In March 2014, the director of the HSE's National Ambulance Service was called before Dublin City Council councillors to answer questions about his intentions towards Dublin Fire Brigade's ambulance service. The decision to do this was taken amid growing controversy at the time about a HSE plan - drawn up in 2013 - to take control of Dublin ambulance service from Dublin Fire Brigade by the end of 2015. The plan in question was drawn up in advance of the HSE-Dublin City Council review of the capital's ambulance service, which was announced in February 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">In the same month and year, at a meeting of the council's environment committee, the chief fire officer gave a presentation where he said the major issue for the fire brigade was funding. He said the fire brigade had provided the ambulance service in Dublin since 1898 on behalf of the city council, while the HSE provides for services outside Dublin. The council agrees a figure annually with the HSE. In that year it was approximately €9.8 million. The chief fire officer stated that the fire brigade's 12 ambulances were working at full capacity and even with the backup of 22 fire tenders, which often responded to 999 emergency ambulance call-outs, the brigade was not able to meet HIQA targets due to factors outside its control. Those factors were resources in areas that included ambulances and personnel. The chief fire officer stated that it had been impossible to reach an agreement on a sustainable funding model with the HSE over the years. That was in 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> Members from all parties and none across the council support the fire brigade service. It appears to me that the chief executive officer of Dublin City Council, Owen Keegan, and the HSE are intent on breaking an effective, efficient, state-of-the-art model of service developed over 120 years by removing Dublin Fire Brigade's ability to maintain a full fire-based emergency medical service, EMS. As other speakers have said, the model is working, so why change it? Why not expand it? Why not resource it? Why not satisfy HIQA standards and support the service?</p>
          <p eId="para_880"> In the time remaining I will read an email I received from a firefighter in recent days. He gives a sense of the pride the workers have in the service:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_881">[The Dublin Fire Brigade service which] we in the service are extremely proud of, and have provided to the city for 120 years, is now under a very real threat of been removed from us and the citizens of Dublin. The HSE has proposed the removal of the delivery of this fire/EMS service from the DFB and instead merge the service with the National Ambulance Service. I know first hand the value of Dublin File Brigade providing an ambulance service and having the back up of every firefighter being highly trained in fire, rescue and paramedic or advanced paramedic skills. From a personal point of view, the comfort that I take from knowing that any of the crew members responding to an incident with me, are capable of performing life saving interventions at the scene of an emergency, makes my response a lot easier.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_882"> In today's world, where there is a constant threat of a large scale terrorist attack or even a small scale attack with high casualty numbers, running alongside the normal everyday emergencies, Dublin Fire Brigade is capable of providing in excess of 100 paramedics on-scene within a very short time frame.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_883"> Last year Dublin Fire Brigade Emergency Regional Control Centre processed in excess of 114,000 ambulance calls and 23,576 fire calls. This year to-date the figures are 56,029 for ambulance calls and 9,033 for fire calls. Dublin Fire Brigade has 12 emergency ambulances strategically located throughout the city and county. Our service is at capacity, so not only is full retention of the service an urgent matter but an increase in capacity is also required as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> He goes on to state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_885">The National Ambulance Service, NAS, provides an emergency ambulance service to the whole of the country. At times where Dublin Fire Brigade are at capacity a request is made to the NAS for resources and vice versa, [obviously when needed]. Last year the response from NAS to [the Dublin Fire Brigade] requests for resources was 75% negative, i.e., they could not provide us with an ambulance. The opposite response, where NAS requested resources from the DFB was met with 80% positive response. [That is down to resources and that must be addressed. That is the point the writer of the email is making.]</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_886"> Ambulance calls are categorised in accordance with the priority of the emergency, the most urgent calls are designated Echo calls, with Delta being urgent but not life threatening. Within the DFB response protocols, a fire appliance, staffed by an officer and 4 firefighters-paramedics is automatically dispatched to all Echo calls. Delta calls may also have a fire appliance attached if the situation warrants one. This dual response capability is a key component to our strength as an emergency service and cannot be mimicked by the NAS.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">That point must be taken on board. I would like to hear the response of the workers involved in the direct front line. They are the people who save lives and they are putting their lives at risk. I think we should respect them and resource them properly. I wish to emphasise that point. We should link in with the committee to see whether we can move the issue on and bring the proper services into Dublin and across the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_888">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this motion today. First, I commend the work of the fire brigade service, many of whose members are in the Gallery, on providing a crucial service to the citizens of Dublin city and county. While I am from west Cork, most weeks I spend three days in Dublin and I may well need the fire brigade service at some stage. While tonight's issues are very much focused on the Dublin Fire Brigade service, the west Cork fire brigade service also has problems which need to be highlighted. I will only touch on that briefly today.</p>
          <p eId="para_889"> I disagree with the HSE's proposal to remove the delivery of Dublin's ambulance service from Dublin Fire Brigade and, instead to merge it with the National Ambulance Service. At present, Dublin Fire Brigade has 800 trained firefighter-paramedics to provide immediate medical assistance to members of the public in need of treatment on a 24-7 basis, 365 days a year. If the ambulance service in Dublin is removed from Dublin Fire Brigade it will impact negatively on the delivery of this vital service and have an adverse effect on safeguarding the community of Dublin. Instead, the Government should be looking at ways to maximise service delivery and to provide greater measures to protect the hard-working firemen who risk their lives every day in order to keep others safe.</p>
          <p eId="para_890"> In my area of west Cork, the firefighters do tremendous work also and should be recognised for that. It is a disgrace that Bantry and Bandon fire stations have water tankers that are broken. They must be replaced immediately. Bantry's water tanker was put off the road in February of this year and Bandon's water tanker has been off the road in recent years. A water tanker is a very important asset to a fire service fleet, as it can carry up to 2,000 gallons of water. In many cases when a fire brigade is called out to a fire there is no water fire hydrant and that is when a water tanker is vital. It is outrageous that west Cork currently does not have any water tankers and that the nearest ones are in Mallow and Middleton. In a recent fire at a farm in west Cork, five fire stations had to be called out because of the extent of the fire where there was no hydrant and extra water was needed. They had no water tanker and if they had, all these stations would not have been needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_891"> I will return to the issue at hand. I call on the Government to retain the delivery of Dublin's ambulance service through Dublin Fire Brigade and not to merge Dublin's ambulance service with the National Ambulance Service.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T21:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_892">I am happy to speak on the motion this evening which I support. I compliment my Fianna Fáil colleagues on tabling the motion. I got very worried when I read in the motion that there are concerns that the Health Service Executive is seeking to remove the delivery of Dublin's ambulance service from Dublin Fire Brigade and instead to merge the service with the National Ambulance Service. I agree with the motion that such a proposal could have a hugely negative impact on the delivery of services from the Dublin Fire Brigade call centre and that removing any element of its fire-based emergency medical service, EMS, system will have an adverse effect on safeguarding communities. That is what we are all about here. Our primary duty as elected politicians is to safeguard the people in our communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_893"> How can anyone in this day and age think it is a good or progressive move to merge any service within the fold of a completely dysfunctional HSE or even the National Ambulance Service? The HSE gets more dysfunctional by the hour. It beggars belief that a health service that is so dysfunctional and chaotic would even seek to have such a move sanctioned. However, it would, because it has no shame. We saw today that Professor Hillery resigned. More people will resign and flee from the HSE because it is utterly dysfunctional, power-grabbing, self-serving and unaccountable. There are many good workers on the ground but not at management level. I am afraid that despite the heroic work being performed by ambulance personnel right across the State, the same, sadly, cannot be said of the National Ambulance Service itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_894"> In my county of Tipperary - in Clonmel, Thurles, Cashel, Tipperary town and Nenagh - we only have one ambulance each to cover night duty from Monday to Sunday each week. I do not blame the ambulance crews, drivers or paramedics. I blame management. It is all about management. To hell with the people and to hell with the crews according to the HSE bible. It is absolutely appalling to think that a single ambulance is being provided to cover night duty in each of the towns concerned. The hinterland of the towns could stretch 20 miles up into the mountains of Hollyford, the Galtee Mountains or the Knockmealdowns. The towns are major urban centres, not to mention the surrounding rural localities, which rely on efficient ambulance services.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">I am informed by the NAS that despite recommendations from its first ever capacity review on the urgent need to recruit additional staff, this will only occur over the next four years. This is disgusting and represents a blatant disregard for people's safety and lives and for ambulance crews. This is unacceptable, given the ongoing chaos and numbers attending emergency departments in South Tipperary General Hospital and University Hospital Limerick and the numbers of patients waiting on trolleys. There also seems to be a significant disparity in the level of ambulances and rapid response vehicles that are assigned to day duties for each of these towns. Cashel, Roscrea and Tipperary town, for example, have only one ambulance each, covering duty from Monday to Sunday while Nenagh has one ambulance and an initial rapid response vehicle covering the same time period. </p>
          <p eId="para_896"> The NAS is talking about developing a single, cohesive, strategic plan for ambulance services called Vision 2020 - God help us. Any visions the HSE had are a distant fog on the mountain peaks and are disappearing by the hour. How many more strategies do we need? Given all of this, is it any wonder that Dublin Fire Brigade is terrified of having its ambulance service subsumed within the NAS, never mind the HSE? I salute the members of fire brigade. A good friend of mine from Tipperary, Mr. Michael O'Donnell, is a proud member and he educated me about the fire brigade when I came to Dublin first because I was not aware of the situation with regard to the fire brigade providing an ambulance service. They do an excellent job and as the saying goes, "If it's not broken, don't fix it". We must not allow the HSE to get its greedy and greasy paws on this service. All it wants is prestige and self-preservation and to hell with the people. I salute the Dublin Fire Brigade whose members do their duty gallantly. They always do so when we come up here for All Ireland and other matches. We will not be here this year, unfortunately, but we will be here next year. Comhghairdeas leo go léir.</p>

          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T21:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_897">I welcome the members of Dublin Fire Brigade who are in the Public Gallery and thank them and all of their colleagues throughout the country for the excellent work they do to protect people and property. They attend accidents on our roads and many times they encounter horrendous situations, including in our cities and on our motorways, where lives are lost. The DFB does excellent work. Why we do not leave them alone to continue doing so? When I hear the words "reconfiguration of services", I know that means a reduction in services. We have found that to be the case in Kerry, whereby a so-called reconfiguration of the ambulance service was simply a reduction. In many instances now, it can be an hour or more before an ambulance arrives in parts of Kerry because the service is stretched to the limit. A Tralee-based ambulance that comes out of Cork University Hospital has to press a button to report availability for work and can end up in Kinsale or Kanturk rather than back in Tralee. When that happens, Kerry is left without an ambulance.</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> I thank the ambulance workers for the great work they are doing. I also thank the members of the fire service in Kerry in places like Sneem, Kenmare, Killarney, Tralee and Listowel. They do great work protecting people when fires break out. I saw them at work on the night a local pub was burned down and they did everything they could to save as much property as possible. They do everything really. They do their level best and while they might not really put their lives in danger, they have a tough time. When they are called out, they have to get on the road within minutes. Everything depends on them doing that. We depend on them so much. </p>
          <p eId="para_899"> I ask the Government to leave Dublin Fire Brigade alone and let it continue to do the work it has been doing for the past 50 or 60 years.</p>

          <p eId="para_901">I thank my colleagues, Deputy Lahart, our Dublin spokesperson, and Deputies Darragh O'Brien and Haughey for tabling the motion, which involved a lot of work on their part. I welcome all of the Dublin Fire Brigade workers who are in the Gallery and I thank all of the people who were outside the Dáil earlier who spoke to us. Unfortunately, I did not see any Government representatives there today but I know that the front-line workers would have liked to engage with members of Fine Gael and with Independent members of Government. I met many members of the fire brigade last weekend at Huntstown Community Centre. They brought with them the true spirit of DFB. They were out in the community, teaching and engaging with children and providing a community service. That might not be valued under the HSE's key performance indicator index or the various outputs of the Department of Health but we must value DFB as a community service first and foremost, which is not recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> Last year, I visited Blanchardstown fire station which covers a wide area, including Dublin west and beyond. I spoke with workers there who are disillusioned with this Government's offer of what can only be described as qualified support. I read the speech delivered by the Minister of State. While the Government accepts the motion, it is only doing so on a qualified basis. Why does the Government not offer full support to the workers in Dublin Fire Brigade? It would have been worthwhile for members of Government to have met the men and women of the fire brigade and heard what they have to say on this important matter. They understand the issues at play much better than the Minister of State or anyone in the Department of Health. This is important because we are talking about life and death and people in an incredibly vulnerable situation getting the necessary care in an emergency. It is as stark as that. </p>
          <p eId="para_903"> I firmly believe in the old adage, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". Regrettably, there are plenty of things broken in Ireland today. We have a housing and homelessness crisis, with more than 3,000 children homeless, and we do not have many solutions from Government. No one can claim the health service is operating well and that the HSE is fit for purpose to deliver healthcare. However, it wants to absorb a service that is working well and is not broken. We have chaos in the Department of Justice and Equality, teachers who cannot pay their rent and a massive haemorrhaging of personnel in the Defence Forces. The Government is again not fixing something that is broken. The elderly are struggling to get by on a week-to-week basis because their pensions are being raided. These issues require fixing now. These are the issues upon which the Government should focus on rather than only offering qualified support to the workers in DFB. </p>
          <p eId="para_904"> Dublin Fire Brigade provides an exemplary, world class ambulance service which saves lives on a daily basis and has done so for more than 100 years. The men and women of the fire brigade know what they are doing. They provide a stellar service 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year. They operate such a good model that other countries have tried to replicate it. A person who has a heart attack in Dublin is more likely to survive than in most other cities in the world. This is precisely because our firefighters are all trained paramedics. Reports have found that we rank second in the world in terms of recovery from heart attacks. Only Seattle performed better and that city studied the Dublin model when designing its own system. This is one of the few areas in which we are a world leader and the Government should not try to undo that by allowing the service to be absorbed into the HSE. Our current model combining fire, rescue and emergency services is internationally recognised as best practice because it works. This model keeps people alive and it is the difference between life and death.</p>
          <p eId="para_905"> I have received a massive volume of calls and emails from members of DFB and from worried members of the public. Much of their concern stems from the dearth of information about what is being planned. A commitment was given and the Taoiseach himself stated previously that any changes to the ambulance services provided by DFB would only be considered after lengthy engagement but this has not happened. Fianna Fáil and the public want to improve the capabilities of fire brigade to make it even better than it is now, not to remove or absorb it. Year on year, as the population grows, calls have increased for additional recruitment but staffing levels are not keeping pace with demand. This means we are heading towards a major problem unless we recruit more workers and empower and resource fire brigade. It is tragic that this continues across many aspects of our front-line health services. </p>
          <p eId="para_906"> A technical solution can be found, despite the qualified support from the Minister of State earlier. According to the men and women of DFB, increased co-ordination between Tallaght and Townsend Street will transform the service. A comprehensive co-ordination programme, resulting in accidents and emergencies being responded to as quickly as possible, would only cost between €10,000 and €20,000 and should be supported by this Government.</p>

          <from>Deputy Marc MacSharry<recordedTime time="2018-06-19T21:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_907">I welcome the representatives of Dublin Fire Brigade. I support the motion before the House. The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, said earlier that the Government will support the motion. Her words in expressing support for the motion need to be followed up with actions. That is what is important to us. All of us raise issues with the HSE day in, day out. It is proposed to take responsibility for ambulances from Dublin Fire Brigade and give it to the HSE even though it is having great difficulty in dealing with itself. As Deputy Haughey said earlier, "If it is not broken, do not fix it."</p>
          <p eId="para_908"> Most of the points I wanted to make have been very well made already. I want to touch on a couple of other aspects of the fire service nationally. Dave Carroll, who is the chief fire officer for County Tipperary and the president of the Chief Fire Officers Association, recently told the association's annual conference that the recruitment and retention of firefighters is a major concern nationally. He said in his speech the association must:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_909">acknowledge the very real difficulties that our retained services are facing in terms of recruitment and retention of personnel. Notwithstanding the incredible commitment given to our communities by members of the retained fire service, it is clear that the current model is not fit for purpose. This model essentially places our fire-fighters on call 24/7 for 365 days a year with limited time off outside of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">In many parts of the country where part-time arrangements are necessary, part-time firefighters are expected to live very close to their fire stations, which limits the kind of work they can get outside firefighting. Mr. Carroll continued:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_911">This model evolved back in the 1950s and 60s and is patently unsuitable for today's lifestyle. The increased urbanisation of Ireland presents further challenges as primary employment migrates from the villages and towns to the larger urban centres. If one thing is abundantly clear it is that there is no easy solution, but neither is there an option to do nothing - the system is not far from falling over so we must arrest that fall, and arrest it now.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">Those are not my words, or the words of someone making a political charge. Those are the words of the chief fire officer for County Tipperary, who is the president of the national Chief Fire Officers Association. His comments speak for themselves. The serious problem he has highlighted needs to be addressed. We expect part-time firemen to live nearby and to be on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This seriously limits their potential to earn a living, especially as the income provided to part-time firefighters is quite modest.</p>
          <p eId="para_913"> I would like to mention another issue that has emerged lately. We need the 218 fire stations in this country because the first responders based in them do an excellent job in fire prevention and, when tragic cases arise, in making sure loss of life, injury and damage to property are limited. The Department is proposing to close Ballyshannon and Bundoran fire stations in south Donegal and to replace them with a single station. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to raise this matter personally with the Department and to respond to me. The two stations in question, which are serving the local area very well, sadly respond to many calls throughout the year. There was a significant tragedy in Bundoran in 1980, when ten people lost their lives in a fire at the Central Hotel. A whole family was wiped out. Indeed, such was the extent of the fire that one body was never found.</p>
          <p eId="para_914"> In 2009, a Fianna Fáil-led Government approved the construction of two new fire stations for both towns and both communities. The stations cover a very wide catchment. Indeed, Ballyshannon is the only fire station in the South that provides cover in Northern Ireland. There are several stations in Northern Ireland, including those in Derry and Strabane, that provide cover to the South from the North. Ballyshannon is the only fire station in the South that provides cover in the North. The area it covers stretches into north Leitrim and north Sligo and up towards central Donegal. The original 2009 plan, which was approved by the Department and the Government of the day, involved the construction of two new fire stations. That was the policy of the council. An expert report that was published recently was agnostic on the need to close one of the stations. It simply referred to response times. The community in this part of the country will not accept the stripping out of services and the closure of critical infrastructure of this kind. The Taoiseach and his colleagues, including the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and Deputies in Sligo and the north west, appear for weekly photo calls to announce plans for things like Ireland 2040. At the same time, it is delivering the closure of critical infrastructure like Ballyshannon fire station. I ask the Minister of State to look into this retrograde decision and do all he can to have it reversed.</p>

          <p eId="para_915">Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle as ucht deis a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an ábhar seo. I thank Deputies for their contributions to this evening's debate. It is clear that Deputies across the House enjoy a shared appreciation of the important role Dublin Fire Brigade plays in the provision of emergency ambulance services in Dublin. I applaud and salute the men and women of Dublin Fire Brigade, who are at the forefront of emergency services provision. People on the front line of emergency services are heroes who dedicate their lives for the safety and protection of others. Their work and dedication help the rest of us to sleep a little easier. I can confirm that there are no proposals to replace the fire-based emergency medical service that has served the people of Dublin well for many generations. I can also confirm that there are no proposals to merge Dublin Fire Brigade and the National Ambulance Service. However, there is a need to consider funding mechanisms to ensure Dublin City Council is adequately reimbursed for the ambulance services provided by Dublin Fire Brigade on behalf of the HSE. We also need to look at ambulance capacity in Dublin and we will do this. A capacity review identified a requirement for increased ambulance resources in the eastern region, which covers counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. The capacity review underlines the need for a multi-annual programme involving phased investment in ambulance manpower, vehicles and technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> I assure the House that the Government is committed to the delivery of a high-quality pre-hospital emergency care service throughout the country. Over recent years, additional investment has been directed towards pre-hospital emergency care each year. An additional €10.7 million, including €2.8 million to fund new developments, has been made available this year. New developments include the development of alternative pathways to care. For example, a "hear and treat" clinical hub has been in operation in the national emergency operations centre since March of this year. This will help to divert some lower acuity patients to alternative care pathways and will, in time, free up some emergency capacity. At present, the clinical hub is only available to callers whose emergency calls are routed through the national emergency operations centre, which is operated by the National Ambulance Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> As we heard earlier, there are two separate call centres in Dublin, one operated by the National Ambulance Service and the other by Dublin Fire Brigade. The existence of two call centres in the capital presents a real risk to patient safety, which we urgently need to address. It is clear that our current call-taking arrangements give rise to delays in the allocation of ambulance resources to patients, including in potentially life-threatening situations. A single point of contact is needed to address patient safety risks which have been identified by successive reports over the decades. While technical solutions have been proposed and independently examined, it has been determined that none of them will resolve the patient safety concerns. We need Dublin Fire Brigade and the National Ambulance Service to have a more co-ordinated and integrated approach to call-taking and dispatch. To that end, a mediation process is under way between Dublin City Council and staff associations. I hope this process will conclude shortly, will pave the way for a safer and more responsive ambulance service for the people of Dublin and will ensure new innovations such as the clinical hub will be available to callers all over the country. I believe the conclusion of the mediation process will also help to provide certainty to Dublin Fire Brigade personnel regarding the continuation of the fire-based emergency medical service delivery model. </p>

          <p eId="para_920">I commend my colleagues, Deputies John Lahart, Seán Haughey and Darragh O'Brien, who have raised this important issue. We know about the services that are out there but it is only when we need a service that we really appreciate the work that is done by many people, including people in my own area. I come from County Sligo, which is in the north west. We have a fire service in Ballymote. I can verify that when one rings the emergency number and then hears the sound of the fire engine coming, it is some relief to know it is on its way.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">We should commend those who work in the fire and ambulance services. They are taken for granted a bit. It is only when one needs the service that one fully appreciates the work they do. </p>
          <p eId="para_922"> I come from Ballymote, County Sligo. We have a good fire service there. As my colleague, Deputy MacSharry mentioned, we have a fire station in Ballyshannon that is to be recommended for closure, which is quite wrong. As was said earlier, funding was committed for two fire stations, one in Bundoran and one in Ballyshannon. These are rural towns in which the population can increase tenfold in the summer time and in the tourist season. I cannot understand why any of those services would be shut down. It is a retrograde step and I ask the Minister of State to have a talk with the officials in his Department to try to get it resolved. The people of the north west deserve better than what is being proposed. </p>
          <p eId="para_923"> The retained fire service people work extremely hard. They attend fires and road traffic accidents. It is fine for us who are in our beds at night when these people get a call. They have to go out and God only knows what they face. That is on a regular basis. I do not think their work is fully appreciated by the Government. In my home town, the people who supply that service must live within a mile and a half of the station and to be there within five minutes of the alarm going off. Ballymote, County Sligo has one of the best rural fire stations in the country time-wise and response-wise. That is on the record. These people cannot get ordinary work like anybody else. One constituent of mine works one day a week and cannot move more than five minutes away from the fire station because he is contracted 24-7 and has no choice but to be in that locality. He has been refused jobseeker's allowance. That is very wrong. He is paid about €70 for the day. When he was getting jobseeker's payments, he was paid about €140. He had a net gain of about €10 a day but the man wanted to work. Now he is told that because he works that one day, he must give up the fire brigade and not work to qualify for a jobseeker's payment. There is something badly wrong if the likes of this can go on. It is unfair for people who are putting their lives at risk day in, day out. They work for us by doing a very dangerous job and they deserve better. Another Minister has informed me that because it is one day and the same day every week, that man's jobseeker's payment should not be stopped. I ask the Minister of State to check that out for me. </p>
          <p eId="para_924"> The retirement age for retained firemen at present is 55, with an extra three years when people are medically fit to do it That age limit should be raised to 63. We are expecting people not to be able to get their pension until they are 68 now. Provided they are medically fit to carry on, that age limit should be raised in order that they can carry on into the future. They are experienced people.</p>

          <p eId="para_925">The acceptance of this motion by the Government is welcome. Even since this morning, its willingness has changed, not just in not opposing the motion as amended but in supporting it. This represents a victory for Dublin Fire Brigade and its emergency ambulance service and their supporters. However, the devil is very much in the detail. The Ministers of State have kept saying there is no threat to Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service and no plan to absorb it into the HSE or place it under the control of the HSE. We must look again at where the notion of that threat came from.</p>
          <p eId="para_926"> An agency of the State, the HSE, initiated a process to absorb Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service into the HSE. It developed an implementation plan and won the support of the so-called custodians of that service, namely, the city and county managers. The HSE controlled the budget and was unwilling to divest itself of it to Dublin Fire Brigade. The HSE wanted to control the very means by which Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service gets to do its work by controlling the call and dispatch centre. It was then by stealth that the HSE sought to absorb the services of Dublin Fire Brigade into and unto itself. That is where that threat came from and the notion that the Government had no idea about it is just folly.</p>
          <p eId="para_927"> Anybody close to this issue will notice the difference in tone in the Minister of State's scripted speech this evening, the first response to the motion. It is completely different from the tone on previous occasions when we raised this issue and for that we are grateful. However, there are still a couple of uninformed stings in the initial contribution by the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, who stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_928">[Dublin Fire Brigade] requests for [National Ambulance Service] assistance can be in the region of 1,000 per week. Sometimes [Dublin Fire Brigade] passes calls in batches which presents challenges to the [National Ambulance Service].</p>
          <p eId="para_929">This is a question of capacity. Dublin Fire Brigade had 82,000 mobilisations last year. If it is not responding it is because it does not have the tenders or ambulances. It is a question of capacity and resources. I do not like the little implication in the Minister of State's speech that it is the fault of Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service that it did not respond to calls and batches of calls were handed back to the National Ambulance Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_930"> We would like to see the full implementation of the report of the expert panel on pre-hospital emergency care services in Dublin, which was published in 2015. We believe, as recommended in that report, that the installation should take place of terminals in both call centres, to which Deputy Jack Chambers referred, with additional resources and funding. The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has gestured towards that tonight and it is new. When the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, discussed this a number of months ago it was not countenanced. I acknowledge the real progress that has been made. However, the call centre issue is not resolved although it is covered in the report of the expert panel. The measure has a cost of €20,000. We suggest that it would be possible to trial this technology for a period acceptable to the HSE, the national call centre, Dublin Fire Brigade and Dublin City Council. As the motion is calling for that anyway, in agreeing to support it, the Government is indicating that it is essentially put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_931"> Many messages go out from this Chamber to the fire officers and crews who are in the Gallery this evening. One is a message to Owen Keegan. The Minister has essentially gone over the city manager's head. The city manager was ready to divest himself of an aspect of a service of which he is meant to be custodian. Legislation provides that he is custodian. A Minister has given him an answer. Because crews of Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service's fire-based EMS service have at least four paramedics, sometimes including an advanced paramedic - I am told it takes at least four paramedics to deal with a cardiac arrest - 27 lives were saved in 2017 and 20 lives were saved in 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_932"> I am happy to commend the motion, together with my colleagues who have spoken tonight, including Deputies Jack Chambers, Haughey, Darragh O'Brien, and Curran.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">I am very happy the Government is supportive of it and that it has changed its tune considerably since the last time we raised the issue but the devil is in the detail and we, along with members and representatives of the Dublin Fire Brigade, will be looking for a meeting with the Minister in the next two weeks to drive this process through to completion.</p>
