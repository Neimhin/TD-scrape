            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_4">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5">The Government appointed Deputy Pat Carey as Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at my Department and the Department of Defence.  Deputy Dick Roche was appointed Minister of State at my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for European affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">As Chief Whip, the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, is primarily responsible for the organisation of Government business in the Dáil and the Government's programme of Dáil reform.  He also oversees preparation of the Government's legislative programme.  In  addition, my statutory functions with regard to the Central Statistics Office have been delegated to him.  I have also assigned responsibility for the active citizenship initiative in my Department to him.  His role will be to drive the initiative forward, oversee implementation of the recommendations of the task force on active citizenship and, critically, promote the concept of active citizenship in all spheres of Irish life.  I also expect him to monitor and identify additional measures which would strengthen our social interaction and broaden the manner in which we view our responsibilities as citizens in the modern Ireland.  He will be supported in this work by a steering group chaired by Ms Mary Davis and the active citizenship office in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">In a co-ordinating role in my Department, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, chairs an interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on European Union affairs.  The committee keeps under review and works to ensure coherence on the full range of issues on the European Union's agenda.  It has a particular focus on the correct and timely transposition of EU legislation.  In addition to these duties, the Minister of State has a heavy workload within the Department of Foreign Affairs, representing the Government at a wide range of EU and international meetings.  In this context, he plays a central role in consolidating and further developing Ireland's positive bilateral EU relations, particularly with the new member states.  He was extensively involved in the public debate on the reform treaty in the lead-up to the referendum.  Similarly, he has responsibility for the Government's Communicating Europe initiative which aims to foster a broad public understanding of and identification with the issues on the EU agenda.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_8">During the recent referendum on the Lisbon treaty one of the questions asked in response to the argument that the reduction in the number of Commissioners from 27 to 18 was in the interests of efficiency of administration and governance was how we could argue it was necessary to reduce to 18 the number of Commissioners for a population of 500 million when, for a population of 4 million, we had 15 Cabinet Ministers and 20 Ministers of State.  Does the Taoiseach believe we have too many Ministers of State?  At the time he appointed his Government did he give any consideration to whether the number should be reduced?</p>
            <p eId="para_9">Will the Taoiseach clarify the position regarding the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh?  In announcing the formation of the Government he indicated Deputy Mansergh would be Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism with responsibility for the arts.  Last week the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Cullen, published the delegated powers order to be given to the Minister of State.  The only reference to the arts I can find in the text is that the Minister of State will have the powers and duties conferred on the Minister under the Heritage Fund Act 2001.  This makes the Minister of State responsible for little more than stately homes.  By what means is the Minister of State to be given responsibility for the arts?  What is the position on the Taoiseach's original proposal, given that it does not appear to have been reflected in the delegation order?</p>

            <p eId="para_10">The number of Ministers of State I have appointed is appropriate in terms of the responsibilities they have been given.  Some of these responsibilities are cross-departmental, an aspect that needs to be further developed.  Following the OECD report on the reform of the public service, I am mindful of how we can better organise government with a view to ensuring we assign to Ministers of State responsibility for tasks which can be pursued in a coherent fashion.</p>
            <p eId="para_11">On the Deputy's question regarding the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, I have made the point that Deputy Mansergh is Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works and has additional responsibilities in the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  These responsibilities are shared with the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Cullen, whom the Minister of State will assist in the discharge of his duties, in the same way as other Ministers of State assist senior Ministers.</p>

            <p eId="para_13">Does the Taoiseach believe Ministers of State are an abused category of office holder in the House?  Ministers now rarely turn up for Adjournment debates and even when private notice questions are tabled, we sometimes find the Minister with direct responsibility does not appear and a Minister of State is asked to appear in his or her stead.  For example, last week when the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was asked to come into the House to deal with the serious concerns of residents of Cobh and Ringaskiddy regarding pollution levels at the old Irish Steel site in Haulbowline, he was nowhere to be found and the Minister of State at his Department, Deputy Hoctor, had to come into the House at short notice.  While it was not the fault of the Minister of State, the House did not receive the direct responses it needed.  Ministers repeatedly hide behind their Ministers of State when questions are put to them, whether in the form of Adjournment debates or private notice questions.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_6">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_14">I do not agree with the Deputy's contention.  There is a set procedure for the Adjournment debate, under which notice of matters to be raised is given by Members and replies are provided by the various Departments.  It is open to Members on the Government side or those in opposition to give notice of matters they wish to raise on any given day and the Ceann Comhairle will deem which ones are appropriate to that day's debate.  Business of this nature has always been dealt with in that way since I entered the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">Every Minister should seek, as a matter of courtesy, to be present in the House when a matter relevant to his or her Department is being taken.  However, there are occasions on which it is not possible for Ministers to be here because they have other duties they are obliged to discharge.  Ministers of State are well capable of addressing matters relating to departmental business in the absence of their senior counterparts.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">Replies sometimes cannot be made available within the allotted timeframe because investigations into particular matters might be ongoing.  The idea that comprehensive answers to private notice questions can be provided within the timeframe to which I refer is unrealistic, particularly when one considers the complexity of some of the issues involved.  Obviously, however, there is a duty on Ministers, in whatever capacity, to provide information that is as comprehensive as possible for the House at any given time.  That duty is always discharged in a conscientious way by Ministers.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">I do not accept the Deputy's contention that an effort is being made by Ministers to avoid their responsibility to be present in the House whenever possible.  There are occasions when it is not possible for them to be here and, in such circumstances, their colleagues will reply to matters in their stead.  This is not meant as a discourtesy to anyone in the House.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_7">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_18">The Taoiseach has been a Member of the House long enough to know that this has become a farce.  There was one occasion on which a senior Minister was in a licensed premises near the Dáil when the case of a man who had been murdered was discussed in the House.  The Minister in question should have been present for that debate.  The Taoiseach may recall that famous incident which was raised by Deputy Allen at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_19">The Taoiseach and I know that serious reforms are required in order to make the House more responsible and accountable and its workings more transparent.  One area in respect of which reform is required is that to which Deputy Gilmore refers, namely, the Adjournment debate.  The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, has responsibility for this matter but we have not yet seen the colour of his eyes in respect of it.  There are a dozen reports in his office — from Government and Opposition parties — in respect of some of which there is a large measure of agreement on how we could make the Dáil more interesting and relevant.  It is his responsibility to ensure action is taken on the recommendations made in them.  I hope he will take on board the urgings of the Taoiseach and ensure such action is taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_20">Under the current system, if Deputy D'Arcy wishes to raise a matter on the Adjournment tomorrow and the Ceann Comhairle allows him to do so, someone in the relevant Department will prepare a script which might not necessarily deal with the issues in respect of which the Deputy is seeking information.  There is a solution in this regard, which is contained in one of the reports sitting in the Minister of State's office.  The Labour Party and Fine Gael are in agreement on that solution and I am sure a large number of Fianna Fáil Members would concur with it.  Under the proposal to which I refer, a second or third question could be put by the Deputy raising the original matter.  When are we likely to obtain a comprehensive package from the Minister of State who has responsibility for this matter?  He could make a name for himself by reforming the Dáil and making it exciting and interesting in order that Members would want to come into the Chamber to raise matters and receive replies in respect of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_21">The Government should treat this as a matter of priority.  I accept that it has various economic issues with which it must deal and challenges it will be obliged to face.  However, the House has in many ways become irrelevant to the Government which chooses to make all major announcements relating to legislation and other matters outside it.  In many instances and from a Government point of view, the Dáil is treated as a place where one should not be.  The Taoiseach has been involved in politics for some time and is aware of this.  Will information on this matter be forthcoming before the end of next week or will we be obliged to wait until October for the Minister of State to outline his proposals?  I accept that, in the context of Dáil reform, the said proposals may receive a large measure of support from Members.</p>
            <p eId="para_22">What is the remit of the Office of the Minister for Children?  I am concerned about the comments made by the DPP last weekend in regard to his inability to take prosecutions in the absence of a referendum on children.  It seems that the changes of personnel on the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children in respect of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, have brought about a serious change of attitude, and not for the good, towards the progress it was making previously.  More than two years ago, my party pointed out that a hole existed in the Constitution and that a referendum was required to plug it, but the matter appears to have stalled.</p>
            <p eId="para_23">Has the Taoiseach instructed the Minister of State with responsibility for children that his primary responsibility is to ensure this House deals with the issue of a referendum for children so that young boys and girls do not become the victims of sexual predators?  When somebody of the eminence of the Director of Public Prosecutions is unable to proceed because of a requirement for a referendum, surely it should be the responsibility of this House to progress the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">From my party's point of view, we submitted our proposals by the date requested but matters seem to have stalled and I ask the Taoiseach to have a word with the new Minister of State with responsibility for children.  Can he confirm that it remains his intention to hold a referendum on children's rights, either on strict liability or the broader issue, and, if so, when will it take place?</p>

            <p eId="para_26">That certainly is beyond the remit of this question but I will answer the first part of the Deputy's question and respond to the second as best I can.</p>
            <p eId="para_27">In regard to the first part of his question, promoting Dáil reform is a shared responsibility of all Members and parties in this House.  We will seek to play a constructive role in that effort.  I have commented in the past that too often Dáil reform has been characterised by questions of where the balance of advantage lies rather than the merits of the reforms themselves.  If everyone kept to the idea that we are trying to improve the working of the House and protect its good name and reputation as we proceed with our business, we probably could make better progress in this area than we have traditionally done.  Too often, ideas have floated around or been implemented but the original intention then started to stray, things became specific and questions were asked for which no notice was given but on which people were expected to have answers beyond what was originally intended.  In other words, the practice of the House often strays from the original objectives of the reform, which is not sensible either.</p>
            <p eId="para_28">The Government and the Chief Whip will play a constructive role in exploring how we can improve procedures for the benefit of imparting knowledge and information to the wider public, as well as improving the interplay between Members as we try to discharge our responsibilities.  Unfortunately, rather than having that effect, the reforms often provide further opportunities for a descent into theatrics from the substantive discussions and dialogue which would benefit the public in terms of listening to the various ideas people have and the convictions they hold.  Let us hope we will continue to try to improve the situation.  Too often, progress is not made because that, unfortunately, turns out to be the outcome rather than the aspirations which were the genesis of the discussions on improving the workings of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_29">In regard to the referendum, I have not studied the statement made by the DPP last Friday, although I will consider it in the context of the continuing debate on this complex question.  My understanding is that he did not say he could not do his job but spoke instead about difficulties and the prosecutorial role.  The prosecution of offences is an issue that arises in terms of how the crime can be fitted to the various warrants and how it can proceed in the courts.  I have not studied the statement but I understand that is what he was talking about.</p>
            <p eId="para_30">The statement will have to be studied and I do not want to say any more until consideration has been given to the DPP's remarks.  However, the statement makes a contribution to the debate.  The debate by the all-party committee is proceeding.  People are finding out just how complex these issues are in the course of these discussions.</p>
            <p eId="para_31">On the problem of sexual predators, as referred to by the Deputy, the question of strict liability applying can have an effect way beyond that particular category of crime.  For example, to what extent should young people engaged in sexual activity be brought within the ambit of the proposals in a way not contemplated in the first instance?  When one examines all these issues, one finds one has to carefully circumscribe what it is one is trying to achieve while ensuring it does not have an effect and consequence way beyond the particular legitimate issue to be examined and sorted.  It is hoped this will be done by way of constitutional amendment based on consensus between the parties.  However, it remains to be seen whether the parties can reach a consensus on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_32">It is true to say that varying views on the matter are emerging within the committee and among its members, regardless of party affiliation.  It is a matter for the committee to find a solution to which everyone can subscribe.  That may or may not occur.  Much depends on where the debate takes us.  There are reasons that matters have not been concluded.  It is precisely because, as I have just outlined, a proposal which, on the face of it, might solve the initial problem could create other problems further down the line.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">I thank the Taoiseach for his response.  On Dáil reform, I have given my view across a range of areas.  I believe half a digital platform should be allocated for coverage of Dáil, Seanad and Committee proceedings.  The Ceann Comhairle should be in a position to operate a lottery during Question Time to allow Deputies present in the House to be called to ask a question.  This would make business much more relevant for Members rather than the set piece which involves a Minister or Minister of State coming to the House to reply to, for example, eight or ten questions which have already been made known to him or her and, as a result of which, Deputies, aside from those who tabled the questions, have no interest in coming into the Chamber.</p>

Perhaps he will clarify that matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_37">The Taoiseach stated that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, who is not in the House, is responsible for the co-ordination of a coherent approach to the European issue, with which I agree.  Unfortunately, that is not what happened over the past couple of months.  Except for the occasional cursory contact I had with the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, at the forum in Dublin Castle, there was not the type of co-ordination one would expect in respect of such an issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_38">Regarding the decision by the people on the Lisbon treaty, it has been brought to my attention that many sectors encounter difficulties as a consequence of the implementation of the transposition of the directives into Irish law.</p>

            <p eId="para_40">The Taoiseach stated that the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, has responsibility for the transposition of EU legislation review.  I am asking the Taoiseach a question about that responsibility.  Will the Minister of State carry out a review of how legislation has been transposed so that where flexibility is possible, it will be shown?  This would demonstrate that the Government had at least listened to the particular problems of sectors of Irish life, ranging from turf-cutting to red tape in small business.  The transposition of directives into Irish law is his responsibility.  This is a fundamental part of the reason people felt so much frustration about the Lisbon treaty referendum.  I ask the Taoiseach to ask the Minister of State, as part of his remit, to carry out a review of what has been transposed in order that we can deal with such issues.  I raised with the Taoiseach's predecessor the issue of water charges.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">Is the Taoiseach happy that the assistance given to the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny which is also the responsibility of the Minister of State is sufficient?  I understand there is a river of material coming towards the committee and that it will need assistance, legal and otherwise, in order that Deputies and Senators who serve on it can be properly and fully acquainted with the range of material coming from Brussels.  As the Taoiseach knows, under the Lisbon treaty, they were to have only an eight-week period in which to make their views and concerns known.  Is he happy that the committee which has been brought to the level of a full committee is being given the necessary resources to do its job properly in the interests of both the Oireachtas and the public?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_42">The Deputy's first question was about Dáil reform.  We must ensure the provision of considered and accurate information for the House is not supplanted by topicality, as if we were here to provide a day-to-day commentary on newsworthy issues.  The Parliament must do its business according to the priorities it sets itself, which must include policy formulation and dealing with issues that will develop over a certain timeframe.  We must not accept the idea that we are only relevant if we discuss issues that happen to be topical or are mentioned on morning radio programmes.  Parliament must find a balance between taking up issues of urgent public importance and maintaining its role as the main legislative and debating forum in the democratic life of the country.  This may mean discussing issues that are not of immediate topicality in wider society but the discussion of which is necessary in order to formulate ideas and decide how we should respond to the major issues of the day as they affect us and our relations with other countries and international organisations.  Sometimes I feel Dáil reform is only about facilitating discussion of subjects that will be printable the following day.  That is one aspect of it but it is not the full role of Parliament.  Sometimes this point is missed.  This is an issue for consideration by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  All parties in the House will participate and the Chief Whip will play a constructive role, now that he has settled in to his job, over the course of the summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_43">The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, chairs an interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on European Union affairs.  His job in this respect is to make sure the Government responds to emerging issues highlighted by Departments based on the work they do.  We hear a lot about the importance of the Commissioner in the role of the civil service, so to speak, of the Union.  We also have 90 people in Brussels on a full-time basis defending our interests through the Permanent Representation, where much detailed work is done on how to adapt and formulate policies at European level which are subsequently transposed into Irish law to ensure they meet our requirements.  We do not hear one word about this during the course of the debate.  It is as though the one person appointed as Commissioner, no matter who it is, is the embodiment of how we defend all our concerns.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  In fact, the Commissioner, on taking up his or her position, must primarily focus on European interests.  In the recent debate on the Lisbon treaty, this was an aberration in terms of the role of Commissioner and those who are defending our interests in the Union.  I was asked whether the principle of proportionality is being respected with regard to the transposition of European legislation.  As the Deputy correctly said, if we had passed the Lisbon treaty we would have a far better structure in terms of the role of national parliaments and national parliamentarians would have an enhanced role in terms of policy formulation in European legislation.  This is now not available to us.  The principles of proportionality and subsidiarity would have been prominent in the future workings of the Union, had it proceeded along the lines of the Lisbon treaty model.  In any event, we are where we are.</p>
            <p eId="para_44">During the referendum campaign it was suggested — I heard it in my part of the country and Members probable heard it in the west — that people will no longer be allowed to cut turf from their bogs.  The ten year exemption, which is soon to expire, under the habitats directive relates to saving blanket bogs in special areas of conservation but opponents of the treaty presented it as though it denied people this freedom in every respect.  Nothing could be further from the truth but who seeks accuracy when trying to win an argument?  It depends on what side of the argument one is on.  This is another example of people portraying the Union in an unfair way, in this case by suggesting it has the power to impose such a ban, which it has not.  It is simply implementing a directive agreed by member states.  We must decide either that we should have a habitats directive with special areas of conservation and national heritage areas or that we should not.  The people who argue that the European Union is being too intrusive will next week oppose developments in certain areas because they want to maintain our heritage and protect the environment.  I suppose it depends on what argument suits them on the day and nobody need seek consistency.</p>
            <p eId="para_45">This is another example of an open misrepresentation of the position.  Canvass teams told me that opposing canvass teams were talking this nonsense and reducing voters' consideration of a matter of national interest on the basis that they would never be able to cut turf again.</p>

Can he tell us if he sees any contradiction in the arguments he is presenting?  Does he think there is any irony there at all?  Can he sniff any hypocrisy in that position?

            <p eId="para_63">No, the Deputy is wrong again.  The treaty provided that, if agreed, the number of Commissioners could be reduced to 18, subject to the principle of equal rotation.  It also provided that the number of Commissioners could stay at 27, if unanimous agreement could be reached on that.  That is what it said.  It was not in the Sinn Féin literature, but that is what the treaty said.  As the Deputy would say, Sinn Féin got out its scéal and away it went.  The Deputy suggested that we should decide how many members of Government we should have, and how many Ministers of State should support the work of those Ministers, on the basis of the number of Commissioners the European Union has.  I do not agree.  I regard any decision on the number of Ministers this country should have as a sovereign matter for the Irish Government.</p>

If we had supported the Lisbon treaty, we would have lost a considerable amount of sovereignty in making decisions.  Perhaps the Taoiseach is right to argue we should let that go.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied there is an absolute need for 20 Ministers of State?  Is he satisfied that all those positions are warranted?  At a time when he is telling the rest of us to tighten our belts, is he satisfied it is absolutely necessary to have 20 Ministers of State?  During these difficult times, we are facing pay freezes — the devil and all.  Is he totally satisfied that all the Ministers of State are giving us value for money?</p>

            <p eId="para_65">I am absolutely satisfied that, in order to discharge political accountability, two or three democratically elected politicians — a Minister and one or two Ministers of State — should be asked to run a Department which may have many hundreds of thousands of people working for it.  I do not see what could be more respectful of our democratic institutions than to give political responsibility for running Departments to politicians.  We do not live in a technocracy — we live in a democracy.  People elect us to this House.  This House elects Governments.  We have a broad range of domestic and international responsibilities in terms of how we serve the people and the country.  I assure the Deputy that those who hold positions in this Administration have extensive and responsible jobs to do.  Each of them is held to account by the other Members of this House on a daily basis.  I do not think it is in the interests of politics for those who exercise the profession to denigrate their fellow members of the profession.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_71">I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 8, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_72">At the social partnership plenary meeting on 15 February 2008, the Government invited the social partners to participate in a formal review of Towards 2016, as provided for under the agreement.  Given that the terms of the pay agreement for the private sector expired in March, the review process includes negotiations on a new pay round.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions held a special delegate conference on 17 April that authorised its participation in the negotiations, which then commenced on 24 April.  The social partnership steering group is overseeing the review of the overall agreement.  There have been several steering group meetings to date, the latest of which took place on 11 June, as well as bilateral engagements within individual social partnership pillars.  These discussions will continue over the coming period.</p>
            <p eId="para_73">Discussions are also underway with the parties to the pay agreement.  To date, 17 meetings have taken place.  These meetings included discussions on the economic scenario; a review of progress made to date on implementing Towards 2016 commitments in the area of employment rights and compliance and pensions; the regulation of employment agencies and agency workers; the legislative framework; workplace learning, education and upskilling; public sector renewal; and pay and related issues.  These issues will be the subject of ongoing discussion over the coming weeks and a series of further meetings is scheduled to take place this week.  In addition, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has arranged bilateral meetings with the social partners to discuss the Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_74">In setting out the priorities of my Government in the Dáil, I emphasised there is an urgency in the parties to the pay terms moving towards an agreement, since the conclusion of an appropriate agreement would support the strength and confidence of the economy in an uncertain world.</p>
            <p eId="para_75">I am looking forward to working with the social partners to chart a course for the period ahead which is in line with our shared objectives, a course which reflects the realities of the situation in which we find ourselves and which enhances rather than diminishes our capacity to secure jobs and living standards for tomorrow, and for the long term.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">In keeping with my wish to engage actively and constructively with the social partners, I was pleased to address the IMPACT 2008 biennial conference on 16 May.  In the course of my address, I spoke about the ongoing social partnership talks, the benefits that have accrued under Towards 2016, public sector reform, decentralisation, the forum on the health sector and the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.</p>
            <p eId="para_77">I addressed the annual president's dinner of IBEC on 25 June, at which I stressed the valued of the partnership process at a time of international economic difficulty.  In line with long established practice the current negotiations are being conducted by officials from the relevant Departments, led by the Secretary General of my Department.  The negotiations are overseen by Ministers led by myself and I am briefed in detail on their progress.  As on all previous occasions the talks process can involve members of Government, including myself, when it is considered that this would be helpful.  I expect such engagement to take place, as appropriate, over the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_78">As the Taoiseach noted, the pay terms of the existing agreement for the private sector expired in March while that for the public sector will expire in September.  We are in a situation where there should be a new agreement on pay.  When does the Taoiseach expect the pay element of the talks to be concluded?  Will that happen on this side of the summer holidays?  I note he said there have already been 17 meetings between the parties on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_79">I appreciate the Taoiseach cannot predict the outcome but I wish to ask him about the framework of the talks.  What period of agreement is anticipated to emerge from the discussions?  Has the Government formulated a pay offer as part of these talks?  Can the Taoiseach indicate to the House what that might be, in general terms?  Considering the non-pay elements he referred to such as agency workers, temporary workers, collective bargaining issues and issues related to employment legislation, are those matters now concluded in a way that allows for full engagement on the pay element?</p>

            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_80">We must return to this issue again.  Has the Taoiseach set a time limit on a conclusion of the pay talks, if they are to conclude?  Is he concerned by the statement from employers that, in certain circumstances, they might be prepared to walk away from social partnership?  Does he see that as a real concern?  How does he propose to bring two polarised sides together to form a basis for negotiation and conclusion?  We recognise that social partnership has been of fundamental importance to industrial peace in the country and to the benefits we have seen in so many areas over the years.</p>

            <p eId="para_81">Does the Taoiseach believe the issue of low pay will be dealt with as part of the current pay talks?  This issue has been highlighted by Mandate, which represents many low-paid workers, for example, those in the retail sector.  Does the Taoiseach accept that those low-paid workers are bearing the brunt of the rising fuel and food costs?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_82">No pay offer has been made by the Government at this point.  We are bringing the published official estimates on the performance of the economy in the first six months to the table so the social partners will be informed precisely as to what the Government regards as the short-term and medium-term prospects.  Doing so will comprise an important input into the talks in an effort to determine whether we can conclude them successfully.  It would be premature to do anything until that issue is addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_83">The non-pay issues are not disposed of.  There has been much discussion on them and, as the Deputy knows, they formed a considerable part of the discussion on the Towards 2016 arrangements.  There have been developments and the discussions continue.  We will do what we can to determine whether we can solve the problems to everyone's satisfaction.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">I would like to see the discussions conclude in the weeks ahead.  This would constitute an important signal of determination on the part of all parties involved to provide a stable framework in a time of uncertainty and economic difficulty.  This would be done with a view to maintaining jobs and inspiring public confidence in respect of how we are proceeding.  Everyone acknowledges that the short-term economic outlook in Ireland has deteriorated.  There are a number of difficult policy choices to be made and we must safeguard Ireland's future competitiveness in an increasingly volatile and globalising world.  We must nurture an environment that continues to be conducive to investment, trade and employment growth through greater productivity and innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_85">There are a number of requirements to be considered if this challenge is to be met successfully.  We must be realistic in our approach.  We face a major challenge but must keep it in proportion.  The strength of our economy across many sectors puts us in a different position from that in which we were when the challenges arose on the last occasion.  Those engaged in the social partnership process have risen to the challenge.  The lesson we learn from our economic history is that, unless necessary corrective action is taken promptly and appropriately, more painful adjustments with less scope for sensible prioritisation inevitably follow.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">I will be making the point that we all need to recognise the short-term issues and that we can return to a position of economic growth as soon as the international upturn comes.  We also need to make responsible and sensible decisions in the interest of job security, competitiveness and fairness to all in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.</p>

          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_41">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_88">For payments in excess of €5,000, additional compulsory modulation at a rate of 2% per year is proposed from 2009 to 2012.  This would bring the modulation rate to 13% by 2012.  A further 3% modulation is proposed on payments in excess of €100,000, an additional 6% is proposed on payments over €200,000 and an additional 9% is proposed on payments above €300,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">The objective is to use this funding to finance measures directed at addressing what the Commission has described as the "new challenges" of climate change, risk management, bio-energy and biodiversity.  As the proposals stand, all of the additional modulated funds would remain in the member state of modulation and could be allocated to farmer payments under the rural development programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">In the negotiations to date a wide range of views have been expressed by member states on the Commission's proposal on modulation and it is not clear what finally will be agreed.  I have opposed the proposed increases in modulation, together with several of my fellow Ministers for Agriculture.  I have concerns about significantly reducing the single farm payment at a time when farmers are still adapting to the impact of decoupling and believe it is needlessly disruptive to change the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 so soon after its adoption.  However, I welcome that the funds released through additional modulation could be used for farm payments in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">Ireland strongly supports pillar 2 of the Common Agricultural Policy and is providing a high level of national funding for rural development.  We already devote a substantial proportion of rural development funds to addressing the new challenges identified by the Commission.</p>

            <p eId="para_92">I have to hand a press statement issued by the Minister on 28 May, subsequent to the most recent publication of the health check proposals.  In respect of the modulation proposals, the Minister's statement reads:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_93">In relation to the proposed increase in modulation . . . the Minister confirmed that any funds raised in this way would remain in Ireland and could be allocated to agricultural schemes and therefore Irish farmers would not lose under the proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_94">I wish to establish clearly that it is the position of the Government that Irish farmers are key to any rural development proposals and that any proposal emanating from the Commission which proposes to take money out of the pockets of farmers and invest it in rural development, via the Leader groups or otherwise, is entirely unacceptable.  Robbing Peter to pay Paul in the name of rural development is unacceptable, notwithstanding the clear implication of the Minister's statement that this is an arrangement and proposal with which he could live.  As time is critical, I wish to lay down a clear marker that the proposal to increase modulation to 13% by 2012 and to take money out of farmers' pockets is entirely unacceptable.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_43" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_95">I agree with the Deputy.  The statement he quoted from me was issued immediately after the publication of the Commissioner's proposals on 27 May, which was the first time I had sight of them.  I repeat that Ireland is strongly opposed to increased rates of compulsory modulation.  The CAP health check process has just begun.  I responded previously to a parliamentary question tabled by the Deputy on the processes begun in respect of a number of issues.  Working groups have been established, comprising representatives from each member state, to flesh out the proposals in each strand of the health check.  At the Council of Ministers meeting I outlined that Ireland was strongly opposed to the modulation proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_96">The aforementioned statement simply outlined that in the past funds that were modulated, if one wishes to describe them as such, did not necessarily remain in the state from which they were taken.  Under the new proposals, were modulation to be implemented, such funds would remain in the member state concerned.  It is unclear what programmes can be assisted, were the modulation proposals to be implemented.  The Commissioner may envisage some schemes that would be on-farm, rather than general, rural development programmes.  While this still is unclear, I have stated clearly, as will officials within the working group, that Ireland is opposed to the modulation proposals outlined by the Commission.  Only an initial discussion took place at the meeting or at subsequent Council of Ministers meetings.  It still is early days and my officials will be doing their utmost to ensure we secure the best outcome and reiterate in the strongest possible terms Ireland's opposition to the modulation proposals.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
            <p eId="para_97">Does the Minister accept that the single farm payment, by virtue of its static nature since its introduction, is of declining value year on year to the agricultural community?  I refer to further tampering with it, by way of reduction, in the light of agri-inflation in particular.  The Minister is aware, for example, that the prices this year of fertiliser, energy and feedstuffs have increased by 62%, 20% and more than 20%, respectively.  Any tampering with the value of these payments will adversely affect both agriculture and rural development because farmers are key to vibrant rural communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_98">I refer to the French Presidency which commenced today.  When President Sarkozy visits Ireland in the near future, will the Minister avail of the opportunity to impress on him and the French who, in general, are supportive of the Common Agricultural Policy that this matter will not be tolerated by Ireland in the context of the health check?</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_99">As for the Deputy's point on the visit by President Sarkozy, he is aware I have met the French Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Michel Barnier, on a number of occasions when we discussed issues of common concern and interest.  I will continue to so do within the Council of Ministers with like-minded Ministers.  A variety of views have been expressed by Ministers from various member states regarding the CAP health check in respect of milk quota, modulation and decoupling.  However, I agree fully with the Deputy, in that decoupling is relatively new and Ireland's farming system has adapted to it well.  When farmers signed up to it, they were of the opinion that it constituted both a set and significant part of their income.  I am opposed to farmers losing part of their income from the single farm payment.</p>

         the progress made in the course of discussions with EU fisheries Ministers in Luxembourg last week with regard to the Irish fishing industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_46" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_101">The Agriculture and Fisheries Council of Ministers meeting in Luxembourg last week had a heavy agenda of fisheries items which were of importance to the Irish fishing industry.  I attended the meeting with my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for fisheries and forestry, Deputy Killeen.</p>
            <p eId="para_102">In the run-up to, and during, the Council, the Minister of State and I had a series of meetings with the Federation of Irish Fishermen regarding the difficult issues facing the Irish fishing industry such as rising fuel costs, low prices at the quayside for fish, competition from cheap imports of fish, the effects of illegal, unrecorded and unregulated fishing and quota restrictions due to declining fish stocks.  We also met EU Commissioner Borg on a bilateral basis the week before the Council and made a strong case for the need for a package of EU-funded measures to address the difficulties faced by fishermen across Europe but in Ireland, in particular, and to set out other priority issues for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_103">Three significant regulations achieved political approval at the Council.  A proposal was agreed for a Council regulation establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, commonly referred to as IUU.  This important measure will address the high incidence of illegal fishing and significantly will tackle the marketing of fish and fishery products acquired through illegal fishing.  After this measure comes into force in early 2010, all fishery products will require a certificate that they have been caught legally before they can be imported into the Community.  This is a major regulation which has much international focus on its success and will represent good news for legal fishermen, as it will  remove illegal products from the market.  Ireland strongly supported this measure at the Council and also called for the Commission to develop effective labelling schemes in order that consumers can play a role by making an informed choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_104">Political agreement was also achieved on a Council regulation on fishing authorisations for Community vessels in third country waters and third country vessels in Community waters, which is important to Ireland, given that we have responsibility for control of large fishing grounds.  The third regulation agreed is a Council regulation on the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas from the adverse impacts of bottom fishing gears, which follows on from a UN resolution.</p>
            <p eId="para_105">The annual setting of total allowable catches and quotas is an important process for Irish fishermen and I will press for the maximum possible allocations for Irish fishermen during the negotiations taking into account the scientific advice on the state of stocks.  Another agenda point was a joint request by Ireland, France and Britain for a mid-year increase in the 2008 total allowable catch for cod in the Celtic Sea, based on jointly submitted scientific advice from our respective marine research institutes indicating positive developments in the state of the stock.</p>
            <p eId="para_106">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_107">This is an important issue for our fishermen as Ireland's 2008 quota is almost gone and the fishery must be closed soon.  As cod is taken in a mixed fishery, its closure inevitably will lead to discarding, which cannot be justified.  After strong pressure from Ireland, France and the United Kingdom, the Commission agreed to consider proposing a increase in the 2008 total allowable catch, if the latest scientific advice, due out at the end of last month, is sufficiently positive.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">A further significant point for Ireland was the renewal of the fisheries partnership agreement with Mauritania which provides fishing opportunities for Community vessels in Mauritanian waters for the next four years.  These opportunities are mainly of interest to our pelagic fleet.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">The most immediately significant agenda item concerned the crisis in the European fishing industry and, in particular, the effects of the recent rapid increases in fuel costs.  Ireland, together with all the other affected member states, conveyed in the strongest terms the depth of feeling of our fishermen on these issues and the seriousness of the situation facing them which has led to public protests across Europe, including Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_110">Commissioner Borg stated he had listened carefully to the case made both in the lead-up to and at the Council and undertook to come to the next Council meeting on 15 July with a package of emergency measures to try to alleviate the crisis.  He has flagged that these measures will be based on a commitment to addressing the over-capacity and over-exploitation issues in the long term.  However, in the short term they may include funding of partial decommissioning to replace older vessels with more energy efficient ones, temporary cessation aid for vessels involved in such schemes, modifications to the <i>de minimis</i> aid rules, reductions in social security contributions for employees, support for research into fuel efficiency and the shift to energy-efficient technologies, as well as marketing measures to address the prices achieved at first point of sale, that is, the quayside.  At the Council we pressed for additional EU funding to be made available and I made it clear that the package must include additional EU funding to provide for the implementation of these measures.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_111">I thank the Minister for a comprehensive reply.  This pertains to the seafood industry which is worth up to €800 million and which certainly has been suffering significant and devastating consequences.  In particular, I refer to the impact on the approximately 12,000 people employed in coastal communities.  It surely behoves Ireland to make an all-out effort to deliver a profitable and sustainable industry.  The Minister is aware that many fishermen face complete economic ruin in the absence of a significant intervention, rather than a token gesture, to save coastal communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">The Minister is aware that the industry has sustained a series of changes, all impacted over a short period, but even prior to the fuel price increases many were finding it difficult to operate.  Many had the idea of converting borrowings into long-terms loans but will financial institutions do that now?  Will the Minister agree that the people who bring in the catch are the price takers?  They do not come up with the price and they are not in a position to pass on any costs in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">Why can we as a country not intervene directly and render assistance, as other countries do?  This is part of the European debate.  The French can do what they like.  The Spanish Government can intervene when it deems it necessary to do so but we are always the great white knights who obey every rule, and it is one of the reasons the Lisbon treaty referendum was defeated.  Our problem is that we are too subservient.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">The Minister met the fishermen and the representatives in Athlone.  They sought a temporary tie-up scheme, which is allowed under the European fisheries fund.  That should not be given as an excuse.  What is the position on the control of fish imports and anti-dumping measures the Minister referred to?  We all saw what happened at the cargo terminal in Cork, which was a frightening scenario.  Why can we not market the fish, which is vital from a health perspective?</p>
            <p eId="para_115">What is the position on the commitment to provide the decommissioning scheme for 80 m vessels?  Where is the €58 million that was provided for that scheme?</p>
            <p eId="para_116">As an island nation we should take a pivotal role in responding to the current crisis.  The European Commission made promises and gave various commitments but that is like the acorn seed.  It takes years for the oak tree to grow.  How long will it take the Council of Ministers to deliver?  What input will this country have to try to secure and save an industry that is extremely important, even for those of us in the midlands?  It is important for the country.  We call upon the Minister to intervene and take every step to ensure the security and future of this important industry.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_117">As Deputy Penrose said, I had a long and detailed meeting with the Federation of Irish Fishermen in his home county of Westmeath a number of weeks ago.  In the meantime, both the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, our officials and myself had the opportunity to meet its members on a number of occasions and both before and after the Council of Ministers meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">One of the issues highlighted to us is that the fisherman is always price taking and that in recent times the actual price they have been getting for the product has decreased whereas for the consumer the price of the end product, whether it is in a restaurant, a supermarket or whatever, had increased.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">In that regard, following the meeting in Athlone we established immediately a national Irish seafood market initiative, which was one of the issues we put to the federation that day, under the chair of the chief executive officer of Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The remit of the initiative will be to discuss, identify and maximise the opportunities for domestic seafood supply to the Irish seafood market.  The objective is to bring the producers, fishermen, wholesalers, distributors and processors together to ensure that the producers and market suppliers communicate with the industry to ensure that everybody gets a fair price in the chain of production and processing.</p>
            <p eId="para_120">Shortly after I was appointed to this office I made contact with Commissioner Borg.  I had in excess of a 30 minute detailed telephone conversation with him.  Subsequently, the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, and I met him in advance of the Council of Fisheries Ministers meetings.  We outlined to him, as Deputy Penrose pinpointed, and others in the House a week ago during the debate, the serious issues facing the industry.  We outlined those issues cogently and strongly to the Commissioner at our bilateral meeting.  That was followed up subsequently at our Council of Ministers meetings where both the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, and I spoke about all those important issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_121">In view of the fact that as a Common Fisheries Policy we put strong pressure and proposals to the Commission to bring forward an EU funded package of measures, a number of initiatives have been taken.  To answer Deputy Penrose's question about when the Commission will come back on the issue, Commissioner Borg said he will come back at the Council of Ministers meeting, which is the 15 July, on foot of the deliberations of the Council meeting a week ago.  We let him know in no uncertain terms, however, the serious situation facing so many fishermen.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_122">I want to ask two brief questions.  The Minister mentioned the Common Fisheries Policy.  What efforts are being made to level the playing field from the perspective of control and enforcement across all member states to ensure that penalties imposed are harmonised and that Irish fishermen are not discriminated against?  Has any progress been made in investigating the discriminatory ban on Irish commercial vessels landing sea bass, which does not apply to other EU states fishing in Irish waters?</p>
            <p eId="para_123">Also, is any extra funding available to be directed without delay to investigation of and research into alternatives to diesel for fishing boats?  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle got a communication from a fisherman in Kilmore Quay who said that if this is not done, there will shortly be no white fish to market because it will not be cost effective to catch it.  He said that is not exaggeration or a case of fishermen whinging and that we should investigate now for the future.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_124">Regarding the latter points, as I mentioned earlier, the IUU regulation has been adopted at the Fisheries Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_125">Regarding a level playing field, we secured a commitment from Commissioner Borg that he would examine a specific proposal from Ireland that would help strengthen the tools available to coastal states such as Ireland to control fishing activity in our exclusive fishery zones.  Ministers are seeking in particular that the coastal member state has access to the quota limits applying to any Community vessels fishing in its waters.  Currently, our authorities do not have access to get the relevant details on a vessel from another EU state.  That is a lacuna in the EU regulations and it is one of the proposals we put to Commissioner Borg.</p>
            <p eId="para_126">Deputy Penrose asked about decommissioning.  The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, announced a week ago that the offers have gone out regarding the decommissioning scheme.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_134">My Department implements a broad range of schemes and services in the agriculture, forestry, fishing and food processing sectors.  It is responsible for voted expenditure of some €1.9 billion in 2008 and also acts as paying agency in respect of EU funding for direct payments to farmers and market supports which total about €1.4 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_135">A high proportion of the Department's Vote relates to large demand-led schemes, for example, the REPS, the farm waste management scheme, the farm investment scheme, forestry, the less favoured areas scheme, grants for marketing and processing projects and the new suckler cow scheme, which together account for more than €1 billion in the Vote in 2008.  Expenditure under these schemes is contingent on a variety of factors outside of the Department's control.  These include farmer confidence, the availability of finance, the rate of completion of capital projects, weather and other factors.</p>
            <p eId="para_136">The agencies under the Department's aegis — Teagasc, Bord Bia, BIM, the Marine Institute and the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency——</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_138">——together account for over €250 million of the Department's Vote this year to ensure that investment in the farming, forestry, fisheries and food sectors continues to play a critical role in encouraging innovation, improving competitiveness and ensuring protection of the environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_139">Expenditure, receipts and the achievement of key outputs are very closely monitored on an ongoing basis with a view to delivering the best possible service to stakeholders and to achieve key targets within the budget allocations agreed by the Oireachtas.  Value for money reviews are undertaken on a regular basis.  In addition, on the initiative of the Minister for Finance, the Department has been engaged in an efficiency review with a view to identifying measures which might be taken in order to effect improvements in efficiency in service delivery generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_140">The Department's main contribution to this process was to commit to a further reduction of 200 in staff numbers over the next few years.  Further initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiency are under consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_141">I intend to continue with this prudent, ongoing approach to managing the Department's finances while taking due account of any decisions taken by Government in the context of the current more challenging fiscal situation.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelCreed" eId="spk_60">
            <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
            <p eId="para_142">I am nearly as wise as I was before the Minister responded, but I expect all will become clearer after the House rises.  I appreciate that many of the schemes funded by the Department are demand led and the Department will have no choice but to honour those schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_143">An issue that exercised us on Question Time on the past number of occasions is the sheep sector and, in particular, a package of €28 million, which was promised in May 2007 in the lead up to the general election.  In the last series of oral questions the Minister confirmed that a total of €9,000 out of the package of €28 million had been paid.  Will the Minister assure the House that particularly vulnerable sector of Irish agriculture, the sheep farming sector, will not be asked to carry the can in respect of efficiencies or cutbacks — call them what he may — and that package, although it requires to be re-tailored to fit the needs of the sheep sector which is in decline, will be ring-fenced for the sheep sector?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_61" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_144">I will come back to Deputy Creed with more detail.  I will write to him during the week because I do not have statistics with me on the take-up there may have been in the meantime since he tabled that parliamentary question.</p>
            <p eId="para_145">I assure him that I met individual farmers and others familiar with the sheep sector.  There are concerns about the decline in numbers for some time but, thankfully, there has been an improvement in prices which was badly needed.  It is an area in which I want to take a particular interest because it is one that needs some assistance and needs confidence built back into it.  North of the Border, as I have gathered from speaking to officials in the Department there and the Minister, they have been finding similar problems to ourselves in the sheep meat sector, and it is an area we want to help.</p>
            <p eId="para_146">I do not want to be too prescriptive, but quite a large percentage of the recommendations of the John Malone report into the sheep sector have already been implemented.  Some of them are in the course of implementation as well.  I do not want to state the specific percentage — I do not recall it exactly.  I will send Deputy Creed a note on the sheep sector, in particular, over the next few days.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
            <p eId="para_147">I appreciate that.  The complexity of all of this is difficult to grasp in a short space of time.  Will the €28 million fund be ringfenced and remain for the sheep sector?  That was a promise made.  It is a fund that has not been drawn down.  It was promised because it is a sector in crisis.  It was a fund that was established with so many strings attached that it proved virtually impossible for the sheep sector, highland or lowland, to access it.</p>
            <p eId="para_148">Given the Minister has made a specific commitment to the sheep sector and has had discussions with his Northern Ireland counterparts, will he investigate — this is slightly aside from the main thrust of this question — the potential of the wool industry?  It is a sector that has been virtually a "discard", if I may import the term from the marine industry.  It is an asset that has been virtually discarded in recent years, but may be coming back into vogue.  The Minister might look at it, both from an insulation perspective and from a wool and yarn perspective.</p>

            <p eId="para_149">I also had discussions with Ministers from the other devolved administrations in our neighbouring island on a number of issues.  We have been making arrangements to hold formal meetings — these were more informal meetings.</p>
            <p eId="para_150">One of the issues we will have down for discussion at the next North-South Ministerial Conference on Agriculture that comes up relatively shortly is the issue of sheep and, obviously, the all-island health status which is a regular issue on which we continue to make progress.  It will be one issue that I will be discussing in the meetings being arranged at North-South Ministerial Conference level with Minister Gildernew and her officials.</p>

            <p eId="para_162">The WTO Director General announced on Friday last that he will propose that a WTO ministerial meeting take place in Geneva in the week commencing 21 July next.  The purpose of this meeting is to finalise the modalities or detailed texts of agreements on agriculture and non-agricultural market access, NAMA.  It is envisaged that a Signalling Conference on Trade in Services will take place at the same time.</p>
            <p eId="para_163">In preparation for the conference, it is expected there will be further engagement on agriculture and NAMA for the remainder of this week with revised texts due towards the end of next week.  This will be followed by meetings at official level in the run up to the ministerial conference.</p>
            <p eId="para_164">If agreement is reached on agriculture and NAMA modalities at this time, the expectation is that, in the period needed to produce detailed WTO schedules, the other areas of negotiation would be concluded so that the final overall agreement would be in place by the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">It is by no means clear that this objective will be achieved.  In addition to the large number of complex issues across the broad spectrum of negotiating areas which are unresolved, the uncertainty in the US political situation could play a crucial role in whether this proposed timetable for reaching a final agreement is achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_166">I am very concerned about some of the proposals being made in the agriculture negotiations and with the lack of balance in the overall process to date.  It is not acceptable that the current negotiations are focused on agriculture while other negotiating areas are not making progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_167">The Government has and will continue to take every opportunity to express our concerns in the strongest terms in the various EU and WTO meetings dealing with these negotiations.  I recently met my French counterpart, and the current state of play and imbalance in these WTO negotiations were high on the agenda of this meeting.  I can report that France and Ireland share the same concerns on the direction of these negotiations and will continue to insist that the Commission does not accept a deal which undermines EU agricultural production.  I have also had formal bilateral meetings with my colleagues from Spain and Poland and they too share our concerns.  I had meetings with other Ministers from member states as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_168">The Commission, including Commissioner Mandelson and his officials, are well aware of Ireland's views on the matter.  These views have been articulated clearly and consistently at all available fora over the last several years, including bilateral meetings, meetings of the Article 133 Committee, the Agriculture Council and the General Affairs Council, and in bilateral meetings with the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_169">At last week's Agriculture Council of Ministers meeting, I re-emphasised to the Agriculture Commissioner, and to the Council as a whole, Ireland's concerns.  I referred, in particular, to the changes that had taken place since WTO negotiations commenced in 2001 and I insisted the new challenges of climate change and food security must be taken on board in any deal.</p>
            <p eId="para_170">In the margins of the Council, a group of 20 EU countries reaffirmed their deep concerns about the WTO negotiations.  I will continue to ensure Ireland plays a leading role in this group of like-minded member states.  I will continue to work closely with like-minded Ministers in other member states to seek support for our position.</p>
            <p eId="para_171">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_172">At official level, my Department, and other Departments involved, have and will continue to work assiduously in the various technical meetings to ensure Ireland's interests are best protected.</p>
            <p eId="para_173">In summary, I will continue to pursue an outcome which does not undermine the 2003 reforms of the CAP and ensures that Irish and EU agriculture can compete on world markets.</p>

            <p eId="para_174">Notwithstanding his reluctance previously at Question Time here, and indeed, the reluctance of his predecessor, to commit to using the veto in respect of the proposals on the table now, does it remain the Government's position, as articulated, albeit at a late stage — with hindsight, far too late — in the context of the Lisbon treaty, and will the Minister confirm in the House that it is the Government's intention to veto unacceptable proposals? Second, has there been any change or variation in the proposals on the table at the WTO as they relate to agriculture, and particularly as they relate to tariff cuts in the areas that are of particular interest in Ireland, namely, beef, dairy products and other critical sectors of Irish agriculture?</p>
            <p eId="para_175">Mr. Sarkozy, apart from being the French President and the incoming EU Presidency, is a strong advocate of the Common Agricultural Policy.  He has made various trenchant criticisms recently, not just of Commissioner Mandelson but also of the WTO proposals that are now on the table.  In that context, has the Minister proposals, with the Taoiseach, to meet Sarkozy to discuss these issues, particularly as President Sarkozy appears to be under the impression that the Government may rerun the Lisbon treaty referendum?</p>

          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_86" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_188">The current discussions at EU level on the high cost of fuel are essentially about short-term emergency measures.  However, any long-term solution to the current difficulties will have to include measures to rectify the fundamental rebalancing of the fleet capacity with the stock resources available, taking into account the operational costs involved for fishing vessel owners.  Grant aid totalling €41.1 million to decommission 46 fishing vessels under the 2008 fishing vessel decommissioning scheme has been announced.  Approved applicants have until 18 July to accept the offer and, if they do so, they must surrender fishing licences by 12 September 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_189">This represents a substantial commitment from the Government, bringing the Irish fishing fleet into balance with available resources and ensuring those remaining in the industry can be assured of a profitable future.  The removal of older, less efficient vessels will increase the quotas available to the more modern competitive fishing vessels and to smaller vessels and will contribute to achieving a more sustainable and profitable fleet.  The scheme delivers on a key recommendation of the strategy for a restructured, sustainable and profitable seafood industry 2007 to 2013, Steering a New Course, also known as the Cawley report.</p>
            <p eId="para_190">The Commission's discussion paper for short-term aid for the industry was the subject of detailed consideration at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 24 June.  The options being considered for such short-term aid carry strict criteria which include linkages to more fundamental fleet management measures.  Operating aid for fishing vessels is not permitted under EU state aid rules and any such measures introduced by EU member states would be in breach of EU law and subject to infringement proceedings in the European Court of Justice.  The Commission is intent on preserving a level playing field and reiterated this in its discussion paper at the Council meeting.  The paper states that there is an impending need to act in order to avert a severe crisis for the EU fishing industry.  The response must be EU wide and co-ordinated in order to avoid distorting competition between member states or fleets.</p>
            <p eId="para_191">At the Council meeting, and in line with the Commission's stated policy, we pushed Commissioner Borg to bring forward a new EU-funded package of measures to alleviate the immediate issues of concern to the Irish fishing industry.  We believe that an effective resolution to many of the issues facing the industry, including the impact of rising fuel prices and quotas, can only be achieved in an EU context.</p>
            <p eId="para_192">The Commission has consistently held the view that the main challenge for the EU fishing industry has been, and still is, the structural imbalance between fleet capacity and resources in many fisheries.  It firmly holds the view, with which I agree, that while the current crisis was triggered by high fuel prices, there are many other factors impacting negatively on the industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_193">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_194">These include illegal, unreported and unregistered, IUU, fishing activity and imports in the Union.  In this regard, I am pleased that the Council took strong action and new measures to combat IUU fishing, estimated at €1.1 billion of illegal imports into the Union annually, were agreed and will commence at the beginning of 2010.  I have also asked the Commission to bring forward urgently initiatives on research and innovation to find ways to develop more fuel-efficient engines and fishing practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_195">As it is clear that high fuel prices will remain, it is imperative, more than ever, to attack the root of the structural problems of the sector.  We have put a significant element of the solution to this in place and are delivering on it through the whitefish decommissioning scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_196">I was pleased with the short-term measures offered by several member states and with the response of the Commissioner Borg, who has undertaken to revert to the next Council meeting on 15 July with definitive proposals to address the issues facing fishermen.</p>

            <p eId="para_199">The Minister spoke of decommissioning the fleet, which has nothing whatsoever to do with my question.  I wish to know what short-term suggestions and measures Commissioner Borg proposed.  At a meeting yesterday in Athlone, which I attended, the fishermen were militant.  They did not discuss decommissioning or the Cawley report, which takes a long-term view of ways to maintain a profitable fishing industry.  The fishermen talked about what can be done for them in the next few weeks so that they will not go out of business.  These people are in dire financial need.  Having examined the matter, I believe the only option is tie-ups and I hope the Minister has discussed the possibility of this measure with Commissioner Borg.  I believe this is the only immediate, short-term measure which can save the fishing industry in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_200">The Minister in his reply suggested that the introduction of state aid packages was illegal, or that Governments should not adopt such a policy.  However, governments are doing this at present.  The Spanish Government, as Deputy Penrose said, will do whatever it must in order to save the Spanish fishing industry.  It may be illegal but it depends on the way the Spanish Government structures aid and provides it for Spanish fishermen.  What short-term measures have been put to Commissioner Borg to save the fleet, before decommissioning and the recommendations of the Cawley report are rolled out?  What short-term measures have been proposed to keep fishermen on the water?</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_201">I have met the fishermen and I know their concerns.  I have also heard these concerns from colleagues in the Oireachtas.  Several issues were put to Commissioner Borg both in the meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, and I and at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council.  We made progress on the IUU regulation, which I mentioned earlier in answer to a question from Deputy Penrose.  We also strongly made the case that the least people should expect in an industry is a level playing field in the regulation of catches which are taken illegally from our waters and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_202">We also strongly made the case for a marketing initiative to promote the purchase of good, wholesome, nutritious fish from European waters.</p>
            <p eId="para_203">There is a significant amount of illegal dumping into Union waters, which is the a cause of serious problems for European fishermen.  We are concerned about our fishermen.</p>
            <p eId="para_204">Another matter we put to the Commissioner, which is an issue high on the fishermen's agenda, is the matter of cod in the Celtic Sea.  We have asked for increased quotas and catch from that sea.  The marine institutes of Britain, France and Ireland put forward detailed scientific information to show that the stocking levels have improved.  The Commission receives its own scientific data and it was due yesterday on the last day of June.  We asked the Commissioner to revert to us as quickly as possible to see if an increase in catch could be allocated.  At the meeting Commissioner Borg was non-committal on the subject.  We pressed him very strongly in view of the available scientific data from the marine institutes of the three countries.  All agreed the stock levels had improved.  We have asked that those scientific submissions be given detailed consideration and that a decision is made.  The Commission has produced a paper.  We have asked for immediate financial aid from the European Union and we have outlined that very clearly.  There is a Common Fisheries Policy and a European response is needed.  Practically everybody at the Council of Ministers who had an interest in fisheries was pushing the same line, that initiatives are needed directly from the Commission.</p>

            <from>Deputy Tom Sheahan</from>
            <p eId="para_205">I come back to the immediate nature of the needs of the fishing industry.  The Minister spoke earlier about how other countries have different quota laws and it is very difficult for the Naval Service to regulate when boarding ships.  The Minister also spoke of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, or IUU, and regulations to combat it coming in by 2010.  I am talking about immediate measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_206">I will suggest one such measure.  We must receive EU funding but I have been told by fishermen that French and Spanish boats are working on diesel priced at 50 cent per litre, whereas Irish boats are working on diesel priced at 91 cent per litre.  It seems the governments in question have implemented this measure on behalf of their fishermen.</p>
            <p eId="para_207">An immediate measure which could be taken to help the fishermen and their fleet in this country is to consider harbour dues.  This would be of direct benefit to the fishermen and could be looked at immediately as an instant help.</p>

            <p eId="para_208">I do not know the differential in fuel price between countries but there is a specific measure in this country to assist fishermen with the cost of fuel.  At the Council of Ministers meeting, as well as bilateral meetings, we put a range of proposals to the Commissioner for consideration.  He took the views of all the different member states and he had to return to the college of Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_209">We pushed him very hard, outlining in particular that we get a very small share of the European fisheries fund.  Above all countries, we deserve a special EU-funded package because of the very small allocation we have received over the years and that we would get, as currently structured, between now and 2013.  We put the point to the Commissioner very forcefully, itemising particular areas where we thought funding could be put to very good use to deal with the immediate problems that affect the industry throughout the country.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Trevor Sargent)</from>
            <p eId="para_212">The farm waste management scheme was introduced by our Department in March 2006 in order to assist farmers to meet the additional requirements of the nitrates directive.  Under the scheme, a standard grant rate of 60%, or 70% in the four zone C counties, was available, and €114 million was spent on this scheme in 2007.  Payment claims substantially in excess of this figure are expected in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_213">The success of the scheme is evidenced by the fact that 48,580 applications were received from farmers under the scheme before the closing date of 31 December 2006.  To date, 41,750 approvals have issued to farmers to commence work.  The remaining applications have either been withdrawn, are awaiting the receipt of full planning permission or are explained by the receipt of multiple applications from a single farmer.  This Department is continuing to issue approvals on an ongoing basis as confirmation of the receipt of full planning permission is received from applicants and has already written to local authorities acknowledging the major contribution which they have made to this process, as well as reminding them of the importance of the end of 2008 deadline for completion of works under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_214">The 31 December 2008 deadline is a condition of the EU state aid approval governing the scheme.  Farmers must complete the works and submit a payment claim to the Department by this date in order that they can qualify for the generous grants available.  A notice has already been sent out by the Department to all approved farmers under the scheme reminding them of the importance of compliance with this deadline.  I am not in a position to ask the EU Commission to alter the terms of the state aid approval.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
            <p eId="para_215">Would it be helpful in determining the level of drawdown or feasible to write to all the applicants who now have approval?  This is an EU-aided scheme but if the drawdown would be smaller it could open opportunities to open the farm investment scheme again.  Writing to these farmers could advise them of the timeframe, which is impossible for them to comply with, and the Minister should take up that issue and engage positively with farming organisations on it in terms of social partnership.  I understand the matter is being raised in that context.  Writing to the farmers could also seek clear direction as to how many of them intend to draw down the offered funding.</p>

            <from>Deputy Trevor Sargent</from>
            <p eId="para_216">I have no doubt there will be many items on the social partnership agenda, of which this will be one.  I cannot pre-empt what will happen there.</p>
            <p eId="para_217">We are working within the result of a lobbying effort to the European Commission.  That has given us the date in question, and the Deputy will acknowledge there is not much room for movement on that basis.  There is a dynamic which should be of assistance in ensuring work is carried out, which is the change in the construction industry.  The Deputy knows that in rural areas, the farm waste management scheme has been very important to the number of bags of cement being sold, for example, up and down the country.  I expect many builders are appreciating the work being carried out and that whatever difficulties there would be in complying with the 31 December deadline will, somewhat paradoxically, be helped by the fact that work will now be available that might have been difficult to engage builders on previously.</p>

Given the importance of this scheme not only to environmental enhancement and farm management structures, but to the construction industry and work in general in rural areas in particular, will the Minister of State go to Europe on this?

            <p eId="para_227">I agree this is a very beneficial scheme, which is also generous.  It is a once-off and it was very clear in March 2006, when it was introduced, that it was the time to get involved and get the work done.  There has been much foot dragging, as the Deputy knows, over the years when it comes to the implementation of the directive in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_228">Far from going cap in hand, we have received Exchequer funding and a willingness from the European Commission to ensure we finally got our act together.  There has been a significant amount of flexibility brought to bear on this issue.  This is the reason I do not want to give any impression that there is some kind of slippage and people should take their foot off the pedal in the implementation of the scheme and getting the work done.</p>
            <p eId="para_229">I have written to local authorities to ensure they guarantee there are no delays in arranging permission and its side of the arrangement being complied with.  I have circulated a notice to all approved farmers under the scheme reminding them of the importance of compliance.  I do not want to give an impression that it may be possible to revisit the scheme.  Unfortunately, when this was done in the past, it resulted in slippage and the foot being taken off the pedal.  The Department wants the scheme to be implemented and the work done.  I call on all concerned to pull together to ensure this occurs.</p>

            <from>Deputy Trevor Sargent</from>
            <p eId="para_231">The report on veterinary practitioners by the Competition Authority was published on 19 June.  While the report found that legislation introduced by my Department in 2005 had gone a long way towards modernising the profession, it concluded that some reforms were still needed for consumers to benefit from competition.  It has identified the following restrictions which it believes need to be addressed: veterinary practitioners are prevented from competing through normal methods of competition such as advertising and offering discounts; vets are severely restricted in how they advertise and promote their business, which denies consumers access to basic information on the availability, terms and prices of veterinary services in their area; vets are unable to promote awareness of their practices and services which discourages them from innovating; a lack of transparency in prices reduces competitive pressure on vets, which can push up the price of veterinary services; and new vets are hindered from competing with established vets.</p>
            <p eId="para_232">The report makes five recommendations designed to address these restrictions and encourage vets to be more innovative in the delivery of services and ensure an adequate supply of veterinary services in the long term and value for money in veterinary services.  The recommendations are directed to my Department and the Veterinary Council of Ireland.  They are that the Department should monitor the number of vets providing food animal services, consider the introduction of lay testers for bovine tuberculosis and bring forward legislation amending the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 to allow incorporated veterinary practices.  In addition, the Veterinary Council of Ireland should remove unnecessary restrictions on advertising and its prohibition on touting.</p>
            <p eId="para_233">The Department will examine these recommendations in consultation with the Veterinary Council of Ireland and relevant interests. However, it is favourably disposed towards the further promotion of competition in the veterinary profession, thereby building on the measures it has introduced in recent years, particularly in the animal remedies area.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_108">
            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_234">One often wonders whether members of the Competition Authority live in the real world.  Many isolated rural communities are fortunate if one veterinarian decides to locate in the area.  While it is fine to speak about improving the veterinary service, does the Department really believe some of the theoretical propositions made by the Competition Authority have any application in rural areas?  Do those who produce reports such as this have any contact with reality?</p>
            <p eId="para_235">As in the case of general practitioners, persuading a veterinary practitioner to move to an area to serve its farming community often presents a challenge.  Has the Minister of State considered the possibility that the points system at college level is the major factor in curtailing the number of veterinary practitioners?  The supply of vets is the limiting factor because one cannot promote competition without adequate numbers of veterinary practitioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_236">We all want value for money.  From my experience of dealing with many veterinary practices during the years, I have found they give value for money and an excellent service.</p>

            <p eId="para_237">Is the Department considering legislative changes arising from the report of the Competition Authority?  To expand on Deputy Penrose's point, a significant number of veterinary practitioners have moved from large to small animal practices.  This ongoing shift is evident in rural areas.  I understand the Department has an obligation to monitor developments under existing legislation.  Are trends emerging in this area which would give cause for concern?</p>

            <p eId="para_238">Given that the report was received as recently as 19 June, the Department needs time to study it in greater detail.  Nevertheless, nothing has been ruled out.  The lack of availability of veterinary practitioners, a point raised by Deputy Penrose, is one of the reasons the Competition Authority has called for advertising rules to be relaxed so as to ensure greater innovation and competition.  Serious consideration should also be given to introducing lay testing for tuberculosis but I do not propose to rush to judgment on this recommendation.  We are aware that a degree of lay testing takes place in New Zealand and the United Kingdom.  We have an opportunity to act on recommendations but it is much too early to give definitive commitments.  Nothing has been ruled out at this point.</p>

          <p eId="para_242">Today the Ulster Bank and Halifax and First Active have raised their variable standard interest rates for the first time since 2001.  This development comes in the face of a further hike in interest rates by the European Central Bank when it meets on Thursday.  This will make life very difficult for hundreds of thousands of people who currently feel the pinch of rising prices, fuel costs, threats of unemployment, cutbacks in frontline services and a deterioration in the value of their pensions and houses.  In particular, 100,000 young people face the terrifying spectacle of their houses being lower in value than their mortgages.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">I remind the Taoiseach that he bears responsibility for a great deal of the problem, despite the fact that he and his Government will continually argue that it is due to international events.  I will quote his address to the National Mortgage Conference in January 2006 when, as Minister for Finance, he stated "there is certainly a consensus that the Irish mortgage and housing market has been strong over an extended period of years because the economic fundamentals of the Irish economy have been strong".  In April 2006, speaking to the Real Estate Alliance property conference, he assured the public, particularly young people considering whether they should use their savings to buy a home, that economic fundamentals were "anchoring the performance of the property market".  We now know there was no such consensus because in October 2005 the International Monetary Fund, backed up by the OECD, the ESRI and the Central Bank, stated the house price over-valuation in Ireland was large compared to other countries and could not be solely explained by economic fundamentals.  During his term as Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach knew and was being advised by the best experts at home and abroad that house prices were grossly over-inflated.  Does he accept any responsibility for this debacle and the position in which 100,000 young people, including many young couples, find themselves?</p>
          <p eId="para_244">Will the Taoiseach explain what the Minister for Social and Family Affairs meant yesterday when she said the Government was there to help people who lost their jobs or got into difficulty repaying their mortgages?  Was this an announcement of some new Government scheme for mortgage repayments?</p>

          <p eId="para_247">This was a proper response and it resulted in much greater benefits for a larger number of house buyers and those with mortgages than would have been the case had I taken on board some of the proposals put forward by the Opposition at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">I do not accept the point made by the Leader of the Opposition to the effect that I made an incorrect policy decision in choosing that option rather than proceeding with stamp duty reform at a time when house prices were appreciating.  If I had instigated such reform, prices would have been hiked up to an even greater degree because it was then a seller's market.  I continually made that point in the past and I stand by my assertion.  The reforms I put in place in the most recent budget were introduced at the appropriate time.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">On increasing interest rates, there is no doubt that difficulties in international markets and the lack of access to funds are causing problems in the context of the cost of the inter-bank rate for banks themselves.  That cost is being passed on to consumers.  I regret that this is a consequence of what occurred in international markets during the past eight or nine months.  Ireland is not immune to what happens in those markets.  Since joining the euro, we have enjoyed historically low interest rates.  I do not underestimate the increased costs accruing to mortgage holders.  However, the responses I brought forward in successive budgets in respect of increasing mortgage interest relief were appropriate and led to people benefiting.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_250">The Taoiseach was dragged, very reluctantly, towards taking action in respect of stamp duty.  When he finally took such action, it was too little too late.  If the Taoiseach is stating that he knew in advance that mortgage interest relief would have to be available in abundance through the Department of Social and Family Affairs, this makes the reply he has just given even worse.  He was advised by national and international experts that house prices in this country were grossly over-inflated.  He stated in September 2007 that the economy was stronger than at any previous point in history.  In April of this year, he said he was not concerned with regard to the slowdown in the construction sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">The Taoiseach now appears to be expressing helplessness and stating that we are not immune to international developments.  Such developments are not responsible for the highest increases in the cost of living in any of the eurozone countries since 2001 or the highest increase in unemployment among European Union states.  Ireland has been steadily losing its market export share since 2001.  These developments were not caused by international events and the Taoiseach served as Minister for Finance when they came about.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">The Taoiseach previously stated that we should engage in some straight talking on these matters.  Straight talking was the mark of the Deputy Cowen of old when he occupied the seat to his left in which the Minister of Health and Children is sitting.  What is the position?  Does the Taoiseach accept responsibility for the situation where 100,000 young people, single and couples, face the terrifying prospect that the value of their houses and pensions are deteriorating?  People's mortgages are now greater in value than the houses in which they live.  They are the mortgaged poor and have been made such by what was a phoney economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">The Taoiseach holds responsibility in respect of this matter because he led the economy to which I refer.  As Minister for Finance, he introduced successive budgets which were reckless in nature and which gave rise to inordinate levels of public spending.  The banks lent money, left, right and centre, and it was a case of "easy come, easy go" in the economy because it made people cheerful and helped win votes.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">Does the Taoiseach accept that the position in which we currently find ourselves was compounded by the actions he took when Minister for Finance?  The people to whom I refer are approaching Deputies on all sides of the House to voice their concerns regarding their mortgages and the threat of unemployment and the cuts in front-line services.  The problems to which I refer were created on foot of the construction of a phoney platform designed to get the Taoiseach's party through another election on the basis that people would assume that all was rosy in the garden when, in fact, that was not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">Will the Taoiseach see to it that the Ministry for Finance will not again become a tool used to encourage people or give them false hope, as was the case when it was claimed that the construction economy was built on a sound platform?  He was responsible for the economy for the past three years and he will now be obliged to suffer the consequences.  At least 100,000 people are going to find themselves in dire straits as a result of the actions he took when he served as Minister for Finance.</p>

          <p eId="para_288">For a couple of weeks, the Taoiseach and the Government have been communicating in coded language.  More use of this language is evident today.

The Minister for Finance stated on the "News at One" last week that resolute, prudent and determined action would have to be taken.  The Taoiseach also informed those at the IBEC dinner last week that it may be relatively painful to apply a corrective course now.  When speaking in New Ross, the Minister for Finance indicated that none of this means there will be cutbacks but rather that savings will have to be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">As the Taoiseach's predecessor might have said, the world, his brother and his mother knows that all of this coded language means that the Government is contemplating making cutbacks and introducing some form of stealth taxes.

          <p eId="para_290">Will the Taoiseach come clean and inform the Dáil and the people as to the nature of the corrective actions, measures, temporary adjustments and savings the Government intends to announce?

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_291">To answer Deputy Gilmore directly, the situation is clear.  We are experiencing a reduction in tax revenues.  As is normal, the Minister for Finance will have informed the Government in general terms about the figures to be released in advance of the publication tomorrow of the Exchequer returns by the Department of Finance.  They will be released tomorrow, not today, by that Department, in keeping with convention.  As a result of publication of those figures, the Minister for Finance will issue a statement.  As the Deputy is aware, we will have a debate next week on the NDP and the economy which will present a good opportunity for the Government to outline the general position.  Given that tax revenues will be back from where we expected them to be because of the international financial situation, it will be necessary for us to work to our expenditure targets within the budgetary parameters we have set ourselves.  That makes for a challenging time both for the remainder of this year and in respect of the opening position for next year.  Decisions will have to be taken in the context of the Estimates for next year's expenditure targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">This matter will be addressed calmly and sensibly in the context of informing the House in the normal way.  Deputies can be assured that the Minister for Finance will be in a position to make a statement to the House next week.  It is not for the Government to make decisions on foot of how eminent other financial institutions may be; it must decide on the basis of its own figures which are collated right up to the time of publication.  The Government is <i>au fait</i> with the general position and the Minister and his colleagues will determine the broad strategy to be adopted.  The Government will make decisions promptly and appropriately and we will discuss them in the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_297">It is not credible when for the past couple of weeks the Taoiseach and the Minister have spoken in this coded language and dropped hints all over the place about corrective action, prudent measures, savings and temporary adjustments.  Such language is creating the climate for the Government to engage in cutting various programmes and services and, possibly, introducing some stealth taxes.  In effect, what the Taoiseach has being doing for several weeks is communicating the preamble of what in effect will be a mini-budget, yet it appears he will not present it to the House.  As soon as it goes into recess, he will have a couple of months to put it into practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">Everybody knows that the public finances have changed.  Everybody understands the economic environment is different.  Incidentally, this is not an international matter.  It is largely due to the Taoiseach's mismanagement of the economy that we are in this hole.</p>

Is he trying to tell us that the Government has not been addressing this issue for quite some time?  It is incredible that he does not know, in general terms at least, the steps that will be taken, the programmes that will be hit and the expenditure that will be pared back.

          <p eId="para_340">No.  Last Thursday afternoon, the Minister of State, Deputy Máire Hoctor, misled the House, whether deliberately or not, I do not know.  However, she misled the House in response to questions regarding the Hawlbowline site in Cork harbour and the content of that site in terms of toxic and hazardous waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to provide for an extra 40 minutes after 10 p.m. to allow the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, to correct the record or for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make a statement on the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_342">I support Deputy Coveney's proposal.  Deputies who were in the House last Thursday afternoon will be aware five requests were made to the Ceann Comhairle for a Minister to come into the House to explain what was going on in Ringaskiddy.  The quality of the response received was wanting.  Questions raised by the community of the harbour area were not answered.  I note the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is present in the House.  It is urgent and critical that the community is assured, in terms of what is being done by Cork County Council and the Environmental Protection Agency to address what is an obvious health hazard in the Cork Harbour region, that the matter is being dealt with.</p>

          <p eId="para_343">The Department's remit is to facilitate a thorough investigation of the site and to report to Government thereon to allow for a Government decision on the future use of the site.  The Minister will report the outcome of this exercise to Government in the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">In the meantime, a contractor engaged in interim surface clearance works disturbed a quantity of hazardous material on the east tip.  In defiance of instructions from the Department the contractor persisted with unauthorised works and it ultimately became necessary to terminate his contract.  The Department's instructions, which were endorsed by the Environmental Protection Agency, were designed to prevent any further piecemeal unauthorised works which could have unknown environmental consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The matter is being handled by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The Minister has met with people from the area and has explained to them the situation in terms of the information available.  He will report on the matter to Government as soon as the report, in respect of the site which has existed for 30 years, becomes available.</p>

Deputy Lynch asked whether a notice at Haulbowline indicated that it was safe and Deputy Hoctor replied "I have just explained that there is no notice because there is no health risk".  The Taoiseach has responsibility for this matter.  The dumped materials at Haulbowline include mercury, lead, chromium 6, zinc and PCBs.</p>

I live in the area and have had calls from residents who are very concerned about the high levels of chromium 6 and mercury that have been known for years but covered up.  I ask the Taoiseach to publish the reports on this matter immediately so people's fears can be allayed.  Will the Minister make a statement in the House this evening on the matter?  This is extremely serious, why is it being covered up?  Why is the Minister running and hiding?</p>

One would hope people could take confidence from the fact that such an independent agency is in agreement with the Department's actions.  The Department is preparing a report on legacy issues which have affected the site since the 1930s and hopes to be in a position to submit to the Government a comprehensive appraisal of the best way of remediating the site.

          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_734">I thank the Minister of State for his effort.  On Committee Stage, the Labour Party made the point that we are a long way from allowing legal notice to be served by e-mail alone.  There is so much spam floating around on the Internet that it would be totally unreasonable to expect a person to have received a legal notice of obligation just because an e-mail was sent to him or her.  We suggested that notice by some other method, such as post, should also be required.  The Minister replied by stating the existing section 3(1)(<i>e</i>) applies only to persons who have agreed to receive communication by e-mail, as we know.  However, this is no solution to the problem because there is no safeguard with regard to what constitutes such agreement.  For example, ticking a box on a form or failing to do so could constitute agreement to receive legal notices by e-mail, even where a person is not fully aware of what he or she is agreeing to.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">The Labour Party reworded its Committee Stage amendment in light of what the Minister of State said to provide for a facility to acknowledge receipt of an e-mail.  This is a formula used in other legislation and ensures the e-mail has been read by the person to whom it was addressed.  The Minister of State stated he would consider our proposal and has done so in some form or other.  His response is not to the total satisfaction of the Labour Party.  It must be borne in mind that there is a criminal sanction involved, or certainly a sanction of a sort that would bring itself to bear on individuals in respect of legal notices they may not have received.  We wanted to ensure there is a facility for confirming receipt of notices.  The Minister of State has tried to meet our demands in some form, but not to the extent we would have liked because we are very careful in this regard.  However, it is a move in the right direction and I will therefore accept the Minister's proposition.</p>

          <p eId="para_751">This matter has exercised my mind, but not because I am a barrister, and I have a view on it.  The Minister of State has received advice contrary to mine and to my knowledge of the subject.  I am not tabling this amendment to be awkward but to ensure the legislation is foolproof and not subject to challenge.  I am concerned that it will not interfere with long-established practice with regard to the common law.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">The provision I propose to include states, "Documents subject to legal professional privilege shall not be liable to production under this section".  This would ensure the search taking place under the section would be constitutional.  The Minister of State said on Committee Stage that this amendment was not necessary and that the wording was not used in other legislation.  However, this is incorrect.  I do not say this lightly because he has certainly tried to be accommodating and tries to meet us half way.  Similar wording is used in many recent Acts, as in section 17 of the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, sections 96 and 131 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and section 16 of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004.  I state reluctantly that the information given to us on Committee Stage by the Minister of State was incorrect.  His advice that our amendment on Committee Stage would undermine other legislation is also incorrect in the context of what I have put forward.  I ask him to reconsider the provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">When the Minister of State said there was no such provision in other legislation, the Labour Party set about examining this.  Section 17 of the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, sections 96 and 131 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and section 16 of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004 include provisions similar to the one I propose.  Why can the Minister of State not accept it in the context of the other legislation?</p>

          <p eId="para_754">The Deputy was doing his homework.  I did not say there was no other legislation but pointed out the advice we received, that is, that these amendments are not necessary because the law relating to privilege exits in any case and because section 21 on evidence in proceedings, which was introduced by the Government on Committee Stage, provides in subsection (3) for any necessary reassurances that privilege applies.  The question of legal privilege is a matter for the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">There is a strong corpus of legislation and considerable precedent in the context of privilege.  The Government contends that what the Deputy proposes to include would undermine other legislative proposals in Acts that do not include the provision as proposed by him.  For these reasons and on the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel, the inclusion of the Deputy's proposal would diminish the guidelines on privilege in the context of legislation already in the Statute Book.</p>

          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_756">It does not diminish the standing of legal professional privilege in the legislation I have outlined, which passed through this House.  If my provision is included in three Acts passed in the past four years, how can the Minister make such an assertion?  I am surprised by the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel in this regard.  If the Parliamentary Counsel examined the legislation to which I refer, it would have noted the very provision I propose by way of my amendment.  I am sure it does not undermine any legislation.  Legal professional privilege is well-founded and one understands its <i>raison d’être</i>.  It is the court that ultimately decides what constitutes legal professional privilege but my provision would constitute a belt-and-braces protection for it.  I cannot understand why there is such reluctance to accept a provision contained in other legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_757">I try to accommodate Members in every way possible.  We asked the Parliamentary Counsel to reconsider this matter and it gave quite specific advice that the amendment should be rejected on the grounds I have outlined.  If I included the provision in this Bill, it could undermine other Acts.  Section 21(3) provides the necessary protections sought by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">I know the Deputy feels strongly about this matter and is advocating a belt-and-braces approach, but we already have a good belt in section 21 and do not need the braces.  On the basis of current legal advice, and regardless of the provisions contained in other legislation in the Statute Book, I urge the Deputy to withdraw his amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_764">In the interests of fairness, the Health and Safety Authority will have discretion as to the publication of names on whom prohibition orders have been issued.  This discretion is appropriate as it recognises scenarios including that where the matter giving rise to the notice has subsequently been put right or the notice has subsequently been cancelled or withdrawn.  I refer to the primary purpose of this legislation in respect of court orders or where a conviction has taken place and the Government stated it would consider this issue.  It decided that a prohibition notice was a bridge too far as by the time a prohibition notice was served, the issue might have been resolved and further proceedings may not have been necessary.  From that perspective, the Government considered this to be appropriate for court orders and for convictions themselves but not for prohibition.</p>

As I noted, the Government tried to facilitate their proposed amendments in every way possible.  This Bill primarily is to ensure the implementation of the REACH directive.

Opposition spokespersons hope their contributions will improve legislation and do not make them for point-scoring purposes.  I thank the officials because obviously this was fairly difficult for them to get through.  Obviously, there is a time constraint in this regard so the quicker it is enacted the better.  All those involved in the industry — the chemical industry was raised in the past hour or so — should take careful note of what is involved.  It is for the encouragement of everyone concerned that this legislation is enacted forthwith and that everyone takes cognisance of the thrust and objectives set out therein.</p>

          <p eId="para_820">Section 32A of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961, which was introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2006, established a process whereby a district judge can, even though outside the District Court district to which he or she is assigned, exercise the powers to issue arrest warrants, search warrants and other related warrants that relate to his or her District Court district.

          <p eId="para_821">In order to provide a workable system to deal with that circumstance, these amendments propose that the President of the District Court should be able to establish a panel of district judges who, on a temporary basis, would be able to exercise the warrant-making powers in question.  This power would normally be exercisable by the judge permanently or temporarily assigned to the District Court district in question; and the appropriate member or members of this panel of judges will be able to exercise that power concurrently with the assigned judge.

          <from>Deputy Barry Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_830">This series of amendments is concerned with the process for investigating complaints against solicitors.  For many years the Law Society has investigated allegations of misconduct arising either from complaints made by clients or routine inspections of solicitors' practices.  However, there is no express provision in the Solicitors Acts giving the society the power to investigate misconduct on the part of a solicitor.  Its power to investigate alleged misconduct is implied in various existing provisions.  Amendment No. 10 removes any doubt arising from the absence of an express provision by declaring in the new section 6A(1) that, for the avoidance of doubt, the society has and always had the power to investigate complaints of misconduct against solicitors.  Section 6(2) is a standard provision which is made when existing statutory provisions are being amended for the purpose of the avoidance of doubt and where the removal applies retrospectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">Amendments Nos. 12, 14 and 16 clarify that the Law Society has the power to investigate alleged misconduct by a solicitor, whether a complaint was made to the society by a client of a solicitor or where the alleged misconduct comes to the attention of the society in the course of carrying out its regulatory functions.  The amendments remove any possible doubt that the society's powers to investigate misconduct extend to complaints generated internally by the society itself, as well as to complaints made to it by clients.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">Section 9 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994 provides for the receipt and investigation by the society of complaints made by clients of excessive charging of fees by solicitors.  The section obliges the Law Society to take all appropriate steps to resolve the complaint by way of agreement between the parties.  The effect of amendment No. 15<b> </b>is to empower the society to continue to investigate a complaint under section 9 and, if justified by the results of this investigation, to proceed with disciplinary sanction against a solicitor for overcharging, notwithstanding the fact that the solicitor and client may have resolved the matter by agreement.  Otherwise the public interest would not be served by facilitating the frustration of a Law Society investigation by way of the solicitor coming to an agreement with the client — perhaps by a financial settlement.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">Section 19 of the 2002 Act provides for the extension of the solicitors' disciplinary regime to alleged misconduct on the part of apprentice solicitors.<b> </b>Amendment No. 19<b> </b>replicates for apprentice solicitors the provisions proposed in amendments Nos. 10 and 12.  Section 19 of the 2002 Act commenced on 1 January 2003; accordingly, subsection (2) of the new section being inserted by amendment No. 19 provides that the amendment will have retrospective effect to that date.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">The Law Society is required by section 7 of the Solicitors Act 1960 to bring the report of the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal to the High Court in cases where the tribunal has found that there has been misconduct and where it leaves the question of the sanction to be decided by the High Court.   Amendments Nos. 11 and 18<b> </b>clarify that the society is entitled, on bringing a report of the tribunal to the High Court in regard to a finding of misconduct against a solicitor or against an apprentice solicitor, to make submissions to the court.  Currently, the right of the society to address the High Court in such matters is not expressly provided for in the Solicitors Acts, although this has been the practice for many years and the practice is regulated in court rules.  Rule 8 provides that the society may seek such an order for sanction as it deems appropriate and reasonable having regard to the findings of the tribunal.  Recently, the High Court considered, as a preliminary point, the right of the society to address it on the sanction to be imposed in a particular case.  The purpose of amendments Nos. 11 and<b> </b>18 is to make such an enabling provision and remove any possible future doubt.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">Amendment No. 28 adds the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 2002 to the Long Title of the Bill consequent on amendments Nos. 17 and 18.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_836">I am more puzzled by this group of amendments and would like to hear about their origin from the Minister of State.  When the Bill started out in life, it included, essentially, many of the sections that have since become the Legal Services Ombudsman Bill.  By agreement, these sections were stripped from the Bill at the time to comprise a stand-alone Bill for all of the reasons we know.  It seems that this group of amendments ought to be included in that Bill.  I am puzzled to know why we are here dealing with amendments that have to do with complaints against members of the legal profession, specifically solicitors, when we are dealing with a different Bill designed precisely for that purpose.  Is it that this is an afterthought on the part of the Minister?  Does it arise from representations from the Law Society arising from what have been euphemistically referred to as recent events?  Why are they being dealt with in this Bill and not the Legal Services Ombudsman Bill?  It is also somewhat surprising and the first time I have become aware of it.  I thought the Law Society was supposed to be doing this for a very long time.  The Minister of State seems to be saying it may be doing so but that there is no statutory basis for it and that he is now providing such a statutory basis for the society for the avoidance of doubt.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">I also wonder about the retrospective element.  Is it feared that there will be a challenge to it?  Subsection (2) of amendment No. 10 seems to anticipate or wants to protect against solicitors who might challenge it.  I refer to where a question of constitutional rights might be at issue.  It states: "If subsection (1) would, but for this subsection, conflict with a constitutional right of any person, the operation of that subsection shall be subject to such limitation as is necessary to secure that it does not so conflict but shall otherwise be of full force and effect".  That is a somewhat unusual belt and braces provision.  While is not unique, it is unusual.  We are dealing with the power of the Law Society to investigate alleged misconduct by solicitors.  Is it just a belt and braces measure to deal with cases where a constitutional right may appear to have been infringed, or does it anticipate a challenge on that basis?</p>
          <p eId="para_838">On the face of it, the amendments ought to be included in the Legal Services Ombudsman Bill.  When a miscellaneous provisions Bill such as this is put together, there are widely diverging areas of civil law encompassed in it.  If one were a practitioner, it is not exactly the most convenient way to go about our business but I am intrigued as to why the amendments are not included in the Legal Services Ombudsman Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelWDArcy" eId="spk_480">
          <from>Deputy Michael D’Arcy</from>
          <p eId="para_839">I was given this job a few days ago when it became known that Deputy Flanagan could not be here.  When I looked at the Bill, I discovered that it had began its life as the Legal Services Ombudsman Bill.  Sections had been removed and we were left with bits and pieces, so to speak, of which there are not many.  On the completion of almost the first full year of this Dáil, there has been little legislation.  This is exactly what it states, a miscellaneous provisions Bill.  There is very little in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">I take issue with the section on apprentices.  It is fine in Dublin city where there are a certain number of positions with the major firms, but there are smaller practices of one or two in the country, with people falling over one another to get into a practice.  The Minister of State is giving the Law Society the power to investigate an apprentice.  An apprentice is not an employee and the person in charge of the practice is effectively supervising his or her work and bringing him or her up to speed on the day-to-day workings.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">I do not know whether providing that apprentices can be subject to disciplinary action by the Law Society is the best way to go.  If the intention is to do this, I question why it was not in the Legal Services Ombudsman Bill 2008 so that it would be the legal service ombudsman, rather than the Law Society, who could investigate such matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">I welcome the section that removes the age limit for jurors — it was an issue I pressed in my capacity as equality spokesperson for Fine Gael — so that a person has the opportunity to serve up to the age of 70.  I also welcome that they are not obliged to do so, that there is a choice.  If somebody chooses to be relieved, this is possible on the grounds of their age.</p>

          <p eId="para_843">Deputy Rabbitte is correct that the original elements of the Bill that became the Legal Services Ombudsman Bill are now a separate Bill.  However, the Solicitors Acts were due to be amended by this Bill originally, hence the fact that they are still in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">My information is there was no particular lobbying by the Law Society.  As I mentioned in my original comments, Mr. Justice McKechnie raised it as a preliminary point.  It was a concern he had about the implicit power of the Law Society and the tribunal.  Therefore, it was thought prudent to include these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">The retrospective point Deputy Rabbitte makes is a reasonable one.  However, I am informed that it is not unusual for retrospective power to be included in legislation of this nature.  In any case, it could be argued that the implicit powers of the Law Society in the previous legislation would have been challenged by now had there been a question.  The persons who are investigated in these circumstances would have access and the resources to challenge any power which they felt was <i>ultra vires</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">On the points made about apprentices, it has been possible to investigate an apprentice solicitor since the 2002 Act.  Following on from the concerns of Mr. Justice McKechnie, we are clarifying the point so there is no doubt and that what was an implicit power will now be explicit, with retrospective effect.</p>

          <p eId="para_849">It is interesting that there has been no input, according to the Minister of State, from the Law Society.  In other words, if it has been operating on the assumption that it has had these powers, implicit or otherwise, over the years, I wonder what its view is about the fact that we are now giving formal expression to them in this new law.  Perhaps it is six of one and half a dozen of the other that it is in this Act, but it does not ring true with me that this was an afterthought as the Bill progressed through the Seanad.  Something must have sparked it.  Something must have caused it to emerge now, otherwise it would have been in the original Bill.  Whether it is allocated to the Legal Services Ombudsman Bill or this one may be a matter of no great import.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">I can only take the Minister of State at his word that he has professional advice that the retrospective element is perfectly consistent here.  It just occurred to me that there must be some reason for taking care to ensure provision for such retrospection.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">Deputy D'Arcy seemed to have a reasonable point on apprentices.  I did not know that type of responsibility could attach to an apprentice.  I would have thought that if an apprentice was found to be allegedly involved in some kind of misconduct or miscreance, that would be a matter for the partner in the company or the master, rather than the apprentice.</p>

          <p eId="para_854">It is a recent judgment, since the publication of the Bill.  In fact, the Bill predates this Dáil and, therefore, the events to which I think Deputy Rabbitte is referring — the concerns about individual solicitors — post-dated the publication of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">In any case, I made the point to Deputy D'Arcy that the power to investigate apprentices is in the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 2002.  That has already been an implicit power in the same way as regards fully qualified solicitors.  The purpose is to put everything on a level playing field arising from the concern expressed in the judgment to which I referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">These points were brought to the attention of the Department by the Law Society but it would be stretching it to say that it lobbied for this particular point.  It simply brought the matter to our attention and it was discussed in the normal way.</p>

          <p eId="para_857">Solicitors at present carry on business either as sole traders with unlimited civil liability or as partnerships with collective and individual unlimited civil liability.  The provisions of section 7 of the Attorneys and Solicitors Act 1870 restrain a solicitor in seeking to limit his or her liability in a contract agreed with a client.  This puts Irish solicitors at a competitive disadvantage in commercial law against UK law firms, which may limit their liability by contract with clients consequent on the repeal of the 1870 Act in the UK some years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">UK law firms which are active in Ireland in commercial law matters limit their liability as a matter of routine.  The anomalous nature of the current position becomes especially apparent when in substantial projects an Irish firm of solicitors must join with other professional advisers to provide a multidisciplinary team and the other advisers can limit their exposure while the Irish solicitor cannot. In practice, this acts as a disincentive to an Irish firm to organise or lead a consortium of advisers since the primary responsibility for services provided by the consortium will often have to be accepted by the leading firm.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">Section 26 (<i>a</i>)(<i>1</i>), in amendment No. 17, will update the existing 19th century statutory provisions, which the UK has repealed, to take account of current commercial and competitive realities.  The change will bring Irish law in line with current UK law and allow Irish law firms to seek and do business in competition with foreign law firms on equal terms.  It will address the anomalous situation where an Irish and a UK firm agree a limit on liability which can then be enforced by the UK firm, but may not be enforceable by the Irish firm owing to the continued application of the Attorneys and Solicitors Act 1870.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Section 26(<i>a</i>)(<i>2</i>), in amendment No. 17, clarifies that the existing consumer protection provisions in the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 and the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995 and 2000 will continue to be available to clients of solicitors in the event that they make a contract which limits their solicitors’ liability.  In addition, section 26(<i>a</i>)(<i>3</i>), in amendment No. 17, includes a safeguard for the client’s protection in the form of a provision preventing the enforcement of such a contract to the extent that it falls below the general statutory minimum amount of professional indemnity cover required of solicitors which currently stands at €2.5 million.  This safeguard would especially continue to protect the interests of non-commercial clients of solicitors in areas such as conveyancing.</p>

          <p eId="para_862">I would never criticise a Minister or Minister of State for agreeing to an amendment or changing his mind as a Bill progresses through the House.  However, in the case of this Bill, as is frequently the case with justice legislation, much of the ingenuity is inspired by the Department and the Minister.  The question of why seemingly significant matters are added on Report Stage in the Seanad arises.  I heard it said recently that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has produced as much legislation in the first year of this Parliament as the other 14 Departments together, which is a worthy track record in making it up as one goes along.  Under the previous regime, we frequently had amendments longer than the original Bill.  One wonders what is the cause of this and whether legislation gets adequate scrutiny before we find it enshrined in law.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">The work on this legislation is of some significance for commerce.  The new freedom conferred on solicitors allowing them enter into this type of contract seems significant.  If it is the case that we are at a competitive disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> other common law neighbouring jurisdictions, then it should be attended to.  It is too long since I studied this law, but the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, will be able to tell me which other contents of the 1870 Act might be repealed in addition to section 7.  I presume the Minister of State and the Department are satisfied that the repeal of section 7 alone is adequate.  We have spent a good deal of time removing from the Statute Book legislation which is out of date and so on.  The existing legislation which is relevant for commerce seems to be dramatically out of date.</p>

I am grateful to the Labour Party for proposing amendment No. 21 in this group, which removes the upper age limit for coroners' juries, an amendment which the Government supports.  We are all agreed these changes are worthwhile, so as to reflect the increasing role and contribution of older people in society and the fact that the mandatory retirement age has been raised.  The changing demography of our population shows an increasing age profile as more and more people continue to live longer, healthier lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">Keeping the right of excuse on age grounds will ensure that any person more than 65 years of age does not lose an existing right and can be excused from service as of right if he or she wishes.  The approach serves to make the possibility of jury service available to older people, while at the same time ensuring that the availability does not impose a burden in any individual case.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">Amendment No. 22, the bulk of which was in the Bill already as passed by this House, replaces provisions in the Juries Act 1976 dealing with people described at present as "incapable persons".  The new language approved already by this House replaces the current rather infelicitous expression with a provision better designed to exclude those for whom, because of inability to read or some enduring infirmity, it is not practicable to sit on a jury.  This restatement in amendment No. 22 is necessary for drafting reasons so as to incorporate the necessary provision to abolish the 70 year old age limit.</p>

          <p eId="para_875">I welcome these measures.  I met a senior retired civil servant recently and I told him I had just finished tabling the equivalent of amendment No. 21 and that he would in future be able to sit on the appropriate jury.  He inquired if I was in my right mind.  The point is that if one is in one's right mind, one should have the opportunity to serve.  Some older people wish to carry out an act of good citizenship.  There are now a greater number of persons of 65 years of age and over than 30 years ago.  The amendment is positive, allowing older people to participate, and will benefit society from the contribution of experienced people with time on their hands and an interest in this area.  Can the Minister of State say with regard to the capacity of one to excuse oneself from service, if there provision for a person over 65 years of age who chooses not to serve?</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_876">I welcome some of these amendments, especially those removing an upper age limit.  I published a Bill to give effect to this change.  The extent of this has been taken on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">That said, I am not entirely happy with the wording relating to "incapable" persons.  I know of many business people who have survived and thrived in business despite not being capable, at this stage, of reading.  They would be excluded from serving on a jury.  In this day and age, to have a prohibition on deaf people serving on a jury is regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">If we look at other jurisdictions, the United States has removed the restrictions on deaf and blind people serving on juries — all US courts now allow deaf and blind people to serve on juries.  Clearly, there would be practical issues to overcome but by doing so — having an interpreter or a signer for people — we would ensure that a deaf or blind citizen is allowed to play their full role as a citizen.  Deafness or blindness is not a sufficient reason to prevent persons from serving on a jury.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">I do not know if a recent court case taken by Ms Joan Clarke and FLAC is concluded.  It reinforced the position I am taking.  I advocate that we amend this amendment to allow people who are deaf and blind serve.  I welcome that the upper age limit has been removed as it was high time this was done.  That part of the language is progressive but we are falling behind in the latter part of amendment No. 22 in particular.</p>

          <p eId="para_880">I welcome the comments of the Deputies.  The capacity for a person to excuse oneself continues in the new Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">With regard to Deputy Ó Snodaigh's comments, the new language refers to an enduring impairment and removes the reference to an insufficient capacity to read, deafness or other permanent infirmity.  That language has been removed and is replaced with "an enduring impairment".  It goes on to say "such that it is not practical for them to perform the duties of a juror".  That language clearly indicates that if it is practical for a deaf person, a person who cannot read or any people in the other categories of impairment to serve on a jury, they shall do so.  I hope this answers the Deputy's concerns in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">As the judgment is reserved in the FLAC case, it is inappropriate for me to comment on it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Barry Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_883">This amendment is to a provision of the Bill that amends the Legal Aid Act 1995 regarding the powers of the Legal Aid Board to waive or reduce contributions payable by the board's clients for its services.  Deputies will be aware that the Legal Aid Board does not provide a free service; it requires its clients to pay a contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">At present, section 29 enables the board to waive all or part of that contribution.  The motivation behind the changes to section 29 contained in the Bill is simply to put beyond doubt concerns which the board has regarding its own power to waive or reduce the contribution payable by one of its clients in circumstances where that contribution has been assessed at a level above the minimum.  At present, the board's conclusion is that it does not have this authority.  Once this amendment is passed, it will unambiguously have this authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">Concern was also raised in both Houses regarding the application of the "severe hardship" standard as the criterion governing whether a contribution could be reduced or waived.  The choice of language in the original amendment was informed by the language in the current legal aid regulations; this amendment proposes to replace that term with "undue".</p>
          <p eId="para_886">This latter expression is more widely found in legislation generally and does not have the extreme connotations which might have been conveyed by, or read by some into, the term "severe".  It also better reflects the reality of how the board would operate such a standard.  The intention is not to set the standard unreasonably high, while still providing that it would not simply apply in all cases, since it might be said that any request for a contribution would involve some hardship to a person on a modest income, in so far as it would reduce their immediate disposable income.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelWDArcy" eId="spk_500">
          <from>Deputy Michael D’Arcy</from>
          <p eId="para_887">I compliment the Seanad on removing the word "severe" and replacing it with "undue".  Certainly, facing into this economic downturn, there will be a challenge.  The Free Legal Advice Centre will have much more work on its hands with regard to lending institutions taking repossession of properties.  The term "severe hardship" was too narrow an interpretation and "undue" will make the service accessible to many more people.  Whoever came up with "severe hardship" was certainly intent on not letting it be available to as many people as practicable.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">I question the interpretation of "undue".  My reading of what the Minister of State is saying is that the free legal advice centre will be the body interpreting "undue" on an individual or case by case basis.  If that is the case, I appeal for the service to be made available to as many as is practicable.  I am not saying it should be made available to everybody but within the last number of months an amount of work has been coming to my clinics and office relating to people with financial difficulties because of the economic downturn and other matters.  In the spirit of this debate, the free legal advice centre should make its services available to the many rather than the few.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_889">I concur with the sentiments expressed by Deputy D'Arcy and do not want to repeat them.  This has been a very important reform in society for people on low incomes and it provides very valuable access to justice for them.  I take at face value what the Minister stated about the amendment before us in terms of first satisfying the board itself that it has the power, in certain circumstances, to waive or mitigate the normal expected subscription.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">"Undue" is a less onerous hurdle than "severe".  I welcome its introduction in terms of dealing with the issue, which is significant.  The issue was significant even at the height of the boom, as access to justice in Ireland can be expensive.  People who find themselves in circumstances of having to endure low incomes have this as pretty much their only route to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">There are solicitors and barristers who take cases <i>pro bono</i>.  However, such cases are usually exceptional, high profile or involve important issues.  They are not the everyday route to the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">Will the Minister of State indicate what is the general picture in terms of backlogs, waiting times and so forth?  Although the position differs from county to county, one has the impression that the free legal advice centres are under a good deal of pressure, that waiting times are unreasonable for a certain type of case in which time is of the essence and that some of the centres find it difficult to respond as quickly as one would like.</p>

          <p eId="para_894">Will the Minister of State explain the difference between the adjectives "severe" and "undue"?  Why not dispense with adjectives and use only the word "hardship"?</p>
          <p eId="para_895">With a downturn under way in the economy, more people will seek access to free legal advice centres.  Given the decision to substitute the word "severe" with "undue", I presume the workload of the centres will increase.  A commitment is needed to ensure they are properly funded to deliver justice and the service many in financial hardship seek.</p>

          <from>Deputy Barry Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_896">If one were to remove the adjectives "severe" and "undue", one would be left with the word "hardship" which could describe any number of circumstances.  An attempt must be made to ensure the hardship being experienced is objectively causing a difficulty for the individual.  As I indicated, we do not want to achieve a reduction in a person's immediate disposable income.  Rather, we want to ensure the service is available to persons in a difficult financial position.  That is the reasoning for the inclusion of the words "severe" and "undue".</p>
          <p eId="para_897">The Legal Aid Board will continue to decide what is "undue" hardship.  This gives it a degree of robustness in terms of its independence.  The availability of free legal aid will not be affected by the proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">While I do not have figures to hand on waiting times for legal aid, I am sure the Department will undertake to provide them for Deputy Rabbitte.</p>

        <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_504">
          <from>Deputy Ciarán Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_899">I welcome several aspects of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008.  We need to target the significant increase in the number of supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations with off-licences.  We must specifically examine the issue of below cost selling and special promotions.  I also welcome the move to review existing sanctions and penalties, particularly those directed towards combating excessive and under age alcohol consumption.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">I am not completely convinced that reducing the opening hours of certain bars will, in one fell swoop, rid us of all the modern day ills of alcohol.  Many are concerned about the proposal to reintroduce closing times which they regard as an unwanted intrusion in their lives.  I simply wish to voice these concerns; it is an issue on which the Give us the Night campaign has been vocal.  The Government has a duty to strike a correct balance between individual freedoms and the proper regulation of the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">Proper planning is required, including in the area of opening hours.  For example, taxi deregulation eliminated many of the queues for taxis faced by those leaving licensed premises late at night.  The vast majority of those who go out late in the evening are clubbing or are, by nature, late socialisers.  They go out to have a beer, listen to good music and dance.  I am concerned that this group will be restricted by the 2.30 a.m. closing time.  Perhaps a more sophisticated approach should be taken to closing times to ensure we do not unduly discriminate against those who wish to socialise, particularly after a hard working week.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">The 1 a.m. closing rule for Sundays does not reflect the changed work environment.  The large numbers working in the service and retail sectors such as cafes want to enjoy themselves as much as the rest of us.  Sequential closing times of bars and nightclubs have been proposed.  For obvious reasons, the alternative term — "staggered closing times" — is not considered the best use of words.  Joking apart, an argument can be made for some form of sequential closing to ensure people leave premises at different times during the evening.  This would relieve much of the pressure on public transport and fast food restaurants and could result in a reduction in the number of public order offences.  In short, it would lead to a more orderly dispersal of people onto the streets.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">Such a system could be regulated by geographical location and types of bars and nightclubs.  I hope the Minister will consider such an approach.  We should reflect on what works elsewhere.  In Italy, for example, the level of binge drinking is perhaps 2% compared to a figure in excess of 30% here.  We could learn lessons from the continental model.  From my experience, having lived in Italy some time ago, there is a strong association between food and alcohol.  In small bars, even those no bigger than the Dawson Lounge not too far from Leinster House, food is served at all hours of the day and night.  While there has been a move towards providing more food in pubs in recent years, the shutters still tend to go down in mid-evening.  If one walks into almost any Irish pub after 9 p.m. and asks for food, the chances are one will be offered nothing more than a packet of peanuts.  Likewise, the later it is in the evening the less likely it is that one will have the choice of having a non-alcoholic beverage such as tea and coffee.  Much could be done in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">The pricing structures on licensed premises need to be examined.  The price of a non-alcoholic beer is frequently equal to or greater than the price of alcohol.  The Minister may need to address this issue in this Bill or future legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">There are other matters that could be addressed, namely, the advertising of alcohol.  I concur with those who argue for a blanket ban on such advertising.  We have a difficulty with alcohol in this country.  As a result, it should not be promoted through the medium of sports events or advertisements which, to a certain degree, glamorise it.  We should reconsider the position in respect of its advertising.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">While we should consider the responsibilities of the users of alcohol, we should also examine those of publicans.  There is an onus on them not to serve those who are clearly intoxicated.  From my limited knowledge of the Temple Bar area in the centre of Dublin, I cannot but be of the view that many publicans are disregarding this aspect of the licensing legislation, in which it is stated people who are clearly intoxicated should not be served.  I am not referring to those who might be tipsy or merry.  I refer instead to the many people one sees on the streets of Dublin who were obviously visibly drunk when they were served alcohol in pubs.  We should take greater action in respect of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">In the United States, not only the owners of public houses but also their bar staff are liable for the actions of those to whom alcohol is served.  If a person knocks back three or four drinks and then drives his or her car, legal liability rests with the individual who served him or her alcohol.  If we were to extend legal liability in this country, not only to publicans but also to their staff, it would concentrate their minds on the need to ensure people do not leave their premises in a state of severe intoxication.  Such an extension of legal liability merits investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">I wish to vent my spleen on the issue of super-pubs.  I reiterate that the emergence of such establishments during the past decade has led to a dramatic deterioration in the behaviour of patrons and in the quality of drinking places throughout Ireland.  Small, intimate venues that were strong in heritage have been literally ripped apart in order to allow for greater amounts of alcohol to be served.  Some of the pubs I frequented in my younger drinking days such as the Temple Bar and many other establishments in that neck of the woods have had their hearts ripped out and been replaced by premises with all the atmosphere of an airport departure lounge.  We should reconsider those aspects of the licensing laws which allow for massive increases in the areas of public houses given over to drinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">I am concerned by the phenomenon of "vertical drinking", whereby those who own pubs remove most of the seating on the premises, turn up the volume on the sound system, refuse to serve food and try to shove as much alcohol as possible down the throats of their patrons.  This type of establishment represents a huge step backwards and is far removed from the small, intimate bar in which one can have a conversation with the owner who will then keep an eye on one and refuse to serve if one is clearly drunk.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">The legislation is a step in the right direction in some respects.  However, I am concerned about the proposal to reduce opening hours.  Sequential closing might have a great deal to offer in combating the binge drinking culture.  I have no doubt that the Minister will examine other aspects of the legislation on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_911">I thank Deputy Cuffe for sharing time.  I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">When discussing issues such as drugs and alcohol, one always feels one is showing signs of one's age and that one sounds like one's grandmother.  However, I am not going to pass up the opportunity to sound like my grandmother or the Minister of State's for that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">Clearly, alcohol is a gateway drug which, for young people, opens up the way to an entirely new culture.  People are increasingly drinking at a young age.  The difficulties we face are clear, particularly when one analyses some of the statistics.  The statistics to which I refer indicate that 28% of all attendances at accident and emergency departments in acute hospitals in respect of injuries are alcohol-related, that alcohol was a contributory factor in 36% of all fatal crashes, that it was also a factor in 25% of severe domestic abuse cases and that 46% of those who had committed homicide were intoxicated.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">We must, as a society, address the problems to which the consumption of alcohol gives rise.  Politicians or political institutions will not be able to deal with this matter on their own.  Action must be taken in consultation with parents and the Government.  Everyone has a role to play.  Gordon Holmes and the alcohol advisory group have done excellent work in crystallising the difficulties and challenges we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">While it is clear that the Bill will not solve all our difficulties, it represents another step towards tackling many of the issues to which I refer.  Deputy Cuffe referred to the problem of binge drinking.  Such drinking is a very visible problem among young people.  The introduction of alcopops such as fat frogs and others has, in the case of young people, made drinking trendy.  When I was young, I did not drink.  However, my friends used to hide the fact that they were drinking.  They used to go to the bottom of the local field where they could not be seen or heard, except on occasion.  It is almost a badge of honour now for young people to be seen walking around with bags or trays of cans of alcohol.  I am concerned that it is almost trendy to be seen weighed down with alcohol on one's way to the local field, someone's house or wherever it is that young people drink these days.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">During the period 1999 to 2005 the number of juvenile offences almost trebled.  That is a matter of concern.  I have two young children who, thankfully, have not yet reached drinking age.  However, it is worrying for parents to face the eventuality of their children going off to hang out with their friends.  One must give one's children a certain degree of independence but one must also know their whereabouts and have some control over them, which is becoming increasingly difficult.  In certain areas of my constituency children gather each Friday evening to drink outside the shops.  This is a cause of grave concern for people who live in those areas and the Garda, which is not in a position to solve the problem.  This Bill will certainly make it easier to address difficulties as they arise on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday evening.  Gardaí will now have the power to seize alcohol.  The problem does not only arise in respect of young people because my age group does not set a good example for our children.  In Temple Bar, adults are rolling out of pubs incoherent and unstable.  That happens all over the city.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">The Government needs to support cultural change through legislation, as it did in the past when drink driving was not regarded as a serious offence.  The practice is now frowned upon thanks to a mixture of legislation and education.  This Bill will support those who are trying to address alcohol abuse in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">Supermarkets are a serious problem in terms of below cost selling.  The Competition Authority would say that below cost selling cannot be prohibited for competition reasons but when it has such a social impact we, as legislators, must override the authority's rigid adherence to the free market.  Some form of regulation is needed.  Petrol stations appear to be a problem in terms of easy access to alcohol.  I would prefer that petrol stations sell nothing but petrol, although I appreciate the severe problems this would cause in rural areas.  I am speaking from a Dublin perspective and acknowledge that many rural petrol stations have morphed into community shops and have become the centres of village life in many places.  Simply banning petrol stations from selling beer would not suffice but it might be considered within city limits.  In the city centre and the suburbs, the sale of alcohol in garages is clearly a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">I welcome the Minister's proposed changes in respect of early houses.  While they may not be the place to drink fine wines, early houses play an important part in Dublin's inner city and working class communities.  Many of them are frequented by taxi drivers and shift workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">This Bill is a good step forward and I have no hesitation in supporting it.</p>

          <p eId="para_923">I welcome this Bill as an attempt to impact on a national cultural issue which is causing severe damage across our society.  However, I would prefer it to be made part a coherent Government policy across a range of Departments.  It is a start in that it restricts off-sale times, requires wine licences to be granted by the District Court, provides for structural separations, CCTV, fire and safety and theatre licensing and gives gardaí powers to seize containers.  It also provides for test purchasing, which is controversial in that it could be seen as entrapment.  The Bill imposes a two-day closure as a minimum penalty, increases fines and gives the Minister powers to bring in restrictions on advertising, reduced prices and special deals.  Part 3 of the Bill deals with public order and alcohol abuse.  Age cards are an important provision in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">The Bill appears to address two areas, namely, under age drinking and the abuse of alcohol by those over the age of 18.  Under age drinking is an important issue.  Last night, I received a letter from a constituent informing me about young people who were congregating in an area behind his house to drink out of cans and bottles.  They abuse alcohol and cause public disturbances but manage to outwit gardaí by leaving as soon as the latter arrive and returning 20 minutes later.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">I note what young people have to say, however.  The Ombudsman for Children recently launched a report in this House which she described as a big ballot.  She engaged with 74,000 young people across the country and found that they are looking for a safe place to visit.  I call on the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to bring forward the provisions of the Youth Work Act 2001.  Young people are calling for youth cafés in every town.  They need places to socialise but in towns throughout Ireland they have nowhere to go until they are old enough for the pubs other than walking the streets or, often, drinking alcohol in the fields and bushes.  We need to put a comprehensive youth service in place with trained workers who can engage with young people.  The cost will be high but the overall savings will be huge.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">This country is facing a health epidemic caused by alcohol abuse.  Speakers on all sides of the House have noted the rampant abuse of alcohol in this country.  That will have a serious impact on health in terms of liver problems and cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">Education in schools is important but I taught these issues for the best part of 20 years and am aware that the effect is limited because the audience is captive and takes little notice.  We should consider the establishment of a proper youth service that would be integrated with health services, the justice system and the gardaí in every town and village.  Trained youth workers could engage with young people and bring them off the streets and into youth centres.  All they want is a safe place to sit and eat with their friends.  We should provide an alcohol-free environment for young people.  I do not know why that is not being provided.  Many of the provisions of the 2001 Act have not yet been implemented.  The Act was lauded when it was passed and the national youth development plan was introduced a couple of years later, but neither has been progressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">The introduction of an age card is crucial.  People working in off-licences and pubs should be over 21 because people under that age can come under strong pressures to serve alcohol to minors.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">I call for the establishment of an office of alcohol control.  The Office of Tobacco Control has been quite successful.  An office of alcohol control could bring together all Departments and State agencies.</p>

          <p eId="para_955">The decision at the most recent Council of Ministers to kick to touch on the issue of a financial rescue package for the Irish fishing industry is viewed with alarm by those employed in the industry.  There was a clear understanding at the initial meeting between the Federation of Irish Fishermen and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Minister of State that decisions would flow from the Council meeting on 23 and 24 June.  That no immediate assistance has come from it is largely the reason we are debating this substantial motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">The fishing industry has immediate and long-term structural difficulties.  The latter will be irrelevant if the immediate difficulties which, simply put, concern direct financial aid to enable the industry to survive the current problems, are not dealt with.  For that reason, I propose to dwell on the positives in respect of last week's Council meeting.  Progress was made on the issue of illegal, unreported and unregulated, IUU, fishing, which is welcome from a conservation point of view.  This should lead to better prices for fish legally landed.  It is estimated that IUU fish in the EU market are worth €1 billion or account for approximately 12% of the market.  This agreement is welcome and everybody involved is to be commended.  What is not clear is the timeframe within which the benefits of this decision will flow.  I suspect — the Minister confirmed this at Question Time this afternoon — that it will take at least two years for the benefits to flow.  Welcome as the decision is — the Slovenian Presidency, the Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commissioner are entitled to take credit for this agreement — it will not put a single euro in the pockets of Irish fishermen in the short term.  While I acknowledge the work done in this respect, it is not the solution to the current difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">The €3.8 billion European Fisheries Fund 2007-13 provides for aid in respect of the temporary cessation of activities due to emergency measures.  This is provided for under priority No. 1 of the European Fisheries Fund — adaptation of the Community fishing fleet.  That this proposal has not yet been finalised is disappointing, given the urgency of the matter and the clear provision for such in the fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">Another point that needs to be made forcefully relates to the appalling failure of the Government to secure for Ireland a fair share of the €3.8 billion allocated in the fund.  A mere €42 million has been secured, which allied to the Government's failure to conclude its negotiations and secure approval for the Operational Programme for Fisheries speaks volumes of its commitment to the sector.  Just over 1% of the European Fisheries Fund has been committed to Ireland, yet we have a substantially greater share of Community waters and fish stocks.  While this was obviously negotiated under the watch of the Minister's predecessor, it is, nonetheless, a shameful outcome.  The failure to secure approval for the Operational Programme for Fisheries is delaying further investment in the industry, especially in processing, marketing, added value and so on where additional employment could be generated.  This is shameful neglect of a national industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">Given the 40% increase in diesel prices since the start of the year, <i>de facto</i> many fishermen are engaged in a cessation of activities simply because they cannot afford to go to sea.  A deal on direct financial assistance in such circumstances must be reached by 15 July, the date of the next meeting of the Council of Ministers, if fishermen are to survive and a resumption of radical protest is to be avoided.  Of concern in the interim is the fact that Bord Iascaigh Mhara is not actively preparing the groundwork for such a scheme.  I stated in the House on 19 June that the preferable outcome to the negotiations would be an EU funded scheme. EU or Exchequer funded, the preparatory work must be done.  What we must not allow is European Commission agreement on a rescue package for the fisheries sector comprising EU and State funding.  As a result of the recession, of the Government’s and the former Minister for Finance’s own making, we will not be in a position, although permission to do so is given at European Commission level, to match the level of state aid provided for French and Spanish fishermen who compete with Irish fishermen in the waters surrounding this island.  That would be the worst of both worlds and unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">The negotiating mettle of the Minister and his colleagues in the Department will be tested to secure the best possible financial rescue package prior to 15 July.  Most of those involved in the fishing industry do not really care from where the funding comes, be it from the Exchequer, the European Commission or outer Mongolia.  What is clear is that the industry needs a financial injection.  What will not be tolerated on this side of the House is Irish fishermen being placed at a competitive disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> those with whom they compete on a daily basis, in particular French and Spanish fishermen, in the seas around this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">President Sarkozy will visit this country shortly.  I call on the Taoiseach and the Minister to raise these important issues with him in order that we can comprehend and respond to proposals from the French Government during its six month Presidency of the European Union.  It will be an opportunity not to be missed to pursue an increase in the total allowable catch of cod in the Celtic Sea which has the backing — this is an important point — of the Marine Institute.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">Against this calamitous background, fishermen face the added uncertainty of the interpretation and implementation of complex fisheries legislation by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority that could result in criminal convictions for breaches that elsewhere in the European Union result only in the application of administrative sanctions.  Having had extensive consultations with fishermen and their representative organisations, this, with the perceived over-zealous enforcement by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, is an issue of the utmost gravity, only behind the issues of diesel prices and quotas.  It is ironic that while the European Union is widely looked to for many solutions, financial and otherwise, this is seen as an own goal by the industry.  It is a legal provision expressly against the wishes of the Commission and the experience of other member states which, if there was the political will, could be changed immediately.  Clearly, the Government does not have the political will to deal with the issue.  This is not about condoning illegal fishing; it is about a uniform system of sanctions across the EU.  The political impotence and double standards of Fianna Fáil backbenchers are clear; they say one thing on the plinth or in their constituencies when talking to fishermen and the exact opposite when confronted by the bully-boy tactics of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.  Tomorrow night's vote is their opportunity for redemption.  The Tadhgs ar dhá thaobh have a second chance.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">We hear much today about global food shortages, but we do not hear enough about the approximately two million tonnes of edible fish that are thrown back, mostly dead, into the sea in the name of conservation.  What a scandal.  The fish are not recorded as catch and could therefore skew conservation efforts.  With millions in the world starving, it is surely possible, without compromising the core objective of conservation, to organise the industry to bring this high-quality health food ashore and allocate species to others whose quotas are not filled.  Technical innovation should also address the issue of accidental catching of small fish.  It is immoral in the current climate that the action demanded by quotas and accidental catch is to throw dead fish back into the sea.  It is entirely unacceptable.  If the public knew this was how the Common Fisheries Policy of the EU obliges fishermen to behave, they would be appalled.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">With an appropriate investment strategy, as outlined by the Cawley report, the potential for added value, import substitution and increased employment in the industry is significant.  Seafood faces the same challenge as Irish agricultural produce — beef, dairy and so on — from imports of dubious quality because of the failure to label, brand and market.  Because consumers have a right to know where produce comes from, and because of the significant economic benefits that can accrue, Irish fish and all Irish food should have clear, foolproof country-of-origin labelling.  An opportunity has been missed regarding the branding, marketing and processing of seafood in Ireland, with a few notable exceptions.  It is worth noting that the fishing industry is substantially, though not exclusively, located in peripheral areas of the country where alternative opportunities for employment are not readily available.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">At a time of great challenge in attracting new industry due to global competition, and with increasing evidence of relocation of existing companies, we simply cannot afford not to develop the seafood sector.  The industry, BIM and the Government need to accelerate the process of investment, with the Cawley strategy providing the blueprint for what needs to be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_967">I commend Deputy Creed on this Private Members' motion.  It is hard to believe, but the bind that our fishermen are in did not develop overnight.  I am led to believe that in 1972 an American philanthropist wrote to the Government of the day advising it not to join the EEC, as it then was.  The reason, in one simple line, was that it would take our fish.  I have not found this letter yet, but I will.  What has happened since then?  Ten times the value of the EU funding we have received has been taken out of our waters.  Until now, fishermen have not had to protest as they have made a good living.  There is no doubt about that.  Over the past 30 or 35 years they made a good living, even though their working conditions were extreme and dangerous.  I was in Athlone yesterday for a meeting of fishermen.  Several hundred fishermen had tied up their boats to be there.  There was a sense of anger and disillusionment.  As well as the fishermen, their wives and families were also there, because they are all suffering.  As I said, this did not happen overnight.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">As a new Deputy, one of my first committee meetings was a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at which the then Minister, Deputy Coughlan, was present.  In my naivety, I asked her whether we as a State had ever gone to Europe to ask for more quota.  The answer I received made me wonder whether I had spoken out of place.  I got a put-down.  Perhaps I did speak out of place, but as far as I know we have never asked for an increase in quota.  We have never tried to claw back any of what we gave away.  Fishermen are under severe pressure at present and we are putting it down to fuel costs and quota restrictions.  The latter have been there for years, while the cost of fuel has increased by 40% over recent months.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">As my colleague stated, what Irish fishermen want is equality.  They want to be on a level playing field with other European fishermen, but they are not.  I have evidence that French and Spanish boats are going out with diesel in their tanks that costs 50 cent a litre, while Irish boats go out with diesel that costs 91 cent a litre.  I would love to have an explanation for this, but I understand how it is being done.  It is not through EU funding but through a mechanism set up by the French and Spanish Governments by which fishermen receive a direct payment, similar to the family income supplement, which offsets the increase in fuel costs.  This gives them much-needed help, but it means that Irish fishermen are not on a level playing field.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">We need immediate proposals to save our fishing industry.  We speak of decommissioning, which must be welcomed, even if the funding is to be only €42 million rather than the €58 million originally announced.  We speak of marketing and say that Irish fish must be labelled and marketed as such.  Yesterday in Athlone I spoke to the manager of a producer organisation who told me that in the co-op shop fillets of cod are being sold at €9.50 per kg, while in the local supermarket imported cod is being sold at €22.99 per kg.  I do not know whether the Irish housewife would pay such exorbitant prices if she knew the fish was imported.  Perhaps there is an opportunity there for the producer organisations themselves in terms of labelling and marketing.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">The Minister, Deputy Smith, stated today that the regulations on illegal, unreported and unregistered fishing would not come into effect before 2010.  This has been put on the long finger.  Fishermen need immediate proposals to save the industry.  Is the funding there to implement the recommendations in the Cawley report?  This is a straight question.  Is the funding there to implement the strategy without an operational programme?</p>
          <p eId="para_972">The Minister advised us that quota restrictions in other countries are not the same as ours.  In the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, we recently asked representatives of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority whether the authority had a boat.  To my amazement, the answer was that it did not.  The authority's 70 staff are, therefore, based on the coast and they nail Irish fishermen coming in, irrespective of what foreign boats do at sea.  Big boats have mulchers on board and have a different quota regime.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority could not nail these boats, given the structure of quotas.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">I will try to express the anger and frustration shown by fishermen at the meeting in Athlone yesterday.  Though it is not included in the Cawley report, they believe that the one way to ensure a profitable, viable future for the fishing industry is to take control of our territorial waters.  A committee was set up in the fishermen's organisations yesterday to approach the Federation of Irish Fishermen, FIF, and the Minister about taking charge of our territorial waters.  I do not know how this goal will be achieved but the fishermen were very enthusiastic because they believe it is the only way they will have a say in what is a natural resource of the State.  We own 20% of European waters but have only 4% of the quota and this would not happen anywhere else.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">Fishermen are very unhappy about having to throw overboard perfectly good fish.  There is starvation in the Third World and food shortages even threaten Europe, yet we discard fish catches worth millions because of quotas.  This is ethically and morally wrong.  To throw good food over the side of a boat is wrong but fishermen are afraid to come to shore and be nailed by the SFPA.  They fear their boats will be tied up and their nets confiscated.  They fear they will have to go to court, take out a massive bond and end up with a criminal record.  They may be delayed for a couple of days.  As I said, this is unethical and immoral.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">I compliment the Minister on designating Schull and Union Hall as landing ports.  A good day's work was done for fishermen in that part of the country.  However, this was a small, cosmetic measure when one thinks of what fishermen are enduring.  I ask the Minister to consider implementing a measure on harbour dues to help fishermen, who are not entitled to social welfare when they cannot go out in bad weather, their wives and families.  Hopefully he will do this and help many fishermen throughout the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_976">I compliment my colleagues, Deputies Creed and Sheahan, on their presentations on this important motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">I intend to focus on the issue of administrative sanctions.  There is a burning resentment in fishing communities and all along the seaboard because of the attitude of the Government to this issue, particularly in recent years.  I feel this resentment is justified.  The last report of the EU Commission on behaviours that seriously infringe the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy shows that it is objectively justified.  The report records the changes that took place and new legal instruments in fisheries enforcement in member states.  It records the 2006 Act that brought changes in Ireland and refers to the increased penalties for fisheries offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">The report refers to the fact that France introduced a number of administrative measures.  It also refers to changes in the United Kingdom, which are the basis for administrative sanctions, and the new scheme produced by the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency on administrative procedures.  The report refers to Spain, which in 2005 adopted an administrative Act establishing criteria for administrative sanctions, and to the position in Sweden along the same lines.  However, the then Minister here rejected all approaches on administrative sanctions.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">This was all done with the clear message that the European Union wants harmonisation.  The last report from the EU Commission lists the most recent changes introduced in this regard in Europe yet the Government has dug in on the issue.  I appreciate that much of this has to do with the character of the then Minister, Deputy Dempsey, as the Bill was going through.  He thought he was high sheriff of the seas and was not for turning, egged on to a degree by ill-informed plaudits from the Dublin media.  There was no appreciation of what the goal was.  There was scope for administrative sanctions here, as in other countries, as mentioned by my colleagues, with a view to creating a level playing field.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">The constitutional issue was raised at the time and was raised again in reply to a recent Dáil question.  I will be absolutely blunt in stating my convinction that there is no constitutional inhibition to the introduction of administrative sanctions in this country.  I believe the approach of the Minister was wrong on this point and I challenged the advice he received suggesting there was a constitutional inhibition.  There is no distinction between the enforcement of fisheries law and the enforcement of road traffic law.  I am not referring to minor parking offences but under road traffic law there are administrative sanctions, including fixed penalties and penalty points, and one can lose one's licence without going to court if one gets enough penalty points.  If a person loses his or her licence he may lose his or her livelihood.  There are countless precedents suggesting the administrative approach is possible.  The constitutional get-out is that offenders can refuse to accept a constitutional penalty and go to court instead and this allows the provisions of the Constitution to be upheld.  A person is entitled, under Articles 34 and 37, to have a charge tried before a court if he or she insists.  The message we are getting from the fishermen and the European Union is that they want a system through which low-level offences can be dealt with on an administrative basis.  I want to make the point that this can be done.  I accept that there are parameters that must be included in a new provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">I am working, on behalf of Fine Gael, on a framework document that will outline how this can be achieved.  It will cover technical offences that were dealt with heretofore by warnings and it will accept that serious offences must go to court, also as heretofore.  It will not be a charter for cowboys.  The document will point out that offences that are not serious can be dealt with through administrative sanctions.  I am asking the Government and the fishing organisations to give serious consideration to Fine Gael's framework document on how this can be achieved.  If the points raised in it are correct, as I believe they are, the necessary legislation should be introduced to underpin the new system that should be put in place as soon as possible.  The solution is in our hands.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_516">
          <from>Deputy John Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_982">I congratulate my Fine Gael colleagues, Deputy Creed, who is our spokesman in this area, and Deputy Sheahan, on this critically important motion.  If one visits coastal areas such as Killybegs, Castletownbere and Rossaveal, one will see that fishing communities throughout the country were left out in the cold over the last ten years, as the rest of the economy flourished.  The previous Fianna Fáil-led Government all but abandoned the fishing industry and the coastal communities.  One third of the population lives within ten miles of the coast.  Ireland's territorial waters, which extend 200 nautical miles from the coast, are ten times bigger than Ireland's land mass.  In the absence of leadership over the last 11 years, the Government has been content to waste Ireland's marine sector, which is one of its greatest untapped natural resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">As a result of the Government's failure to show any commitment to the development of the marine sector, our fishing industry is in crisis.  The costs associated with fishing vessels and diesel are increasing rapidly.  Issues such as insurance costs and over-regulation are imposing enormous hardship on those working in the industry.  As Deputy Creed said, just 1% of the European fisheries budget is allocated to Ireland.  I guarantee the Minister, Deputy Smith, that this country's fishing communities, which were waiting for his party at the referendum on the Lisbon treaty, will be waiting for Fianna Fáil when we go to the polls again in 12 months' time because they feel they have been sold down the tube.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">Any commitments which may be given at this time will be a small price to pay.  Fishing vessels worth up to €400 million are parked at the port of Killybegs, in which €50 million has been invested.  I fully understand and appreciate the critical role that the fishing industry plays in coastal communities.  The marine sector continues to be in relative decline.  The livelihoods of our coastal communities are being endangered by the neglect of the Government.  I do not blame the EU.  Aquaculture should be developed in the interests of our coastal communities and those involved in our inland fisheries.  Responsibility for the marine sector has been divided between four different Departments.  Fine Gael has given a commitment to re-establish the sector at Cabinet level, with a senior Minister, but that has not been pursued by the current Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">The motion before the House, which is directly concerned with the latest and most severe crisis to be encountered by the fishing industry, deals with many of the important issues which can be directly addressed by the Government without having to wait for the EU.  The Government can take immediate action to save the fishing sector.  It must reverse its policy of disregard and disinterest if fishing communities throughout Ireland are to survive.  The Government's indecision is wasting valuable time.  When I was Fine Gael's spokesman in this area for two years, I travelled to the various coastal communities to meet fishermen and their families.  There is no point in giving lip service to such people.  Responsibility for matters such as inshore fisheries, inland fisheries, coastal erosion and marine aquaculture has been given to other Ministers or Ministers of State.  We should state honestly that the Government has neglected our coastal communities.   The area within 200 nautical miles of the coast of Ireland comprises an area ten times bigger than its land mass.  The third of the population that lives within ten miles of the coast is being paid lip service.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">There has been a U-turn on the fantastic document produced by Dr. Noel Cawley.  When the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005 was being considered by the Oireachtas, we heard the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, engaging in a total fabrication.  As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe mentioned, that legislation provides for the criminalisation of fishermen.  When I met the EU Commissioner, I was assured that there is no reason we cannot decriminalise fishermen who engage in certain activities.  Under the legislation I mentioned, a fisherman who has committed a small offence cannot go to America because he is deemed to be a criminal.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">We must address the needs of our fishing fleet.  There are too many boats out there.  It is unacceptable that Ireland benefits from just 1% of the EU fisheries budget of €3.5 billion.  The making of a one-off investment in the decommissioning of boats has been recognised as a policy tool that is perfectly justifiable in terms of the public good that ensues.  The motion before the House calls for a uniform and balanced approach to the enforcement of fisheries regulations, which is important.  Fine Gael does not condone over-fishing.  It supports the enforcement of the regulations of the law.  Many people are concerned that the potential of the fishing sector is not being met.  The worldwide demand for fish is evident in every store.  It is a question of pushing an open door.  However, the processing companies are experiencing difficulties.  Some 14 factories in Killybegs have been closed.  Every factory in Rossaveal and Castletownbere is closed.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">Does the Minister, Deputy Smith, think it is enough to pay lip service to the industry?  Fishermen who have made huge investment in this sector, while rearing families, are justified in thinking they should get more than lip service.  Where is the Cawley report?  It was suggested before the last election that Dr. Cawley was eminently qualified to compile the report.  He visited all the fishing communities.  Not only was it suggested that the establishment of a single marine Department would be considered, but it was promised that ministerial consultative committees would be put in place.  What is happening in areas like aquaculture?  Nothing is happening with the proposed marine research development in Galway.  The seabed survey has been cancelled.  The inland fisheries sector is all over the place.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">The Minister will not fob me off.  I assure him that Fine Gael is standing with coastal communities.  We will not renege on the promises we have made to them.  Deputy Kenny has stated clearly that when Fine Gael is returned to Government, it will revitalise this valuable industry.  It is unacceptable that Ireland, as an island nation, has been totally relegated.  I do not give the Government any credit in this regard.  It has neglected our coastal communities.  It has failed to create jobs in such areas.  It claims that it is involved in consultations and meetings, but it is doing absolutely nothing.  Fishermen are annoyed.  They were annoyed when I visited them some years ago, but they are now more annoyed than ever.  I guarantee the Government that if it ignores them, it will do so at its peril.  Deputies who represent coastal communities are well aware of what people in such areas felt about the Government the last time they went to the polls.  Whatever they thought of them then, they think even less now.  People in coastal communities will make their feelings clear when the local elections are held next May or June.  They are annoyed about the changes which have been made to diesel excise rates, for example.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">This is one of the most critical issues to have been raised on Private Members' business for some time.  I assure the House that this problem will not go away.  It is not good enough to pay lip service to the fishermen, or to try to fob them off.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_518">
          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_992">I commend the efforts of Deputies Creed and Sheahan in bringing this motion to the House.  I commend my colleague, Deputy Perry, on the work he did in opposition in the previous Dáil.  I refer, for example, to his contribution to the Fine Gael policy document, Oceans of Opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">The motion before the House mentions that the value of the seafood industry to the economy is over €750 million.  If one considers what we could be doing, that figure represents the tip of the iceberg.  We need to consider the value-added sector.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State with responsibility for food, Deputy Sargent, talks a good game.  He needs to implement something, however.  Fishing is a tremendous industry with great potential.  Rather than talking the talk, we should be walking the walk.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">Deputy Jim O'Keeffe spoke succinctly about the legal aspects of the criminalisation of fisheries offences.  The simple issue of criminalisation goes to the heart of fishing families and communities.  We need to compare like with like.  As Deputy Creed argued, the person who put together the rules that force fishermen to dump fish at sea is surely more deserving of being criminalised than, for example, a fisherman who fails to log a telephone call to a fishing port.  As the Minister is in control, he is in a position to do something about this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">I would like to speak about the scientific advice.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, will have an interest in this.  Do scientists take discards into consideration?  No, they do not.  They do not measure discards.  How, therefore, can the biomass of fishing stock in any geographical area be measured at any given point in time?  It cannot be done because discards are not being measured.  We have to stand with the fishermen, who are willing to work with the Department in this regard.  They do not want to dump fish at sea.  They are forced into such action when they are in danger of being treated as criminals.  Do scientists take environmental issues into consideration?  No, they do not.  Scientists do not consider the fact that spawning grounds are moving further north.  We are always being told that the oceans are getting warmer.  The lines which were drawn on the map 30 or 40 years ago are still in use, even though the fish are moving further north.  Fishermen are being forced to fish in specified boxes even though they know small fish will be caught in such areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">We have to get a grip on the reality of this area.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, has a responsibility to work with the fishermen in the pelagic and demersal sectors.  He needs to listen to the fishermen because they have the local knowledge.  I refer not only to those currently employed in the fishing sector but also to those who are retired.  They know what is happening in the marine environment.  They do not need scientists to tell them what is going on.  They want to work with people in the scientific industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">There is a complete disconnect between the roles of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the fishermen.  As I said last week, the Minister has an opportunity to show real political leadership in this area.  He can take control and start bringing some reality to the fishing industry.  There is absolutely no reality there at present.  Mackerel fishermen were told in January that they had to do all their fishing within a three-week or six-week period.  They know that nobody is telling the haddock or the cod to go into the nets.  I know the cod boxes are closed off but has anybody told the cod?  This shows the craziness and ludicrousness of having this type of system.  At sea fishermen are in different boxes.  Cod go into these and that is something we must take seriously and look to the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">I know the Minister lives somewhere in the midlands but he has good contacts within the coastal community.  I ask that he listen to those people and work with them.  He should start working with the science rather than allow the scientists to make ridiculous rules that are unworkable and fly in the face of proper conservation practice.  This is what fishermen practise.</p>

          <p eId="para_1018">I wish to share my time with the Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, and Deputies Pat ‘the Cope' Gallagher and Sean Connick.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">I appreciate the opportunity we have this evening to discuss the current issues of importance to the Irish seafood industry which is facing a particularly challenging time, as all Deputies present have stated.  It also affords me the opportunity to update the House on the most recent developments at home and in Europe in the seafood sector and the work that my colleague, the Minister of State with special responsibility for fisheries, Deputy Tony Killeen, and I have been doing since our appointment and particularly since the Dáil debated this matter last month.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">Central to our work has been the ongoing contact that we have maintained with the Federation of Irish Fishermen.  At last week's  conference on innovation and sustainability in the seafood sector the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, took the opportunity once again to discuss issues raised and review progress.  He acknowledged the patience and very reasonable attitude of fishermen since our meeting in Athlone on  13 June.  He recognised that fishermen are impatient at delays in finding solutions to the current crises.  I assure fishermen and the FIF that the Minister of State and I fully understand their situation and we will continue to work with the utmost urgency to secure an EU-funded package of measures as early as possible and to progress the range of other issues identified by the FIF as of particular importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">Following the Athlone meeting with the Federation, the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, and I met EU Fisheries Commissioner, Mr. Joe Borg, on 18 June when we outlined in detail to him the urgent issues facing the Irish fishing industry.  At the EU Fisheries Council meeting last week and following a further meeting with the FIF, I outlined to the Council a strong case for a package of EU-funded measures to address the current difficulties experienced by fishermen in our country.  I was supported by a number of Ministers from other member states in expressing the view that there was an urgent need for a pan-European approach to resolving the short and medium-term difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">The introduction of short-term measures to complement the restructuring of the Irish fishing fleet through the current decommissioning scheme is an important element in addressing the difficulties now faced by vessel owners and crew.  It is our clear view that the Commission has a responsibility to source additional funding to support the industry during this period of restructuring and put it on a firm and sustainable footing in the future.  We take the view, given the relatively small share Ireland receives from the Common Fisheries Policy, that Ireland has a special case for additional funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">In addition to the specific proposals on short-term measures, the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, and I pressed for further initiatives to strengthen the price fishermen receive for their catch and to reduce the cost of fishing.  At the Council we pressed the Commission to examine new initiatives at EU level to increase the return received by fishermen at the quayside and improved labelling to assure consumers.  We also asked the Commission to bring forward initiatives on research and innovation in the development of more fuel-efficient engines and fishing practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">The situation we face is that, given the large-scale programme of decommissioning that is under way, as recommended in the Cawley strategy report on the future of the fishing industry in Ireland, there is no funding available under the European Fisheries Fund nationally for temporary tie-up measures as envisaged in the Commission's paper.  For this reason, I pushed the Commission to provide the necessary additional funds from the EU budget.  The Fisheries Commissioner, Mr. Borg, has undertaken to come back to the next Council meeting on 15 July with definitive proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">The Cawley strategy, Steering A New Course, was launched in January 2007 and represents an excellent blueprint to transform the industry.  The strategy sets out a vision for a sustainable, profitable and self-reliant industry.  The expert analysis set out in that report remains valid today.  We must ensure that we do not lose sight of our agreed goals and that we use this opportunity to continue to implement the key recommendations.  The strategy focused on a number of key areas, namely, the restructuring of the fishing fleet to bring it into balance with available resources, a more innovative and co-ordinated approach to the marketing of seafood, capitalising on its healthy and nutritious image and maximising the value of seafood at every stage from the sea to the table.  The Government has committed to this strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">I am pleased that a number of the structural measures outlined in the strategy have already been successfully implemented.  These include the 2008 whitefish decommissioning scheme which we announced recently with grant aid of €41 million.  Approved applicants have until 18 July 2008 to accept the offer and if they do so they must surrender their fishing licences by 12 September 2008. Failure by an applicant to meet these deadlines will result in the next applicant on a reserve list being offered the opportunity to decommission his or her vessel.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">The approval involves 46 boats over 18 m. in length, with a combined capacity of 7,590 gross tonnes, permanently exiting the whitefish fleet over the coming weeks.  With an average size of 165 gross tonnes per vessel, these boats represent 68% of the overall target set for the scheme and are in addition to the 27 whitefish boats already decommissioned in 2005-06.  Overall, a total of 33% of the over-18 m. whitefish fleet involving 73 large vessels will have been decommissioned since 2005. The result of this decommissioning will be a significant boost to the economics of those boats that remain in the fleet.  This economic lift comes from the redistribution of the whitefish and prawn catch previously taken by the vessels being decommissioned and is currently estimated at €20 million.  Over the next five years this will result in up to €100 million in additional catching opportunities for those boats that remain.  Decommissioning is very beneficial to those owners and skippers who remain in the fleet.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_1029">This round of decommissioning grants is a substantial commitment to the seafood industry and will help to put the sector on a more sound financial footing, delivering a sustainable future for Ireland's fishermen into the future.  It will help to bring about a viable future for the fishing sectors that will support the economies of coastal communities dependent on fishing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">To meet the challenge of ensuring that the Irish consumer eats more Irish seafood which would enhance the benefits along the value chain to our catchers and farmers, I have recently established the new Irish seafood market initiative under the chairmanship of Jason Whooley, chief executive of BIM.  The remit of the initiative will be to maximise opportunities in the Irish domestic seafood market for the Irish fishing fleet and its objective is to bring together fishermen, fish farmers, processors, wholesalers, distributors and retailers to ensure they are supplying the domestic market with as much Irish seafood as possible and to lessen our reliance on imports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, has also established a new Irish Fisheries Science Research Partnership under the chairmanship of Dr. Peter Heffernan, the chief executive of the Marine Institute, to enable both fishermen and scientists to share vital information.  The experience of sharing and collaborating will help build mutual trust and confidence between the scientific and catching communities, the benefit of which will I believe be a better shared understanding of the state of the fish stocks around Ireland.  It will, in addition, use the local knowledge of fishermen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">Given that the use of administrative sanctions has been the consistent subject of debate and has been an agenda item for fishermen at all their meetings with me, I also wish to address in some detail the issue of sanction levels in our own national legislation.  Fishermen argue that they are being criminalised by being taken to the Circuit Court for minor offences and that administrative sanctions should apply for smaller offences instead of prosecution in the Circuit Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">In the interest of absolute clarity, it is important to state some facts.  Illegal fishing by vessels of any member state in our waters, which in many cases involves non-declaration of landings of key commercial stocks or misreporting of them, is not acceptable and must be subject to dissuasive sanctions.  Since 1959, Ireland has applied its criminal law in respect of fisheries matters and, since becoming a member state of the European Community, Ireland has applied the criminal law in the enforcement of fisheries policy. The legislation passed by both Houses in 2006 does not in any way constitute a new approach other than that the maximum penalties are for the first time graduated and lower maximum penalties are applicable in the case of smaller vessels.  This is the correct approach.</p>

          <p eId="para_1039">The actual sanction applied in each case is a matter for the judge, taking account of the maximum fine limits set in the legislation.  The regime in place is required to protect fish stocks and the long-term future of coastal communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">In order to inform these discussions, I asked the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority for data on the current level of inspections being undertaken by both the Naval Service and the land-based inspectorate on fishing activities.  The authority has advised that, in 2007, there were 20,639 landings by Irish and non-Irish vessels into Irish ports, of which 8.6% were inspected.  These landings broke down as follows: there were 19,174 landings by Irish vessels, of which 6.7% were inspected, and 1,465 landings by non-Irish vessels, of which 33% were inspected.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Trevor Sargent)</from>
          <p eId="para_1057">I support the hard work and efforts of my Department colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, to find resolutions to the difficult challenges faced by the fishing industry.  As pointed out by the Minister and Members in Fine Gael, the current circumstances in the fishing industry have been developing over time.  The Irish fishing industry is wholly dependent on the state of the fish stocks in the Irish zone.  The decline in fish stocks has not happened over night.  There have been warning signs for some time and, collectively, we have not paid enough attention or taken adequate action.  Clearly, this is a European issue and action must be taken at the EU Council table.  It is realised across the board, by fellow member states and stakeholders, that many of our fish stock levels are low and must be rebuilt.  Our ambition should be to have our fish stocks at high levels and in a healthy state so they can sustain our industry and coastal communities.  It will require courageous management and enforcement of conservation measures and quotas at EU and national levels to rebuild our fish stocks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">The Marine Institute, the competent national authority on fish stocks, has advised on the current position and the future is worrying.  Cod stocks have collapsed in the Irish Sea and west of Scotland, partly because of fishing and partly due to climate change, as acknowledged by Deputy McHugh.  Irish Sea whiting has declined dramatically since early 2000 and the fishery, which yielded 15,800 tonnes in 1988, yielded 935 tonnes in 2006.  The high-value Irish Sea sole stock has suffered from five years of poor spawning and the stock is at an all-time low.  The Irish fleet now depends on prawns and we have been very fortunate that this stock appears to be in good condition and able to sustain current Irish fleet activity.  However, having spoken to fishermen in my constituency from Balbriggan, Skerries and Howth in recent days, I note there is a trend towards having more and larger vessels fishing in the Irish Sea for prawns.  If this continues, it will certainly be of concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">The Celtic Sea herring stocking level is likely to be as low as it was in the 1970s, when it collapsed.  There are serious concerns about north-west herring and a rebuilding plan should be put in place.  The position on our key mackerel, horse mackerel and blue whiting stocks is not as serious as that on herring and whitefish.  The status of the horse mackerel stock is unknown.  Blue whiting fishing levels are considered too high to be sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">Deep-water stocks are very different from traditional shallow-water species and are highly vulnerable to over-exploitation.  Scientists consider that the stock is severely depleted, and deep-water fishing operations have been found to damage very sensitive habitats, for example, deep-water coral mounds.  Scientists consider that shark and ray are in a serious state of decline.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">Management plans are urgently required for all sea fisheries.  These plans must reduce fishing pressure, eliminate discarding and rebuild depleted stocks.  Across the EU, too many boats are targeting too few fish.  We must reduce fleet capacity by permanently removing boats from the fleet, reduce fishing effort on stocks and develop long-term management plans for fish stocks to rebuild stocks that ought to be present.  These are European challenges and we in Ireland must play our part.  Substantial progress in delivering a better balance between our fleet and available fishing opportunities will be achieved with the full implementation of the current decommissioning scheme, which has funding in the order of €42 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">Let me address a specific issue on sea bass which has been raised by the industry.  In Ireland we have a ban on the landing of sea bass caught by trawlers and a restriction on the number of sea bass that anglers may retain each day.  The industry has raised this issue with the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, and pointed out that commercial fishing of sea bass is allowed in other member states, including France and the United Kingdom.  It has also pointed out that sea bass is a by-catch in many fisheries and fishermen are required under our own national laws to discard all fish caught unintentionally.  Industry representatives asked the Minister and Minister of State to consider revising the current arrangements to allow for a by-catch quota for commercial trawlers.  The Minister and Minister of State asked the Marine Institute for scientific advice and this has just been received.  The institute advises that the total size of the stock frequenting waters around Ireland is unknown, but is likely to be quite small, with a maximum estimate of 100 tonnes.  It advises that, despite warming seas around our coasts, the species remains at the northern limit of its range.  The institute advises that "there is currently no prospect of a sustainable commercial fishery for sea bass".  The Minister advises me he will discuss this scientific advice with his colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who has responsibility for angling and has a significant interest in this issue from a sea-angling perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">As Minister of State with responsibility for food, I see great potential in the seafood sector, provided we address now the structural challenges to which I referred.  Consumers are developing a greater understanding of the range of fish on offer and are increasingly becoming aware of the nutritional benefits of eating seafood.  It seems we are constantly receiving the positive message about the benefits of Omega 3 oils, and particularly the benefits of eating oil-rich fish.  It is against this positive backdrop that the Irish seafood industry operates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">The Government is firmly committed to the development of our seafood industry and, as one may know, it is a key element of the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  The Government is committed to investing over €500 million in the marine sector, from coastal infrastructure to marine research and seafood development.  Of this sum, up to €334 million has been identified for investment in delivering the seafood element of the strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">I wish to support all the efforts of my colleagues, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Killeen, in working to find solutions to the range of concerns identified by fishermen and, in particular, in taking decisive action to address the structural imbalance between fish stocks and the Irish fleet.  I also am heartened by the commitment and dedication of all stakeholders in developing and promoting fish in the Irish marketplace in which there are excellent opportunities for the future of this indigenous, renewal, natural resource based industry.</p>

          <p eId="para_1066">I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate.  I have been in the House for a long time and this may be the first occasion on which fisheries issues have been dealt with by way of Private Members' business.  This is an indication of the seriousness of the position.  Over many years since 1973, and since 1983 in particular, difficulties have been experienced on a continual basis.  While they have been overcome, the price of fuel now has tilted the balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">I compliment both the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, on their initiative in travelling to a meeting in Strasbourg after their marathon meeting with the representatives of the industry in Athlone but in advance of the recent Fisheries Council meeting.  I understand a package of measures will be presented by Commissioner Borg to the fisheries Ministers on 15 July, which may alleviate some short-term pressing issues.  I seek the rapid implementation of such short-term measures as unless the Commission approves them, a very serious situation will confront us.  I am hopeful in this regard and have confidence in both Ministers, who have had a handle on an extremely difficult brief from an early stage and who understand the issues and problems confronting them.  A package of measures should be approved by the Commission for Ireland in particular, although I realise the Commission must deal with all of Europe.  These issues affect all member states across the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">Were a package of measures to be agreed, everyone, including the Ministers above all, would want them to be financed by the European Commission.  However, if co-funding from the member states is required, such funding must be provided.</p>

          <p eId="para_1074">This is not a matter that requires European sanction.  It is supported throughout the European Union and if this can be done, it would constitute an important step forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">In addition, I am pleased a meeting was held recently between the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and the industry representatives.  This meeting was important because there had been a wide gulf between the authority and the fishermen.  I am pleased the authority subsequently issued a statement seeking a new, fresh start.  Neither the authority nor the fishermen seek confrontation as participation and co-operation are sought.  I do not believe it is necessary to engage in chasing fishermen for minor, petty offences.  The individuals who should be chased are those who are taking 80% of the fish from our most prolific fishing grounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">The European Union has been good to Ireland and I am a great supporter of both the Union and the Lisbon treaty.  Unfortunately however, the price paid by the fishermen was too great.  I do not criticise the negotiators because at that time, they did not foresee the developments that would take place.  Those who state that voting "No" means Ireland can re-negotiate all those issues should be aware this is not possible.  We have been dealt a hand of cards and everyone wishes the Minister and the Minister of State well in their endeavours in Europe.  I ask them to consider closely a fisheries Bill with a view to introducing administrative sanctions.</p>

          <p eId="para_1081">It is good that the fishing industry has been the highlight of Members' attention during statements in the House a fortnight ago and again tonight under Private Members' business.  As I come from County Wexford, I am acutely aware of the crisis and the difficulties faced by fishermen in Ireland at present.  I have been left in no doubt regarding the dire crisis they face.  Some time ago, I put on the record of the House my attendance at a meeting in Kilmore Quay on 19 May.  The fishermen and women involved had their backs against the wall.  They did not wish to be obliged to drive around the country to attend long meetings; they simply wished to fish and to earn a living.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">I was presented with a document that night called, Death of an Industry: Death of a Community.  It raised five issues on which I have been working to try to tackle.  The first is the price of fuel.  As Members are aware, it has increased by 40% since January and by more than 300% in recent years.  Moreover, the Common Fisheries Policy must be readjusted and legislation must be repealed in respect of making criminals out of fishermen.  In addition, there is a need to discuss the over-policing by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and what will happen to the fishing crews after the decommissioning of the boats.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">I acknowledge the great efforts made by the Minister, Deputy Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, as well as the officials, who have worked extremely hard to try to address the many difficulties facing the industry.  They have held a series of meetings with both the Federation of Irish Fishermen and in Europe with Commissioner Borg.  I look forward to and hope for a successful outcome on 15 July when they return to Europe to secure a rescue package that will be suitable and helpful to all fishermen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">At present, the fishing industry is experiencing what can only be described as the perfect storm.  I refer to high fuel prices, falling prices for the catch, dumping of huge quantities of fish from outside the EU, a quota that is too small and, as noted earlier, over-zealous enforcement.  Coastal communities are being hit extremely hard by all of the above, as well as by rising interest rates.  Lives are being put at risk to survive and perhaps chances are being taken and people go to sea when they should not.  However, this arises as a result of the enormous pressure under which people and families find themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">The Government is committed to implementing the Cawley strategy.  Funding of €216 million has been committed to the fisheries sector under the national development plan and a further €118 million is due over the lifetime of the programme.  Last week, the first offers under the decommissioning scheme were made, 50% of which will be paid in the autumn with the balance to be paid in January.  This scheme will help to balance the fleet with the remaining resources fishermen must seek out.  As for the issue of administrative sanctions, I welcome the request by the Minister to the Attorney General to reconsider a regime of administrative sanctions and to examine their introduction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">As for discards, as I have stated previously, they should be kept and logged.  It is a shame that fish that already are dead are discarded into the sea and I seek resolution of this issue as soon as possible.  I also welcome the recent statement by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and I was delighted that representatives of the Federation of Irish Fishermen and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority have met.  In respect of the issue of increased quota from the Celtic Sea, a response is awaited from the Commission in respect of Ireland's scientific information.  I would welcome the increase in quota from the Celtic Sea as sought by Ireland and it is to be hoped it will be successful in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">Ireland has sought financial aid for the fisheries sector from the EU.  This undoubtedly is an EU-wide crisis and the Common Fisheries Policy must deal with it.  It also constitutes a good test of the EU itself because all its coastal member states face difficulties.  They should work together as they face many common difficulties.  On the issue of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, 500,000 tonnes constitutes almost €1.1 billion of illegal fishery products that are being dumped into the EU at present.  This matter must be addressed and I welcome the Minister's efforts to tackle it.  I also welcome the new seafood market initiative and the Irish fisheries and science research partnership.  They should be put to work straight away.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">While in opposition, it sometimes can be easy to criticise.  This Government is committed to protecting the Irish fishing industry.  Huge effort has been made in the past six weeks by both Ministers, and by backbenchers like myself who have constantly raised this issue with our colleagues.  We hope 15 July will bring the assistance that is required.  I am committed to working for the fishermen of Kilmore, Duncannon, Fethard-on-Sea and those throughout Ireland to ensure we have a successful and worthwhile fishing industry.</p>

          <p eId="para_1091">I support the Fine Gael motion.  The fishing industry contributes significantly to our economy.  As the Cawley report states, it is a vital indigenous industry that directly employs approximately 12,000 people, with total annual revenues of approximately €702 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">Fishing makes an extremely important contribution to our coastal communities and thereby our country.  We are an island nation with approximately 7,400 km of coastline, which is approximately 10% of the coastline of the European Union.  Our major cities are all located at the coast.  If major coastal urban centres are included, Ireland's coastal population would be 50% for the whole of Ireland.  A total of 34% of Ireland's population lives within 5 km of the coast.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">The Cawley report states that fishing makes an enormous contribution to the regional and local development of remote rural coastal communities.  The report outlines that the waters around Ireland contain some of the most productive fishing grounds in the European Union.  It is estimated that in 2004, the total catch by all fleets within the Irish economic zone was 700,000 tonnes of fish valued at €500 million, the greater proportion of which was taken by non-Irish vessels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">Fishing is an industry that faces challenges.  That was the reason behind the Cawley report.  As other speakers mentioned, the issues to be dealt with include depleted stocks of fish, marine and coastal pollution and competing development pressures for ocean and coastal space.  Future challenges include climate change, one impact of which will be the loss of fishing days because of increased numbers of storms.  There is also the challenge of dealing with EU regulations and the need for our fishing and aquaculture industries to compete.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">I recently read the book by Damien Tiernan, <i>Souls of the Sea</i>, which is about the loss of the <i>Pere Charles</i> and the <i>Honeydew II</i>.  Despite the conditions those boats went out because they had no option but to do so.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> recently, Lorna Siggins wrote about the inquiries into the causes of these incidents and said they were at various stages.  She stated: “but there is one common thread — the best safety equipment in the world is of limited benefit when skippers and owners coping with shrinking quotas and expanding fuel bills are under pressure from an unworkable Common Fisheries Policy and the banks”.  She also stated: “Several studies suggested the true impact of the crisis was being concealed by a steady flight by crews to the construction industry”.  That is important in terms of the future of the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">The Labour Party marine spokesperson, Senator Michael McCarthy, highlighted a number of issues brought to his attention by fishermen, one of which is the fact that the Government committed €42 million recently for the decommissioning of boats over 18 ft.  when the Cawley report had called for €62 million.  There is no funding for decommissioning of boats under18 ft., which means that small fishermen have been forgotten by the Government.  Boats under18 ft. are generally older and their owners are an older age group.  It is logical that those fishermen would be more willing to retire but, unfortunately, decommissioning is not an option open to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">As other speakers said, the dumping of fish is a major issue.  Senator Michael McCarthy, as marine spokesperson, has highlighted the fact that there are more sea fishery protection officers in Ireland than in all of Spain.  We have approximately 100 sea fishery protection officers yet there is no comparison between the size of the Spanish and the Irish fleets.  As speakers from all sides of the House have highlighted, Irish fishermen can be prosecuted in courts and face jail terms for minor offences, and there is no facility currently for administrative fines.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">On the issue of enforcement, Senator Michael McCarthy got an e-mail from the wife of a fisherman in which she outlined the impact of the inspection regime on her husband.  She said her husband had a completely clear record and that in ten years he had never been cautioned, never mind committed an offence, yet he and all the other boats were being subjected to 100% inspection on arrival in port and had to endure that while being laughed at by fishermen from other countries like France and Spain, where virtually no inspections are being carried out.  She said these inspections take hours and have led to her children going to bed and school very upset because the boat is in, having been at sea for up to three weeks, but their father has not been able to come home to them.  That is an indication of the huge impact of the regime on the families as well as the fishermen themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">The Cawley report is the framework document for meeting the challenges faced by the fishing industry.  It was published in December 2006 and sets out clearly the steps that need to be taken to address the issues for the fishing industry.  As Members are aware, the recommendations range from developing markets for aquaculture projects, protecting the marine and coastal environment and, as highlighted in the motion, discarded fish and unsafe equipment, all of which are covered in the Cawley report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">As the motion points out, however, the progress of implementation of the report has been slow.  In that regard, I tabled a parliamentary question on 18 June in which I asked for a report on the recommendations of the Cawley report implemented to date, the recommendations that have been partly implemented, the recommendations that have not been implemented and so on in tabular form.  The reply from the Minister outlines all the recommendations in tabular form as I requested but, interestingly, the "Implemented" column is blank.  None of the recommendations of the Cawley report has been entirely implemented.  The report was published in 2006.  The Government does not accept the significance of the fishing industry to our economy and the importance of the portfolio of the marine, which is another issue that has been highlighted by my colleague, Senator Michael McCarthy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">In 1987, the Government showed great commitment to the marine by setting up a Department of the Marine but, unfortunately, successive Fianna Fáil Governments have rowed back on that commitment and slowly but surely sidelined the Department.  Currently, the marine and coastal responsibilities are spread over six Departments — Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; Communications, Energy and Natural Resources; Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Transport; Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs; and Arts, Sport and Tourism.  All those Departments are involved in the area to some extent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">I put down another parliamentary question recently asking if there was any interdepartmental unit, group or committee to oversee the co-ordination of the marine responsibilities and it appears there is not.  There is a fragmentation of the responsibility.  A recommendation in the Cawley report was that the co-ordination of the marine and coastal responsibilities should be spearheaded by what was then the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  The report was critical of the negative impact of the under-resourced marine Department at the time but matters have got worse.  It is at odds with European Union policy and policy in Canada, the United Kingdom and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">In that regard, the first ever EU Commissioner for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs was recently appointed.  Canada is bringing in an ocean Act but there is none of that type of co-ordination here.  Labour is calling for the immediate establishment of an interdepartmental committee to co-ordinate coastal and marine responsibility at Government and State agency level because that is the type of thing that was sought by the Cawley report, and no doubt it is necessary.  There should be a single framework for the management of marine and coastal responsibility and, obviously, an integrated and cross-sectoral approach.  There should be full implementation and proper funding for the implementation of the Cawley report.</p>

          <p eId="para_1106">I thank Labour for the time allocated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">Earlier today I attempted to table a further amendment to the Government's amendment and the Fine Gael motion but, regrettably, it was not allowed.  For the record, I want to read it into the record of the House.  It stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1108">Calls on the Government to:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1109">demand a complete re-negotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy as it affects the Irish fisheries, Irish stock management and the allocation of quota to Irish fishermen;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1110">reclaim jurisdiction over Irish territorial waters and the Irish fisheries;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1111">amend the Criminal Justice Act and the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act to remove criminal sanctions against fishermen and replace them with administrative penalties;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1112">bring an end to the dumping at sea of dead fish;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1113">address as a matter of urgency the crisis brought about by fuel price increases;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1114">tackle the illegal fishing by foreign vessels in Irish waters;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1115">introduce a labelling system to identify the country of origin of all fish and fish products sold here;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1116">encourage the development and growth of the processing sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">The reason I tabled my amendment is because neither the original motion nor the Government's amendment, for all their good intentions, address the basis and core problems facing Irish fishermen fundamental to which is the Common Fisheries Policy which has been the bedrock of the disastrous mismanagement of the Irish fishery since this State joined the EU.  Unless and until the Government reverses the shameful sell out made at that time, we will be merely tinkering around and allowing Brussels engineer and effectively liquidate the Irish fishing sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">There seems to be little political will here to demand a radical overhaul of the Common Fisheries Policy.  In a reply to one of my questions today the Minister claims that many of Ireland's priorities have been delivered on during the ten yearly reviews but admits this State has received no support with regard to addressing the fundamental issue of quota.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">Indeed, the overall impression is of this State constantly having to fight a rear-guard action to preserve whatever crumbs have been thrown our way.  That in itself is reason enough, as one of the significant stakeholders in the sector, to demand that the policy be reformed in such a way as to ensure the interests of Irish fishermen are protected and enhanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">It is significant that at the same time as this State was negotiating entry to the EU so was Norway.  The Common Fisheries Policy was drawn up during the talks as a means of allowing "equal access" to British and Irish waters for the fishing fleets of the then six member states of Italy, France, Germany, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg.  Sensibly, the Norwegians decided that such a sacrifice of a national asset was not worth it as they still had a thriving fishing sector, and without doubt they have developed that sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">The harm done by the Common Fisheries Policy is generally recognised.  In 2002 the review group which reported to the Forum on Europe referred to the "inequalities and injustices" inherent in the Common Fisheries Policy.  Perhaps it best summed up the situation when it declared that "Ireland has only a small piece of its own cake".  Just how small is illustrated by the fact that even though we have 16% of EU fishing waters, we have only 4% of the quota.  Even that fails to adequately illustrate how badly done by we are, as the Irish fishery is the most lucrative in the EU with 40% of edible fish consumed in the EU caught in Irish waters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">As I referred to in my statement two weeks ago, the 2004 estimate of the catch by the Irish fleet in waters around our coast was that it amounted to 15% of the total catch.  Within the area under EU jurisdiction it was only 28%.  In the same year it was estimated by the Marine Institute that the value of the catch in surrounding waters was €800 million of which €460 million was taken in the EU zone.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">I also referred to EUROSTAT statistics which place the accumulated processed value of fish taken in Irish waters between 1974 and 2004 at approximately €200 billion, five times the value of the total transfer funds we received from the EU, mainly in CAP and Structural Funds over that period.  In the closing eight or nine weeks of the campaign on Lisbon, we listened to those stating how grateful we should be to Europe, how thankful we should be for what they have done for us.  They got five times the value back out of Irish fishing waters compared to what we received in Structural Funds from the EU.  Those are the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">Had our fisheries been properly managed and developed under domestic control they might have become a valuable resource that could have played a vital role in the economic development of the country.  Instead, the Irish fishery was squandered and is at present in mortal danger, not only due to current pressures such as those brought about by the steep increase in fuel prices, but by the overall trust of EU policy which many believe, with justification, is deliberately designed to reduce the Irish fishing sector to insignificance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">I take exception to the fact that people welcome decommissioning.  It is a shame that Irish fishermen, who may be the second or third generation, are being forced out of the sector.  It is nothing of which to be proud.  It is a shame to say we got €42 million to compensate people for their livelihoods, and for their fathers' and grandfathers' livelihoods.  It is a significant indictment on this State to come to such a point that decent honest hardworking men and women are being forced out of the sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_1127">What is worse is that the intent of Brussels is being reinforced here by the actions of the State and its enforcement authorities, as is illustrated by the manner in which the sector is policed and by recent legislative changes to both the Criminal Justice Act and the Sea Fisheries Act which, in effect, criminalise fishermen in a manner not applied to any other economic sector.  I stood here when the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, referred to anybody who was caught with a small bit over quota or who had any conviction as a result of fisheries as traitors.  The sell-out of the fishing sector when Ireland entered the EU was treason.</p>

          <p eId="para_1129">That sell-out was the treason, not the actions of the poor man who comes in with a by-catch on his boat who is brought before the courts for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">The Minister made reference to the fact that for lesser offences one goes before the District Court.  He misses the point.  The point is that once somebody goes before the court, be it the Circuit Court or District Court, and has a criminal conviction, the knock-on effects include that he would be unable to get a visa to go to the United States for a holiday or to see a family.  That is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">The fact is that a measure to criminalise a sector was brought through this House, although many of us fought it tooth and nail.  Would it happen where, for example, a farmer exceeds his milk quota?  Such a person would not be brought before the courts, but a fisherman will be brought before the court if he comes in with one box of fish over the quota.  What is being done here is a disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">I appeal to the Minister to deal with the criminalising of the fisherman, to take that stigma away from a great sector of our community, to bring in administrative sanctions for lesser offences and to give the men and women of our coastal communities justice.  These people should not be stigmatised, criminalised or driven out of the sector completely, which is what has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">Another area to which I refer is the need to tackle illegal fishing.  I am against illegal fishing.  Illegal fishing has been estimated to be as much as one third the value of the entire legal catch in Irish waters, but that could be a gross underestimate.  That is being taken primarily by foreign vessels coming into Irish waters and taking the stocks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">The Minister made reference to the searches and landings.</p>

          <p eId="para_1136">He stated that 6.7% of Irish landings were inspected, while 33% of the non-Irish landings were inspected.  That is a total distortion.  A large percentage of the non-Irish vessels are landing outside of this State, while almost 100% of Irish vessels are landing here.  That is a distortion and it is misleading and should not have been in the Minister's speech because it does not bear out the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">I attended a meeting yesterday in Athlone.  It was an honour to be there, but it was also depressing to see genuine men and women congregating and giving up a day's work, possibly two if they had far to travel to attend, to try to get justice.  They were trying to lobby every elected representative and political party in order to do so.  I applaud them on how reasonable they have been to date.  They have given us every opportunity to resolve matters.  To do so we have to return to the European Union to tackle the Common Fisheries Policy to get justice and assume jurisdiction and sovereignty over our own waters.</p>

          <from>Deputy David Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_1138">I spoke earlier about two issues: under age drinking and the abuse of alcohol by people over 18 years of age.  The alcohol advisory group has proposed many recommendations.  It asks for an overall government policy, which I support.  Perhaps during the summer the Government and all Departments might produce such a policy before the next legislation is presented.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">I encourage the imposition of a levy on bottles and cans to encourage recycling.  This would be useful.  I agree with outlawing the sale of alcohol at cut prices and as a loss leader.  The association between alcohol and sport must be broken, especially in the advertising sector.  I call on sports bodies to take a responsible view on the matter.  The culture begins when people under the age of 18 years are brought into pavilions, bars and clubs for the cup to be filled.  We need to step back from this.  In my area some clubs have gone to restaurants rather than bars, which I applaud.  I encourage more clubs and associations to do likewise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">We must examine the matter of non-alcoholic beers and try to encourage a pricing structure which would make them more attractive.  The same applies to soft drinks which are very expensive too.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">We need to see a greater presence of gardaí on the streets to combat public disorder.  Staggered closing times for pubs must be explored and encouraged.  The alcohol advisory group has done much work in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">I am concerned that many young people have no place in which to socialise.  They go to shopping centres but are hunted away.  We need youth cafés, youth centres and a proper youth service.  I taught for many years in a second level school and know that schools can only do so much.  There may be programmes in schools, but they only go so far.  We need to have professional youth services available.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_569">
          <from>Deputy John Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_1143">I broadly welcome the objectives of the Bill in seeking to tackle the growing problem of excessive alcohol consumption.  Excessive alcohol consumption and binge drinking by young people place a huge strain on public health resources and exacerbate the problems of anti-social behaviour and criminal activity.  The Bill does not tackle the cultural problem that Ireland has with alcohol consumption.  If we were serious about curbing excessive consumption, we would be discussing the banning of all relevant advertising, especially advertisements associated with sports such as Gaelic games, rugby, horse racing and many others which facilitate alcohol advertisements.  This advertising plays a critical role in the glamorisation of alcohol.  If we were serious about curbing excessive consumption, we would also deal decisively with the below cost selling of alcohol, especially the campaigns to promote the sale of spirits.  We would consider a prohibition of the use of alcohol purchases as a means of increasing bonus or loyalty points, a significant issue when one examines the growth of under-cost selling by supermarkets.  I have a vested interest in this issue as I work in the retail trade.  I know the difficulties in the promotion by all retail chains of the sale of alcohol.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">If we were serious about curbing excessive consumption, we would discuss the need for health warnings on all alcohol containers.  Deputy Stanton referred to the Office of Tobacco Control.  There should be a corresponding body to deal with the problem of excessive alcohol consumption.  Measures restricting the sale of cigarettes and health warnings on packets have proved very effective.  If we were serious about curbing excessive consumption, we would also consider the feasibility of providing for traceability to the retail outlet of all alcohol containers sold, which would be possible with the available technology.  It would be feasible to use bar codes and so on for this purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">We are not considering such measures because the Government is not interested in taking decisive action on this important issue.  Within the very limited terms of the Bill some of the proposals are disproportionate and unworkable.  The Bill does not address the issue of mandatory identification cards for persons under the age of 21 years.  The Garda has invested heavily in state-of-the-art forgery proof identification cards, but there has been a very low take up because it is not mandatory to have such a card.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">Section 8 of the Bill states mixed trading retailers will have to construct a separate area for the display and sale of alcohol.  Small shops that cannot make such a structural alteration will have to place all alcohol behind the counter.  Retailers will face serious problems in complying with this provision.  Prohibitive costs will be incurred in building a separate area and the erection of new shelving.  There will also be problems with planning and health and safety issues.  All this assumes a retailer will have sufficient space available for the construction of such an area, but many retailers do not.  Such an area will have to be separately manned, increasing staffing levels, which may outweigh the issue of viability for many small independent retailers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">With regard to the sale of wine, 12 bottles of wine represents the sale of one bottle of Powers whiskey, a ratio of 12 to one.  This has changed considerably in recent years.  Consumption of wine is not common among young people.  I operate an off-licence and know only too well that there is no excessive alcohol abuse in the consumption of wine.  This happens at a different level with the abuse of spirits, or at least the level of abuse would be considerably smaller in the case of wine consumption.  If the proposal allows for an open retail outlet, prohibiting the sale of wine behind a counter is a draconian measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">The consequence of these provisions will be that family-owned village mixed-trading retail premises, including shops in small towns, will be forced out of business because only the largest retail chains will be able to afford to meet the new requirements for selling alcohol.  I am concerned about the Government's policies for rural Ireland.  It has launched a process of unpicking the fabric of rural and coastal communities stitch by stitch, post office by post office, house by house, through the serial introduction of regulations and restrictions that impact most heavily on such communities.  In this case the regulation will affect family-owned village mixed-trading retail premises which are the backbone of small town and villages.  Sadly, the Government appears to be more interested in ending rural heritage and traditions than in striving to keep them alive.  I will maintain pressure on it to have our rich rural heritage recognised and protected by legislation, rather than threatened by it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">The Bill completely ignores the Border factor.  In Border regions persons under the age of 21 years can freely travel to off-licences and retail outlets in Northern Ireland to purchase alcohol.  Such a scenario will completely dilute the objectives of the Bill in such regions.  While the overall objectives of the Bill are to be welcomed, we cannot have a situation where persons under the age of 21 years will be prohibited from purchasing alcohol in retail and off-licence premises in this jurisdiction, while they can travel a few short miles across the Border and freely purchase alcohol in similar outlets.  They will claim they are only doing what the Tánaiste, Deputy Coughlan, recently advised shoppers to do if they wished to avoid being ripped off by the major retail food chains.  The Government advises shoppers that if they wish to avoid being ripped off by major retail or food chains, to shop in the North.  That was the Tánaiste's argument on the stacked up costs to retailers, as well as taxation.  All she could indicate on local radio was that we should shop in the North.  It is an indictment of the inability of this Government to deal with the stacked up costs of doing business in this country.  It is a facade of protectionism.</p>

        <speech by="#PJSheenan" eId="spk_570">
          <from>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</from>
          <p eId="para_1150">I thank Deputy Stanton for allowing me time to say a few words on this very interesting proposed legislation.  I dislike the move to annihilate the small shopkeepers and put them out of business by imposing an additional burden on already overburdened businessmen and women.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">The Minister is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut in this case by imposing section 7 of this Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008.  The section is a technical proposal which gives jurisdiction for granting the certificate for a wine retailer's off-licence to the District Court and provides for the giving of advanced notice of applications for such licences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">The Government alcohol advisory group established by the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in January 2008 must be scraping the bottom of the barrel to find measures to combat shortcomings in the licensed trade.  Why was there no debate in this House on its proposals before bringing this Bill to the House?</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">The group compared the corner shop operator with the giant multinational supermarkets and garages which have the privilege of having a spirit and beer retailer's off-licence, and which can buy in bulk.  The convenience or corner shop can only purchase a couple of dozen bottles of red and white wine under an existing wine licence.  Why impose extra expense on an unfortunate shopkeeper in making him or her apply to the District Court for a certificate, and then to the Revenue Commissioners for a wine licence?  The shopkeeper must then compete with the giant superstores, which can offer up to 50% off the price of such bottles of wine or offer two bottles of wine for the price of one.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">If that was not bad enough, the Minister is again using a sledgehammer to drive the last nail into the coffin of the corner shop in the very next section.  Section 8 provides for the structural separation of alcohol products from other products in premises engaged in mixed trading, such as convenience stores, small supermarkets and petrol stations.  Alcohol is to be displayed and sold in separate areas of the premises, in which access is controlled.  In a fair-sized shop that cannot expand any further, there would be no room to put alcohol behind the counter.  There may only be a few feet for a checkout desk, so how can the Minister be so cruel as to impose that section?  The Minister should allow sanity to prevail and exempt convenience stores and shops under a certain square footage from section 8.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155">Taxpayers' money is being used as propaganda.  For years the Government has spent public moneys trying to curtail the consumption of alcohol and tobacco.  The money has been wasted and has not led to a reduction of one iota in the consumption of alcohol and tobacco.  The most recent survey has shown an increase in tobacco consumption.  Such advertising is propaganda, as it has allowed the Government to remove resistance to even more restrictive legislation on every occasion it wants.  What would the Supreme Court rule if a case similar to the McKenna case was put before it?  In the McKenna judgment the Supreme Court restricted the Government from using public money to advocate its own case in referendums?</p>
          <p eId="para_1156">The present advertisement from one State agency states a person can never drink and drive.  I know of no law allowing for a zero level of alcohol.  Is this not another example of propaganda softening up public opinion before lowering the limit from 80 mg/100ml to 50 mg/100ml?</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">Before he facilitates the passage of this legislation, I ask the Minister, in his wisdom, not to impose sections 7 and 8 which use a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</p>

          <p eId="para_1161">This is a very important Bill but it should, like some alcoholic drinks, be allowed to mature.  We receive representations about social disorder, particularly as it occurs late at night on streets, in estates and in waste areas.  There are complaints of intimidation, harassment and sometimes violence.  There is a broader issue than just the commercial interests from which we have received representations, important as they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162">In the past, excessive drinking has caused financial difficulties.  This may also happen in the future.  The report of the Government alcohol advisory group, on which this legislation is based, draws attention to the high level of alcohol consumption in this country.  One must worry about the long-term health effects, especially of young people engaging in binge drinking because money is so freely available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163">There is a need for other activities to be available, such as sporting activities, entertainment and youth services.</p>

          <p eId="para_1172">Being able to get alcohol and other things until quite late in the evening is one of the amenities of modern life.  We should not adopt an over-puritanical zeal.  I am reminded of Sir Toby Belch's retort to Malvolio in "Twelfth Night", "Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?"  On the other hand, we should not encourage uncontrolled consumption and misbehaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173">As I said at the beginning, legislative proposals of this type are capable of fine tuning.  The Minister correctly conceded on the issue of early opening for which a persuasive case was made, although only where it now exists.</p>

          <p eId="para_1175">Most if not all public representatives have received detailed representations from the retail trade, focused on the practicalities of some of the proposed regulations.  I am glad the Minister has indicated that detailed discussions and negotiations are taking place on a voluntary code of practice, independently monitored and enforced.  If achieved, such a code will be a welcome and constructive measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176">It is correct to have some measures to prevent a proliferation of off-licences in particular places.  I am also pleased to note the introduction of the time limits of 10.30 a.m. and 12.30 a.m. on Sundays.  I was never sure of the reason these limits were removed.  It is important the Garda has the ability to act, in the case of a group which is causing a disturbance, for instance, in an area of waste ground, to confiscate drink where a nuisance is being caused.  I would not quarrel with the covert measures to deal with the sale of alcohol to persons under age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177">As Minister of State with responsibility for the arts, I am impressed by the number of theatres in Dublin when looked at from a licensing point of view.  One would never know from advertisements in the arts pages that there were so many theatres.  For this reason, I understand the reason this issue is being addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178">The cost of soft drinks on licensed premises, while outside the remit of the Bill, was referred to by Deputy Stanton and in the report of the alcohol advisory group.  Soft drinks in premises cost at least as much as a pint.  I accept, however, that pubs have overheads and other costs and these items may not be as cheap as they would be over the counter in a shop.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179">The broader issue of social drinking, particularly in the countryside, was also adverted to.  Essentially, this is not a problem in the cities where taxis and public transport are available.  However, an issue arises in rural areas.  While the law must be the same for everyone, just as tax inspectors will focus on profiles for tax evaders rather than going after every ordinary PAYE taxpayer, so the Garda should concentrate on areas where the problem is greatest.  Nevertheless, I would not object to the Government or public health agencies advertising the ideal because I believe it is preferable not to drink if one wishes to drive.  That is not to say the limit will be lowered to zero or some impractical level but there is never any harm in holding the ideal before people.</p>

          <p eId="para_1180">I welcome the Minister's decision to heed his party colleagues and Members from other parties on proposals regarding early morning licences, of which there are three in Cork.  The three premises in question, the Welcome Inn, The Sextant and Charlies, are run extremely well and have held early morning licences for many decades.  They serve the docklands and other areas and cater for people completing night shifts.  I am pleased the Minister has reversed his earlier decision.  It is an important step because the early morning houses are well run and open at times of the morning when difficulties do not arise.</p>

          <from>Deputy Noel O’Flynn</from>
          <p eId="para_1182">I also welcome the Minister's decision to heed Members and representatives of industry on the cordoning off of areas for the sale of alcohol in supermarkets.  I note that supermarkets have already begun to move all alcohol into one area rather than placing such products at points of sale where they are an attractive option.  I hope the supermarkets will take the Minister's advice and agree to introduce a code of practice on below cost selling and address the many other issues in the area of alcohol availability and price which are causing problems for us.  It is outrageous, for example, that beer can be purchased more cheaply than water.  I hope the supermarkets will be practical and act responsibly in these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183">Public disorder is a source of serious concern to me and other Members.  The number of my constituents with these concerns has increased substantially since I was first elected to Dáil Éireann.  The current position is remarkably different from that which pertained when I was first elected to Cork City Council.  It was during my time on the council that I first became aware of the need for tougher penalties to curb the rise in binge drinking, public disorder and drinking in public places.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184">In 1998, I and a number of colleagues pioneered secondary legislation to prohibit alcohol consumption in public streets and places in Cork.  I pay tribute to the former long-standing Senator, Denis Cregan, who is recovering from an operation.  Members send their best wishes to Mr. Cregan who was one of the members of a sub-committee established to address this issue as a result of a motion I tabled in the council.  The idea originated with the late Mr. Jim Sweeney and Mr. Noel Dalton, one of my advisers, who is also deceased.  Superintendent Martin Shanahan and Brian Bermingham, the current Lord Mayor of Cork, were also on the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">We travelled the streets of Cork until 4 a.m. to observe what unfolded late at night.  It was appalling to see so many people drinking and falling all over the place with bottles in their hands.  Some of them started fights or got into other kinds of trouble and were arrested.  I am pleased we introduced the prohibition which has worked in most places.  All the other local authorities followed suit and in fact one or two of them even beat us to the punch because the wheels of bureaucracy in Cork City Council did not move as fast as elsewhere.  Nevertheless, we were first to have the idea.  I ask that other local authorities introduce similar secondary legislation to complement the primary legislation being introduced.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelOFlynn" eId="spk_590">
          <from>Deputy Noel O’Flynn</from>
          <p eId="para_1187">I am pleased my colleagues in Cork County Council introduced similar legislation in certain parts of the county following years of being asked to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">Parts of certain towns and cities turn in to no-go areas at certain times of the day and night.  Gangs of people binge drinking and loitering in public spaces are a source of intimidation and anxiety to local residents.  This is particularly noticeable in the summer months when people are out and about more in the evenings and school children are on their summer holidays.  One of the provisions in the Bill will enable the Garda to seize alcohol from a person of any age who is causing nuisance in public.  Another provision deals specifically with those aged under 18 years who are in possession of alcohol.  New powers under the Bill will enable the Garda to seize the alcohol and impose punitive fines for teenagers unwilling to allow alcohol to be seized.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">The extent and seriousness of our binge drinking culture can be put in context when one considers the figures the Minister cited in his address to the House last week.  That Irish people consume more alcohol than any of our European neighbours will surprise some people.  It is shocking, however, that on average every Irish person aged 15 years and over consumes 20.8 units of alcohol per week.  This figure does not include the 20% of adults who do not drink.  The Minister also cited the 2007 Eurobarometer survey which found that 34% of Irish drinkers consumed five or more alcoholic drinks in one sitting compared with the EU average of 10%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190">The impact of this drink culture can be felt at all levels of society, whether in drink related deaths on our roads, alcohol injuries, which account for almost 30% of all cases in accident and emergency departments, or the corrosive effect alcohol has on family life in every townland in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">The vast majority of publicans run orderly licensed premises and do not tolerate binge or heavy drinking.  Much of the problem is due to young people and not so young people buying slabs of beer and bringing them to houses.  Young people also drink shots and vodka is extremely popular among them.  I checked the position in this regard and I am aware of what is happening.  Before they go out at night, the people to whom I refer are well set up from the point of view of alcohol.  They do not frequent pubs but instead go directly to nightclubs.  I am not stating that these individuals are being disorderly but they are drinking alcohol in an uncontrolled environment, namely, in people's houses.  People are consuming large amounts of alcohol and their behaviour is giving rise to some of the difficulties being experienced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192">Alcohol has crept into every facet of Irish life.  We celebrate with champagne, drown our sorrows over a few pints, enjoy a summer's day with a pint of cider in a beer garden and have a hot toddy on cold dark winter nights.</p>

          <p eId="para_1196">The St. Patrick's Day parade is in danger of becoming a shrine to our binge drinking culture.  As a society, we must learn to find other ways of socialising and enjoying ourselves.  The Mediterranean way of life — enjoying a sociable drink or two, with good food and in good company — has much to recommend it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197">The Bill also deals with the huge increase in the availability of alcohol.  The number of off-licences has increased by 70% since 2001.  During the same period, the number of wine-only off-licences has trebled.  New measures will make it tougher to obtain off-licence permits and, for the first time, such measures will apply in respect of wine-only licences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198">As stated earlier, convenience stores and supermarkets blatantly advertise cut-price alcohol.  Posters advertising cheap alcohol are clearly aimed at both binge drinkers and those who are under age.</p>

          <p eId="para_1202">I hope that new measures being introduced in the Bill will see an end to this practice.  Negotiations involving the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have led to the introduction of a code of practice.  In that context, I hope the sales and marketing techniques used by suppliers and retailers will reflect the wishes of the Oireachtas and the Department sponsoring the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203">There is nothing wrong with off-licences closing at 10 p.m.  I live in Clonskeagh, which is a couple of miles from the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The off-licence there closes at 10 p.m.  It might be a condition of the licence that this is the case.  When travelling home from the Dáil, I do not see anyone queuing outside to buy alcohol at 9.55 p.m.  The 10 p.m. closing time for off-licences will not greatly inconvenience anyone and I welcome its introduction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">On under age drinking, earlier today the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Wallace, launched new guidelines which will restrict the advertisement of alcohol on television.  She stated that a process to identify areas in respect of alcohol advertising, promotions and sponsorships where further legislation would afford greater protection to young people will be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">I would like to see an end to the link between sporting events and alcohol.  By continuing to link high-profile sporting events with alcohol, we are sending out the wrong message.  The reality is that alcohol consumption severely inhibits people's ability to compete.  We must change our attitude to alcohol.  Breaking the link between alcohol and sport would be a very positive step in the right direction.  I urge all sporting organisations to seek sponsorship from business interests that are not involved in the alcohol industry.  If they do so, they will be able to phase out sponsorship from alcohol companies.  A number of larger sporting organisations have already commenced the process in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206">Alcohol consumption has increased at a staggering rate in the past ten years.  We have gone from being a nation of normal drinkers to one of alcohol abusers.  The effects of this on society are shocking and disturbing.  We are suffering as a result of increased public disorder, higher rates of alcohol-fuelled violence and alcohol-related mental health problems.  The Bill represents an important step in tackling this issue.  It is time we reclaimed our towns and cities in order that people might walk the streets without falling over drunken individuals or being obliged to navigate their way through empty bottles, cans and the other things that are usually left over after a night's drinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207">I am delighted that action was taken in respect of this matter in Cork.  The system there is not perfect but at least the by-laws are in place and are proving to be of assistance.  The Bill before us is extremely important.  I encourage local authorities in west Cork and other areas throughout the country which have responsibility for seaside resorts to introduce by-laws similar to those to which I refer.</p>

          <p eId="para_1211">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this issue, which is much discussed.  Many and various people have offered the ultimate answers in respect of this matter.  I am not sure the Bill will address all of the issues to which previous speakers referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">There is always a danger that we might fail to recognise what are the real problems.  When people did not have as much money available to them as was the case up until a couple of weeks ago, the problem was not so great because many could not afford to consume large amounts of alcohol at weekends.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213">I am concerned about the activities of the zealots whose ambition it is to close everything down in the hope that this will solve all our problems.  The latter will not prove to be the case.  I am also concerned with regard to the developing trend of people holding house parties, the alcohol for which is sourced from supermarkets or off-licences.  Those attending such events can engage in extremely heavy drinking and this often results in serious rows.  The authorities have no control over parties of this nature and people can, unobserved and unsupervised, drink alcohol and take drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214">Some public houses have been unduly blamed for creating problems.  In the past, most well-run public houses had a cranky barman who would tell a customer to go home — either at the end of the night or beforehand — if he adjudged that the latter had enough drink taken.  He might also ask whether the person intended to go home at all.  In certain instances, the barman might ring the person's home and alert "she who must be obeyed" as to the current whereabouts of the drinker.  There were many aspects of local legislation in this regard which had a serious impact but which have gone by the wayside and been forgotten.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215">The most serious development in respect of people's drinking habits is the fact that the rural pub trade is being slowly strangled, which is sad.  Rural pubs have been in operation for generations and they act as social centres and meeting points for people of all ages.  There is a notion abroad that this type of thing should be stymied.  In my view, some economist has decided that there should be no life in rural areas and that houses should not be built in these areas.  Local authorities are doing a good job of ensuring that the latter will be the case and their efforts have the full support of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Post offices, which are part of the communications network in rural areas, are being closed down, as are petrol stations and local shops.  The life is slowly being strangled out of rural areas.  This is being done in the interests of mass marketing and the creation of new urban centres.  If one consults a sociologist or a psychologist, he or she will inform one that living in such urban centres is not ideal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216">There have always been problems with regard to alcohol during certain periods in this country's history.  One of the difficulties that emerged in rural areas in the 1940s and 1950s came about as a result of the manufacture of moonshine.  The problem with poitín and alcohol of that type was that standards relating to its quality fluctuated and the drinking practices of those who consumed it went unregulated.  There was no control over it whatsoever and it caused horrendous damage in rural areas.  It was recognised by church and State alike as a particularly bad phenomenon that had to be stamped out.  It filtered away over the years — no pun intended — and has now virtually disappeared.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">The problem we now face is the easy availability of alcohol to young people who do not seem able to control the consequences.  Anti-social behaviour is not always the result of drunkenness.  Members of this House have encountered countless cases of anti-social behaviour in which alcohol was not involved, although that does not excuse drunkenness.  The current generation of school leavers seems to lack responsibility and direction.  They do not seem to be capable of examining the negative and positive options involved in binge drinking, which can cause serious and permanent damage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218">The question of zero tolerance should be addressed.  I hope the Government does not proceed in that direction because it could have serious consequences for rural Ireland.  Where will people drink and is it a bad idea?  If we are to be self-righteous on this subject, we should ask whether alcohol should be banned, as was done in the United States in the 1920s.  Prohibition was spectacularly unsuccessful in that country.  The people who want to legalise certain drugs would claim that it was in the hands of the wrong people but I do not know.  I do not think we should go down that road.  A person who had three or four drinks on a Saturday or Sunday night will not risk going to work the following morning unless he or she has a driver.  That is the stark reality of zero tolerance.  It might be thought an easy way to catch people on the basis that it would discourage the consumption of alcohol altogether, but in fact it discourages driving and drinking.  We must ask whether we want to abolish that particular practice altogether.  Personally, I would go along with either side if it seemed to be the right thing to do but I warn that serious social consequences will ensue.</p>

          <p eId="para_1220">Absolutely.  As time goes on, it will be seen as part of an economic objective to extinguish the countryside.  Eventually, the countryside will be nothing more than a parkland where people can take a stroll on the weekend or go for a picnic.  That would be an appalling situation.  It is no good for people to say that the intention is high-minded.  That is utter rubbish because as members of local authorities we have seen the natural progression.</p>

          <p eId="para_1222">Newspapers have reported that Deputies are acquiescent to publicans but the latter live and work in the country.  I received only one representation on this Bill and a number of people were supportive of it.  We must ask where we are heading.  If we are heading towards the scenario to which I referred, we will face a dangerous problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223">Everybody has to live and take responsibility.  In response to representations from many sources over the years, we extended the opening hours of pubs.  I am not sure that was a great idea.  If our population is not sufficiently mature to handle that, it may have been the wrong decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224">When I first entered this House, there were few, if any, off-licences in the country.  A campaign was started to develop the off-licence industry, with the result that in some parts of the country publicans close their pubs and operate off-licences instead because the latter provides a solid trade.  Alcohol is not consumed on the premises, so it is economically beneficial for the publican.  The consequences, however, can be disastrous.  I do not propose to set out the number of occasions on which a tragedy occurred in the aftermath of large purchases of alcohol from off-licences or supermarkets.  I do not understand why no reference is made to the connection between road traffic accidents and the amount of alcohol consumed in private houses.  No consideration is given to whether the alcohol is readily available in an uncontrolled environment, where a half bottle could be the same as a half a glass.  That is a hugely important aspect of the matter under consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225">Extraordinary and disgraceful actions are taking place in conjunction with the consumption of alcohol and, in many cases, drugs.  There is little emphasis on the role of drugs in road traffic accidents.  Some of us raised this issue several years ago but nobody bothered to listen.  It is said that alcohol is equal to illicit drugs.  It is a habit-forming drug but the difference is that few people use violence to obtain money for alcohol.</p>

          <p eId="para_1228">That is fine.  People will readily say we have research but that word has been greatly abused in recent times.  Those of us who work in politics use research at times to come up with various answers.  We also use those famous focus groups to come up with answers that are self-serving to a great extent.  I do not know what useful information is provided other than that which is already available and which everybody knows.  Occasionally, we get the information dramatically wrong, such as in regard to the anticipated result of an election.  Where were the focus groups in these circumstances, what were they doing and who unplugged their message centre?  Research can prove anything one wishes.  It can point to all kinds of solutions to all types of problems.  However, if it were that effective we would not have any problems with alcohol, drink driving or any other issue good, bad or indifferent.  I tend to take research with a proverbial pinch of salt.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229">In the general scheme of things, no one would agree with the abuse of alcohol, drink driving or family disharmony arising from the consumption of alcohol, an issue I had intended to speak about earlier.  There are many households for whom the combined consumption of alcohol and drugs creates a misery.  The situation of the unfortunate alcoholic who cannot break the habit, even with the best will in the world, is also sad.  These people, having obtained treatment and tried everything, often still cannot break the habit.  It is easy for us to say something should be done about this but it is not all that easy for those whose families are afflicted in this fashion.  That one person in a family continually resorts to serious over-indulgence in alcohol resulting in abuse and violence in the household is sad and appalling.  This has always been the case; the situation has not changed with the passage of time.  However, people now have more disposable income than they had 25 or 30 years ago.  As a result, they are spending more money in this way and never without neglect in other areas.  There is a consequence and a price to pay for everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230">I hope this legislation does some good and achieves what it purports to do, something we must all hope for.  I do not believe it will abolish all the problems in this area.  I also hope it does not become the death knell of social life in rural Ireland for the good and obvious reason that rural Ireland has faithfully and strongly supported this country's social and economic cause down through the years and will continue to do so.  I see no reason it should not continue to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231">The new generation, young people and school leavers in particular, need to be taught responsibility.  I do not know how this can be done.  Many of us are parents and know well how closely young people need to be watched.  There is no excuse for junior certificate students going on a binge that lasts for two days.  That is totally and absolutely unnecessary.  It shows an appalling lack of judgment on the part of a person so young.  While most parents pay special attention to the needs of such students there will always be one or two students and parents who do not do so and this, in turn, leads to peer pressure that results in the type of issues about which we are speaking.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232">I hope some of the issues raised by Members of the House, which are drawn from their own experience in their dealings with the public and their knowledge of what goes on in urban and rural Ireland, are taken on board by some of the focus groups and specialists who resort to the information gleaned in surveys and opinion polls.  There is nothing like the voice of the true participant in rural and urban social life in Ireland.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Fitzpatrick</from>
          <p eId="para_1235">I welcome the Bill as presented by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  I also welcome the changes made by the Minister following extensive consultations.  Ireland's place on the European alcohol league table is not something of which we should be proud.  While the Bill does not address all our ills, it goes a long way to addressing the areas examined last January by the alcohol advisory group established by the Government.  It is essential that we all sign up to this legislation and help to implement it in an effective manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236">I wish to raise a number of specific issues.  I welcome the proposed penalties to deal with rogue traders, publicans and off-licences that sell alcohol to young people.  Another problem referred to is that of people drinking at home and then going to the pub for the last hour.  It is difficult for publicans to identify such people.  This issue needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237">I am glad the Minister has decided not to include in the Bill a proposal to separate or fence-off drinks and customers and that people will continue to be able to browse and make their own choices before purchasing.  I hope the trade will, during the next year or so, introduce a voluntary code in this regard thus meaning the Minister will not have to make regulations in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1238">Excessive consumption of alcohol causes serious issues for families and accident and emergency departments.  It results in anti-social behaviour generally and absenteeism, all at substantial cost to taxpayers.  I see merit in the Minister providing in future legislation for manufacturers, vintners organisations, wholesalers and the trade to pay a levy into a fund which could be used to treat people affected by alcohol.  This type of support by the trade would be equally as beneficial as its existing support for sporting organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239">A need exists also to recognise the great work being done by various groups and organisations, many of them voluntary organisations, including Alcoholics Anonymous.  I pay particular tribute to Sister Concilio at Chuain Mhuire, Athy, County Kildare for the work she is doing.  A fund sponsored by the trade would provide badly needed funds to these organisations which must depend on the State and voluntary sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240">Young people should be educated about the dangers of excessive indulgence in alcohol.  A module in the transition year programme for second level students and in the back to education and outreach programmes could be very helpful in this regard.  Indeed this type of programme could be extended to the workplace and could result in a decrease in instances of alcohol related illnesses and absenteeism.</p>
          <p eId="para_1241">Licensees should be fully aware that their licences are a valuable commodity which must be respected.  Publicans should carry out their business in an orderly and reasonable manner.  They should recognise their responsibility to ensure they and their employees take all reasonable steps to ensure they are fully compliant with the legislation.  These regulations must apply also to those who lease premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242">Local authorities have introduced by-laws in towns and villages preventing the consumption of alcohol in public places.  These by-laws have played an important role in the prevention of anti-social behaviour.  I welcome the new arrangement whereby applicants must apply to the District Court rather than the Revenue Commissioners for various licences.  This will ensure more transparency in this area.  The grounds on which an objection may be made to the granting of a District Court certificate for an off-licence are to be extended to include consideration of neighbourhood needs and the existing number of licences in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">Another issue which the Minister should examine and which is not dealt with in the Bill is that of pleasure boats with a full public house licence travelling back and forth daily on our waterways.  Applicants for licences of this type should also go before the District Courts.  I welcome the inclusion in the Bill of provisions regarding the introduction of CCTV in certain venues.  A programme of spot-testing for this service would be helpful to ensure the equipment is in good working order.  Similarly, the test purchasing of alcohol by gardaí is welcome, as is the fact that gardaí will have the power to seize bottles, cans and containers where there is reasonable apprehension of public disorder and to ask people to leave an area in a peaceful and orderly manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1244">Nothing in this Bill has a detrimental effect on rural pubs, which is welcome.  In rural areas the pub is not just a place to drink.  There is no place like a good Irish pub and, dare I say, there is nothing like a good Kildare pub.  The Bill will reduce the threat of public order offences arising from the over-consumption of intoxicating liquor.  I welcome the introduction of identification cards, particularly those issued by Garda liaison officers, which have played a major part in preventing under age drinking and improving the quality of life of those affected by it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245">I suggest that in future Bills we introduce regulations with regard to staff and security personnel who must deal with young people on licensed premises.</p>

          <p eId="para_1247">It is important that security people be courteous and understanding of young people.  They must not be seen as targets or as the sole abusers of alcohol.  Many older people are also abusers, but young people appear to be the main targets.  We should also investigate the labelling of alcohol products, as for tobacco products, to show the consequences of overindulgence.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1248">I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for agreeing to share his time with me and I welcome the opportunity to contribute on Second Stage of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249">We must acknowledge there is a problem in this country with regard to the abuse of alcohol.  I emphasise the word "abuse" because there hundreds of thousands of people who consume alcohol in a responsible fashion on a regular basis.  They get enjoyment from it and do so without causing harm to themselves or a nuisance to anyone else.  It is important we put the debate in context.  Notwithstanding this, we need to be honest with ourselves and acknowledge there is a problem with widespread abuse of alcohol in society.  Some of the implications of the consumption of alcohol in an abusive manner, as the Minister outlined in his Second Stage speech, are a wake-up call, if one were needed, about the negative consequences of this problem.  For example, he mentioned that alcohol is a factor in 28% of all attendances at accident and emergency departments in our acute hospitals, that alcohol is a contributory factor in 36% of fatal road crashes, that 46% of those who commit suicide are intoxicated at the time, and that alcohol is involved in 25% of domestic abuse cases.  The abuse of alcohol also has a negative effect on the economy.  It contributes to absenteeism and leads to poor performance at work.  If we were to calculate the effect in monetary terms, although it would probably be impossible to do so, it would run into billions of euro.  However, the personal costs are incalculable.  If we consider some of the results of alcohol abuse, such as road crashes and domestic abuse, we can see that the fallout in society is very serious.  This makes it all the more important that the House treat this Bill as a priority and ensure its passage at the earliest possible time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">People living in communities throughout the country are terrorised by the anti-social behaviour sometimes associated with the abuse of alcohol.  Every politician in this House is contacted on a regular basis by constituents who are dealing with that in their daily lives.  We must accept in this debate that our love affair with alcohol, as a country, is not without consequence.  Gardaí have an extremely difficult job in dealing with the abuse of alcohol and its fallout in society.  There is nothing we can do in this House that will in itself resolve the alcohol problem in Ireland, but there are measures we can adopt which will help the Garda in carrying out its difficult task of managing the fallout of alcohol abuse.  These measures must, in line with this Bill, deal with two issues: public order and controls on the environment in which alcohol is sold in both the off-trade and the on-trade.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and his predecessor, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on the speedy adoption the report of the Government alcohol advisory group.  The report was submitted, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows, at the end of March.  The general scheme of the Bill was published in April, and we are here now, sitting late, to deal with Second Stage.  It is to be hoped we will move towards the final adoption of the Bill in the days ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">I welcome the contribution made by the Bill in curtailing the consumption of alcohol in public places and that it allows gardaí to seize alcohol from persons who are under age.  I was mistakenly of the view that the Garda already had this power.  Many gardaí have already been exercising it without it being in statute form.  They did so in a discretionary manner and they will continue to use the power wisely.  In Cork county and city, as Deputy Noel O'Flynn pointed out, specific by-laws are already in place prohibiting the consumption of alcohol in public places.  I know from my experience in Cork county that this works quite well.  It varies depending on the level of enforcement by the Garda, but my experience is that these measures are helpful and that young people fear the seizure of alcohol and the consequences of being caught drinking in a public place as it will be brought to their parents' attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1252">It is important to point out that the new measures put forward in this Bill are additional to all of the existing powers of the Garda Síochána.  They are not in themselves the answer to the problem but if used judiciously by the Garda they will help to deal with the problem of alcohol abuse.  They will also facilitate early intervention.  If a garda identifies a group of people drinking in a public place early in the evening he or she can intervene and possibly prevent problems that might arise three or four hours later when a lot more alcohol has been consumed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253">I welcome the Minister's statement in the House that he is willing to consider a code of practice to be put forward by the retail trade with regard to the structural separation proposed in section 8 of the Bill.  If a proper code of practice is introduced by the sector, provided it is subject to independent audit and verification, and if the evidence on the ground is that retailers are acting responsibly, the Minister will give them the benefit of the doubt and will not invoke the provisions of section 8 on structural separation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254">I welcome the restrictions on the hours in which alcohol may be sold by the off-trade.  They are sensible and helpful.  It is important the measures we put forward are meaningful and effective and contribute in a tangible way to dealing with the fallout of alcohol abuse.  When we were discussing this in the Fianna Fáil justice policy group, many of us made the point that controls at the point of sale are what really count.  When a person approaches a counter with alcohol, what checks and balances are employed by the person behind the counter?  Does he or she ask for identification?  How does he or she ensure that the person is not intoxicated and is over 18 years of age?</p>
          <p eId="para_1255">I welcome the broadening of the scope of objections that can be put forward by residents and the Garda when applications are made for off-licences.  That residents feel the demand for the off-trade has already been met in an area will be a justifiable reason to submit an objection to the issuing of a licence.  It is important that the penalties we impose for recurring breaches of this Bill and previous Acts are serious and feared by the trade.  The fact that a premises may be shut down for a minimum of two days is an important step forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">Much has been said in this House and outside about the move from the on-trade to the off-trade and the consequences for rural Ireland and alcohol consumption generally.  This is a fundamental point because when alcohol is consumed in a public house controls are in place.  The majority of public houses are owned by an identifiable person who has an interest in ensuring the establishment is well run and does not get a bad name or attract attention from the Garda.  The shift from the on-trade to the off-trade has meant more alcohol is now consumed in an uncontrolled environment, often at home or at parties.  The same controls are not in place and this may account for some of the problems that have taken hold in the past number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">With regard to special exemption orders, I welcome that a condition can be imposed that, on the granting of such an order, a closed circuit television, CCTV, system must be installed by a licensed premises.  The Minister should further extend this and require certain licensed premises to install CCTV in the surrounding area, perhaps covering up to 100 m either side of the premises on the street outside.  In the event of problems spilling onto the street the Garda would have the resource of CCTV to avail of in a related investigation.  I also welcome the fact that the District Court must be satisfied that all fire safety standards have been met before granting a special exemption order.  I welcome the tightening of provisions relating to theatre licences and the fact that they will be subject to normal licensing hours, as will any other public house.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">Some issues outside this Bill must be highlighted, particularly parental control.  Many of the problems in society relating to alcohol abuse are associated with young people, under age in many cases, consuming alcohol in an uncontrolled fashion without supervision.  No law can be passed in this House that will solve the issue of the abuse of alcohol; parents can achieve far more by working on the issue and I encourage them to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">The secondary purchasing of alcohol is already illegal but we should send out a loud and clear message that it is highly irresponsible of any adult to buy alcohol for an under age person.  Many adults do so at a profit, which is a disgraceful thing to do, and we should not be shy in condemning the practice.  Alcohol is now so cheap that we must put effective controls in place.  Section 13 allows for test purchasing, that is, the Garda using an under age person to attempt to buy alcohol.  Such sting operations have a much greater role to play, not just in terms of under age drinking but across a range of areas in criminal law.  I welcome this provision and hope the Garda use it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">I look forward to more progress in future on traceability and ID.  I welcome the fact that the Bill allows for the introduction of regulations dealing with alcohol being sold at promotions in a cheap and irresponsible fashion.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_615">
          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_1261">I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words on this Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008.  There is a sense of <i> déjà vu</i> in seeing another intoxicating liquor Bill as every Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform produces one and expects that it will do the business.  We see a new Bill each session after the failure of a previous Bill put forward by a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The problem remains as stark, dire and difficult to deal with after each Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262">The former Minister emphasised extending the opening hours of public houses but the current Minister emphasises the reduction of the opening hours of off-licences.  It is a case of one steps in and the other steps out; a shift in one direction is followed by shifts in other directions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263">The provisions of this Bill are pragmatic and should have an impact in addressing the situation they are meant to address.  They aim to resolve some of the public order issues that are related to the abuse of alcohol.  However, it is seldom that legislation effects a significant improvement in matters of this nature.  There is already much legislation relevant to this area that is not being implemented properly.  Policing is haphazard and <i>ad hoc</i> and operates differently in different parts of the country, different counties and urban and rural areas.  A certain flexibility exists in terms of Garda powers and this is an issue.  For example, in County Mayo, for the offence of serving drink to minors, there is a high level of prosecution of owners of public houses and off-licences.  In other areas prosecution for such offences hardly occurs.  How robustly the legislation is implemented depends on the superintendent or chief superintendent in charge.  This area could be addressed without new legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1264">There is an issue of lack of responsibility in the industry.  There is a willingness to allow situations where people consume too much drink to develop and a blind eye may be turned to individuals, who could well be adults, purchasing drink in off-licences for minors.  In general the industry has much to learn and the suggestion that it should be responsible for a fund to treat the negative effects of alcohol should be examined as such a scheme would show a certain level of responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1265">The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has often raised the issue of labelling and traceability.  It was included in the previous legislation and the 1999 legislation but it has never been implemented.  The Minister had the power to implement it but did not do so and nor did his predecessor.  There is not much sense in introducing such provisions if they are not to be implemented.  Labelling bottles, containers and cans of alcohol to identify where the product was sold, whether it be an off-licence, convenience store or supermarket, would be very useful for the Garda.  Gardaí would be helped by knowing the source of the product they find being abused in a field and such labelling should not be beyond the abilities of modern science, considering the extent to which barcoding for prices and stocktaking exists in shops.  That would be very helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_1266">Part 3 of the Bill, which sets out some new Garda Síochána powers, involves an amendment to the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 relating to the seizure of alcohol.  The Garda already has a considerable body of powers which could be implemented.  Its power to seize containers of alcohol in public places, at public events, etc., is not being implemented.  I suppose it is a starting point.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">I am pleased the alcohol advisory committee, which was established in January 2008, produced a report in March 2008.  It is almost a record for a body of that nature to report within three months.  This legislation, which results from that report, was published within a further three months and probably will be passed this month.  It is something of a record to meet all such deadlines.  The chairman of the committee, Mr. Gordon Holmes, did sterling work with this report, as he did with previous reports.  His practical work in dealing with these issues certainly represents a service to the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268">The three central issues which are covered in this legislation, in the interests of curtailing public disorder and anti-social behaviour on the streets, are quite separate.  The Bill addresses the increase in the number of supermarkets, convenience stores. petrol stations and off-licences selling alcohol, deals with the number of special exemption orders and sets out certain sanctions.  We are so used to anti-social behaviour on our streets that we are almost immune to it.  Such disorder does not surprise us greatly.  When one travels around public places, such as city streets and housing estates, on weekend nights, one observes this major problem.  One of the features of modern Ireland is the inordinate amount of disquiet and, in many cases, fear that is caused by groups of people who rove around in possession of containers of alcohol, or already having consumed alcohol.  This is a relatively new phenomenon in so far as it did not precede the Celtic tiger to any great degree.  New measures are required to deal with such actions, which have caused many people a considerable amount of grief.</p>
          <p eId="para_1269">Ireland is a nation that sees alcohol as its favourite drug.  Irish people have been happy to consume it over the years.  There is nothing new in that respect.  Alcohol seems to attract people of all classes and ages.  It is associated with junior certificate, leaving certificate and university students.  It is at the heart of virtually every social event, including communions, confirmations and weddings.  The social lives of most Irish people revolve around alcohol.  Legislation of this nature will not change that culture.  The need to address that culture may well be another day's work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270">As we consider the nuts and bolts of every Bill that is presented, we should also focus on our broader philosophy — the thrust of what we are trying to do.  It is not just a question of public order, which is the issue on the ground.  We also need to reflect on why public order offences represent such a huge problem.  I suggest that Ireland has never had a responsible attitude to alcohol consumption.  Irish people who are not pioneers tend to engage in over-consumption.  What is seen in Ireland as normal consumption of alcohol is seen on the Continent as binge drinking.  The attitude of most European people to the consumption of alcohol is different from the actual experience in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1271">Much more work, involving much more time than we can give to this Bill today, is needed if we are to address the issues I have mentioned.  Such a detailed consideration of these matters is the only way we can deal with this problem.  Regardless of the amount of effort we put into legislation, it will not represent more than the tip of the iceberg.  This problem is often highlighted on television when Irish sporting teams play abroad.  There is something extremely boorish about the behaviour of certain characters in the stands who wave the flags of public houses or wear Guinness t-shirts.  They are indicating it is their culture to have an affiliation with a public house or an alcoholic product.  I suggest that they are non-cultural — rather than cultural — expressions and symbols.</p>
          <p eId="para_1272">I do not doubt that the availability of alcohol is one of the factors that contributes to the problems under discussion.  The ready availability of alcohol leads to greater consumption of alcohol.  The same would be the case if drugs were freely available.  The trade in alcohol of supermarkets, off-licences, convenience stores and forecourts has mushroomed in recent years.  There has been an increase in this area since the advent of the Celtic tiger.  Now that the Celtic tiger is no more, I hope there will be a reduction in such activity.  The new approach to the consumption of alcohol involves more drinking outside the public house, specifically in the home.  There was a time when the consumption of alcohol was concentrated in public houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">We need to consider how alcoholic products are presented in supermarkets and convenience stores.  If one goes into a regular supermarket, one will find that alcohol is stocked in the same aisle that contains soft drinks, such as Lucozade, Coca-Cola and Pepsi.  A child who is looking for a soft drink has to go to the same aisle as those who are looking for alcohol.  There is a lot to be said for separating both types of refreshment.  A different type of clientele is attracted to each.  If young people find alcoholic products juxtaposed with soft drinks, that will make it easier for them to approach such products, including hard liquor.  I agree with the idea of outlawing the below-cost selling of alcohol and certain types of promotion of alcoholic products.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">We have not really spoken about the sale of alcohol Bill, which will make certain provisions in respect of sponsorship and advertising by alcohol companies.  It is of major importance that associations involved in sporting and other healthy activities distance themselves from tobacco and alcohol companies which have used despicable mechanisms to sell their products.  While there is no relationship between the two categories of organisation, they are always linked as if one leads to the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_1275">I am happy enough with the proposed restriction on the opening hours of off-licences.  If off-licences are open from 10.30 a.m. to 10 p.m., people will have enough time in which to sell alcohol.  I do not see a problem with that.  I suggest that we could provide for a later opening time on St. Patrick's Day, as the proposed 12.30 p.m. opening time is a little early.  The agreement that off-licences in Dublin city centre should not open until 4 p.m. on St. Patrick's Day, which was brokered by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, has resulted in a significant reduction in the awful mauling around the place at an early hour that has been associated with St. Patrick's Day in recent years.  I do not see the reason for restrictions on the early houses.  They are few and far between and the issue is one we can examine with a view to allowing them continue.  They do not tend in any way——</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
          <p eId="para_1279">I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for facilitating me in raising the plight of intellectually and disabled people who have finished their education in the special education school in St. Gabriel's, Bishopstown, County Cork.  They have received letters from their service provider, the Brothers of Charity, indicating that there is to be no subsequent placement for them.  They had expected an adult or a day-training placement.  Unfortunately, no such placement has been offered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">As the Minister of State will appreciate, this is causing great consternation to the young people concerned and their parents.  Such treatment might well be considered the thin end of the wedge but many more people can expect a similar outcome because of the lack of planning and foresight of the Government in preparing for the downturn in the economy and the recession we are experiencing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281">If such is the case this week, I shudder to think what will happen to the most vulnerable, needy and voiceless in our society the week after the House closes, when the Cabinet will take its decision to slash and burn services.  If this is a hallmark, or a foretaste, of what we can expect, then God help the most needy in society.  An old political slogan from the era of Charles J. Haughey stated that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped.  Undoubtedly, that adage still applies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">I have no doubt that the Minister of State's heart is in the right place.  I urge him to step out from behind his prepared script tonight and reassert the primacy of this House.  This is a House, not a Government, a House that voted to ring-fence €50 million of moneys for the care of people with a disability.  Who is running the country?  Is it the Oireachtas, by way of its Votes and specific funds for specific purposes, or is it the Health Service Executive and its bookkeepers, who are so involved in cash management?</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">If it is simply a case of cash management within the HSE, then it should be remembered that the service providers — of which there are many, and voluntary organisations also —  provide excellent care, sheltered employment, rehabilitation and assisted living home support, the whole range of services for people with a disability.  It should not be the case that these service providers and voluntary organisations are driven to a situation where they are obliged to communicate with their clients and with the parents of these unfortunate people with a disability.  They have been forced to tell parents that, as matters stand, there is no placement for their children in these organisations next September.  That is entirely unacceptable.  It causes trauma not only to the young people by putting an obstacle in front of them that prevents them achieving their potential, but also their parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">At the weekend I was contacted by parents of one such person.  Both parents work and it is not an option for them to leave their child unattended throughout the day at home.  These are real situations involving real people.  Who is in charge?  If the Government and the Oireachtas votes €50 million for people with a disability, it behoves the HSE to communicate with the voluntary organisations and service providers and ensure that those funds are delivered.  It is not acceptable management that these people should be treated like pawns in a political game between the Government and the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">This issue was raised earlier today by my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, who spoke about one of her constituents.  Each of the 166 Deputies has come across similar experiences.  Who is in charge?  Is it the Government, the Oireachtas or the HSE?  If we vote €50 million specifically for disability purposes, these people should not be denied a placement next September.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">The Minister should step out from behind his brief and prepared script and reassert the primacy of democracy in this House.  He must provide for the most vulnerable people because if this is the way the Government intends to act next week, or next month, when the Oireachtas is in recess, God help the most vulnerable and voiceless ones in society.  They will be the victims of Government cutbacks and of recession and that is not as it should be.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_1288">The fact that I speak tonight is a clear indication that this is a national problem.  I speak specifically on behalf of the parents of young adults who attend St. Vincent's in Lisnagry, County Limerick.  The service providers, the Daughters of Charity, have been forced to write to parents.  Nine young adults are involved, three of them school leavers, the other six finishing a rehabilitative training course.  I have a letter dated 25 June and I have no doubt that many such letters have been sent to parents of children with an intellectual disability because the service providers were not informed by the HSE that they can go ahead and recruit staff.  The letter states, in part:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1289">The Daughters of Charity have applied for funding to the Health Service Executive in order to provide the appropriate adult day service for your daughter this year.  Unfortunately, funding has not been released and, as a result, the Daughters of Charity are concerned that we may not be in a position to offer new services in 2008.  Therefore we cannot guarantee a service for your daughter in September.  The HSE is fully aware of our inability to provide additional services without additional funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">I put a question to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I am glad to see that the Minister of State with responsibility for the disabilities area, Deputy John Moloney, is in the House tonight.  It is appropriate that he is here and I am glad that he recognises the seriousness of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">I asked the Minister to clarify that multi-annual funding for the disability sector promised in the programme for Government is to be fulfilled in 2008.  I got a reply just over a month ago which stated: "The Government has fulfilled its promise in relation to the 2008 element of the multi-annual investment programme 2006-2009 by allocating additional funding of €50 million to the HSE's 2008 budget".</p>
          <p eId="para_1292">That is not true.  The funding has not been allocated.  The Government must put its money where its mouth is.  I understand from my soundings that the Department of Health and Children is engaged in discussions with the HSE regarding how the €50 million will be spent.  I require an explanation from the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, who has responsibility for the disability sector.  Is the Department of Health and Children using this issue as no more than an exercise in cash management?  Will the Government come forward and provide the funding?  The Minister of State's constituency colleague, the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, has repeatedly said that he has a personal commitment to people with disabilities.  Where is it?</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">In the instance I raised, concerning the Daughters of Charity at St. Vincent's in Lisnagry, three of the nine young adults left school last Friday.  They have no future and do not know where they stand and neither do their parents.  Furthermore, the other six young adults who will finish their rehabilitative training programme this month are in a similar situation.  The Government must put its money where its mouth is.  This is an appalling situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">I understand the HSE's national disability steering group was to meet today to discuss this issue.  I hope the Minister will be able to state the HSE will provide the funding.  I hope he is aware of what happened at the meeting because what is occurring is absolutely disgraceful and appalling.  I want to be able to tell the parents and young adults associated with the Daughters of Charity Service for Persons with Intellectual Disability, St. Vincent's, Lisnagry, that the Daughters of Charity can proceed with recruiting the staff.  I refer to two care workers, one nurse and one programme supervisor.  A capital allocation of €120,000 is required to enable certain of the buildings on the campus to be adapted in order to provide the adult services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">I have written to Seamus McNulty, the assistant national director who is responsible for disability services in the HSE.  I expect the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, will honour the commitment the Government made at budget time to provide the €50 million to one of the most vulnerable sectors of society.  We should not have to be here tonight.  The Daughters of Charity, along with many other service providers for the intellectually disabled, should be recruiting at present and should be able to tell the parents and young adults that they will be availing of proper adult day care services from 1 September.  I want to hear a positive response from the Minister of State.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Moloney</from>
          <p eId="para_1300">The funding will be in place for the children in question.  There has been a delay in explaining how soon it will come through.  Most of the concerns raised, quite properly, by the voluntary organisations were raised because they had not heard that the funding was in place.  The reality is that once we can commit ourselves to allocating the funding, the issue will be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">I am pleased to take this opportunity to address the important issues raised by Deputies Creed and O'Donnell.  As they will be aware, within the health and training sector, a range of training, health and personal social day services are provided by several State agencies, including the HSE, non-statutory agencies funded by the HSE and specialist training providers funded by and behalf of FÁS, to young people with disabilities when they leave school.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302">On the question of training, particularly the provision of life skills training, otherwise referred to as rehabilitative training, the HSE and HSE-funded agencies provide such training services for persons with disabilities to enhance their individual skill level.  The services focus on the enhancement of an individual's care, fundamental skills, life skills and social skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303">The outcome of rehabilitative training is not predetermined but is dependent on the level of the development capacity of each individual.  Consequently, it is important that training services be matched to a person's need.  In meeting such needs, the HSE employs guidance officers at local level to assist in the profiling of young school leavers with disabilities to appropriate training and day services.  The guidance officers work with school leavers, their families, school authorities and service providers to ensure that school leavers with disabilities have access to appropriate services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304">The co-ordination and planning of services to meet the needs of people with disabilities form a central tenet of the national disability strategy.  A critical element of such co-ordination and planning is the requirement to provide financial support for the development and implementation of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">On funding requirements for service development for HSE-funded services, the Government has set aside specific funds for service delivery for people with disabilities under the multi-annual investment programme.  Significant additional funding has already been provided and has been spent on developing new and enhanced health and personal social services for people with a disability, including young people leaving school in the period 2006 to 2007.  These areas will continue to be the focus of developments for the remaining years of the multi-annual investment programme, 2008 and 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">The Government provided the HSE with an additional €75 million in both 2006 and 2007.  This funding resulted in an additional 506 day places and 492 day places in 2006 and 2007, respectively.</p>

          <p eId="para_1320">Day services were enhanced through the provision of additional supports to deal with school leavers or other adults with significant disabilities.  The supports include 52 places in 2006 and 66 places in 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321">The increase in services in recent years has ensured that young people with intellectual disabilities and autism have appropriate services in place to ensure a smooth transition from secondary school.  This is what we are tying to achieve this evening.  In some cases, the funding provided supported school leavers to access appropriate day services in line with a person-centred plan.  In many cases, this funding provided places for individuals completing rehabilitative training, thereby creating training places for other school leavers.  The HSE and HSE-funded agencies also provide a range of other day services, designed to meet the needs of adults with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1322">The multi-annual investment programme for disability services makes provision for the development of additional day, residential and respite places each year between 2006 and 2009 for people with intellectual disability and autism.  The €50 million to which the Deputy keeps referring was provided to the HSE in budget 2008 for additional services to people with disabilities, including 467 additional day places for people with intellectual disabilities.  As the Deputies will be aware, the commencement of the planned developments in disability services this year was delayed due to a financial review in the HSE.  This did not just concern the disability sector but pertained to the whole spectrum of health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1323">I am more than pleased to inform the House that the HSE has assured me, following discussions all week, that it is now in a position to roll out the planned developments, as outlined in its 2008 service plan.  It is not a case of the Government alone taking credit as all Deputies are involved in their capacity as representatives of people with disabilities.  It was agreed that nobody would want to see the disability sector short-changed or funding reduced.</p>

          <p eId="para_1347">Within ten days, the HSE will be in a position to do this.  I understand the Deputies' specific questions regarding adult day training for students at St Gabriel's, Cork, and St. Vincent's, Lisnagry, are being considered by HSE in the context of its funding priorities for 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_1348">I also wish to inform the House of some developments in areas related to the issues raised by Deputies Creed and O'Donnell.  As for services for adults with a disability, the HSE is in the process of undertaking a comprehensive national review of HSE-funded adult day services.  This review will seek to advise on the reconfiguration and modernisation of existing adult day services to reflect the core principles of the health strategy, namely, access, quality, accountability and person centredness.  The review includes, as part of its work, examining and reviewing the range of day services such as activation, rehabilitative training and sheltered work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349">To date the strategic review of HSE-funded adult day services has consulted widely with service users, families and service providers and is about to engage in discussions with all parties to the sectoral plans, including the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social and Family Affairs.  A census of HSE-funded adult day services has been completed and the findings will help inform decision making in this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1350">As a further significant development in support of the national disability strategy, the Office for Disability and Mental Health was established by the Government in January this year.  The office brings together responsibility for different policy areas and a range of services which have an impact on the lives of people with a disability and people with mental health difficulties.  The main focus of the office is to improve co-ordination and communication across Departments and agencies in the delivery of disability and mental health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351">I have been appointed Minister of State with responsibility for equality, disability and mental health and my objective is to move the disability agenda to a level which compares with the best in the world.  We should do so in partnership with all stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352">I agree the difficulty may have been due to the delayed announcement.  However, I emphasise that people should be there to guarantee that whatever funding is allocated to the disability sector will remain intact.</p>

          <speech by="#ThomasByrne" eId="spk_665">
            <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne</from>
            <p eId="para_1354">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permitting this matter to be discussed on the Adjournment.  The existing health centre in Laytown, County Meath, was built for a former era, that is, before the area of Laytown, Bettystown and Mornington became the second largest town in County Meath, which it effectively now is after Navan.  The health centre also serves areas beyond that, including Grangerath, where I live, Donacarney, Stamullen and Julianstown.  It serves a wide population in east County Meath.</p>
            <p eId="para_1355">The staff at the health centre provide a good service to the community.  While they do the best they can, given the population they do so in small and cramped conditions.  I acknowledge that senior local HSE officials in the HSE north-east area have confirmed to me that east Meath is a priority for them.  The services provided at the health centre include two doctors, a practice nurse a number of public health nurses, dentistry services for children — although there are delays in this regard — a community welfare officer and certain speech therapy facilities.  However, other services should be provided there, including social work, child protection, disability services, services for older people, ophthalmic services, audiology services, physiotherapy services and some psychiatric services.  Such services are not being provided and in many cases my constituents are obliged to travel to Dunshaughlin, Slane or Navan to obtain them.  This is highly inconvenient for many of them, especially older people and young families with children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1356">Last January, the HSE informed me there was a serious proposal to acquire another property to be used as the health centre for east County Meath.  While I was pleased with this news, I made a commitment to the HSE to keep quiet about it as best I could because discussions regarding the premises were at an advanced stage but had not been completed.  Consequently, I was content to allow the HSE to complete the deal.  However, I recently have been approached by the property's owners, to whom I had never spoken previously, who informed me the HSE had told them there was no money available for this project.  Other rumours are flying about in the area to the effect the HSE is in conversations with other landowners and developers with a view to providing an improved health centre in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1357">While I welcome the commitment of the local HSE officials in their search for a premises, I hope it is not the case that the HSE does not have the money to provide an improved, enlarged and much needed centre in a area of massively growing population.  I hope the financial commitment is present at a national level as well as the local commitment.  I would be grateful were the Minister of State to inform me this matter is a priority for health services in growing areas.  Two doctors work at Laytown health centre and two others also operate in the community, serving a population of more than 10,000.  They are under pressure and despite the property downturn, people continue to move into the area.  I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children for coming to the House to respond to this issue and I look forward to his response.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnMoloney" eId="spk_666" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy John Moloney</from>
            <p eId="para_1358">I will take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I thank Deputy Thomas Byrne for raising this issue as it provides me with an opportunity to reaffirm the Government's commitment to developing community-based services at local level.  The Government strategy of 2001, Primary Care: A New Direction, is the roadmap for the development of primary care services in Ireland over a period of ten to 15 years.  The development of such services is an essential component of the health service reform process.  It has been estimated that in a developed primary care system, 90% to 95% of people's day-to-day health and social care needs can be met in the primary care setting.  The key objective in primary care policy is to develop services in the community that will give people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams.</p>
            <p eId="para_1359">Under the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement, the Government has committed itself to the establishment of 300 primary care teams by 2008, 400 by 2009 and 500 by 2011.  In line with the agreement, a review of these targets is under way at present.  The provision of these services, including the furthering of health centres and primary care teams at local level, is an operational matter for the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1360">I understand from the HSE there is a health centre located at Alverno Heights, Laytown, at present. While this centre was extended several years ago, given the rapid growth in population in east County Meath, difficulties are being experienced regarding its existing capacity.  At present, the centre provides a range of services, including general practitioner services, public health nursing services and community welfare officer services.  Consultation rooms also are available for visiting allied health professionals such as speech and language therapists and the area medical officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1361">In keeping with the primary care strategy, the HSE is developing proposals at present for a primary care team in Laytown.  This development will necessitate the renting or leasing of additional accommodation in the short term.  Suitable accommodation for this purpose is being identified in the Laytown-east County Meath area.  The medium-term plan for the Laytown area is to source new accommodation via a public private partnership process.  While a national advertisement seeking expressions of interest from developers was placed in late 2007, unfortunately no submissions for the Laytown area were received.  It is intended that the advertisement process will be repeated later in the year as east County Meath remains a priority for a public private partnership development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1362">Since 2002, the Government has provided significant new funding to enable the primary care strategy to be rolled out.  In addition to the additional resources being put in place, membership of primary care teams is drawn from existing professional and other staff working in primary, community and continuing care services.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has emphasised to the HSE the importance she attaches to the continued development and roll-out of primary care teams.  I am satisfied that services for the Laytown area will be significantly enhanced with the development of a primary care team for the area.  I again thank Deputy Byrne for raising the issue and I hope he is satisfied with the response.</p>

          <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_667">
            <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_1363">I am pleased to have the opportunity of raising this issue again.  It concerns a new school for Gaelscoil Bharra in Cabra, an issue I have been raising virtually every year I have been a Member of the Dáil.  Gaelscoil Bharra is located just off Fassaugh Avenue and has been in prefabricated buildings since it was founded 13 years ago.  I am blue in the face raising the issue with the Minister and trying to determine when some movement will take place on the part of the Department of Education and Science to replace the prefabricated buildings with a new school, which the children and the parents have been requesting all those years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1364">Recent figures indicated that 40,000 pupils are educated in prefabricated buildings but those prefabs would be extensions to the original school building.  In this case the entire school building is prefabricated.  This has been the case for the past 13 years and it is not good enough.  During the winter time the buildings are cold, damp and unsuitable for children.  During the summer time they are too hot, and when it rains there are pools of water everywhere, including in the yard, and toilets block up.  It is a nightmare for everybody concerned — the staff, the pupils and their parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1365">I raise this issue more than once a year and receive a variation of the same answer, namely, that the Department of Education and Science is doing its best and that it is on the lookout for a site for a permanent school but, strangely, 13 years later those people from the Department who have been out searching for a site still have not discovered one.  I hope this might be the night the Minister of State will give me the good news that new eagle-eyed civil servants in the Department of Education and Science have at last discovered a suitable site.</p>
            <p eId="para_1366">Meanwhile, parents are concerned about their children's health and the conditions under which they are educated.  The children themselves suffer physically and educationally from the lack of good quality services.  Also, the parents and the staff are constantly fundraising to try to plug some of the gaps in maintaining the unsuitable buildings that are now well past their sell-by date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1367">We are at the end of the construction boom and as we move into something of a recession and there is no longer an emphasis on the construction of residential dwellings, there may be scope for moving the construction industry into providing much needed infrastructure of this nature.  I am sure many developers would be delighted to get contracts to build schools.  Those contracts would not be that much different from the type of contracts they would get for housing estates.  This might be an opportunity for the Government to retain its spending power to do whatever borrowing is necessary.  It is the way to go.  There is the opportunity to do that and to try to keep the construction industry moving.  If that is the decision of the Government, it will be able to address the problem of the large number of prefabs and the need to have permanent school structures constructed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1368">I have come into this House too often asking that something suitable in the line of an educational facility be provided for children who should be cherished by the nation, as we all know.  That is not the case with these particular children.  The Minister of State might have some good information for me tonight.</p>

            <p eId="para_1369">I wish I could impart some good information on my first Adjournment Debate in response to Deputy Costello.</p>
            <p eId="para_1370">I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the current position regarding the future plans for Gaelscoil Bharra, Cabra.</p>
            <p eId="para_1371">Modernising facilities in our existing building projects as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, is a significant challenge and something I understand will be one of the priorities of the Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1372">The Government has already dramatically increased investment in the schools building programme to almost €600 million this year.  Under the lifetime of the national development plan, almost €4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  That is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1373">It will underpin a particular emphasis on the delivery of additional school places in rapidly developing areas while continuing to develop the Government's commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary accommodation throughout the country.  It will also enable the purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the schools building programme, again with the focus being on site requirements in rapidly developing areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1374">On the specific matter raised by Deputy Costello, the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of the Department of Education and Science in regard to site acquisitions generally, had been requested to source a greenfield site for this Gaelscoil.  On foot of advertising, no proposals were received for a greenfield site in the Cabra area.  Further to that, the OPW was requested by the Department to look into building a permanent school on the existing temporary site.</p>
            <p eId="para_1375">The further progression of the acquisition of this site will be considered in the context of the capital budget available to the Department for school buildings generally.  The Department is not in a position to say at this stage when the acquisition will be concluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_1376">I thank the Deputy and wish I could have been a font of knowledge but, unfortunately, I cannot be one.  I am glad to have the opportunity to outline the current position to the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_1380">The Farm Improvement Scheme was introduced by my Department in July 2007 with funding of €79 million as agreed under the 2006 Partnership agreement, Towards 2016, and was suspended on 31 October 2007 as applications had reached this level of funding.   Indeed, the terms and conditions of the Scheme specifically provided for its termination when this financial ceiling was reached.  12,675 applications were received from farmers prior to the closing date of the Scheme and these applications are currently being processed within my Department up to the level of funding made available for the Scheme.  I have no plans at present to reopen the Scheme to new applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1381">The revised Farm Waste Management Scheme which was introduced by my Department in March 2006, rather than the Farm Improvement Scheme, was the principal measure designed to assist farmers meet their obligations under the Nitrates Directive and a standard grant-rate of 60% (70% in the four Zone C counties) is available to farmers who complete investment works under that Scheme.  48,580 applications were received from farmers under the Farm Waste Management Scheme and, to date, 41,750 approvals have issued to farmers to commence work under the Scheme.  The remaining applications have either been withdrawn, are awaiting the receipt of full planning permission or are explained by the receipt of multiple applications from a single farmer.  To date this year, over €110 million has been paid out in grants to farmers under the Farm Waste Management Scheme compared to €21 million in 2006 and €114 million during the 2007 calendar year.  Under the terms of the Scheme, all investment works must be completed by farmers and supporting documentation submitted to my Department by 31 December 2008 and I urge farmers to ensure that this deadline is respected so that they can avail of the generous grants available.</p>

The National Strategic Plan sets down a programme of support for fisheries in line with the Seafood Sector Review Group report, Steering a New Course — strategy for a restructured, sustainable and profitable Irish seafood industry 2007-13 (the Cawley report), which was launched by the Taoiseach on 28 January 2007.

            <p eId="para_1386">As part of the normal consultative process for approval, the Commission adopts a negotiating position where it sets out in their observations and recommendations with regard to improving the OP. This negotiating position was received on the 22nd of April 2008, officials from my Department met the Commission (DG Mare, DG Regio and DG Environment) on 24 April as part of the formal process in the consideration of Ireland's O.P.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">The issues raised by the Commission were mainly procedural and/or editorial in nature.  The Commission expressed disappointment at the exclusion of measures under the Axis 4 pillar of the European Fisheries Fund "sustainable development of fisheries areas".  At a meeting between the Commission and officials of my Department on the 24 April, the Commission acknowledged Ireland's commitment to implement these measures under national state aided measures as outlined in the National Strategic Plan for Fisheries 2007-2013.  However, the Commission continued to press for it's inclusion under the operational programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">The Commission also expressed concerns in relation to Ireland's implementation of certain EU Directives on the Environment in the context of providing EU funding under the OP for aquaculture development.  The Directives identified are the Birds Directive, the Habitats Directive, the Shellfish Waters Directive and the Dangerous Substances Directive.  The linkage made by DG Environment between the implementation of these Directives and support for the development of aquaculture in Ireland is, in our view, disproportionate as the issues arising in respect of the Directives are significant, complex and challenging.  I do not consider that the Fisheries Operational Programme is an appropriate vehicle for addressing the issues related to the implementation of these Directives in Ireland.  Nevertheless, my officials are working closely with their colleagues in the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government to address issues related to these Directives in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">My priority at this time is to secure the agreement of the EU Commission for the Fisheries Operational Programme and in that context, I am currently reviewing the options available, including taking aquaculture development out of the Operational Programme and supporting the industry as national measures.  This option would not negatively impact on the development of the aquaculture sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1391">The Commission proposals in the milk sector cover the full range of market management measures currently in place.  While milk quota expansion is at the forefront of these proposals, considerable changes to other market management measures are also proposed.  These include the abolition of private storage aid for cheese and the disposal aid for butter used in the manufacture of pastry and ice cream and for direct consumption.  The Commission has also proposed making optional rather than obligatory as at present, the private storage aid for butter, casein aid and the skimmed milk powder feeding stuff scheme.  In addition, the Commission has proposed to change the current intervention schemes, which guarantee the purchase of up to 30,000 tonnes of butter and 109,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder when intervention is open in Member States, to a tender only scheme.  On quotas, the Commission has proposed to increase national quotas by 1% per annum from 2009/10 to 2013/14 and to allow quotas to expire in 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_1392">My approach in these negotiations will be to ensure a ‘soft landing' towards the eventual abolition of quotas in 2015.  The Health Check provides Irish and EU dairy farmers with a new opportunity to respond to increased global demand.  However, the proposals currently on the table, in my view, do not meet the expectations of Irish milk producers in meeting the demands of international dairy markets.  A gradual increase in quotas is the most sensible and logical way to achieve this but we will need to be more ambitious in the annual adjustments of quota volumes.  I will be asking the Commission to bring forward more ambitious quota expansion proposals in these negotiations and moreover, I want to keep the existing market management measures in place to cater for any price volatility that may occur during the transition period.</p>

            <p eId="para_1413">Climate change has potentially serious implications not just for agriculture but for all sectors of the economy.  The Irish agricultural pasture-based production system has many advantages in terms of sustainability and in a decoupled environment, efficiency of production is pursued which means that carbon emissions per unit of production are kept as low as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1414">In the context of carbon proofing, the agriculture sector will continue to effect production efficiencies in order that the emissions per unit of food produced are as low as possible.  In this regard it can be expected that in 2008 the continued implementation of the Nitrates Regulations will result in better utilization of nutrients, with a consequent reduction in nitrogen applications.  Other measures which will contribute to greenhouse gas abatement, such as the encouragement of minimum tillage, the use of clover swards and the adoption of low emission trailing shoe technology for slurry spreading have been introduced under the new Rural Environment Protection Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1415">Carbon sequestration by Ireland's forests is a significant element in the National Climate Change Strategy and will play a very important role in meeting our Kyoto targets.  Both forest products and energy crops also contribute to the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by acting as substitutes for fossil fuels and my Department continues to support participation in the EU Energy Crops Scheme and the Bioenergy Scheme in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1416">I realise that further initiatives will be needed to address the challenge of climate change, which is why my Department has committed substantial funding, under the Research Stimulus Fund, to various research projects devoted to identifying sustainable greenhouse gas reduction measures.

It should be noted that responsibility for setting the standards whereby fishermen can retrain for the Merchant Navy rests solely with the Marine Survey Office (MSO) of the Department of Transport (DoT).</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">BIM have been working closely with the MSO in this regard and most recently, have been asked to submit a proposal to them in relation to transfer and progression from fishing Certificates of Competency to merchant marine Certificates of Competency. This proposal is under active consideration at the moment. There are a number of technical issues to be resolved in this process and BIM continues to be engaged with the MSO in this regard and I am pushing for early delivery of these measures. I would also be supportive of incentives for such training to be made available and I have asked BIM to pursue options in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">In addition, all fishermen are eligible to undertake BIM training programmes including those serving on vessels that are decommissioning. In this regard, BIM and FÁS have agreed to co-operate to provide training for fishing vessel crewmembers that find themselves without a job when their fishing vessel is decommissioned. Both agencies will work closely together to provide retraining, up-skilling or diversification opportunities in the seafood industry or elsewhere in the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447">Diversification into other marine related areas such as aquaculture or seafood processing or training to become Department of Transport (DoT) certificated skippers, mates and engineers, or undertake Global Maritime Distress and Safety System radio and other skills training will be available to crew through BIM.  For those who wish to retrain to enter the marine tourism sector or handle workboats authorised to carry passengers (e.g. on fish farms), BIM can provide training to enable them gain the DoT Passenger Boat Proficiency Certificate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">The training funding provided by Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) is for the delivery of further education and statutory training courses to the seafood industry.   Funds are not allocated to cover fees for courses in Higher Education or Third Level institutions.   There are several grant schemes available in this regard via the Department of Education and Science and further information is available from that Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">Notwithstanding, the career options made available to individual fishermen, it is ultimately a personal decision as to what route they wish to take in their future working lives. Every encouragement will be afforded to them from the appropriate resources of my Department and those of BIM to facilitate where possible career changes for fishermen on decommissioned vessels.</p>

            <p eId="para_1451">The EU Commission reviewed the whole area of food labelling and in that context my Department contributed to Ireland's submission which was coordinated by the Department of Health &amp; Children.  The Commission subsequently brought forward a proposal for a regulation on the provision of food information to consumers.  This draft regulation will be examined by Council of Health Ministers and the European Parliament under the co-decision procedure.  The FSAI proposes to initiate public consultation on this proposal from July to October this year.</p>

This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.   However, it indicated that it will reconsider the draft measures once we have submitted additional explanatory information.  This information is currently being prepared for transmission to the Commission.</p>

            <p eId="para_1472">Early indications show that planting figures for 2008 should well exceed the 5,000 hectares referred to by the Deputy. It is worth emphasising that my Department has committed a total of €126 million in the current year to further the national afforestation programme.  The current suite of Afforestation Grant and Premium Schemes, along with the various support measures, is the most financially attractive package ever made available in the history of forestry in Ireland.  The establishment grant covers 100% of the planting costs, while the annual forestry premium is payable to farmers for 20 years. Both the grant and premium rates have been reviewed in recent times and increased in order to make the scheme more attractive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1473">Under the Forest Environment Protection Scheme (FEPS), landowners can receive a premium of up to €200 per hectare, over and above their forestry premium, should they choose to participate in the scheme, which promotes the establishment of high nature value forestry. This scheme was launched as a pilot in 2007, and after some refinements, including reducing the planting level threshold from 8 hectares to 5 hectares, has been adopted into the suite of afforestation schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1474">My Department is also undertaking significant promotional activities to encourage further participation in forestry. Radio advertisements aired earlier this year, highlighting the benefits of planting forests, are supplemented by promotion and publicity in other media throughout the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">Earlier this year Mr. John Malone completed a review of the factors affecting the rate of afforestation in Ireland. His report outlined a number of recommendations, aimed at furthering the afforestation program, which are currently under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">With the very attractive financial package available and the promotional efforts supporting the planting programme, I believe that an increase in the afforestation rate can be achieved.</p>

            <p eId="para_1479">I am particularly concerned that the use of ‘hazard-based cut-off criteria', as a basis for the approval of substances, ignores the scientific principle of risk assessment.  Of course it is important that the use of substances in plant protection products should be appropriately controlled.  Some substances, which may fail to meet the cut-off criteria, are crucial to crop protection in Ireland.  Their withdrawal may cause significant agronomic and economic damage without securing any significant reduction in human or environmental exposures to these types of substances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1480">I am also concerned about the absence of a detailed, up-to-date impact assessment on the effects of the current text on the competitiveness and sustainability of Irish and European agriculture.

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_1525">I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 115 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1526">The WTO Director General announced on Friday last that he will propose that a WTO Ministerial meeting take place in Geneva in the week commencing 21 July.  The purpose of this meeting is to finalise the modalities or detailed texts of agreements on agriculture and non-agricultural market access (NAMA).  It is envisaged that a Signalling Conference on Trade in Services will take place at the same time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1527">In preparation for the conference, it is expected that there will be further engagement on agriculture and NAMA for the remainder of this week with revised texts due towards the end of next week.  This will be followed by meetings at official level in the run up to the Ministerial Conference.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">If agreement is reached on Agriculture and NAMA modalities at this time, the expectation is that, in the period needed to produce detailed WTO schedules, the other areas of negotiation would be concluded so that the final overall agreement would be in place by the end of 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1529">It is by no means clear that this objective will be achieved.  In addition to the large number of complex issues across the broad spectrum of negotiating areas which are unresolved, the uncertainty in the US political situation could play a crucial role in whether this proposed timetable for reaching a final agreement is achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1530">I am very concerned about some of the proposals being made in the agriculture negotiations and with the lack of balance in the overall process to date.  It is not acceptable that the current negotiations are focused on agriculture while other negotiating areas are not making progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_1531">The Irish Government has and will continue to take every opportunity to express our concerns in the strongest terms in the various EU and WTO meetings dealing with these negotiations.  I recently met my French counterpart in Dublin, and the current state of play and imbalance in these WTO negotiations were high on the agenda of this meeting.  I can report that France and Ireland share the same concerns on the direction of these negotiations and will continue to insist that the Commission does not accept a deal which undermines EU agricultural production.  I have also had bilateral meetings with my colleagues from Spain and Poland and they too share our concerns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">The Commission, including Commissioner Mandelson and his officials, are well aware of Ireland's views on the matter.  These views have been articulated clearly and consistently at all available forums over the last several years, including bilateral meetings, meetings of the Article 133 Committee, the Agriculture Council and the General Affairs Council and in bilateral meetings with the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1533">At last week's Agriculture Council of Ministers meeting, I re-emphasised to the Agriculture Commissioner, Mrs. Fischer Boel and to the Council as a whole, Ireland's concerns.  I referred in particular to the changes that had taken place since WTO negotiations commenced in 2001 and I insisted that the new challenges of climate change and food security must be taken on board in any deal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1534">In the margins of the Council, a group of 20 EU countries reaffirmed their deep concerns about the WTO negotiations.  I will continue to ensure that Ireland plays a leading role in this Group of like-minded Member States.  I will continue to work closely with like-minded Ministers in other Member States to seek support for my position.</p>
            <p eId="para_1535">At official level, my Department, and other Departments involved, have and will continue to work assiduously in the various technical meetings to ensure Ireland's interests are best protected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1536">In summary, I will continue to pursue an outcome which does not undermine the 2003 reforms of the CAP and ensures that Irish and EU agriculture can compete on world markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">As regards specific submissions received by my Department, I can confirm that submissions have been received from a number of stakeholders over the period of the negotiations.  These submissions form the basis for a large element of the work of the WTO Consultative Committee, which was established for the express purpose of consultation and advice on the negotiating round.  I can also confirm that, where appropriate, we have made oral and written submissions to the Commission on a range of issues related to the WTO.</p>

            <p eId="para_1539">I am aware and very concerned with the increase in fatal farm accidents between 1993 and 2007 involving farmers over 60 years of age.  I fully support the work of the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), the statutory body established under the 1989 Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, which works in partnership with the agriculture and forestry sectors to improve health and safety in farm and forestry workplaces.</p>
            <p eId="para_1540">While there is a general downward trend in the rate of fatal farm accidents in recent years, there is an alarming increase in the number of fatal accidents to farmers over 60 years of age. The majority of these accidents were associated with tractors/machinery, livestock and falls.  The Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee, of which my Department is a member, are planning to target the promotion of safety for older farmers as part of their new Farm Safety Action Plan for 2008-2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_1586">I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 107 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1587">Since 1959 Ireland has applied its criminal law in relation to fisheries matters and, since our membership of the European Community, Ireland has applied the criminal law in the enforcement of fisheries policy.  Successive Governments have applied the criminal law.  We do this to protect fish stocks and to seek to avoid financial penalties being imposed on the State and the Irish taxpayer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1588">The possibility of introducing administrative sanctions was comprehensively considered, including an examination of practices in other Member States, at the time of the passage of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill through the Oireachtas.  The position taken by the Minister at the time was based on the legal advice from the Attorney General.</p>
            <p eId="para_1589">In response to recent representations on this matter from the Federation of Irish Fishermen I have asked the Attorney General to examine this issue and consider if there have been any new developments which might support the introduction of a regime of administrative sanctions for fisheries offences in Ireland, at least for minor offences.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_1591">In relation to quota allocations, the position is that Ireland's shares of the main fish stocks were set in the early 1980's when fish stocks were being shared out between EU Member States. The share allocations were based on catch records and reflected the fishing levels of the Irish fleet and other Member states' fleets at that time.  The percentage shares held by each Member State have generally remained the same for over 20 years under the principle of relative stability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1592">It has been a priority of successive Irish fisheries Ministers to try to have these shares improved.  The Common Fisheries Policy was reviewed in 1992 and again in 2002 and in both cases substantial efforts were made to push Ireland's case for increased shares of important stocks but without success.  Ireland received no support from other Member States for changes in the allocation keys for the share out of stocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1593">The practical reality is that to achieve an increase in Ireland's share of catches, other Member States would have to take a cut in their shares.  This is all the more difficult to achieve when the total allowable catches (TACs) of all the main commercial species are falling and the reality is that achieving support for such an outcome at the December Agriculture and Fisheries Council, where quotas are fixed for the following year, is not deliverable.  At this point the European Commission and other Member States largely take the view that the quota shares are fixed and not subject to ad-hoc changes pending any more fundamental review of the Common Fisheries Policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1594">The next overall review of the basic framework of the Common Fisheries Policy is not scheduled until 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1595">The CFP reform package, agreed in December 2002, included key national priorities such as:</p>
            <p eId="para_1596">the continued recognition of the Hague quota preferences, which are very important to Ireland as they give Ireland a higher share of certain important fish stocks than was agreed in the 1980's;</p>
            <p eId="para_1597">an action plan to address the problem of juvenile fish catches;</p>
            <p eId="para_1598">stronger control and enforcement; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1599">the establishment of Regional Advisory Councils giving fishermen a strong voice in shaping future fisheries policy at EU level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1600">Following protracted negotiations at the December 2007 Agriculture and Fisheries Council, a total package of 182,699 tonnes of fish was secured for the Irish Fishing Industry for 2008.  This was a significant success given that the initial proposal by the European Commission involved cuts of up to 25% for 25 of the 37 stocks of importance to Ireland.  The crucial Hague quota preferences were also successfully defended after a number of Member States attempted to have them set aside.  It appears that this system is likely to be challenged again this year and in that regard I want to assure the House that I will strongly resist any proposals to reduce or abolish our entitlements under these measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1601">The Cawley Report "Steering A New Course — Strategy for a Restructured, Sustainable and Profitable Irish Seafood Industry 2007-2013" sets out a clear strategy to maximise the value of quotas focused on increasing the value of seafood at every stage from the net to the fork.  I am satisfied that the effective implementation of this Strategy, which the Government has endorsed, will deliver a sustainable, profitable and self-reliant industry that will maximise its long term contribution to coastal communities.  I am fully committed to working efficiently and effectively with the industry to deliver this strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1603">The issue of high levels of discards in commercial sea fisheries is a global problem and is on the agenda of all major international organisations who deal with the development of sustainable sea fisheries and protection of marine ecosystems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1604">Discarding is usually a feature of mixed fisheries where one species may be the target of fishing activity, but other species may be caught accidentally in the fishing gear.  It can also occur for economic reasons, i.e., when smaller, less valuable fish are dumped in favour of larger, more marketable ones (a practice known as high-grading).</p>
            <p eId="para_1605">The discarding issue is already being addressed at a European level through measures regulating fishing gear, such as adjusting net mesh sizes or requiring acoustic devices to be attached to fishing gear.  A new discard policy which aims to stop the practice of discarding is under preparation and a consultation process is currently underway with all the stakeholders.   An effective resolution of the discards issue will likely require a combination of new policy and technical measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1606">At my meeting on the 18th of June with Commissioner Borg I raised this issue as a priority for me, and for the Federation of Irish Fishermen.  While he advised that finding effective solutions is challenging, he restated his commitment to continue to prioritise the current work programme agreed by the Council in June 2007.  I will continue to press for progress on this issue at national, EU and international levels and I am confident that, with the co-operation, collaboration and commitment of all the stakeholders, significant improvements can be achieved in this most sensitive area for the long term sustainability of our industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_1614">The Agriculture and Fisheries Council took place on 23/24 June.  I represented Ireland together with my colleague Tony Killeen, Minister of State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1615">The Council reached political agreement on the following proposals for Council Regulations:</p>
            <p eId="para_1616">Establishment of a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing;</p>
            <p eId="para_1617">Fishing authorisations for Community vessels in third country waters and third country vessels in Community waters; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1618">The protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas from the adverse impacts of bottom fishing gears.</p>
            <p eId="para_1619">The Council also reached a common position under the co-decision procedure on a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market.  I abstained in the vote on this proposal because of my concerns that the use of "hazard-based cut-off criteria" as a basis for the approval of substances ignored the scientific principles of risk assessment.  Some of the substances which fail to meet the criteria are crucial to crop protection in Ireland and their withdrawal may cause agronomic and economic damage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1620">Aside from the agreements reached, the Council also had discussions covering a variety of agriculture and fisheries issues.  These included a policy debate on the CAP Health check, focused on the issues of further decoupling and the possibility of specific support in vulnerable regions and sector.  Commissioner Fischer Boel provided Ministers with an update on developments in the WTO negotiations.  In addition, Member States raised issues concerning safeguard measures in the bovine sector arising from Bluetongue, the recent evolution of costs and prices in respect of animal products, the adaptation of the BSE surveillance system, the safety and compliance with Community rules of food, feed, animal and plant imports and the co-ordination of veterinary and border controls.</p>
            <p eId="para_1621">As to fisheries, there was a wide-ranging debate on the impact of increased fuel prices on the fisheries sector.  Also on the agenda was Ireland's request to the Commission, submitted jointly with France and the UK, for an increase in the 2008 TAC (Total Allowable Catch) for cod in the Celtic Sea.  The Commission also presented its annual Policy Statement for Fishing Opportunities, which outlines its approach to setting TACs for quota species for 2009, and there was a discussion on the adoption of the updated EU-Islamic Republic of Mauritania Fisheries Partnership Agreement.</p>

In this regard it works closely with the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive in relation to the public health aspects of and the potential implications for human health posed by these diseases, as for example in relation to avian ‘flu which crosses both disciplines.</p>
            <p eId="para_1628">I am acutely conscious of the threats of various animal disease outbreaks and my Department continually reassesses such threats and the dangers posed to Ireland.  On the basis of such risk assessments, I and my officials on an ongoing basis review the adequacy of our control measures aimed at mitigating the risk of the introduction of such diseases to this country.  As part of this review process, my Department has offered and continues to offer biosecurity advice to farmers in relation to diseases such as foot-and-mouth, avian ‘flu and bluetongue.  This advice is updated as appropriate and made available in leaflet form, through the national newspapers or on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1629">My Department within its own internal competency and facilities operates a wide range of surveillance, monitoring, controls, systems and processes which regulate, monitor and manage the risks posed by diseases and pests.  These competencies and skills encompass professional, veterinary, scientific, bacteriological, microbiological, virological, epidemiological, administrative and legal expertise, all of which contribute, as appropriate, to the process.  My Department's state of the art veterinary and agriculture laboratories at Backweston also continue to develop as centres of excellence increasing their range of diagnostic services to underpin any challenges posed to animal, plant health or food safety.  All of these professions and disciplines are constantly upskilling and re-training.</p>
            <p eId="para_1630">In addition to its range of internal resources, my Department can rely on extensive external expertise, and assistance from State agencies, as well as organisations such as Birdwatch Ireland and academic expertise, such as for example, that provided by the Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis in UCD (CVERA) and the Department of Zoology at NUI, Galway in dealing with diseases or threats of diseases.</p>

            <p eId="para_1633">My Department, in the context of delivering the Direct Payment Schemes worth up to €1.9bn annually, is required to carry out on-the-spot inspections on a number of farms covering land eligibility, and cross-compliance.  A minimum of 5% of applicants are inspected annually under the eligibility rule.  Up to two-thirds of these inspections are carried out without a farm visit and using the technique of remote sensing. Cross-compliance involves two key elements:</p>
            <p eId="para_1634">A requirement for farmers to comply with 18 Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) set down in EU legislation on the environment, food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health; and</p>

            <p eId="para_1636">The rate of on-farm inspection required for cross-compliance is 1% of those farmers to whom the Statutory Management Requirements  or GAEC apply.  However at least 5% of producers must be inspected under the Bovine Animal Identification and Registration requirements while 3% must be inspected under the rules governing sheep and goat identification.</p>
            <p eId="para_1637">A Commission report on the application of cross-compliance was presented to the April 2007 Agriculture Council and Council conclusions were adopted in June 2007.  The following issues were covered in the conclusions:</p>
            <p eId="para_1638">Tolerance for minor non-compliance</p>

            <p eId="para_1644">Phasing in of cross-compliance for new Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1645">Council and Commission Regulations are now in place implementing the new arrangements with effect from 1 January 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1646">Under the new regime, while all inspections should generally be unannounced, a Member State  can give up to 14 days notice for land eligibility inspections and for cross-compliance inspections involving SMRs other than those related to animal identification and registration, food, feed, and animal welfare. For checks involving animal identification and registration, the maximum advance notice is 48 hours provided that the purpose of the inspection is not jeopardised.  For SMRs dealing with feed, food and animal welfare no advance notice may be given.</p>
            <p eId="para_1647">My Department is required to ensure that the control environment established under cross-compliance is robust and meets with regulatory and audit requirements.  Nevertheless, my Department believed that the cross-compliance provisions were overly complex for farmers and has sought and gained appropriate simplification in the context of the review of cross-compliance conducted by the Commission and the Regulations introduced as a result.</p>
            <p eId="para_1648">It is intended however, that further simplification of the cross-compliance arrangements will be pursued in the context of the CAP Health Check.</p>

            <p eId="para_1650">At the Council of Fisheries meeting in Luxembourg last week EU Fisheries Commissioner Borg, undertook to come back to the next Council meeting on the 15th July with definitive proposals to address the issues facing fishermen.</p>
            <p eId="para_1651">However, I will continue to use every avenue open to me, as will Minister Killeen to convey in the strongest possible terms the depth of feeling of Irish fishermen on the situation facing them at present.  We will continue to press for a package of EU-funded measures to address the current difficulties experienced by fishermen across Europe, particularly in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1652">I was heartened by the support I received from my fellow Ministers at Council and am also pleased with the progress made in a number of areas of concern to Irish fishermen.  I believe the meeting was positive as regards the restructuring of the industry and action to combat illegal fishing.  I welcome the agreement reached at Council on a new regulation to combat landings of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fish from within and outside the EU.</p>

            <p eId="para_1657">The Commission Health Check proposals in the milk sector cover the full range of market management measures currently in place, and milk quota expansion is at the forefront of these.  The Commission has proposed to increase national quotas by 1% per annum from 2009/10 to 2013/14 and to allow quotas to expire in 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_1658">My approach in these negotiations will be to ensure a ‘soft landing' towards the eventual abolition of quotas in 2015.  The Health Check provides Irish and EU dairy farmers with a new opportunity to respond to increased global demand.  However, the proposals currently on the table, in my view, do not correspond with the expectations of Irish milk producers in meeting the demands of international dairy markets.  A gradual increase in quotas is the most sensible and logical way to achieve this but we will need to be more ambitious in the annual adjustments of quota volumes.  I will be asking the Commission to bring forward more ambitious quota expansion proposals in these negotiations and I also want to keep the existing market management measures in place to cater for any price volatility that may occur during the transition period.</p>

            <p eId="para_1660">I support the principle of maximum price transparency at all levels.  In Ireland, producer prices at export meat plants are published weekly by An Bord Bia. This includes a comparison with EU lamb markets.</p>

This will provide an objective assessment of quality and enhance price transparency.  My Department has facilitated trials on mechanical grading and the results are currently being considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_1811">The Commission presented its legislative proposals on the Health Check to the Informal Agriculture Council in Slovenia on 27 May.  The proposals are currently being examined in Council Working Groups and the Special Committee on Agriculture.  The impact of the whole package of measures on Irish agriculture will clearly depend on what is agreed at the end of the negotiations.  The aim is to reach agreement at the November meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1812">The CAP Health Check does not seek to fundamentally alter the principles of the CAP which include the concepts of adequacy and continuity of supply within the EU.  Rather the stated purpose of the Commission is to ensure that the CAP is best placed to meet upcoming challenges including climate change, bio-energy, water management, bio-diversity and food security.</p>
            <p eId="para_1813">My aim in the negotiations will be to achieve the best possible outcome for Ireland and for agriculture. I have already outlined the issues of concern to Ireland to Commissioner Fischer Boel, to Commission officials, and to colleagues in other Member States. I will continue to take an active role in the discussions at every opportunity and to reiterate our priorities. These include: Ensuring that further simplification of the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and cross-compliance is delivered; In preparation for expiry of milk quotas in 2015, seeking ambitious annual quota increases and clear, predictable decisions taken at this stage to give policy certainty to producers and the industry; Maintaining effective market management measures to cater for any market volatility that may occur; Opposing the proposed increase in compulsory modulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1814">I will also be seeking a degree of subsidiarity in a number of areas but specifically in relation to the management of the Single Payment Scheme, to adjust policy to national circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_1828">Teagasc, the Agriculture and Food Development Authority, has responsibility for the provision of education and training services to the agri-food sector. It actively promotes careers in farming as being very rewarding and fulfilling with the opportunity to develop a lifestyle which competes favourably with other professions, particularly with regard to quality of life and job satisfaction.  Teagasc courses in agriculture, horticulture, forestry and horses are continually reviewed and updated to meet changing needs in terms of knowledge, skills and competence for today's farmers.  Education for farming can be availed of through one of the eight agricultural/horticultural colleges, a local Teagasc training centre or on line through the Teagasc eCollege.  Teagasc courses are accredited by FETAC or HETAC with the advantage that participants can progress through the qualifications ladder to degree level and beyond.

            <p eId="para_1840">The worldwide increase in the price of cereals over the last 18 months, partly due to adverse weather conditions, has caused the price of compound animal feeds to increase by about 30%. However, the acreage directed to cereal cultivation has increased significantly in 2008, helped by increased market demand and the suspension of the obligation to set 10% of arable land aside. I am hopeful that these factors, coupled with  the elimination of import duties for cereals, will help to ease the pressures on feed costs. In addition an aid for private storage scheme and an increase in export refunds were also introduced to specifically address the issue of feed prices for the pigmeat sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1842">I am very concerned with the level of farm safety on our farms. Last year 11 people died on Irish farms, while this was a decline of almost 40% on 2006, it is still unacceptably high. This year to-date 10 people have died on Irish farms. I strongly support the work of the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), which is the national body in Ireland with responsibility for securing health and safety at work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1843">In 2007, almost 17% of all fatal workplace accidents occurred on farms and the corresponding average figure for the years 2002-2007 is just over 25%. While the general downward trend in the rate of fatal farm accidents involving children and adults under 60 years of age is welcomed, the increase in fatal farm accidents among farmers over 60 years of age is very worrying.</p>
            <p eId="para_1844">The Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee to the Health and Safety Authority was set up in 2002. This Committee is made up of representatives from my Department, Teagasc, HSA and other farming groups and supports and co-ordinates the majority of research and promotional activities in relation to farm safety. This Committee put a five year Farm Safety Plan in place in 2003, which achieved a 28% reduction in farm fatalities and a 31% reduction in farm accidents. A new five year Farm Safety Plan is being developed by the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee and my Department will fully support this Plan with the aim of reducing farm fatalities and injuries even further.</p>

            <p eId="para_1852">The Government decision on the decentralisation of my Department is that our headquarters will move to Portlaoise, involving some 600 staff; the local offices in Cork city will move to Fermoy, involving some 100 staff; and the laboratories in Cork and Limerick will move to Macroom, involving up to 100 staff. The move of the Fisheries function of my Department to Clonakilty is now substantially complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_1853">My Department's original Decentralisation Implementation Plan allowed for a phased movement to Portlaoise. The 2005, 2006 and 2007 phases of decentralisation to Portlaoise were completed on schedule. The original estimate for completion of the plan was 2008, to coincide with the availability of the permanent accommodation.  The OPW announced last December that a consortium, the Macquarie Partnership, has won the tender for the project to build the permanent offices in Portlaoise (as part of a public private partnership including offices in Mullingar and Carlow) and planning permission for the new building has now been granted. A revision to the Department's Decentralisation Implementation Plan is now being considered, to reflect the changes to the timetable and the progress so far, as well as the evolving operating environment. An additional advance phase has been agreed and planning and preparations for this phase are currently underway.</p>
            <p eId="para_1854">Separate implementation plans for Fermoy and Macroom are in place.  Sanction has been granted for the building in Fermoy and some recruitment is currently in progress.   The identification of a site for Macroom is progressing. These moves are currently scheduled for completion in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1855">In total there has been an increase of 275 full-time posts in Portlaoise and 81 in Clonakilty since the programme was announced. Of the 275 staff that transferred to Portlaoise, 111 originally worked in my Department and were relocated under the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1856">The Government Decision on my Department is that the headquarters which is currently in Dublin will move to Portlaoise. The completion of the programme depends on the availability of the permanent accommodation and we are in discussion with OPW regarding the timescale for delivery of the building.</p>

            <p eId="para_1883">The bulk of fish which comes ashore at Irish ports may be destined for the local fresh market, may be sold to fresh fish markets on the continent, particularly France and Spain, and the remainder goes to the Irish fish processing sector.  Processing activity includes production of frozen fillets, mainly in the case of the pelagic herring and mackerel, to added value consumer ready products in the case, in particular of shellfish products such as crab, mussels, scallops etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1884">Effectively all the pelagic fish landed in Ireland is exported, mainly in whole frozen and in frozen fillet form to African and East European markets.  A substantial   proportion of the whitefish landings are sold on the fresh domestic market while species such as hake, megrim and monkfish tend to be exported in fresh form.</p>
            <p eId="para_1885">In the main, shellfish species are sold live and fresh in the case of lobsters, oysters and some crab, but also in processed form as consumer ready products in the case of mussels and Dublin Bay prawns.  Salmon from aquaculture is exported fresh, but in recent years there has been a move away from exporting the whole fish towards the export of fillets which is a higher value form.</p>
            <p eId="para_1886">In 2007 seafood exports amounted to 158,022 tonnes valued at €360 million.  This included exports of seafish and aquaculture products including salmon in fresh fillet as well as smoked form, and mussels and oysters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1887">Exports of whitefish and some pelagic in fresh form amounted to: 20,755 tonnes valued at €50 million.  This amount may be considered that which is not processed.  Exports of shellfish in live, fresh and frozen and other processed forms are classified cumulatively and amounted to 41,723 tonnes valued at €147 million.  A large percentage of this value is accounted for by processed product.</p>
            <p eId="para_1888">The remaining €158 million value of exports comprises fish which has been processed in a  variety of ways, including whole frozen and frozen fillets,  individually frozen pieces e.g. mussels, cooked and pasteurised such as crab, smoked fish including salmon and other processed and prepared presentations.</p>

            <p eId="para_1907">My Department carries out analysis on an ongoing basis of the various negotiating proposals which emerge in these negotiations.  This analysis covers a large number of different scenarios and their impacts on the different agricultural sectors.  In particular, the analysis evaluates the levels of import protection for individual products under the various different tariff cut scenarios that have been proposed up to now in the negotiations.  It provides a basis for assessing the impact of such cuts and the relative benefits of seeking sensitive product status to mitigate their effects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1908">I am not convinced that it would be appropriate at this stage for me to publicly release the analysis undertaken by my officials to advise me in these negotiations.  I believe this is a reasonable and prudent approach given the critical point we are at. I do not want to undermine in any way my negotiating position and I do not believe that the Deputy would wish to undermine Ireland's position in these negotiations.  I have already indicated on a number of occasions that I, or my officials, are available to brief the opposition on some key issues in relation to impact analysis on a confidential basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1909">Similar estimations have been made by various representative bodies and shared with the Department.

            <p eId="para_1910">A number of other bodies and research institutes, in Ireland and elsewhere, have also carried out economic studies. Some of these analyses attempt a broader, overall assessment of possible outcomes of the negotiations.  Inevitably these studies are based on a wide range of assumptions about issues that are yet to be decided in the negotiations.  My Department also considers and uses these studies to inform our negotiating strategy.   In particular I would point to the FAPRI Ireland WTO Analysis of Impacts on Irish and EU Agriculture study of March 2006 and the 2003 Forfás WTO Negotiating Objectives for Irish Enterprise Report.  The FAPRI analysis has recently been updated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1911">The EU Commission has also recently presented its own latest analysis of possible impacts of the most recent proposals from the chairman of the WTO Agriculture Committee.</p>

The most recent meeting of that Committee took place on Thursday last and heard presentations from the Department and from FAPRI Ireland regarding the current proposals.  The analysis and assessments emerging from these meetings contributes helpfully to the negotiating position adopted by the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_1914">Recent data from the Central Statistics Office on the Consumer Price Index show that Ireland, in common with the rest of the EU and indeed the world, has experienced a steep rise in food prices.  The cost of food and non-alcoholic beverage prices increased by 7.8% in the year to May 2008. This compares to an increase of 1.4% for the year to May 2007 and mirrors the upward trajectory in food prices as evidenced globally and across Europe, particularly evident since late 2007 and into 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1915">Changes in food prices are primarily a function of market forces operating at international, EU and national levels. Consistently strong economic growth in developing countries is the main driver of changing world food demand towards high-value agricultural products and processed foods.  Slow-growing supply, low stocks, and supply shocks at a time of increasing demand for feed, food and fuel have led to price increases globally. Biofuel production has also contributed to the changing world food equation. In common with the EU, Ireland is not impervious to this evolving change in context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1916">In addition, rising input costs, at both producer and processor levels have fed through to put upward pressure on food prices. Pressure on input prices, in particular energy and raw material including feed costs, has combined with strong competition on world dairy and cereal markets in increasing producer prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1917">In response to this situation the EU Council of agriculture Ministers has suspended set-aside, in order to increase cereal production, and has recently agreed a 2% increase in milk quota for 2008. Further measures are being considered in the context of the current discussions on the ‘‘Health Check'' of the CAP. A consultative process has been formed to advise on all aspects of the Health Check and the long-term future of milk quotas. This involves the main industry and farming stakeholders as well as independent experts and will feed into the ongoing debate on all the issues concerned.</p>

         his views on the change from risk to hazard based assessment of pesticides that would take out a number of crop reduction products; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1919">The new draft EU Regulation to replace Directive 91/4144/EEC concerning the marketing of plant protection products is part of a strategy for the Sustainable Use of Pesticides.  I supported most of the provisions contained in the draft Regulation but I am concerned that the use of ‘hazard-based cut-off criteria', as a basis for the approval of substances, ignores the scientific principle of risk assessment.  Some of the substances that are crucial to crop protection in Ireland may fail to meet the new cut-off criteria and their withdrawal may cause significant agronomic and economic damage without securing any significant reduction in human or environmental exposures to these types of substances.  I am also concerned about the absence of a detailed, up-to-date impact assessment on the effects of the current text on the competitiveness and sustainability of Irish and European agriculture.</p>
            <p eId="para_1920">For these reasons, and despite supporting most of the provisions contained in the draft Regulation, I abstained from a vote on the Regulation in Council and provided a statement for the minutes to this effect.</p>

            <p eId="para_1922">Comparing the results of the 1996 and 2006 censuses for persons in employment by sector gives an indication of the sectoral employment shifts which have occurred in the intervening period. However, comparing the data for both points in time does not allow any conclusion to be drawn on exits from farming and entries to other sectors of employment in the intervening period. Such an analysis would require a micro level longitudinal study.</p>

Obviously, the Government must take decisions in the light of the fiscal situation which will be indicated on publication of the half yearly Exchequer returns to-morrow.  We will then give priority to those Programme commitments which are most valuable from a social and economic perspective and can realistically be achieved in view of the present budgetary situation.  I intend to publish a progress report on the implementation of the Programme for Government by the end of the summer.</p>

            <p eId="para_2232">Briefly, under the Ethics in Public Office Acts, gifts given to an office holder by virtue of his/her office which exceed €650 in value must be surrendered (where there is a doubt as to the value of gifts, my Department arranges for valuations through the Office of Public Works in accordance with the legislation).

These statements are subsequently forwarded by SIPOC to the Clerk of the Dáil for inclusion in the Register of Members' Interests, which is laid before the Dáil and published in Iris Oifigiúil.  They are also published on the Houses of the Oireachtas website.</p>
            <p eId="para_2234">I understand that my predecessor made the necessary statements of interest to SIPOC for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007 and listed any such gifts in them.  His statements can be downloaded from the Houses of the Oireachtas website.  Any such gifts that he received in 2008 will be due to be included in his statement of registerable interests for 2008 to be made in January 2009.  I understand that no such gifts were received by him in respect of the meetings in 2008 mentioned in the Deputy's questions.</p>

            <p eId="para_2242">In January 2008, work began on the Review with preparations for a comprehensive survey of stakeholders and in March 2008, a survey of stakeholders and employees was carried out.

            <p eId="para_2249">The Value for Money and Policy Review initiative was introduced by the Government in June 2006 replacing the Expenditure Review Initiative (ERI) which began in 1997 as part of the financial reform agenda set out in <i>Delivering Better Government</i>.  It encompasses formal reviews for the period 2006-2008 already agreed to be carried out under the old Expenditure Review Initiative (ERI) as well as all other Policy Reviews conducted and commissioned by Departments which impact on Value for Money.  The Government also agreed that completed reviews should be published and presented to the relevant Select Committee of the Oireachtas and that a list of all reviews be provided annually to the Select Committee and published in Departments’ Annual Reports.</p>

While the focus of the Review was largely on policy aspects relating to the payment of the grant-in-aid, several of the recommendations should contribute to the efficiency of the organisation and reduce not only the direct Exchequer grant, but also the payments for services made to the organisation by both the public and private sector. One of the recommendations of this Review was that responsibility for Ordnance Survey Ireland should move to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. This change took effect from 1st January, 2008. The DCMNR will be better placed to comment on further progress achieved as the other recommendations of the Review are implemented.</p>

            <p eId="para_2287">I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 and 166 to 168, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2288">The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States. In the Irish context, these derogations allowed inter alia for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services. While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date. However the European Commission, which is the deciding authority, refused such requests.</p>
            <p eId="para_2289">The Finance Act 2008, as the Deputies are aware, consequently provided the legislative changes to withdraw the relief in respect of fuel used for public passenger transport vehicles. The relief will be withdrawn with effect from 1 November 2008 and the appropriate full excise rates will apply from that date. In the circumstances outlined above the question of reconsidering or deferring the withdrawal of the existing relief does not therefore arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2290">The Department of Transport and other relevant line Departments have, in conjunction with my Department, explored alternative mechanisms that might be used to direct Exchequer resources toward such services from that date, subject of course to compatibility with competition and EU State Aid requirements. While the matter is still being considered it is necessary however to stress, despite the claims being made otherwise, that introducing an alternative suitable mechanism is not a straightforward matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_2296">I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no full-time Customs presence at Weston, Ireland West or Galway airports. Customs controls at these airports, as at the other smaller airports, are risk based and are carried out by Special Compliance/Enforcement staff. Attendance is targeted and is based on analysis and evaluation of general seizure trends, traffic frequency, route and similar risk indicators. Attendance can also be as a result of specific intelligence. These controls are kept under constant review, in particular to take account of emerging smuggling trends and any traffic increase at these airports.</p>
            <p eId="para_2297">It is important to note by way of context, that the operating environment for Customs has been shaped to a significant degree by the introduction of the Internal Market and the related principles of freedom of movement within the EU.  Of specific relevance are the abolition of routine and systematic Customs checks on goods and passengers moving within any part of the EU and the elimination of Customs controls on the baggage of intra-Community passengers other than anti smuggling checks.  This is particularly relevant in the case of the smaller airports where passenger traffic is predominantly intra-Community.  In fact some of the smaller airports have no international flights. The approach has of necessity been to balance the freedom of movement principle in regard to people and goods with the need to control smuggling and enforce prohibitions and restrictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2298">The Revenue Commissioners assure me that, having regard to the context set out above, they are satisfied that their risk based approach, which is in line with the methodology adopted by other EU administrations in similar circumstances, remains valid.</p>
            <p eId="para_2299">As regards the drugs seizure in 2006 and the related arrest of three Irish nationals, I have been informed that, while this seizure may have been connected to an aircraft that had previously left Weston, the seizure was in fact made in Belgium.</p>

This cutter has not been sold.  Revenue, as part of its coastal control/anti-smuggling development programme, is currently in the process of acquiring a second Customs cutter which will be delivered in late 2009.  All staff/crew assigned to the Cutter will be trained in the required range of Customs skills including search of persons and of vessels.</p>

            <p eId="para_2361">Capital allowances are available where capital expenditure is incurred on the construction or refurbishment of certain nursing homes. The cost of the site does not qualify for capital allowances. The nursing home must be operated or managed as a registered nursing home within the meaning of section 2 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 and be registered under section 4 of that Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2362">Capital allowances are available over a 7-year period at the rate of 15% per annum for the first 6 years and 10% in year 7. Owner-operators can use the allowances to reduce their taxable income arising from the operation of the nursing home. Investors/lessors can use the allowances to reduce their taxable rental income from the letting of the nursing home and, depending on the amount of their rental income, can set off up to €31,750 annually against their non-rental taxable income. In the case of nursing homes that are first used, or first used following refurbishment, on or after 1 February 2007, the person claiming the capital allowances must continue to own the nursing home for 15 years to avoid a clawback of the allowances granted. Prior to this date the required holding period was 7 years.</p>

            <p eId="para_2383">One of the key challenges facing the health service is the need to ensure that services are planned and provided in line with the clinical needs of the patient. A number of experimental initiatives have been put in place by the Health Service Executive with a view to providing care in community based rather than hospital based settings where clinically appropriate.  The "Hospital in the Home" service is one such initiative along with the introduction of Primary Care Teams, Community Intervention Teams, a Rapid Access Service for the Elderly and the GP Out of Hours service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2384">The "Hospital in the Home" service was delivered by a private service provider on the basis of a service level agreement with the HSE and was for a period of one year. This agreement came to an end on the 16th March and was extended by agreement until 11th May 2008.  During the year, the service treated in the region of 2,000 patients at an annual cost of €6.83 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2385">A review of the service was carried out between January and March of this year under an independent Chairperson.  The review made a number of recommendations.  The main recommendation, which has been adopted by the HSE, is that the concept of the "Hospital in the Home" be retained and that the service should be repatriated within existing HSE services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2386">The HSE has emphasised that no patient was disadvantaged by this decision and has advised that patients who had been receiving services from the provider in question when the contract ceased have had their episode of care continued until it was scheduled to finish. These patients have since been referred back to their primary physician for management of any future care needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2387">The HSE is developing the range of services provided by the Community Intervention Teams in the Greater Dublin Area and extending their coverage with a view to meeting the needs of patients previously treated by the "Hospital in the Home" service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2388">I have agreed to meet shortly with representatives from the company which had been providing this service.</p>

            <p eId="para_2390">Section 53 of the Health Act, 1970, (as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005) provides, inter alia, for the levying of a charge where in-patient services have been provided for a period of not less than 30 days or for periods aggregating not less than 30 days within the previous 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_2391">The Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005 in keeping with Section 53 of the Health Act, 1970, as amended, have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges may be levied.</p>
            <p eId="para_2392">With effect from 14th July 2005, charges may be levied on persons who are in receipt of in-patient services in premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hours basis, and in premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis.  The regulations provide for a different level of charge in respect of each class as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_2393">Class 1</p>
            <p eId="para_2394">Class 1 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of €120 or the weekly income of that person less €35, whichever is the lesser.</p>
            <p eId="para_2395">Class 2</p>
            <p eId="para_2396">Class 2 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this situation, a weekly charge can be levied of €90, or the weekly income of that person less €55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.</p>
            <p eId="para_2397">These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on either class of person. The HSE has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of "undue hardship". Under Section 1 (b) of the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005, the HSE can examine a person's overall financial situation in view of the person's reasonable expenditure in relation to themselves or their dependants, if any.</p>
            <p eId="para_2398">It is a matter for the HSE, based on its own legal advice and taking into account the individual circumstances as well as the service being provided, to make a decision on any charges levied.</p>
            <p eId="para_2399">The rate of charges applicable to long stay care have not been increased since their introduction in July 2005.  These charges will be reviewed in the context of "A Fair Deal".</p>

It is a requirement that childcare services which are funded under the NCIP are accessible to children with disabilities.

            <p eId="para_2408">Directive 2005/36/EC provides for the mutual recognition of qualifications of nationals of member states in respect of a broad range of regulated professions, including a number of regulated health professions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2409">This new Directive makes specific provision — in Articles 28, 29 &amp; 30 — for training in general medical practice.

The Medical Council was consulted on the Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2410">General coordination of matters relating to Directive 2005/36/EC is undertaken by the Department of Education and Science and an official of that Department is appointed to coordinate the activities of the designated authorities in the State.

            <p eId="para_2413">In January 2008 the National Advisory Committee on Drugs in Ireland and the Drug and Alcohol Information and Research Unit  in Northern Ireland published the results of an all-island Drug Prevalence Survey carried out in 2006/2007 on a representative sample of people aged 15-64 years.   Results are available separately for Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The results for Ireland indicate that:</p>
            <p eId="para_2414">3% of respondents reported using any illegal drug during the last month (current use);</p>
            <p eId="para_2415">7% reported using any illegal drug in the last year (recent use); and</p>
            <p eId="para_2416">24% reported having ever used any illegal drug in their lifetime (ever used).  Applying these percentages to the 2006 Census of Population figures for the 15-64 year age group (a total of 2,907,473 people), suggests  that:</p>
            <p eId="para_2417">87,000 people have used any illegal drug in the last month;</p>
            <p eId="para_2418">204,000 people have used any illegal drug in the last year; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2419">698,000 people have used any illegal drug in their lifetime.</p>
            <p eId="para_2420">While the number of people who report ever using any illegal drug in Ireland has increased from 18.5% of the population in 2002/3 to 24% in 2006/7, this is to be expected as successive  cohorts of those who grew up when there was increased exposure to different drugs grow older.  It should, however, be noted that there has been no comparable increase in current use or recent use and that current use continues to be low.</p>
            <p eId="para_2421">While cannabis continues to be the most commonly used illegal drug, cocaine use has grown, particularly among the young adult (15-34 years) population. The HSE has in place a national cocaine awareness campaign and funding has also been allocated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to enable Local and Regional Drug Task Forces to develop local awareness campaigns to dovetail with this.</p>
            <p eId="para_2422">My Department and the HSE are participating in the development of the new National Drug Strategy 2009-2016 which is being led by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  This strategy will provide the opportunity for a renewed emphasis on prevention.</p>

            <p eId="para_2471">The Health Service Executive has commissioned a number of reviews of the configuration of acute hospital services including the one in the Mid West referred to by the Deputies.  In each case, the first priority is patient safety.

            <p eId="para_2472">The Health Service Executive commissioned Horwath Consultants in association with Teamwork Management Services in February 2007  to work on the strategic reviews of acute hospital services being undertaken by the Executive in the Mid West and Southern regions. The reviews focus on identifying the best configuration of acute hospital services in the region including arrangements for A&amp;E, critical care, acute medicine and surgery, together with diagnostic services so that the highest quality of care can be delivered to the population of the regions concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2473">The Health Service Executive reviews will act as one of the inputs to decisions on how best to reconfigure acute services in the regions concerned. The Government and the Executive are committed to ensuring that the approach to re-organisation of services is carried out in consultation with the key stakeholders, and that each element is progressed incrementally. I believe that it is important to work with health professionals and other interested parties to secure an increasing set of improvements over time. This approach will, I am confident, produce the best outcome for patients.</p>

            <p eId="para_2508">Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI).  The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.  There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2509">Products which are necessary for the management of the specified illness are available to LTI patients.  Other products are available according to the patient's eligibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_2510">People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2511">Non-medical card holders and people whose illness is not covered by the LTI can avail of the Drugs Payment Scheme, which protects against excessive medicines costs.  Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €90 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. In addition, non-reimbursed medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.</p>

            <p eId="para_2513">The Deputy's question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE) under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2514">As the Deputy may be aware, requests for assessment for intercountry adoption are continuously increasing. The recent study on intercountry adoption, undertaken by the Children's Research Centre in Trinity College, revealed that Ireland has one of the highest rates for foreign adoption in Europe.  In addition, as a result of the increased number of children coming from abroad, a new and increasing demand for post-adoption reports from sending countries has been created.  Both assessments and post-placement reports are being undertaken by HSE social work staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_2515">The HSE has been assessing the provision of services in the context of moving from the health board system to a single executive.  It has acknowledged that there is a divergence in the provision of services and is committed to addressing those differences.  In a number of areas, the HSE has improved waiting times by contracting assessments out to non-statutory agencies with appropriate expertise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2516">It is important to note that couples find it frustrating that subsequent to undergoing an assessment with the HSE and receiving the Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability from the Adoption Board they must then wait  before receiving a referral for a child from the sending country (for some countries up to two years).  This is an aspect that is outside the jurisdiction of the HSE and is dependant on the regulations that each individual country has with regard to Intercountry Adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_2517">The HSE has undertaken a review of the intercountry adoption service.  This review examined staffing, business processes, resources, strengths and options within the service and considered, inter alia, the issue of the commissioning of other providers to undertake some of the work associated with the assessment process.  The HSE has indicated that it will contact the Department with a proposed strategy on the management of the service into the future based on this work and parallel discussions with professionals within the service.  I would like to assure the Deputy of my attention to this issue and reiterate the importance of a rigorous and effective assessment system.</p>

MAIP commitments include the development of new residential, respite and day places for persons with intellectual disability and autism in each of the years covered by the programme as well as the transfer of persons with intellectual disability or autism from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements.</p>

            <p eId="para_2672">To qualify for a social assistance payment a person must satisfy a means test.  The means test examines sources of income and includes provision to disregard numerous sources of income including child benefit, carers allowance/benefit, supplementary welfare, fuel allowance and living alone allowance.  Mobility Allowance applicants must undergo a means test to ensure a cost effective delivery of the scheme.  As per any social assistance scheme, a balance must be struck between the needs of any individual and the requirements to prioritise public funds.  Any person who receives mobility allowance must do so on the basis of genuine need in accordance with the medical criteria and the means test laid down in the scheme.</p>

There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_2674">The Community Welfare Officer (CWO) of the HSE has advised that the person has not made a request for an ENP.

            <p eId="para_2683">The 2008 Service Plan, developed by the HSE and approved by the Minister for Health and Children, included €50m for the development of additional disability services.  The standard expenditure sanction issued to the HSE for 2008 stipulated that the prior approval of the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance would be required in the event of any proposal to spend this money for any other purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_2684">Clearly, it is essential that the HSE lives within its overall budget for the year.  It needs to manage its activity levels and cost drivers appropriately to achieve this and I do not believe it is desirable to resort to using development funding to offset expenditure pressures arising in respect of ongoing health services.  The HSE is currently reviewing its overall financial position for the year and roll-out of planned developments in disability services is being considered in that context.  I have been in communication with the HSE with a view to an early determination on the matter.  The HSE has informed my Department that it plans to release €20m of the €50m additional funding for Disability Services.</p>

          <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_829">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_2687">As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) under which the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) was introduced in January of this year.  The CCSS replaced the previous staffing support grant scheme which was implemented under the EU co-funded Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and which ended in December 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2688">In providing for the CCSS and the previous EOCP support scheme, Government childcare policy has recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families in addition to the main supports which are made available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs, that is Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone is expected to amount to expenditure of over €500m in 2008.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose.</p>
            <p eId="para_2689">The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme has an allocation of €154.2 million over 2008-2010 and will continue to support and ensure the sustainability of community-based childcare services which provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents.  Community-based childcare services will qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  The parent profile of each service, and the amount of subvention it will receive, are determined on the basis of completed parent declaration forms which they return as part of the application process.  The subvention received by services is, in turn, reflected in a tiered fee system under which reduced fees are charged to parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.  As the parent declaration forms are completed on an annual basis, the level of funding which is approved for each service is established on an annual basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2690">Transitional arrangements have been put in place to facilitate services which were funded under the previous EOCP support scheme to adjust to the new arrangements.  As a result, these services will receive not less than 95% of their previous level of funding in 2008.  The CCSS also recognises that in some cases, particularly in rural areas or on the islands, community childcare services may operate with a small or fluctuating number of children, in which case a minimum annual grant level of €20,000 can be awarded.</p>
            <p eId="para_2691">The CCSS provides an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community-based childcare services generally, and I am satisfied that it will also be effective in delivering the NCIP objectives of  supporting families to break the cycle of poverty and disadvantage.  It will also provide a framework which can accommodate any future childcare related initiatives which may be introduced.  The scheme is responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage and the ceiling for funding which existed under the previous scheme has been removed.  Account is also taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  The changes which have been introduced will ensure that the most affordable childcare is available to families according to their means.  Put simply, the tiered fee structure is the most effective way of ensuring that the considerable and ongoing Government support for the community childcare sector, will be targeted at those who need it most.</p>
            <p eId="para_2692">I am also pleased to advise the Deputy that, the Childcare Directorate of my Office has notified services of their individual grant levels for July-December 2008 and that the total amount of grant assistance under the new Scheme will be significantly higher than was the case under the previous scheme.  I am confident that the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme is a fair and equitable way of supporting community childcare operators in the provision of an affordable and high quality service to parents.</p>

            <p eId="para_2730">The GP visit card was introduced in 2005 as a graduated benefit, with the specific purpose that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their general practitioner.  The necessary amendments to the Health Act 1970 were enacted by way of the Health (Amendment) Act 2005.  The income guidelines used by the HSE to assess applications for GP visit cards are 50% higher than those used in assessing applications for medical cards.  As of 1 June, 2008, 80,035 persons held a GP visit card.</p>
            <p eId="para_2731">The range of general practitioner services available to holders of a GP visit card is the same as is available to persons who hold a medical card.  In all other respects holders of a GP visit card have limited eligibility for health services.  I do not intend extending the benefits attaching to the GP Visit Card beyond that for which it was originally designed.  The costs of exempting GP Visit Card holders from hospital charges would be very difficult to quantify, as hospitals have no need to record a patients public eligibility status other than if they hold a Medical Card.</p>

Against this background, the European Council decided in March 2008 to place BZP under control in accordance with the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances.  Member States must act as soon as possible, but no later than one year from the date of the decision, to introduce control measures and criminal sanctions.  Work is underway in my Department with a view to introducing the necessary control measures here.</p>

            <p eId="para_2756">The recruitment pause put in place in September 2007 was initiated as part of the HSE financial break-even plan to facilitate the delivery of services on budget in accordance with the provisions of the 2007 National Service Plan.  This pause did not involve random job cuts but did mean that the recruitment of staff to approved positions was delayed.  The HSE put in place a derogation process to deal with the filling of essential posts to protect front-line services and close to 900 posts were approved under this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2757">This temporary pause in recruitment ended on 31st December 2007 and any posts falling vacant from 1st January 2008 can be filled subject to the provisions of Circular 01/2008.

            <p eId="para_2758">The Employment Control Framework provides for the filling of vacancies arising in 2008, the filling of approved and funded service development posts not filled at the end of 2007 and new service developments in 2008. An overall employment ceiling of 111,650 whole time equivalents has been set for the public health services for 2008. This level of employment provides for 1,050 additional new posts arising from development funding provided by the Government in the Budget Day package for 2008. A breakdown of these development posts is provided as follows.</p>

            <p eId="para_2801">The EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States below the EU minimum duty rate.  In the case of public transport services under my responsibility, these derogations included reduced rates to apply to fuel used for scheduled bus services. Scheduled bus services comprise bus passenger services provided by Bus Atha Cliath, Bus Eireann, private operators in accordance with bus route licences under the 1932 Road Transport Act and holders of Authorisations pursuant to European Council Regulation 684/92 as amended. While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However the European Commission, which is the deciding authority, has to date refused all such requests.  The Finance Act 2008 provided the basis for the removal of these excise duty reliefs with effect from 1 November 2008. My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and other Departments, has been exploring whether alternative support mechanisms could be appropriate and could be done in a manner compatible with EU State Aid and other legal requirements. My Department has also met the Coach Tourism and Transport Council, as well as CIE, on this matter.  My Department has also received a written submission from the Coach Tourism and Transport Council.  While my Department is in discussion with the Department of Finance on these issues, it is necessary to stress that, despite claims being made otherwise, introducing an alternative suitable mechanism is not a straightforward matter in the current economic climate.  I do not envisage any approval from the Department of Finance for a replacement scheme in the current economic circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_2808">Policy in relation to the regional harbours, as published in the Ports Policy Statement in 2005, is that the continued operation of these harbours under the outdated provisions of the Harbours Act 1946 is unsustainable on the grounds of good governance and that most would best achieve their potential through transfer to local authority ownership.  Where it is not possible to reach agreement on transfer to local authorities, the option of sale of the harbours will be considered.  In harbours where significant commercial traffic exists, consideration will be given to bringing such harbours under the control of a port company.</p>
            <p eId="para_2809">For over three years now, my Department has been funding essential works to protect the fabric of these regional harbours at an average cost of approximately €4m per annum, pending their transfer to local control.</p>
            <p eId="para_2810">The transfer of the harbours to local authority control is effected by means of an order made by the Minister for Transport with the consent of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The order transfers all the property, rights and liabilities of the harbour authority and every member of their staff to the relevant local authority. On completion of the transfer, the Harbours Act 1946 no longer applies and the harbours concerned are managed in accordance with the statutory powers available to the local authority. The statutory powers of local authorities are a matter for the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_2819">I propose to take Questions Nos. 313, 315, 327 and 329 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2820">On 19 June 2008, my Department was advised by the Circle Line Company that it was going into voluntary liquidation and that bus services it was providing to and from Celbridge and Lucan that were the subject of licences issued under the Road Transport Act, 1932, would cease to operate from Friday, 27 June 2008. I very much regret the loss of employment and the loss of the significant level of services to which the licences related.</p>
            <p eId="para_2821">The operator of the services that have now been withdrawn has made complaints to my Department in relation to alleged anti-competitive practices with regard to Dublin Bus services. These complaints have been the subject of ongoing communications between my Department, Dublin Bus and the company.  Dublin Bus has advised my Department that it is conforming to its obligations with regard to its service authorisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2822">I understand from Dublin Bus that there are approximately 217 services daily from the Lucan area to the city centre and that 39 of these also serve the Celbridge area.  I am also informed that there are approximately 190 outbound services from the city centre serving the Lucan area throughout the day.</p>
            <p eId="para_2823">It is open to Dublin bus or any other operator to submit proposals to my Department in respect of new bus services from the areas in question. On the 27th June, 2008 Dublin Bus made an application seeking authorisation to provide a small number of morning services from Celbridge and Lucan, subsequently the application was revised by the Company and re-submitted to my Department on 30th June, 2008. That application is currently being given urgent consideration by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_2825">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to expedite the establishment of a Dublin Transport Authority, which will have the necessary powers to ensure the delivery of the integrated public transport system envisioned under Transport 21.  The Dublin Transport Authority Bill has been published and is currently before the Dáil.</p>
            <p eId="para_2826">The DTA Bill establishes a comprehensive framework which will give the new Dublin Transport Authority the power to procure public passenger transport services through the making of public service transport contracts.  Section 48 of the Bill envisages that the DTA may enter into contracts following open tendering in respect of public bus passenger services, as well as metro and light rail services.  It also provides that public bus and rail services can be secured by means of direct award contracts.  However, section 52 provides that direct award contracts will only apply to the continued provision of the services currently being provided by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.</p>
            <p eId="para_2827">Accordingly, the future growth in the market for subvented public bus services will be pursued by way of open tendering in accordance with the new EU Regulation 1370/2007 on public passenger transport services by rail and by road, which will become mandatory from December 2009. All contracts will be framed against the background of EU law and will set strict standards of operational performance and customer service and will contain penalties for non-performance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2828">The provisions of the Bill seek to maintain a balance between the need for transport services, including bus passenger transport services, that are the subject of a public service obligation and the licensing of private transport operators who provide commercial bus transport services and are licensed under the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932.</p>
            <p eId="para_2829">The Programme for Government also includes a commitment to improving bus services under Transport 21 by reforming the bus licensing provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, to facilitate the optimum provision of services by providing a level playing field for all market participants, both public and private.</p>
            <p eId="para_2830">It is my intention that proposals for a new bus licensing regime will follow in subsequent legislative proposals to be contained in the Public Transport Regulation Bill.  At this stage it is too early to be precise on the detail of the proposals except to confirm that the new Bill will deal with the replacement of the Road Transport Act 1932 and the provisions of the Transport Act 1958 that relate to the provision of bus services by the State bus companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2831">While it is not possible at this time to indicate a precise time as to when the legislative proposals on regulatory reform of the bus market will be published, applications for new bus licences and notifications from State bus operators will continue to be processed under the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, as amended, and the notification system with reference to the Transport Act 1958, as appropriate.</p>

At this stage it is too early to be precise on the detail of the proposals except to state the new bus licensing regime will be designed in a manner consistent with the new EU PSO Regulation.  It is envisaged that the new licensing structure will apply in respect of all commercial bus services, including those provided by Dublin Bus and Bus Eireann, and that the powers to grant licences in the Greater Dublin Area will be given to the Dublin Transport Authority.  The new Bill will also encompass provisions relating to the subvented bus market outside the Greater Dublin Area that are consistent with the EU PSO Regulation. In drafting proposals for reform for inclusion in the new Bill, I will aim to establish:</p>
            <p eId="para_2835">(1) a common licensing regime for commercial services, with clear criteria for the grant of licences,</p>
            <p eId="para_2836">(2) a contracting regime for bus services in respect of public service obligations which are open, transparent and flexible, and</p>

The shortfall in numbers for Ballinasloe will be met by the National Roads Authority (NRA) whose overall numbers have increased by 22 since decentralisation was announced. The NRA has stated that they can send an advance party of 30 staff to Ballinasloe within a two to three year timeframe.</p>

            <p eId="para_2870">The European Union's 1996 Common Position on Cuba, adopted under the Irish Presidency in 1996, remains the basis of both the European Union's and Ireland's approach to relations with that country. The aims of the EU Common Position include encouraging a process of peaceful transition towards a pluralist democracy, promoting human rights and improving the living conditions of the Cuban people.</p>
            <p eId="para_2871">In the Conclusions on Cuba adopted unanimously on 23 June 2008, the EU, noting the changes undertaken to date by the Cuban Government, re-iterated the Union's desire for a constructive dialogue with the Cuban authorities. Contrary to what is suggested by the Deputy, the Council further decided formally to lift the EU diplomatic measures, which had been suspended since 2005, in order to encourage and facilitate the political dialogue process and enable the full use of the instruments of the 1996 Common Position. Ireland was strongly supportive of this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2872">The Conclusions also re-stated the Union's human rights concerns, and urged the Cuban authorities to release all remaining political prisoners unconditionally and to facilitate access by international humanitarian organisations to Cuban prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_2873">On the occasion of the annual review of the Common Position in June of next year, the Council will evaluate its relations with Cuba, including the effectiveness of the political dialogue process.</p>

            <p eId="para_2876">I propose to take Questions Nos. 332 and 333 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2877">The Programme for Government of June 2007 committed us to campaign for a complete ban on the use of cluster munitions and to seek agreement on an immediate freeze on their use pending the establishment of effective international instruments to address humanitarian concerns. In implementation of this commitment, Ireland hosted and chaired a Diplomatic Conference in Croke Park last month to negotiate a treaty to prohibit the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians. On 30 May, over 100 States adopted a Convention on Cluster Munitions, which effectively bans all cluster munitions which have ever been used and provides ground-breaking provisions for victim assistance and clearance of contaminated areas. It represents a major advance in international humanitarian law.</p>
            <p eId="para_2878">The Convention will be opened for signature in Oslo on 3 December 2008 and will enter into force six months after the thirtieth State has ratified it. The Government is committed to early legislation to give domestic effect to the Convention and the new Inter-Departmental Committee on International Humanitarian Law has begun consideration of national implementation. I intend to introduce a Bill in the autumn and aim to take this forward rapidly so that Ireland will be in a position to sign and ratify the Convention in December.</p>
            <p eId="para_2879">As regards State investment, the Minister for Finance raised the issue of investing in shares of companies which are involved in the manufacture of cluster munitions with the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission earlier this year. The Commission agreed to exclude companies involved in the manufacture of cluster munitions from the Fund. I understand that the Commission has now implemented this decision.</p>

However, as the Committee felt that the proposal in question did not sufficiently meet the objectives of the Fund, support was not recommended on this occasion.</p>

            <p eId="para_2898">The situation in Zimbabwe is very grave and of the utmost concern to the Government and to the international community. This deep concern is strongly shared by members of the Oireachtas and by the Irish people.</p>
            <p eId="para_2899">I have made consistently clear our utter condemnation of the conditions under which last Friday's run-off election took place. The widespread state-sponsored violence and intimidation, which resulted in the deaths of close to one hundred MDC supporters and led to Morgan Tsvangirai's forced withdrawal, mean that Robert Mugabe's purported election victory cannot be regarded as in any way valid.</p>
            <p eId="para_2900">Following the re-inauguration of Mugabe as President on Sunday, the international community must continue to make clear that his position has not the slightest democratic legitimacy. The priority must be to find a peaceful way forward, through dialogue, that allows a legitimate government to be formed that reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people. Ireland fully supports the UN Security Council's call to this effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_2901">There is now a particular political and moral onus on African leaders, currently meeting at the African Union Summit, to take a decisive lead. In particular, the African Union needs to make clear that it does not accept this travesty of democracy and to show the necessary vigorous leadership to chart a negotiated way forward. I am encouraged by reports today from Sharm el-Sheikh that efforts to promote such a process are under way. This would represent a step in the right direction following yesterday's call by South Africa for talks between the Mugabe regime and the MDC. Any such negotiations would have to be credible, substantive and time-limited, and would need to be based on the outcome of the 29 March elections.</p>
            <p eId="para_2902">Ireland and the EU will continue to work closely with our African partners and with the UN and international community to develop the pressure for democratic change and for the relief of the suffering of the Zimbabwean people. In this regard, I would strongly support the imposition of further EU measures on those responsible for directing the recent political violence, and would also support UN sanctions as proposed by the United States, while avoiding any additional exacerbation of the dreadful economic situation which the long-suffering people of Zimbabwe have had to endure on a daily basis for far too long.</p>

            <p eId="para_2906">The Government are and have for some considerable time been very concerned about the welfare of the Irish community in Zimbabwe.</p>
            <p eId="para_2907">In the last two years, the Irish Abroad Unit of the Department has supported two Irish community organisations in that country, the Mashonaland Irish Association and the Bulawayo Irish Association. This funding is provided for welfare and administrative needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2908">In the same period, the Irish Abroad Unit has also provided funding to Safe Home Ltd, the voluntary organisation which supports elderly Irish emigrants who wish to return to Ireland. In this regard, Safe Home has housed a number of older Irish citizens who decided to leave Zimbabwe and return to Ireland due to their dire economic circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2909">The Embassy in Pretoria, which is accredited to Zimbabwe, stays in on-going contact with the Irish community in that country. In addition, the Ambassador and staff from the Embassy visit Zimbabwe regularly and meet with members of the Irish community, including religious and representatives of Irish NGOs working in Zimbabwe.</p>
            <p eId="para_2910">There are in the region of 2,000 Irish citizens still resident in Zimbabwe and our current advice, as outlined on our website, strongly recommends Irish citizens there to keep a low profile, exercise a high degree of caution, monitor local media for developments and avoid all areas where demonstrations may be held, or where there are large gatherings of people. They should not travel unnecessarily, especially at night. Where possible, they should remain in built up areas and avoid the commercial centre of Harare.</p>
            <p eId="para_2911">They are also advised to register their details and those of their families with the Honorary Consul of Ireland in Harare, and also with the local British Embassy, with which we have a standing arrangement to assist in the provision of emergency consular assistance to Irish citizens. They should ensure that their travel documents are up to date and readily available in case they need to leave the country at short notice.</p>
            <p eId="para_2912">My Department's further advises all Irish Citizens resident there to regularly monitor travel advice issued by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2913">All Irish citizens have the right of entry into this State. There is no particular need, therefore, to have specific discussions with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform other than to keep that Department generally informed of the overall situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2914">Finally, I should emphasise that the Department is advising against all travel to Zimbabwe at the present time.</p>

            <p eId="para_2917">In March 2008, the Government decided to reduce the administrative burden of domestic regulation on business by 25% by 2012. Administrative burdens include the cost of e.g. form filling, returns, applications, retaining records etc as required on foot of regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2918">My Department is responsible for devising the approach and methodology to be used across Government, for coordinating the work across Government Departments and Agencies and for reporting to Government on progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_2919">Initially, all Government Departments will be required to list the Information Obligations which their regulations impose on business. From that listing, Departments will assess which requirements are the most burdensome and will then measure the actual cost to business of the most burdensome requirements. At that point the most appropriate approach to achieving the overall 25% target will be re-examined.</p>
            <p eId="para_2920">In the case of my own Department, the intention is to focus initially on three major areas of regulation i.e. Company Law, Health and Safety legislation and Employment legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2933">The meetings referred to by the Deputy, were attended by my predecessor as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mr. Michael Martin TD. In relation to the meeting with Minister Rachid of Egypt, that meeting took place on 6th November 2007, not 6th January 2007, as stated by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2934">It is customary at meetings with Ministers from other countries, such as those listed by the Deputy, to exchange modest gifts.  The value of such gifts received by Minister Martin in these cases was significantly less than the threshold prescribed in the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, whereby gifts with a value in excess of that amount are deemed to be a gift given to the State.  In fact, many of these gifts have little intrinsic monetary value, examples of gifts that were received are, paperweights, letter openers, books etc. It is not practicable at this stage to identify which, of a range of various items, was presented at each specific meeting, over a period of more than two years.</p>

            <p eId="para_2984">The Department, with the cooperation of FÁS, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Department of Education and Science, has recently tested the non-income activation proposals in Kilkenny and Coolock.

Recruitment of additional Medical Assessors is being organized at present.  The number of medical examination centres in use by the Department is being streamlined.  To date, seven examination centres have been closed and all others are reviewed periodically on the basis of demand and accessibility.</p>

Measaim go bhfeicfear athraithe suntasacha ó thaobh fheiceálacht na Gaeilge de sa saol poiblí nuair a thagann siad i bhfeidhm. Táim den tuairim chomh maith, mar atá ráite agam cheana, nach bhfuil sé inmholta a bheith ag iarraidh chuile rud a bhaint amach in aon iarracht amháin.</p>

Is d'aon ghnó atá na heisceachtaí seo á moladh agam.  Táim go láidir den bharúil nach mbeadh ciall dá laghad le dualgas a chur ar chomhlachtaí cosúil leis an mBord Árachais Sláinte Shaorálaigh ná Bord Soláthar Leictreachais na lógónna atá acu a aistriú go Gaeilge trí ASS nó BSL á úsáid, chomh maith leis na leaganacha atá acu cheana féin. Is ainmneacha branda agus lógónna iad seo a bhfuil aithne fhairsing orthu i measc an phobail.  Tá na comhlachtaí Stáit seo, agus go deimhin comhlachtaí poiblí eile dá leithéid, i gcomórtas le cuideachtaí eile agus níl sé i gceist agam aon dochar a dhéanamh dá n-íomhá ná dá gcúraim thráchtála.

            <p eId="para_3185">As the Deputy will be aware, the CLÁR Programme is a targeted investment programme for rural areas that have suffered more than a 35% drop in population between 1926 and 2002. Since I introduced the Programme in 2002, it has been reviewed and extended twice, most recently in April 2006.  I provide for the Deputy's information under Table 1, the list of Electoral Divisions in Co Clare that are now covered by the Programme.  Table 2 lists all measures currently available to applicants from the CLÁR areas within County Clare and there are 17 applications for the Small Public and Sewerage Scheme currently on hand.</p>
            <p eId="para_3186">The measures under the programme are constantly kept under review to ensure their relevance to the programme's goal of rural regeneration and the list may be subject to change.  Since the programme was launched in 2001, over €11m has been approved and almost €7.7m of that has been drawn down for projects in the CLÁR areas of County Clare.  Full details of all funding approvals can be found on the Department's website, <i>www.pobail.ie</i> Table 1, County Clare DEDs</p>

            <p eId="para_3459">In March of this year, the Government decided to reduce the administrative burden of domestic regulation on business by 25% by 2012. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for devising the approach and methodology used across Government, for co-coordinating the work across Government Departments and agencies and for reporting to Government on progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_3460">In this context, the Minister recently asked all departments to list the information obligations which their regulations impose on business, and to prioritise and measure the most costly requirements. When this assessment is completed, my Department, along with other departments, under the leadership of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, will review the situation to see how the 25% reduction can best be achieved.</p>

            <p eId="para_3464">The total package negotiated in November 2005 in the context of the reform of the EU sugar regime was worth €312m to Ireland. An amending EU regulation in October 2007 had the effect of increasing the overall value to Ireland of this package to €353m. The package was composed of three elements.</p>
            <p eId="para_3465">The first element was the compensation for the reduction in the minimum price of beet — worth approximately €123m to Irish beet growers over seven years. This was incorporated in the Single Payment with effect from 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_3466">The second element was the EU restructuring aid which, at the outset, was worth €145m to Ireland.  Under the EU regulations, three parties benefited from this aid: the sugar processor, former beet growers and machinery contractors.  The first instalment (40%) was paid in June 2007 and the balance (60%) was paid in February 2008.  Some 380 machinery contractors received €5.9m to compensate them for actual loss in value of specialized beet machinery.  As a result of the amending EU regulation in October 2007, the amount of restructuring aid for Ireland was increased by €41.3m. Payment of this additional amount was made retroactively to over 3,500 former beet growers last month, bringing the total amount of restructuring aid allocated to the growers to over €53m.</p>
            <p eId="para_3467">The third and final element of the package was the diversification aid worth almost €44m to the former beet growers.  The first tranche of 50% (€22m) was paid in September 2007 and the balance was paid in March 2008.  This completes the implementation of the sugar reform package.</p>

            <p eId="para_4040">The development of regional and local agri-food products has an important part to play in achieving sustainable rural development and local food producers are key to this goal. This Government is committed to supporting local and regional food and Towards 2016 and my Department's Agri-Vision 2015 Action Plan include measures in this regard. Bord Bia, which operates under the aegis of my Department, works closely with other State and local agencies to exploit emerging market opportunities by providing guidance, advice and mentoring assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4041">My Department in co-operation with Bord Bia organised a national conference last November in Mullingar on the topic of exploring the opportunities in Local Food to raise awareness of local food and to highlight the benefits of local food initiatives for both the consumer and the producer.  This built on a series of six Regional Food Fora held over an eighteen-month period, which brought together regional, speciality and artisan producers as well as relevant state agencies.  As part of the drive to promote the benefits of local and regional food, my colleague, Minister Trevor Sargent T.D. invited local authority mayors and management to a Forum in January to engage with the growing culture of local food entrepreneurship and examine models of successful local markets.  An Artisan Industry Committee is also operating under Agri-Vision 2015 to address issues for developing the artisan food sector at local level.</p>

            <p eId="para_4045">The structural form of farmers' markets in Ireland varies between privately owned markets, public markets, co-operatives and the more familiar Country Markets.   Discussions have taken place with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the possible development by an interdepartmental group of statutory guidelines in relation to farmers markets. As a statutory approach would take some considerable time, a small group is being set up to draw up draft ‘best practice' guidelines which would be useful to interested parties and might form the basis for such a standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_4046">My Department is also currently funding a 3-year research project on examining effective structures for Farmers' Markets in Ireland under the Research Stimulus Fund Programme. The project, which is being undertaken by the Centre for Cooperative Studies and the Department of Food Business and Development, University College Cork, will seek to establish how farmers markets can best be structured to increase the competitiveness and sustainability of small farmers and to enhance product quality. It will examine structures in Ireland and draw on experiences of other countries to recommend ways of improving the effectiveness of farmers' markets in Ireland.</p>

A narrower definition of farm household (which would exclude some part-time farmers) estimates total farm household income to be €47,703 with 54% coming from farming, 27% from off-farm earnings, 17% from state transfers and 3% other sources.

            <p eId="para_4053">The use of pig slurry or poultry litter as a fertiliser for the purposes of agriculture is governed by the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006, which were introduced by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to give effect to the Nitrates Directive. The Regulations place strict obligations on all farmers in terms of fertiliser application and the management and utilisation of animal manures with the objective of protecting and improving Ireland's water quality. I appreciate that certain sectors of farming, such as the pig and poultry industry, face particular challenges in adapting to meet the requirements of the Regulations.  This was acknowledged by the inclusion in the Regulations of transitional provisions up to I January 2011, to allow for a period of adaptation for these sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_4054">In order to assist with the adaptation process, my Department established the Working Group on Intensive Livestock Enterprises  which includes representatives from Teagasc, the farm organisations, industry and other stakeholders.

            <p eId="para_4055">Nutrient off-take on most grassland farms in Ireland is low, resulting in a limited need for phosphorus in particular; and this is the limiting factor for most farms in the Cavan/Monaghan area. Tillage crops, on the other hand, provide a viable option for the use of pig and poultry manure.</p>

            <p eId="para_4058">My Department is aware of trade interest in using poultry derived meat and bone meal in pig rations and <i>vice versa</i>.  At present, EU regulations prohibit the feeding of meat and bone meal to farm animals.  Discussions are taking place at EU level on a partial relaxation of this ban.  The question of using bovine meat and bone meal to feed either pigs or poultry is not under review at this stage.  There are concerns that a relaxation of the ban on feeding of meat and bone meal to pigs or poultry might undermine the ban on feeding this material to cattle.  This could create problems for Ireland’s valuable beef industry.  The Commission has indicated that the ban on feeding poultry derived meat and bone meal to pigs and vice versa could be relaxed if satisfactory tests that can distinguish pig and poultry bone meal from ruminant bone meal become available. No final decision has yet been reached on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_4059">Imports of genetically modified maize and soya form a significant proportion of the feed materials used in Ireland for livestock feed.  In excess of 95% of both the maize by-products and the soya imported into Ireland is genetically modified.  Farmers have, however, experienced some disruption in trade in maize by-products for ruminant diets over the last twelve months, caused by a lack of synchronisation in the GM crop authorisation process used in the exporting countries and the EU.  This issue is under active review both within my Department and at EU level.</p>

            <p eId="para_4063">The deputy is referring to either the designation of shellfish waters under the Directive 2006/113/EC on the Quality Required of Shellfish Waters or to the Classification of Shellfish Areas according to the requirements of food safety legislation by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.  In accordance with the Government Decision of 30th July 2007, all active shellfish production sites where the waters are in need of protection or improvement in relation to the parameters specified in Directive (2006/113/EC), will be designated.</p>
            <p eId="para_4064">The interdepartmental Shellfish Waters Management Committee are at an advanced stage in the identification, mapping and selection of sampling points for these sites. On completion of this work, a process of public consultation will commence in advance of the designation of these sites by regulation. Any sites which are actively productive and where the water is in need of protection or improvement in the Irish territorial Waters of Lough Foyle are likely to be included in this process. The process of consultation and designation will be carried out in conjunction with the Loughs Agency in relation to Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough.</p>
            <p eId="para_4065">In accordance with the Government Decision of 2 October 2007, responsibility for the Quality of Shellfish Waters function concerning Directive 2006/113/EC will transfer to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Preparation for this transfer is at an advanced stage. My officials will continue to work with that Department on these issue through it's representation on the Interdepartmental Shellfish Waters Management Committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_4066">In relation to the Classification of Shellfish Areas according to the requirements of food safety legislation by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the European food regulations require shellfish areas to be classified using the amount bacteria found in sampled shellfish, as an index of water quality. The resultant outcome is one of three classifications; ‘A' (highest quality, lowest bacterial count) through ‘B' and ‘C'. This classification defines how these shellfish may be marketed, for example, shellfish consumed directly may only be harvested from ‘A' areas, that is, waters meeting the highest microbiological standards. Conversely, shellfish harvested from areas of lower water quality require further depuration/purification prior to sale.</p>
            <p eId="para_4067">In Ireland, the SFPA is the Competent Authority for classification of shellfish areas, under Service Contract with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI). SFPA officers carry out regular sampling of areas, for analysis at laboratories under the supervision of the Marine Institute (MI). Over the past year, the SFPA has participated in establishing a Code of Practice for microbiological classification of shellfish areas, with significant input from FSAI, MI and Bord Iascaigh Mhara, and the Irish Shellfish Association, as well as a nationwide series of consultation meetings with the shellfish industry, and an on-line consultation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4068">This has resulted in the recent publication by the SFPA of the 2008 classification for all Irish shellfish areas. For Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough the Irish Authorities collaborate with the Northern Ireland authorities and the Loughs Agency. The outcome for harvesting of oysters in Lough Foyle in 2008 was B status as it has been for previous years.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food  (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_4078">The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the European Union's instrument for the management of fisheries and aquaculture.  It was set down in 1983 and has been reviewed on a 10 year basis since then (in 1992 and 2002).  During both reviews, many of Ireland's priorities were delivered.  The process leading to that reform of the CFP was a lengthy and comprehensive one.  It embraced such key areas as access to resources, conservation, control and enforcement structures and fleet policy.  The reform process spanned a number of years and involved detailed consultations with stakeholders across the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_4079">In relation to quota allocations, the position is that Ireland's shares of the main fish stocks were set in the early 1980's when fish stocks were being shared out between EU Member States. The share allocations were based on catch records and reflected the fishing levels of the Irish fleet and other Member states' fleets at that time.  The percentage shares held by each Member State have generally remained the same for over 20 years under the principle of relative stability.</p>
            <p eId="para_4080">It has been a priority of successive Irish fisheries Ministers to try to have these shares improved.  During both reviews of the Common Fisheries Policy, in 1992 and again in 2002, substantial efforts were made to push Ireland's case for increased shares of important stocks but without success.  Ireland received no support from other Member States for changes in the allocation keys for the share out of stocks.  The practical reality is that to achieve an increase in Ireland's share of catches, other Member States would have to take a cut in their shares.  This is all the more difficult to achieve when the total allowable catches (TACs) of all the main commercial species are falling and the reality is that achieving support for such an outcome at the December Agriculture and Fisheries Council, where quotas are fixed for the following year, is not deliverable. At this point the European Commission and other Member States largely take the view that the quota shares are fixed and not subject to ad hoc changes pending any more fundamental review of the Common Fisheries Policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_4081">The 2002 review led to a new basic Regulation that will govern EU Fisheries policy until the next review which is planned for 2012.  It is not realistic therefore to expect a further reform process in the interim.  The CFP reform package, agreed in December 2002, included key national priorities such as the continued recognition of the Hague quota preferences, which are very important to Ireland as they give Ireland a higher share of certain important fish stocks than was agreed in the 1980s; an action plan to address the problem of juvenile fish catches, stronger control and enforcement and the establishment of Regional Advisory Councils giving fishermen a strong voice in shaping future fisheries policy at EU level.</p>
            <p eId="para_4082">Following protracted negotiations at the December 2007 Agriculture and Fisheries Council total package of 182,699 tonnes of fish was secured for the Irish Fishing Industry for 2008.  This was a significant success given that the initial proposal by the European Commission involved cuts of up to 25% for 25 of the 37 stocks of importance to Ireland.  The crucial Hague quota preferences were also successfully defended after a number of Member States attempted to have them set aside.  It appears that this system is likely to be challenged again this year and in that regard I want to assure the House that I will strongly resist any proposals to reduce or abolish our entitlements under these measures.</p>

            <p eId="para_4087">I refer the Deputy to the responses to questions Nos. 47 of 6 November 2007 and 204 of 14 May 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4088">The process has become considerably more complex in recent years due to increased activity and demands in the coastal zone and the knock-on need to take an ever greater account of public safety, environmental and economic issues.    A key element in this is seeking to ensure that the licensing process takes full account of the requirements of a number of EU directives and relevant implementing regulations governing, in particular, the potential environmental impacts of any aquaculture activities.   These include Directives on the quality of shellfish waters, on the protection and conservation of Natura 2000 sites and on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the marine environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4089">My Department is continuing to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the EU Commission with a view to ensuring that the licensing process takes full account of the requirements of all these Directives.   This work is considerably advanced at this stage.  In addition to the complexities associated with EU Directives is the fact that many of the licences already in place were issued in the 1990's for a period of 10 years and are now coming up  for renewal.    The process for renewal of a licence is essentially the same as that for a new licence.   In addition there are a substantial number of applications for assignment of licences.   It is also a feature that there is an increasing number of legal issues arising in the context of the administration of the regulatory process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4090">The licensing procedure is lengthy and complex, involving a range of intermediate measures before a recommendation and decision can be made in any one case.   The process involves consultation on a technical level, a public consultation process, and statutory consultation with a wide variety of Government Departments, bodies and agencies.  Any decision on an application is also potentially subject to appeal to the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board.   I would emphasise that, to a large extent, my Department is dependent on inputs and advices from a number of other Government Departments and agencies which are key to the deliberative process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4091">My Department has prepared a detailed strategic plan to give effect to the recommendations on aquaculture licensing contained in the Cawley Report.   This plan is currently undergoing urgent internal consultation with a view, inter alia, to eliminating the licensing backlog within a defined timeframe and delivering enhanced customer service to the industry.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_4109">Agricultural production in Ireland and the EU must be viewed in the context of a reformed and evolving Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), with much more competitive EU and world commodity markets. As a result of the reformed CAP farmers can now take advantage of the freedom to farm exclusively for the market.  They can focus on meeting the requirements of the consumer in a competitive manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_4110">Irish Agri-food related exports in 2007 totalled approximately €9bn. To survive and grow the sector must be highly competitive on EU and international markets. Competitiveness is not optional, at either producer or processor level, for a sector that is so export-oriented.  In this situation, producer prices across all commodity markets will obviously vary from Member State to Member State depending on prevailing market conditions and the comparative advantage or lack thereof that exists in that Member State. For example, prices of Irish beef have tended to rise in line with prices in the UK and Continental Europe, where the majority of our production is consumed. At times when the supply of product on the EU market is tight, beef prices in Ireland tend to rise at a greater rate, because such a high percentage of our production is exported to a range of beef deficient EU markets. With regards to cereals, the EU market price is currently buoyant, with the traded price of grain in Ireland well above the basic intervention price.</p>
            <p eId="para_4111">In Ireland, agricultural output (producer) prices increased by almost 10% in 2007, primarily attributable to increases for cereals, milk and vegetables.  The latest data (April 2008) shows that the (unadjusted) Irish agricultural output price index was 16.3% higher than in April 2007. The indices for cereals, milk, cattle, poultry, pigs, vegetables and sheep varied considerably and were up 67.7%, 26.8%, 14.1%, 11.9%, 8.4%, 6.7% and 4.2% respectively.  By comparison, in the first quarter of 2008, the EU output price index increased by 15.8% compared with the same period in 2007 with a similar range of increases across the various commodities.</p>

            <p eId="para_4113">The Irish food and beverages sector currently export over €8 billion, of which prepared consumer foods and seafood amounts to over €2 billion. Some 70% of food is exported to EU markets, with the UK receiving 48%.</p>
            <p eId="para_4114">In addition to health and well-being, and taste or quality, convenience is a significant driver in the very competitive consumer foods market and customers demand products that require little preparation or cooking time. An ever increasingly sophisticated and demanding consumer is supplied through a highly concentrated retail multiple grocery sector. The multiples, in turn, demand safe, high quality, good value, innovative branded and private label products from Irish food processors and suppliers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4115">The Irish prepared consumer food processing sector has proved its efficiency and effectiveness in supplying the retail multiples both in the home and export markets, where they are subject to stiff competition, particularly in the current economic climate. The bulk of Irish food products are exported to the UK market, where Irish companies have been particularly successful in gaining significant market share. Seafood processors have also been successful in recent times in entering new markets in the Far East.</p>
            <p eId="para_4116">Irish food processors would not have achieved the success they currently enjoy if they had not succeeded in keeping abreast of both market trends and technological developments in the fast moving and extremely competitive consumer global foods market. My Department, working in conjunction with the promotion and development agencies, recognises that to continue to satisfy the very demanding standards and requirements of the retail multiples, Irish food processors need to achieve high levels of innovation and competitiveness. Assistance is particularly focused on developing company's management, innovation and marketing capabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4117">A number of company clusters in innovation and world class manufacturing are currently in existence, whose objective is to keep abreast with developments in these areas, facilitated by Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia, BIM and Udaras na Gaeltachta. Participating companies have in the recent times visited centres of excellence overseas to ensure this is achieved.</p>

            <p eId="para_4119">I am aware of the current issues facing the pigmeat sector.  Feed costs have no doubt become a major factor in the past year.  In line with the general increases in prices of commodities world wide, the price of certain imported feed materials has increased by as much as 80%. This has resulted in compound feed prices that are 30% ahead than at the same time last year. Increased cereal planting consequent on the modification of set-aside rules should result in an easing of prices for native grains from the 2008 harvest, but prices are expected to be still well above the level that prevailed in 2006.  In addition to this import duties have been abolished on certain feedstuffs coming from non-EU countries and it is hoped that this will also add to feed availability.</p>
            <p eId="para_4120">The present price being paid to pig producers, currently standing at €150/100kgs, is up 15% on last year has been improving steadily over the past weeks. This positive development for producers has been assisted by the availability of export refunds which has helped alleviate pressures on the EU market.  Teagasc has prepared a development strategy for the Irish pig industry that identified the issues facing the sector and an Implementation/Steering Group is being currently set up. This group will consist of a small broadly based group that has the necessary stature and expertise to provide recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4121">Pigmeat features prominently in Bord Bia's programme of promotion on the home and export markets. On the export front, Irish pork has access to important markets worldwide and pork is included in overseas promotion drives and market access initiatives. To this end new initial communications have begun with New Zealand, Australia and Vietnam with a view to gaining market access to these countries.  I recognise, however, that the weak U.S. dollar is creating difficulties for exports to non-EU countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_4122">In the context of labelling my Department is pursuing the possibility of country of origin with the EU Commission.  The pigmeat sector has proved resilient in the past and I am confident that it can address its challenges and continue to prosper.</p>

            <p eId="para_4126">The Minister for Health &amp; Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Under the general labelling Directive (2000/13/EC), the place of origin of the foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.</p>
            <p eId="para_4127">EU beef labelling legislation requiring country of origin labelling of beef has been in place since September 2000.  As this legislation did not cover beef sold by the catering trade my Department collaborated with the Department of Health &amp; Children to have national legislation enacted to require that all beef sold or served in the retail or catering sector is now required to carry an indication of the country of origin.  This legislation is enforced by the FSAI.</p>
            <p eId="para_4128">Regarding the labelling of poultry meat, there are EU Regulations which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultry meat at retail level. The Regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.</p>
            <p eId="para_4129">My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat. This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.   However, it indicated that it will reconsider the draft measures once we have submitted additional explanatory information.  This information is currently being prepared for transmission to the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_4130">The EU has 36 specific marketing standards covering fresh fruit and vegetables. Apart from quality criteria these standards also set down strict provisions regarding labelling, these include country of origin.  The EU Commission is currently reforming the Common Organisation of the market for fruit and vegetables. As part of this process a number of the existing specific standards will be replaced by a general standard which will cover a wider range of fruit and vegetables.  I will continue to press for progress, as I believe consumers are entitled to full information on the labelling of food products.</p>

            <p eId="para_4132">Under the National Development Plan 2007-2013, substantial funding of circa €50 million has been included to assist producers of fruit and vegetables to upgrade or develop new production facilities.  The scheme of investment aid for the commercial horticulture sector will assist capital investment on farms to promote the specialisation and diversification of on-farm activities, improve the quality of products and facilitate environmentally friendly practices and improved working conditions on farms.  Commercial enterprises will also be assisted to improve marketing and processing facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4133">In addition, fruit and vegetable producers can benefit from EU aid under the Producer Organisation (PO) scheme. POs provide their members with the opportunity to concentrate marketing, reduce production costs, improve quality and stabilise prices. The strengthening of the role for POs is a core part of the EU strategy for improving the competitiveness of the fruit and vegetable sector in the future. With the more flexible rules adopted by the EU last year governing the formation and operation of POs, I hope to see them playing a much greater future role in supporting Irish producers of fruit and vegetables.</p>
            <p eId="para_4134">In December 2007 My Department also invited applications from the horticulture sector for funding under the capital investment scheme of aid for the marketing and processing of agricultural products.

Under the Scheme, aid is being provided to assist the development of the fruit and vegetable sector through grant aiding capital investment in buildings and/or new specialised plant and equipment in commercial enterprises involved in the marketing and processing of fruit and vegetable products. A total of 36 eligible applications were received and these applications are undergoing a detailed assessment and evaluation process.</p>

            <p eId="para_4138">All tree species grant-aided by my Department under the forestry grant schemes achieve high levels of carbon-sequestration.  The potential of different tree species to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere depends mainly on their rate of growth.  Some conifer species grow rapidly and will begin to sequester considerable amounts of carbon early in their life.  Other species, including some broadleaves, grow more slowly and do not sequester the same level of carbon until later in their life.  Generally, as trees reach maturity, there is little difference in the total amount of carbon dioxide sequestered, when all species are compared.</p>
            <p eId="para_4139">The relationship between forests and carbon sequestration is a highly complex one and the efficiency of forests to absorb carbon is not dependent upon the tree species alone.  Other factors such as soil type, previous land use, local climate, disease, fire, forest management activities, fertilisation and the rate of decomposition of forest organic matter all contribute, to greater or lesser degrees, to the overall forest carbon cycle.</p>

            <p eId="para_4143">There are in place a number of strategic plans operated by my Department which have the overall objective of developing and enhancing the capacity and competitiveness of the agriculture, food, forestry and fishing sectors. These include the Agri Vision 2015 Action Plan, the relevant commitments in Towards 2016, the National Development Plan and the Rural Development Programme for the 2007-2103 period, Steering a New Course — the seafood industry strategy and the agriculture and marine research development programmes in the National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation.  These plans were compiled taking into account the views of the industry, farming organisations and other major stakeholders and are regularly monitored to ensure that the relevant commitments are met on an ongoing basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_4144">As regards the maintenance and development of markets for Irish produce, Bord Bia will continue to play a prominent role in supporting the industry, both on internal and external markets.  Furthermore, the Programme for Government of June 2007  provides for the establishment of a  high-level  interdepartmental group whose role  an ongoing basis, will be to identify and work to ease access and fully exploit new overseas markets for Irish food and drink products. This newly formed Group met recently and agreed a programme of work to deliver on its terms of reference, which are:</p>
            <p eId="para_4145">To identify and work to ease access and fully exploit new overseas markets for Irish food and drink products.</p>
            <p eId="para_4146">To seek the re-opening of traditional markets and access to new markets based on terms of trade equivalent to EU standards.</p>

            <p eId="para_4149">The most recent figures available from the Central Statistics Office are for the year 2005 and these show that there were 73,500 farmers whose sole occupation was farming or 56% of the total, this compares with a figure of 49,300 for 1997 (figure for 1998 is not available). Over this period the number of farmers with another either major or subsidiary occupation rose from 49,300 to 58,900.</p>
            <p eId="para_4150">The trend in recent years has been towards part-time farming and reflects a combination of factors including the increased availability of off-farm employment. Many small-scale producers find that combining farming with off-farm employment is an effective way to ensure their continued viability in farming. At the same time, full-time farmers are looking to the new flexibility offered to them under decoupling to develop and intensify their commercial farm enterprises.</p>

            <p eId="para_4152">Official data on deer farming is available from the Census of Agriculture which is carried out by the Central Statistics Office roughly every ten years. The first and so far only Census of Agriculture that included deer was in June 2000. This stated that there were farmed deer on 266 farms. Teagasc has estimated that the number of farms involved in deer production peaked in the mid 1990s at about 450 and they would estimate that the number currently stands at between 200 and 250.</p>
            <p eId="para_4153">The structure of deer farming has altered over the last ten years and the number of units has decreased. While there are fewer enterprises now, they are larger, more specialised and moving towards quality assured high value product outlets.</p>

            <p eId="para_4155">Ireland has been successful in building EU and world market trade over a sustained period.  This has been supported by consistent efforts to promote and market Ireland's dairy produce in these markets by Irish operators.  Over 80% of Irish dairy production is exported to EU and world markets.  2007 was another successful year for the Irish Dairy Sector with exports up 13% to €2.36bn.  This was achieved despite challenges brought about by reduced export refunds, subsidies &amp; aids, increased energy costs and a weakening of the US dollar against the Euro.  The increase in dairy exports amounted to €270 million, 65% of the total rise in food and drink exports, and half of this growth came from Asian Markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_4156">As a consequence of tightness of supply on EU and World Markets, prices for dairy products increased considerably in 2007 and prices reached record levels in the Autumn.  Due to this market buoyancy, there are currently no internal aids or export refunds available in the milk sector.  However, my Department and I continue to keep the dairy markets under close review and intervene when necessary with the EU Commission to stress the importance of utilizing all market supports available, particularly for butter, in order to stimulate demand and stabilize the market for dairy products.</p>
            <p eId="para_4157">The key challenges in the medium term will be to ensure that Irish farming and the agrifood sector is at the heart of an evolving high-value food market which is focussed on quality and innovation.  This is at the core of Government strategy, evidenced by the National Development Plan 2007-2013, AgriVision 2015 and the Partnership Agreement Towards 2016.  A key element of this strategy was the Dairy Investment Fund launched in 2007.  My Department provided funding of €114 million towards investment in dairy processing and a total of 19 capital investment projects were approved and awarded Government grant assistance under the Fund, which will generate an estimated capital spend of €286 million at full production.  The purpose of the Fund is to increase the efficiency of the main dairy outputs by supporting the upgrading of plant and buildings and to assist operators in capturing new business and in developing new valued added products.  Some of these projects have already been completed and the remainder are progressing to the implementation phase.</p>

            <p eId="para_4172">The distribution of Irish beef exports has undergone significant change since 2000. Irish exports have gone from a position where only 50% of exports went to other European markets in 2000 to 97% in 2007.  The principal factors behind this change in market distribution have been the emergence of a significant market deficit in the European beef market combined with an improved market position for Irish beef in key markets.  This development represents significant progress for the Irish beef sector as the EU market continues to offer the highest market returns to Irish exporters on a consistent basis.  The improved market position for Irish beef is highlighted by the fact that to date in 2008 Irish steer prices stand at 100% of the EU-15 average R3 male cattle prices compared to 90% in the early 2000s.</p>
            <p eId="para_4173">Pigmeat</p>

            <p eId="para_4175">Continental EU markets such as Germany, France and Italy also continue to provide an important outlet for Irish pigmeat.  In terms of International markets for Irish pigmeat, the key destinations include Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States. Other markets to emerge over recent years include China which provides additional opportunities for Irish exporters to the region.</p>

            <p eId="para_4198">I propose to take Questions Nos. 407 and 408 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4199">The area devoted to energy crops increased from 137 hectares in 2003 to just over 9,000 hectares in 2007. The varieties of energy crops sown to date are Oilseed Rape, Miscanthus, Willow, Oats and Wheat. A figure for the number of hectares planted under energy crops in 2008 is not yet available. This figure will be forwarded directly to the Deputy immediately it becomes available, together with a listing of crops being grown under the 2008 Energy Crops Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4200">Support to farmers for growing energy crops is available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme, which provides an EU premium of €45 per hectare for energy crops that are used to produce bio-fuels and electric and thermal energy produced from biomass. In 2006, my predecessor called for a review of the energy crop premium, as it was not proving effective in Ireland and also raised the matter with the Agriculture Commissioner. The EU Commission subsequently published a Report on implementation of the scheme and made a proposal to allow Member States pay national aid of up to 50% of the costs associated with establishing miscanthus and willow. Following the adoption of this Proposal, the Department introduced a new Bio-energy Scheme offering establishment grants of  €1,450 per hectare to farmers to plant willow and miscanthus.</p>
            <p eId="para_4201">The cultivation of energy crops for bio-fuel feedstock provides an alternative land use option for farmers and is part of the solution to mitigating the harmful effects of climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector. Sustainability in the production and use of bio-fuels is critical and in that regard the Commission has proposed new environmental sustainability criteria for bio-fuel use in the EU. The criteria will set strict targets for bio-fuels in terms of greenhouse gas emission savings.</p>

            <p eId="para_4203">As part of the EU sugar reform package diversification aid worth €44m approximately to Ireland was made available.  The main objective of this aid was to provide funding towards the cost of establishing alternative farming enterprises by the former beet growers and thus assist these farmers to earn a replacement income and contribute to the viability of the wider rural economy of the former beet growing areas. The first tranche of 50% (€22m) was paid in September 2007 and the balance was paid in March 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4204">Following the reform of the Common Agriculture Policy in 2003, farmers now have the freedom to focus on new market opportunities including the area of purpose grown energy crops for use as a renewable source of energy in the heat, electricity and liquid bio-fuels markets. The market for energy crops is developing in response to the need to develop alternative renewable sources of energy. To improve the profitability of growing energy crops in Ireland, my Department introduced a number of support measures in 2007. The measures include a new National Energy Crop Premium of €80 per hectare to supplement the EU premium of €45 per hectare available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme. A new Bio-energy Scheme was also introduced to encourage farmers to grow miscanthus and willow for use in the production of heat and electricity. The Scheme provides farmers with establishment grants of up to 50% of the costs of establishment, subject to a maximum grant of €1,450 per hectare. As a further support measure, areas planted with energy crops also qualify for the Single Farm payment. I am confident that these measures will encourage farmers to consider energy crops as an alternative land use option.</p>
            <p eId="para_4205">Many farmers who previously grew sugar beet will have increased their cereals acreages this year as a result of the increase in cereals prices in recent times and following the decision of the EU Commission to set the obligatory set-aside rate at zero for the 2008 harvest.</p>

          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_935">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_4217">As outlined to the Deputy in a reply on 21st February, plans for the development of the agrifood sector are set out in the AgriVision 2015 Action Plan, the Programme for Government, the National Development Plan and the Rural Development Plan.  The AgriVision Action Plan was the Government's response to the seminal Report of the AgriVision 2015 Committee on what needed to be done to secure the optimal development of the agriculture and food industries. It contained 167 actions based on three key drivers for success, i.e. competitiveness, innovation and consumer focus.</p>
            <p eId="para_4218">Yesterday, I launched the Second Progress Report of the Action Plan detailing the work that has been undertaken in the two years since its publication.  Substantial progress has been made, with 93% of its actions implemented. The combined effect of these and related actions has been that overall food exports rose in 2006 by 10% with a further 5% increase in 2007 to €9.2 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_4219">Meat Sector</p>
            <p eId="para_4220">In relation to meat, the Action Plan points out that the short-to-medium term goal of the meat sector, especially beef, is to ensure that high market penetration in the EU is consolidated and developed, while also recognising the importance of access to commercially attractive third country markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_4221">The challenges facing the sector are varied and it is essential that it continue to adapt positively and efficiently to evolving market trends and consumer demands.  Consequently, and in line with the Agri Vision 2015 Action Plan, I have put in place a number of measures and supports, which, I believe, will support the industry in positioning itself to face the challenges posed by ever evolving markets. These initiatives cover every aspect of the "meat chain", from producer to the consumer.</p>
            <p eId="para_4222">Beef</p>
            <p eId="para_4223">Amongst the specific measures introduced to support the beef industry are:</p>
            <p eId="para_4224">A Capital Investment Aid Scheme aimed at increasing value added and increased efficiencies for the beef and sheepmeat industries at processing level</p>
            <p eId="para_4225">a nationally funded Suckler Welfare Scheme aimed at improving animal welfare and contributing to the improved quality and viability of suckler herds.</p>
            <p eId="para_4226">a Beef Forum to examine the various issues arising in the sector and to consider appropriate responses.</p>
            <p eId="para_4227">In addition, Bord Bia is intensifying its promotional measures to publicise the positive response of the beef industry to an ever-evolving market.  These initiatives complement and underpin the existing quality assurance schemes and the advances in breed improvement being developed by ICBF.</p>
            <p eId="para_4228">Sheepmeat</p>
            <p eId="para_4229">The Sheep Industry Development Strategy Group set out a series of recommendations covering areas such as production, research, advice, processing and marketing. The objective is to facilitate the development of a more profitable sheep sector in Ireland covering production, processing and marketing.  Most of the recommendations in the Report fall to be implemented by the industry itself and of their nature will take time for their effects to be seen. My Department is playing its part by providing assistance for breeding, processing facilities, mechanical grading and quality assurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4230">Other aspects of the Group's report are also being pursued and sheep farmers are major beneficiaries of various schemes being operated by my Department. Under REPS 4, a new mixed grazing measure is specifically targeted at them. Payment from the National Reserve of the Single Payment Scheme have and will continue to be made to certain sheep farmers. This will result in payments of some €42m up to 2013 in the areas concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_4231">The downward trend in lamb consumption in certain markets presents a real challenge. To address this, Bord Bia is collaborating with its French and British counterparts on a 3 year generic lamb promotion on the French market to promote lamb to younger consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4232">Pigmeat</p>
            <p eId="para_4233">Over the past year the very high cost of feeding stuffs has created serious difficulties for pig producers. While there may be some easing of cereal prices the likelihood is that feed costs will continue to challenge the sector. In recent months the prices being paid to producers throughout the EU have been very high compared to recent years. This is due in large part to the scheme of export refunds introduced last December following representations by this country and other Member States to the European Commission. An aids-to-private-storage scheme that operated last November also provided some useful assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4234">Access to international markets is an important contributor to the viability of the Irish pig industry. Our pigmeat is exported to a wide range of destinations worldwide including important markets such as Japan, Peoples Republic of China and the US.</p>
            <p eId="para_4235">My Department maintains an extensive scheme of controls on the hygienic production of pigmeat and on the operational procedures that are required to underpin the certification of pigmeat for markets worldwide.  Bord Bia's marketing initiatives cover pigmeat. The sector is often involved in overseas promotion drives which occasionally involve the participation of pigmeat exporters.  My Department will continue to work with Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs and the industry to identify and develop other potential markets.  Pork and bacon is included in Bord Bia's promotion campaigns for the Irish market and the Bord's pigmeat quality assurance scheme is being developed with a view to increasing membership.</p>
            <p eId="para_4236">Poultry</p>
            <p eId="para_4237">It is my policy that this industry should develop to its full potential and be in a position to meet the demands of today's consumers and withstand the very strong competition from abroad.  The Poultry Expert Group was set up to review the main factors impacting on the poultry and eggs industry and draw up relevant action points. The group was comprised of various industry players including producers, processors, packers, feed suppliers, relevant State bodies etc. The final report of the Group contains recommendations concerning such matters as poultry meat labelling, animal welfare, environment protection and feeding stuffs. My Department will be implementing the recommendations relevant to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_4238">Dairy Sector</p>
            <p eId="para_4239">Processing Industry</p>
            <p eId="para_4240">Last year my Department provided funding of €114 million towards investment in dairy processing. A total of 19 capital investment projects were approved and awarded Government grant assistance under the Dairy Investment Fund, which will generate an estimated capital spend of €286 million at full production.  The purpose of the Fund is to increase the efficiency of the main dairy outputs by supporting the upgrading of plant and buildings and to assist operators in capturing new business and in developing new valued added products.  Some of these projects have already been completed and the remainder are progressing to the implementation phase.</p>
            <p eId="para_4241">Milk Quotas</p>
            <p eId="para_4242">Reducing costs and increasing scale means getting more milk quota into the hands of active and committed producers at the lowest possible cost.  In order to achieve this objective my Department introduced the Milk Quota Trading Scheme for the 2007/2008 quota year, in recognition of the need for improved efficiency and long-term competitiveness at producer level.  The scheme has now completed its second year of operation and has been responsible for the transfer of 320 million litres of milk quota to active and progressive dairy farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4243">At EU level, Ireland pressed for an increase in Milk Quotas for the 2008/09 milk quota year.  The Commission, in its Dairy Market Report in December 2007, recommended a quota increase of 2% for all Member States from April.  This proposal was adopted by the Council of Ministers in March, and the additional quota has been allocated to all active dairy farmers, giving further opportunities to the Irish dairy sector to respond to improved international dairy markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_4244">As a consequence of tightness of supply on EU and World Markets, prices for dairy products increased considerably in 2007 and prices reached record levels in the Autumn.  Due to this market buoyancy, there are currently no internal aids or export refunds available in the milk sector.  However, I will continue to keep the dairy markets under close review and will intervene when necessary with the EU Commissioner to stress the importance of utilizing all market supports available, particularly for butter, in order to stimulate demand and stabilize the market for dairy products.</p>

            <p eId="para_4308">Integrate Ireland Language and Training Ltd. (IILT) approached my Department earlier this year with a proposal to withdraw from direct tuition for adult refugees and with a request that this tuition be mainstreamed. IILT envisaged continuing direct tuition for a group of up to 200 programme refugees. My Department accepted that mainstreaming of service provision was appropriate as it accords with the overall approach to provision of services to migrants as set out in "Migration Nation" — a statement on integration strategy and diversity management which I recently launched. In doing so the Department decided that all provision should be mainstreamed and provided by VECs as it would make no sense to seek to continue with a small element of provision by IILT.</p>
            <p eId="para_4309">As IILT will cease providing direct tuition there is no longer a need for the company to transfer to Greendale. In July 2007, it was announced that the vacant premises of Greendale Community School would continue to be used for educational purposes. St. Michael's House Special School, Colaiste Dhulaigh and Integrate Ireland Language and Training Ltd (IILT) were announced as the three educational institutions which would transfer to Greendale. St. Michael's House and Colaiste Dhulaigh will continue to avail of the accommodation at Greendale and this will ensure that the premises will continue to be used for educational purposes.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Conor Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4316">The total cost of providing English language support to children in our primary and post primary schools is estimated to be over €120 million in the 2007/2008 school year. An estimated €30 million of this cost is in relation to post primary education.</p>
            <p eId="para_4317">It is estimated that in the region of 28,000 children in first and second level schools benefited from English language support in the 2007/2008 school year because English or Irish was not their first language. The corresponding figure for the previous school year is 23,500.</p>
            <p eId="para_4318">The substantial increase in the number of language support teachers underlines the important improvements made in this area in recent years. The previous limit of two teachers per primary school and the limit of two years' support to an individual pupil was changed. The total number of children who received more than 2 years English language support is not readily available.</p>
            <p eId="para_4319">In order to ensure that schools can accurately and objectively assess the language requirement of children, my Department has recently sent assessment materials to all schools. The assessment materials will enable schools to ensure that the specific language requirements of children needing support are met in a targeted way.</p>
            <p eId="para_4320">A number of research projects are also underway.  The Inspectorate is conducting an evaluation of the provision of English as an Additional Language (EAL) in a number of primary and post-primary schools in 2008 and 2009. A report will be prepared for mid 2009.  The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) is undertaking a large-scale study into how an increasing diversity of students impacts upon resource requirements and day to day teaching and learning in primary and post-primary schools. It is expected that this review will be completed in autumn 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_4322">The findings of this research work will evaluate current provision and will inform me on ways, where such are indicated, to improve the standard of English language education for migrant pupils in primary and post- primary schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_4352">Results of a survey on the uptake of Stay Safe carried out by the Child Abuse Prevention Programme (CAPP) and my Department in 2006 showed that at that time:</p>
            <p eId="para_4353">2,514 schools (84.19%) were providing the programme</p>
            <p eId="para_4354">472 (15.81%) were not providing the programme, and</p>
            <p eId="para_4355">263 schools (8.8%) of respondents) were not teaching the sections on inappropriate sexual contact and secrecy.</p>
            <p eId="para_4356">Of the 472 schools that were not teaching the Stay Safe programme, 240 (8.0% of respondents) reported that child abuse prevention was covered as part of the curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_4357">Research has not been carried out by my Department into the way the programme is operating since this survey was completed.  However, following the survey my Department has been taking a targeted approach to the provision of training.  Two additional primary school teachers were seconded to CAPP in September 2007 to assist with this training, which is being directed at those schools that had indicated they are not implementing the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4358">In the 2007/2008 school year CAPP has provided training to approximately 615 schools, over 5,000 teachers and 1,100 special needs assistants.</p>
            <p eId="para_4359">In addition to this targeted training, CAPP continues to provide in-service training and support to all primary schools on request.</p>
            <p eId="para_4360">It should also be noted that in 2006 my Department sent a Circular on Child Protection and Procedures for Primary Schools (Primary 0061/2006) to the Chairpersons and Principals of all primary schools.  This draws attention to the crucial importance of schools following closely the Child Protection Guidelines and Procedures which are based on the Children First national guidelines issued by the Department of Health and Children and specifically adapted to cater for primary school settings.</p>

So far the feedback on the protocol and the related book delivery guarantees has been very positive.  The protocol is due for review shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_4382">For the past nine years the Planning and Building Unit within my Department have been using a process called the DART approach to develop sustainability and energy efficiency in educational buildings.  This acronym focuses on four key areas, namely; Design, Awareness, Research, and Technology.  The policy is informed by the Building Unit Professional and Technical staff, driven by its technical guidance documents and updated by continued energy research and development.</p>
            <p eId="para_4383">Rather than develop a unique focus on energy design the Planning &amp; Building Unit has taken a more holistic approach and has developed technical guidance on energy efficiency in school designs as an integral part of a suite of technical guidance documents, likewise the costs of all elements are included in the basic building costs for each project.  These technical guidance documents are available on <i>www.education.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_4384">The output specification for the heating system in the above schools is the same as the specification used in all new school design.</p>
            <p eId="para_4385">It has been demonstrated that all Primary Schools designed and built in line with the above policy and the technical guidance documents can have an energy performance that is up to 2.3 times more efficient than International Best Practice with an associated reduction of 29,744.94 kg CO2 over the best practice figures for a typical 16 classroom school.  This excellent energy efficiency will in turn reduce energy consumption by over 50% with energy costs reduced likewise.</p>
            <p eId="para_4386">The main heat source for the schools, where natural gas is available, is fully condensing, fully modulating boilers.  These boilers are provided with direct boiler temperature modulation in order to maximise the boilers' efficiency.  By providing direct boiler weather compensation, the water temperature within the boilers can be held within the boiler's condensing range for most of the heating season, without the need to oversize radiators.  The use of direct boiler modulation also allows the removal of mixing valves from secondary circuits and generates a net cost saving.  Where natural gas is not available oil fired boilers will be utilised.</p>
            <p eId="para_4387">In keeping with the low energy philosophy all heating pumps operate through electronic speed controllers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4388">Each teaching space and staff areas are controlled via two port motorised valves with digital thermostats with a range of 21 degrees Celsius +/- 3 degrees.  These allow teachers to trim local temperature control within a temperature band.</p>

         the reason, in view of the Government’s supposed commitment to expend €252 million in supporting information and communications technology in schools over the period 2007 to 2013, his Department has cut funding for IT support services to schools, which has led to 21 ICT adviser posts not being filled in September 2008 as a result of the withdrawal of funding; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the directors of education centres were informed by e-mail at 5.15 p.m. on 20 June 2008 that the ICT advisory service would no longer be available; the reason this occurred in view of the recent reports that the decision to withdraw funding was made in March 2008 but not communicated to the personnel involved, which causes all such personnel inconvenience; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_4414">I propose to take Questions Nos. 464, 466, 502 and 507 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4415">ICT Advisor posts were provided as part of the ICT Advisory Service operated by the 21 full-time Education Centres around the country, to provide pedagogical advice and support and advice on ICT-related issues to schools and Education Centres.  While employed by the individual Education Centres, my Department funded the posts via the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE), which in consultation with the Education Centres, directed the work of the ICT advisors in supporting the local implementation of the ICT in Schools Programme.  There are 3 vacancies among the 21 posts, with a further post due to be vacated in September following the ICT advisor's retirement.  Of the remaining 17 posts, 14 are filled by teachers on secondment from their teaching duties and 3 are filled on a non-secondment contract basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_4416">A Value for Money Review of the ICT Support Service, which addressed the work of the NCTE, the ICT Advisory Service and specific posts assigned to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, was undertaken by my Department.  While concluding that the Service is generally effective and efficient, the Report recognises that each school must plan and execute its own policy for ICT integration across the curriculum.  It concludes that now, ten years on, the resources currently utilised by the ICT Advisory Service operating from the regional Education Centres would be better employed focusing supports for ICT leadership and change within each school.</p>
            <p eId="para_4417">The Education Centres have been advised that the Department is not prepared to renew secondment arrangements for the 14 teachers seconded as ICT Advisors.  The implementation of these arrangements has been discussed with the Education Centres and schools concerned.  My Department will ensure that any difficulties arising in specific schools by the return of the teachers concerned will be addressed.  My Department is considering the position of the three non-seconded ICT advisors.</p>
            <p eId="para_4418">The role of the school's ICT coordinating teacher will be prioritised as central in the provision of ongoing ICT support and advice to teachers.  Local school-based and peer to peer support has been identified internationally as the most effective way to further ICT integration in schools.  Furthermore, there is a need to ensure that the integration of ICT is specifically incorporated into all the support service activities funded by my Department and that it is recognised as an integral part of all curriculum development, support and training rather than an optional add-on.</p>
            <p eId="para_4419">The annual cost of the 14 seconded teachers is some €1.3m.  It is intended that any consequential savings will be directed to support ICT in schools.  As the Deputies will be aware, I intend to publish the report of the Strategy Group appointed to advise on priorities for investment in ICT in Schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_4451">The admission requirements for entry into third level colleges and the delineation of points for particular subjects are matters for decision by the colleges themselves.  The Central Applications Office provides a processing service on behalf of the colleges, based on the parameters stipulated by the colleges for entry purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4452">My predecessor is on record as favouring the provision of bonus points for higher level mathematics where students are entering third level programmes with a high mathematics content, such as in science, engineering and technology.  These views were publicised to stimulate debate on the issue and this is happening.  For example, last month, the universities formally communicated their collective view that the introduction of bonus points for Leaving Certificate higher level maths is unlikely to achieve the national objective of greater participation in science, engineering and technology programmes or of dramatically increasing uptake of Leaving Certificate higher level mathematics. Instead, they consider that a number of other, longer-term solutions and potentially more effective responses are needed to increase the numbers of students taking Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate higher level mathematics and participating in higher education science, engineering and technology programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4453">In relation to the reform of junior and senior cycle mathematics, my Department has initiated very significant development work on foot of advice received from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  The reforms are designed to provide for the phased implementation of syllabus change in mathematics by:</p>
            <p eId="para_4454">Providing a bridging framework from the revised primary curriculum into second-level</p>
            <p eId="para_4455">Promoting greater mathematics literacy across the school population</p>
            <p eId="para_4456">Bringing changed emphasis in the mathematics learnt and, in particular, a strong focus on context and applications and problem-solving in a general move towards a strengthened emphasis on "real mathematics education" and a greater ICT dimension</p>
            <p eId="para_4457">Encouraging greater take up at higher level (intended targets are 60% at Junior Certificate and 30% at Leaving Certificate)</p>
            <p eId="para_4458">Providing a solid foundation which prepares students for careers in science, technology, engineering, business or humanities options</p>
            <p eId="para_4459">Providing for an innovative professional development model under which change would be implemented in various areas of mathematics on a phased basis in a rolling programme of reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_4460">For schools involved in the initial implementation from September 2008, students will experience mathematics in a new way.  Teachers will be provided with classroom materials to enable them to adopt the new approaches and will be supported professionally in embracing change.  These materials and supports will include lesson plans, with teacher guides and student worksheets, online exemplars and a range of assessment materials.  Examination questions will also be changed for these students, with some choice between science/engineering based applications and those emanating from the realm of business or the social sciences.</p>
            <p eId="para_4461">Implementation of the pilot phase of the reform of mathematics, known as Project Maths, will commence on 1st September 2008 in 24 participating schools. The project will be mainstreamed in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4462">As this major project rolls out in our schools, I encourage continued debate among the education partners on bonus points for mathematics.</p>

            <p eId="para_4464">Táim feasach ar an dtaighde dá dtagraíonn an Teachta, taighde a thugann le fios go gcruthaíonn daltaí i nGaelscoileanna thar an meán i scrúduithe caighdeánaithe Béarla.  Tugann staidéar náisiúnta sa réimse seo le fios chomh maith go bhíonn próifíl socheacnamaíoch níos airde ag mic léinn dá leithéid, agus go mbíonn suim níos mó ag a dtuismitheoirí san oideachas ná mar a bhíonn i scoileanna príomhshrutha.  I nGaelscoileanna, tharlódh go múinfí gach ábhar ach amháin an Béarla trí Ghaeilge, rud a fhágann go mbíonn leibhéal tumtha de 88-90% ann.</p>
            <p eId="para_4465">Is é bunphrionsabal an pholasaí phoiblí sa chás seo ná seasamh le ceart gach uile pháiste chun an churaclaim iomláin a rochtain ag an gcéim is luaithe. Seoladh an curaclam athbhreithnithe bunscoile i 1999 tar éis do chomhairle fhairsing a bheith glactha leis na comhpháirtithe oideachais.  Deireann leathanach 27 i Réamhrá  an Churaclaim: "It is a particular feature of Irish primary education that children, from the beginning of schooling, have experience of language  learning in two languages."  Leagann sé amach leis sin fráma ama íosta seachtainiúil don teagasc.  Forálann sé seo go mba cheart, áit a bhfuil céad teanga dá mhúineadh, go mbeadh ceithre huaire teagaisc ann in aghaidh na seachtaine, agus trí huaire in aghaidh na seachtaine áit a bhfuil lá níos giorra ann do ranganna na naíonán.    Áit a bhfuil an dara teanga dá mhúineadh is é an fráma ama íosta a mholtar ná 3.5 uaire sa tseachtain, agus 2.5 uaire do ranganna  naíonán a bhfuil la níos giorra acu.</p>
            <p eId="para_4466">Is gnáth-pholasaí poiblí é go bhfanfadh an scéal, mar a leagtar amach sa churaclam é, agus insna freagraí ar Cheisteanna Dála chun an Iar-Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta, gan athrú i.e. go gcloífí leis an bhfráma ama íosta a mholtar sa churaclam don dara teanga.  Dá réir sin, éilíonn Ciorclán 0044/2007 go soláthródh Gaelscoileanna, tráth nach déanaí ná tosach an dara téarma sa Naíonáin Sóisearacha, 3.5 den Bhéarla ar a laghad in aghaidh na seachtaine, nó 2.5 uaire in aghaidh na seachtaine áit a bhfuil lá níos giorra ann do ranganna na naíonán.</p>
            <p eId="para_4467">Machnaíodh cinneadh maidir leis an gceist seo a chur siar go dtí go mbeadh tionscadal taighde déanta chun a fháil amach cérbh é an tionchar a bhí ag cineálacha éagsúla tumoideachais ar chruthúnas na mac léinn.  Is dealraitheach go mbeadh taighde dá leithéid éigeantach os rud é go bhfuil an oiread sin athróg i gceist anseo (stádas socheacnamaíoch, cleachtas na scoile, éagsúlacht céad teanga ag na mic léinn sa bhaile).</p>

Tá Grád C ar a laghad ag Ardleibhéal sa Ghaeilge san Ardteistiméireacht riachtanach chun dul isteach in oiliúint do bhunmhúinteoirí in Éirinn.  Déanann iarrthóirí ar an gCúrsa Dioplóma Iarchéime scrúdú béil mar chuid den phróiseas roghnúcháin d'iontráil sa chúrsa; tá céim sa Ghaeilge ag an-chuid de na hiontrálaithe seo freisin.</p>

Ina theannta sin, tugann cuiditheoirí (is é sin comhairleoirí ón tSeirbhís Réigiúnach Tacaíochta don Churaclam), atá suite i lárionaid áitiúla oideachais, cuairt ar scoileanna chun tacú le múinteoirí agus comhairle a thabhairt ar ghach gné de churaclam na Gaeilge.  Gabhann 31 comhairleoirí leis an scéim Tús Maith agus tá siadsan ag leathnú oibre in-seirbhíse a rinneadh leis na  múinteoirí cheana sa Ghaeilge chun cur le hinniúlacht agus muinín na múinteoirí féin agus iad ag labhairt na Gaeilge chomh maith lena n-ábaltacht an teanga a mhúineadh.</p>
            <p eId="para_4493">Tá an fhianaise ann go bhfuil móran bunscoileanna báúil le comhtháthú na Gaeilge le múineadh achar eile den churaclam.  Tuairiscíonn níos mó ná ceathrú de na scoileanna i bhfoirmeacha bliantúla na staitisticí go n-úsáideann siad an Ghaeilge chun ábhar amháin nó níos mó ná sin a mhúineadh.</p>

Maidir le múinteoirí, tá raon leathan de thionscnaimh i bhfeidhm ag mo Roinnse, tríd an Rannóg Oiliúna Múinteoirí, chun chumais mhúinteoirí sa Ghaeilge a fheabhsú.  Ag leibhéal na hiarbhunscoile, bunaíodh seirbhís atá sainiúil don ábhar don Ghaeilge sa bhliain 2007.  Tá an tseirbhís mar chuid den tSeirbhís Tacaíochta Dara Leibhéal, a chuireann tacaíocht churaclaim atá sainiúil do chláir agus d'ábhair ar fáil, agus tacaíocht don teagasc agus foghlaim go ginearálta i scoileanna dara leibhéal.</p>

Ceann do phríomhaidhmeanna na seirbhíse is ea tacú leis an nGaeilge mar theanga chumarsáideach i scoileanna agus seomraí ranga. Dearadh an clár forbartha gairmiúla chun tábhacht na scileanna labhartha a chur chun cinn mar chuid dílis de na siollabais don Teastas Sóisearach agus don Ardteistiméireacht, ceadú do mhúinteoirí raon straitéisí teagaisc agus foghlama a fhorbairt a chothóidh cumas labhartha teanga, mar a mholadh in Imlitir 0042/2007, agus tógáil ar láidreachtaí an Churaclaim Leasaithe do Bhunscoileanna.</p>

            <p eId="para_4507">The Value for Money Review process is overseen by the Value for Money and Policy Review Central Steering Committee of the Department of Finance.  Seven Value for Money Reviews were selected by the Steering Committee for completion in 2006-08 — the Review of Programmes Managed by the Teacher Education Section, the Review of Youthreach and Senior Traveller Training Centres, the Review of Insurance Arrangements in Schools, the Review of the Summer Works Scheme, the Review of Special Needs Assistants, the Review of Expenditure on the Education of Persons who do not have English or Irish as a First Language and the Review of Grants to 1st and 2nd Level Schools.  The Review of Programmes Managed by Teacher Education Section and the Review of Youthreach and Senior Traveller Training Centres were published in April 2008.  Arrangements for consideration and implementation of the recommendations in each case are in place and progress will be reported on a quarterly basis to the Value for Money and Policy Review Central Steering Committee of the Department of Finance.  Work on the remaining reviews is progressing on the basis of a timetable agreed with the Department of Finance for completion of the 2006-08 programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4508">A number of other Value for Money Reviews have been published by my Department, including the Review of the ICT Undergraduate Skills Programme, the Review of Programmes managed by Teacher Education, the Review of Youthreach and Senior Traveller Training Centres, the Review of the Supply Teacher Scheme for Primary Schools and the Review of the Small and Rural Schools Initiative and the Permanent Accommodation Initiative.  A further two reviews will be published shortly — the Review of Youth Encounter Projects and the Review of ICT Support Services for Schools.  The Value for Money Review process is overseen by the Central Steering Committee of the Department of Finance.  Accordingly, Arrangements for the next round of reviews, which may cover the period 2009-11, are being considered by the that Committee.  The Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative commenced in 1997 (previously called the Expenditure Review Initiative).  Its objectives are to analyse Exchequer spending in a systematic manner and to provide a basis on which more informed decisions can be made.  It is one of a range of modernisation initiatives aimed at moving public sector management away from the traditional focus on inputs to concentrate more on the achievement of results.  Where possible, Value for Money Reviews in my Department are carried out by staff assigned to the IPA Masters in Economic Science in Policy Analysis degree programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4510">Teacher allocations to second level are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules relating to recognised pupil enrolment.  In general, a ratio of 18:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on established Junior Certificate, Leaving Certificate, repeat Leaving Certificate and Transition Year Programmes and a ratio of 16:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, Post Leaving Certificate courses and Leaving Certificate Applied.  The rules for allocating teaching posts provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet essential curricular commitments, my Department will consider applications for additional short-term support.  An independent Appeals Committee is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.  Significant improvements have been made in the staffing of our second level schools in recent years.  In the 2001-02 school year, there were approximately 24,477 wholetime equivalent teaching posts allocated to second level schools.  For 2006-07, the corresponding figure is 25,454 wholetime equivalent posts.  This increase in staffing has improved the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level in recent years.  The pupil teacher ratio has fallen from 13.85:1 in the 2001-02 school year to 13.13:1 in the 2006-07 school year.  Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching timetable and subject options including English, Irish and Maths having regard to pupils' needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation.  In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_4512">At present, a total of 450 local Home, School, Community Liaison (HSCL) co-ordinators provide HSCL services to 691 schools (370 Primary and 281 Post-Primary) throughout Ireland.  This number includes 80 posts which were provided in 2006 to extend HSCL services to all schools selected for inclusion in DEIS, the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion, that did not have such services.  My predecessor, Deputy Hanafin, also extended a commitment to schools not selected to participate in DEIS but already in the HSCL scheme, to continue to support these schools in their efforts to deal with educational disadvantage among their students in line with both their size and level of disadvantage.  The HSCL scheme is a major mainstream preventative strategy targeted at pupils at risk of not reaching their potential in the educational system because of background characteristics which tend to affect adversely pupil attainment and school retention.  The scheme is concerned with establishing partnership and collaboration between parents and teachers in the interests of children's learning.  It focuses directly on the salient adults in children's educational lives and seeks indirect benefits for the children themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_4513">Local HSCL co-ordinator posts are provided on a full-time or shared basis between schools and must be deployed to do full-time liaison duties.  For the first time, posts are shared across the two sectors — primary and post-primary — to facilitate local HSCL co-ordinators working with the families of disadvantaged children.  The local HSCL co-ordinator addresses the development of the parent-teacher relationship in collaboration with the local community in order to enhance the nurturing of the whole child.  This implies noting personal and leisure needs as well as the curricular and learning needs of parents so as to promote their self-worth and self-confidence.  The scheme also promotes the development of staff and teacher attitudes and behaviour so that the school becomes a place where all young people can reach their potential.  Local HSCL co-ordinators focus on adults, including parents, guardians and teachers, not on children.  The outcomes should positively impact over time on children's lives.  HSCL initiatives are concerned with promoting parents' education, development, growth and involvement; the participation of parents in their children's education including homework support; providing a parents' room and child care facilities for parents who attend programmes in the school; and developing principal and teacher attitudes towards partnership and a whole-school approach — parents and teachers are encouraged to collaborate in sharing their complementary skills, experiences and knowledge.  My Department has undertaken a full review of HSCL allocations and clustering arrangements in all schools participating in the scheme to ensure that all schools have a level of service which is commensurate with both the size of the school as well as its relative level of disadvantage.  Any modifications to the scheme arising from this review will be notified to schools by the end of August and will take effect from 1 September 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_4523">All primary and post-primary schools promote mutual respect and understanding of cultural, ethnic, racial, social and religious diversity.  The celebration of intercultural diversity is an important component of school life and is emphasised particularly in Social, Personal and Health Education, which is a mandatory part of the national curriculum in primary schools.  It is also emphasised in Civic, Social and Political Education which is an examinable subject taken by all junior cycle students in post-primary schools.  Senior cycle programmes in Politics and Society and in Social, Personal and Health education are being developed.  To assist primary and post-primary teachers and their pupils to have a better understanding of different cultures, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed Intercultural Guidelines.  The materials in the guidelines help schools to develop a more inclusive learning environment and provide students with the skills and knowledge to live and participate in our ever developing intercultural world.  The guidelines encourage teachers to integrate cultural issues right across the curriculum.  There are many opportunities to compare and contrast life in different countries throughout the primary and post-primary curriculum whether in geography, music, Social, Personal and Health Education or history.  These opportunities allow teachers and students to incorporate the intercultural perspective across the curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_4524">The Inspectorate of the Department is constantly carrying out whole school evaluations.  In addition, it is carrying out an evaluation of the provision of English as an Additional Language in a number of primary and post-primary schools.  A report on their evaluation will be prepared for mid-2009.  It will, <i>inter alia</i>, evaluate the inclusion of services for migrant students within the whole school planning process.  In October 2008, I will host a conference with the theme “Towards the Development of an Intercultural Education Strategy”.  This will be followed up by a number of focus groups with key stakeholders, including the education partners, to determine their views on Intercultural Education.  Based on all of the above, if it becomes evident that there is a need to change from the very inclusive education that is in existence I will consider such evidence.</p>

            <p eId="para_4532">Considerable progress has been made by my Department on the relevant recommendations in the Report on the National Task Force on Obesity.  Schools have worked on devising healthy lunches policies as part of Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) and Physical Education (PE).  The Post-Primary School Development Planning Initiative has a number of activities in place to promote healthy living in schools.  The SPHE Support Service offers support for policy development which includes Healthy Eating policies.  The Primary Curriculum Support Programme and the School Development Planning Support have prepared planning templates (with prompts) for schools to assist them in school planning for the implementation of the PE Curriculum and the wider aspects of physical activity and school sport.  In addition to the activities carried out by SDPI which I have outlined, programmes at post-primary level provided by the Social Personal and Health Education Support Service, the Junior Cycle Physical Education Support Service include a section on health-related activities, as does the Home Economics Support Service, which focuses on the Leaving Certificate syllabus.  The majority of schools currently participating in the School Completion Programme operate breakfast clubs or other meal provision, in accordance with the Nutritional Guidelines issued by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4533">In April 2007, the National Educational Welfare Board launched its equipment sponsorship of Cumann na mBunscol, which aims to promote the importance of sport in school life.  A special PE funding package of €6.5 million issued in 2006 to primary schools, and in 2007 a similar package of €3 million issued to post-primary schools.  Following the success of the pilot scheme, the Department of Agriculture and Food decided to rollout the Food Dudes programme on a national basis.  The programme will be rolled out to approximately 625 schools each year over a 5 year period and it is intended that every primary school in the country will be offered Food Dudes over this time.  The first wave of the national rollout began in April 2007 with a reduced block of 72 schools and from September 2007, 125 schools have been invited to participate in the programme at any one time.  The subjects Social, Personal and Health Education and Physical Education, cover, among elements of the syllabus, the areas of healthy eating, healthy lifestyle, physical health, body care, exercise, relaxation and diet. They are evaluated in schools by the inspectorate, using indicators specific to primary and to second-level schools as appropriate.  In the development of Whole School Evaluation, the inspectorate has sought to ensure that its inspection processes support the full implementation of SPHE at both primary and second-level.</p>

            <p eId="para_4563">I was approached last year by a private company requesting assistance under Major Emergency Management for the disposal of hazardous hydrogen cyanide cylinders.  The company wrote to me on a number of occasions outlining concerns regarding the cylinders, the importance of disposing of them appropriately and requesting the assistance of the Defence Forces in this regard.  The company was informed that the disposal of hazardous waste was not a matter for either the Department of Defence or the Defence Forces and that further correspondence should be channelled through the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_4564">The relevant authority in this matter is South Dublin County Council.  The Council proposes to use its statutory powers under the Waste Management Act, 1996, as amended, to dispose of the hazardous material.  The Defence Forces have been requested by the civil authority to assist in this matter by providing a suitable site for disposal and to provide explosives to be used in the destruction of the material.  I understand that plans to dispose of the material are being put in place by the local authority in consultation with the relevant State authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_4568">In June 2006 (S180/20/10/0839B), the Government approved a schedule of Value for Money and Policy Reviews for the period 2006-2008  replacing the previous Expenditure Review Initiative and strengthening the institutional arrangements underpinning this process.  Four reviews were scheduled for completion by the Department of Defence in this period. The Reviews and their current status are as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4569">1. A review of Maintenance of Aircraft in the Air Corps was published in July 2006.  The main findings of this review were that the efficiency and effectiveness of aircraft maintenance was being compromised by the age and diversity of the fleet that the Air Corps operated over the period of the review.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4570">The ongoing investment in Defence equipment has resulted in significant modernisation of the Air Corps fleet and has resulted in reduced fleet diversity.  Very significant improvements in logistical support for the modern aircraft types were put in place as part of the procurement contractual processes.  Power by the Hour contracts are in place with Pilatus, Eurocopter, Agusta Westland, Learjet and McAlpines (for the Garda helicopters).  These contracts improve the availability of spare parts for maintenance purposes. In two cases, Pilatus and Agusta Westland, the aircraft manufacturers have placed a consignment stock of spares in a bonded store at Baldonnel to maximise logistic efficiency.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4571">The ongoing infrastructure investment programme has seen improvements to the maintenance infrastructure. Other recommendations which focused on organisational matters, have been considered and implemented where appropriate.  It is anticipated that all these changes will significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of aircraft maintenance in the Air Corps.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4572">2. A review of Clothing Procurement in the Defence Forces was published in September 2007.  This review has identified potential for increased efficiency and effectiveness in the clothing storage and distribution system.  An implementation group, tasked with drawing up a detailed implementation plan has been established.  The anticipated improvement in inventory turnover ratios should decrease the volume of clothing stock on hand.  However, it is vitally important to ensure that the Defence Forces clothing needs continue to be met.  The optimisation of inventory levels and  the clothing distribution system are inextricably linked to supplier performance and the implementation group are considering this factor in their deliberations.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4573">3. A review of Naval Service Vessel Maintenance is currently being progressed.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4574">4. A review of Usage of Military Training Land is currently being progressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4575">It is anticipated that the outstanding reviews will be completed by end December 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4576">Arrangements for the next round of reviews, which may cover the period 2009-2011, are being considered by The Value for Money and Policy Review Central Steering Committee.</p>

            <p eId="para_4602">I have already indicated in response to Parliamentary Questions that the high level interdepartmental committee on multi-unit developments has been established to identify the legislative and administrative actions that should be taken in response to recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission on the matter.  The interdepartmental committee met on 7 occasions to consider the preliminary proposals which were set out in the Commission's Consultation Paper.  Since then the Committee has had its first meeting to consider the Commission's recommendations — 70 in total — that are contained in its Final Report that was published on 24 June last. The Committee is in the process of establishing a programme of work in response to the recommendations as a matter of priority.  The Commission's Report is a wide ranging document involving reforms across a broad range of policy areas including planning and development law, tax law, company law, the law relating to registration of ownership of land, the jurisdiction of the courts and other related areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_4603">My Department is already engaging with the Property Registration Authority/Land Registry to examine the recommendations made, for example, in relation to the registration of title for multi-unit developments.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is examining the recommendations for the strengthening of company law.  In so far as issues relating to consumer information and general awareness in the area of multi-unit developments are concerned the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has already welcomed the new publication launched by the National Consumer Agency to address the need for consumers to understand the issues around multi-unit developments.  This followed on from the work at the stakeholder forum on which his Department and other key organisations were represented.</p>
            <p eId="para_4604">I should also mention that the National Consumer Agency has agreed a Code of Practice for developers of multi-unit developments with the Irish Home Builders Association.  This Code outlines the responsibilities of developers regarding ownership, management and maintenance of common areas and the provision of common services within such developments.  It also addresses areas such as the establishment and operation of the management company, the use of property management agents, the calculation of service charges and establishment of a sinking fund.</p>

            <p eId="para_4606">Last year my predecessor as Minister helped launch the Group's first event, a Gaelic football competition, which I understand was very successful.  The Group involves members of a number of ‘blue-light' services, such as police, ambulance and fire services.  The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that responsibility for a number of these services fall within the ambit of other Ministerial colleagues.  However, my Department will write to the other Departments concerned to ask them to examine whether there are any sources of funding for which this Group would be eligible and to make direct contact with its representatives.  My Department will conduct a similar exercise itself.</p>

            <p eId="para_4619">Following the shooting of Aiden McAnespie the Government requested an inquiry be carried out into the fatal shooting and the circumstances surrounding it.  The then Deputy Garda Commissioner Eugene Crowley was appointed to carry out the inquiry.</p>
            <p eId="para_4620">The inquiry was conducted on the basis that statements made by witnesses who came forward would be treated as confidential and their identities would not be revealed. For that reason the report, which was submitted to the then Minister for Justice in 1989, was not made available to any other party.</p>
            <p eId="para_4621">However, having regard to the wishes of the McAnespie family, in 2002 the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform released to the family a fair and accurate summary of the Crowley report. It was not considered realistic to release the report in any other form, either edited or with redactions, as the degree of editing that would be necessary to anonymise the report would be such as to be impracticable, particularly as it would require much more than the mere omission of names to prevent a breach of the commitment given not to reveal the identity of witnesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_4622">Furthermore the final report on the post-mortem conducted by Dr. Harbison, State Pathologist at the time, was also made available to the family.</p>
            <p eId="para_4623">It remains the position that the report cannot be released as to do so would breach the assurances of confidentiality given at the time.</p>

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 21 May 2004, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned and will be fully considered, under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, before the file is passed to me for decision.</p>

On 8th April 2008 the person referred to was arrested following an attempted burglary in Newcastle West, Co. Limerick. He was remanded in custody and was sentenced at Bruff District Court on 1st May 2008.  The court imposed two consecutive terms of three months imprisonment, suspended on certain conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4678">On 5th May 2008, the person referred to was again arrested in Macroom Co. Cork for offences contrary to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and Immigration Regulations. This man was committed to Cork Prison on 7 May, 2008 on foot of a warrant issued at Listowel District Court to commence the six month prison sentence. He received an additional 2 month sentence on 21 May, 2008 in Macroom District Court for the offences for which he was arrested on the 5th May, 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4679">This person was granted temporary release for one week on 4 June, 2008 subject to conditions including a requirement to sign on daily at a Garda station, to reside at a particular address, to keep the peace and to be of sober habits. He returned to the prison on 11 June, 2008 where he was again granted a period of temporary release consisting of one week's duration. He failed to return to custody as required and was deemed "at large" on 18 June, 2008. The Gardaí were subsequently notified of his status and he is therefore liable to arrest and immediate return to prison custody.</p>

            <p eId="para_4684">Following the submission of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda Síochána. The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. Crime statistics are provided by the CSO for the period beginning 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_4685">I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.  The figures for public order offences recorded for each Garda Division in the years 2000 to 2002 are available in the relevant Garda Annual Reports, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas library.</p>
            <p eId="para_4686">One of the priorities set for the Garda authorities for 2008, under the Garda Síochána Act 2005, is to combat, in cooperation with other agencies and the community generally, the problems of public disorder with particular emphasis on alcohol related behaviour (including under age drinking) and socially disadvantaged communities especially through utilisation of the legal mechanisms being made available, including behaviour warnings and closure orders.</p>
            <p eId="para_4687">Strong provisions are already in place to combat anti-social behaviour. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 modernised the law in this regard. Furthermore, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 contains provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order.  In addition, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides the Garda with powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.</p>
            <p eId="para_4688">The Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008 is currently before the House. The Bill contains a number of important reforms of the licensing laws and public order legislation, with the aim of addressing the adverse consequences of alcohol abuse in our society.  The measures being proposed are a balanced response to problems caused by excessive alcohol consumption and binge drinking.</p>
            <p eId="para_4689">Current policing policy in the area concerned is predicated on the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property and drug-related crime, the prevention of public order offences and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of the residents. Specific initiatives and special operations are put in place when analysis of criminal behaviour and crime trends indicate that such measures are necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_4722">While these are the numbers of Gardaí specifically assigned to community policing, it is of course the case that all Gardaí have a role to play in addressing community policing issues.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within the Garda Síochána, and I agree with the view of the Garda Inspectorate, expressed in its most recent report, that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland. The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day personnel strengths of individual divisions, districts and stations may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4723">It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking all relevant factors into account.  In that regard, the needs of the Garda Stations referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.</p>

In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply, by a specified date, for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_4733">The report of the Value for Money (VFM) review of Asylum and Immigration was published on my Department's website in November 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_4734">The Review was carried out during a period of significant change, a key feature of which was falling numbers of asylum applications in the State and very significant increases in numbers for other immigration services. The review involved a combination of, inter alia, financial and business analysis, resource mapping and allocation modelling and performance management. The outcome of the review was a comprehensive series of recommendations clustered around nine key areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_4735">A unique feature of the review was that it was a dynamic constantly evolving process. As recommendations were agreed, the implementation cycle also began. This meant that by the end of the Review, all of the recommendations had been accepted and implemented or were at early stages of implementation. A key driver in the implementation of these recommendations was the establishment of the Irish Naturalisation &amp; Immigration Service (INIS) in early 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_4736">A framework for the ongoing implementation of the recommendations arising from the Review has been in place since early 2007 in the form of a major Change Management initiative.  This initiative included the establishment of a dedicated Change Management Unit in February 2007.  The work of the Unit involves the co-ordination of the INIS Change Management Programme under the direction of a Change Management Project Board.  The Change Management Project Board is chaired by the Director General of the INIS and includes the senior management of all agencies/ divisions in INIS.  The key drivers of the change programme are:</p>
            <p eId="para_4737">the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008;</p>
            <p eId="para_4738">IT developments;</p>
            <p eId="para_4739">structural changes to INIS business units and procedures arising from the Bill, increased business volumes and the need to improve staff development and customer services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4740">Six project teams have been established to support the implementation of the Change Management Programme as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_4741">1. Immigration Policy and Operations</p>
            <p eId="para_4742">2. Single Procedure Transition Team</p>
            <p eId="para_4743">3. Shared Services and Structures</p>
            <p eId="para_4744">4. Communications and Training</p>
            <p eId="para_4745">5. Removals Policy and Operations</p>
            <p eId="para_4746">6. IT and Interoperability</p>
            <p eId="para_4747">The Project Teams report to the Change Management Project Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_4748">With regard to the Deputy's specific query concerning the recommendations in the VFM Report on the asylum system and the actions taken to date to implement them, the position is as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_4749">Recommendation 1.</p>
            <p eId="para_4750">Redeploy staff from the asylum agencies into DJELR Visa, Immigration and Citizenship. Staff may be redeployed due to a 40% reduction in the volume of asylum applications between 2003 and 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_4751">Actions to date: The Report set out a framework for the re-deployment of some 140 posts from the asylum area to other immigration functions such as visa processing, citizenship services and repatriation. This strategy for the movement of large numbers of staff to address changing demands for the various services provided by the INIS — which is indicated by a fall in asylum numbers and an increase in demands for other immigration services — has been ongoing for some time now.  Over 120 posts have been transferred to date from the asylum area to the broader immigration function.</p>
            <p eId="para_4752">Recommendation 2.</p>
            <p eId="para_4753">Introduce a Shared Corporate Services to provide the necessary corporate support for the immigration and asylum areas in the Department, ORAC, RAT and RIA.</p>
            <p eId="para_4754">Actions to date: INIS has established a Corporate Support Division to deal with accommodation, finance and personnel matters, management information and co-ordination functions. It is intended to bring all corporate support matters in ORAC and RAT under its control in due course having particular regard to the proposed new processing framework in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008.  Under the Bill, which is currently at Committee Stage in this House, the functions currently carried out by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) will be subsumed into the INIS.  The Bill also provides for the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to be replaced by a statutory independent Protection Review Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_4755">IT services for INIS have also been centralised in the Department's IT Division with policy matters on IT developments being handled by relevant Divisions in INIS.  The support of the new AISIP (Asylum and Immigration Strategic Integration Programme) IT System is also being planned with a shared services ethos in mind. The Department's IT Division will be the hub for these services, which will include upgrading centralised management reporting services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4756">Recommendation 3.</p>
            <p eId="para_4757">Establish a central source for the Country of Origin (COI) information supply, further consolidate research activities and performance improvement across the agencies and DJELR.</p>
            <p eId="para_4758">Action to date: It has been decided that the Refugee Documentation Centre (RDC) which operates under the auspices of the Legal Aid Board will act as the central COI source for the INIS.</p>
            <p eId="para_4759">A new Country of Origin Document and Library Management System has been developed to enhance the operational capacity of the RDC as part of the AISIP Project (Recommendation 7).  This new system was launched in September 2007. The system enables users to view the RDC library catalogue, COI documents and published ‘anonymised' queries from their desktop via a single user interface.</p>
            <p eId="para_4760">Recommendation 7.</p>
            <p eId="para_4761">Provide a single view of the client through an integrated case management, workflow and scanning system for the entire process of immigration and asylum.</p>
            <p eId="para_4762">Actions to date: The contract for the development of a new case management system for the asylum and immigration areas (project name AISIP — Asylum and Immigration Strategic Integration Programme) has been signed and work has commenced.  The key modules in the AISIP System are:</p>
            <p eId="para_4763">A Case Management System</p>
            <p eId="para_4764">An Accommodation Management System</p>
            <p eId="para_4765">A Country of Origin and Library Information System</p>
            <p eId="para_4766">A File Tracking System</p>
            <p eId="para_4767">These modules will be integrated so as to provide an immediate overview of any case.  Consequently, details of a case from one end of a process right through to the other end will be available (for example from asylum to refugee status to citizenship).  The delivery of the AISIP Project will greatly enhance the business capacity and the effectiveness of the INIS.  INIS will be moving from a number of aging, unlinked systems to a modern user-friendly integrated IT system.  The new system will ensure that INIS will have the ability to handle increasing workloads more efficiently, that more informed security decisions can be made and enhanced customer service delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_4768">Development work commenced on 1 January, 2007 and since then the Country of Origin and Library Management System has been rolled out to the Refugee Documentation Centre (Recommendation 3). The planned roll-out of the entire system is due by the end of 2009, which includes the development of new modules for the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4769">Recommendation 8.</p>
            <p eId="para_4770">Adopt a single procedure for all protection and other issues including a streamlined removals process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4771">Actions to date: The introduction of a single protection procedure for the processing of applications to remain in the State whether as a refugee, a person eligible for subsidiary protection or on any other grounds is included in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008. This approach will replace the present multi-layered process which considers refugee matters first and then, as part of a whole new process, issues associated with leave to remain in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_4772">A dedicated Single Procedure Transition Team has been established to ensure that the planned new Applications Processing Office within INIS which will replace the ORAC will be able to implement the protection aspects of the Bill after enactment.  The Transition Team has made considerable progress in the preparations to date for the implementation of the Bill.  Draft procedures for the processing of cases under the new Single Application Procedure and training materials are under development along with documentation for protection applicants such as questionnaires, standard letters, information notices, etc to support the implementation of the new procedure.</p>
            <p eId="para_4773">With regard to the other recommendations in the VFM Report relating to the broader immigration area, viz:</p>
            <p eId="para_4774">Recommendation 4.</p>
            <p eId="para_4775">Introduce a dedicated Service Development team in DJELR to progress critical organisational initiatives such as implementing key change initiatives, developing guidelines governing critical processes, designing and implementing management processes for performance and service improvement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4776">Recommendation 5.</p>
            <p eId="para_4777">Make Organisational adjustments within DJELR to strengthen capacity with regard to operations and policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_4778">Recommendation 6.</p>
            <p eId="para_4779">Develop a focused Customer Service Model within DJELR.</p>
            <p eId="para_4780">Recommendation 9.</p>
            <p eId="para_4781">Co-ordinate activities on immigration through the formation of a new institutional structure, INIS.</p>
            <p eId="para_4782">In respect of which other initiatives have already been taken within INIS, the Deputy might like to be aware that the Project Teams established under the INIS Change Management Programme have been tasked with:</p>
            <p eId="para_4783">the identification and implementation of the business processes and organisational structures arising under the Immigration Residence and Protection Bill 2008;</p>
            <p eId="para_4784">the establishment of INIS-wide shared services opportunities such as those in the areas of judicial review, customer service and family reunification arising under the 2008 Bill and the AISIP project;</p>
            <p eId="para_4785">the development and implementation of communications and training strategies and the identification, and</p>
            <p eId="para_4786">consideration of the opportunities available to optimise the integration of INIS IT systems and the IT requirements arising under the 2008 Bill and other legislative instruments.</p>
            <p eId="para_4787">It is within this framework that all of the Recommendations contained in the VFM report will continue to be progressed in order to support the future delivery of asylum and immigration services in an integrated fashion.</p>
            <p eId="para_4788">The cost of completing the Value for Money Review on Asylum and Immigration was €146,867 (VAT inclusive).</p>

            <p eId="para_4829">The Immigration Act 2003, which was commenced on the 15th September 2003, contained a number of key changes to the Refugee Act, 1996 which enabled the processing of asylum applications to be speeded up and enhanced our ability to deal with abusive applications. These changes included the imposition on applicants of a clear statutory duty to actively pursue their asylum applications and co-operate at all times with the processing agencies or face having their applications deemed withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_4830">The most common reasons for an application to be deemed withdrawn are where an applicant fails to attend for an interview at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) without reasonable cause; an applicant fails to co-operate with the Refugee Applications Commissioner after having lodged his or her application; or an applicant fails to notify the Commissioner of his or her postal address or change of address.</p>
            <p eId="para_4831">Since the commencement of the Immigration Act, 2003 recommendations are made by the ORAC to the Minister that an application should be deemed withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_4832">Statistics are not maintained in a way which distinguishes between applications deemed withdrawn on the basis of applicants failing to notify the Refugee Applications Commissioner of their postal address or change of address and applications deemed withdrawn for other reasons.</p>

            <p eId="para_4886">The Deputy might note that each case is considered individually and regardless of whether or not written representations are submitted by, or on behalf of, the applicant. Following a detailed examination of each individual case, including a consideration having regard to Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, a recommendation is made as to whether a Deportation Order should be issued or temporary Leave to Remain in the State granted.</p>
            <p eId="para_4887">At present, 8,915 such cases are recorded as awaiting decision. However, this figure  includes around 1,600 cases where applications for Subsidiary Protection in the State have been submitted by the same persons. Where an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State has been submitted in addition to an application for leave to remain, the Subsidiary Protection application must first be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_4888">Indications are that many of those whose cases are still awaiting decision may already have left the State without notifying my Department of their having done so while others will have submitted other applications for residency e.g. applications for permission to remain in the State on the basis of their marriage to an Irish or EU National.  Decisions on these applications must be finalised before their applications for leave to remain in the State can be finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_4889">The Deputy will appreciate that the consideration of applications for leave to remain in the State is a resource intensive process. It is not, however, possible to provide an average waiting time for the processing of such applications, primarily because no two applications will be the same in terms of their complexity.</p>
            <p eId="para_4890">The following table sets out the other statistical information requested by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_4954">Data which would enable regulatory or compliance costs for the business sector, as referred to in the question, to be established are not currently available.  My Department, however, is represented on the cross-Departmental High Level Group on Business Regulation, chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment which is tasked with taking concrete measures to reduce administrative burdens in five specific regulatory areas (including the environment), based primarily on suggestions put forward by the business sector. It is planned that a report on progress made by the group will be prepared for Government by the end of July 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4955">At an EU level, the European Council agreed at its meeting in March 2007 that reducing administrative burdens was an important measure for boosting Europe's economy, especially through its impact on SMEs. The Council agreed, therefore, that administrative burdens arising from EU legislation should be reduced by 25% by 2012.  My Department has been working with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in contributing to this project.</p>
            <p eId="para_4956">In addition, arising from a Government decision in March 2008, Ireland has also set a national target of 25% for the reduction in the administrative burden on businesses arising from domestic regulations. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is coordinating the process and is currently finalising the approach and methodology for all Departments to implement the Government decision.</p>

         further to Parliamentary Question No. 905 of 17 June 2008, the way he can issue statistics regarding targets under the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2007 in view of the fact that the information regarding the number of major producers that comply with their producer responsibility obligations under the self-compliance method and the amount of waste dealt with through this system is not available in his Department and is only held by local authorities; his views on whether his Department should have access to this information; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4960">National waste statistics for all waste streams, including packaging waste, are independently produced and published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  National Waste Reports have been published in respect of the years 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004 and 2006 with interim reports published for 2002, 2003 and 2005 respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_4961">In the case of packaging waste specifically, national statistics are compiled by combining information about packaging waste obtained through audited surveys of local authorities, recycling organisations, landfill annual environmental reports, industry and the application of composition factors derived from municipal waste characterisation surveys.  In addition, the EPA liaises with Repak on an ongoing basis to cross-check the reported recovery of packaging waste collected in Ireland for the purposes of recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_4962">Notwithstanding the position as set out above, Ireland is required under Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste to report in a prescribed format to the European Commission on an annual basis in relation to the recovery and recycling of packaging waste in Ireland.  Data in the prescribed format are submitted each year by my Department to the appropriate authorities in the Commission — the statistical data in Ireland's annual packaging reports are provided by the EPA and are derived, in the main, from that published in the associated National Waste Report.</p>

            <p eId="para_4964">The National Development Plan (NDP) 2000-2006 identified the five cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford as existing gateways to be key regional growth centres for future regional investment and development.  In addition, the NDP recommended the preparation of a national spatial strategy to inform future investment decisions, secure more balanced regional development and facilitate sustainable development in economic, social and environmental terms.  The National Spatial Strategy (NSS) 2002-2020 identified these existing gateways together with a further four new national level gateways of Sligo, Dundalk, Letterkenny and Athlone/Tullamore/Mullingar as strategically located gateway cities and towns to act as economic drivers for their wider regions, and nine hub towns to link those gateway regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4965">Since the launch of the NSS in 2002 a significant and diverse range of implementation measures have been undertaken, including the establishment of NSS implementation structures, the adoption in 2004 of Regional Planning Guidelines (RPGs) and alignment during 2005 and 2006 of all City and County Development Plans with the RPGs ensuring a hierarchy of consistent plans are in place ranging from national to local level.  This integrated planning framework sets a critical context within which more specific NSS implementation activities can take place.</p>
            <p eId="para_4966">My Department has undertaken and commissioned extensive research to support the development of the NSS Gateways and Hubs, and has published two studies that comprehensively set out development issues and investment priorities in each of these locations.  The two reports, the Gateway Investment Priorities Study (2006) and the NSS Hubs — Development Issues and Challenges (2007), which are both available on my Department's website — www.environ.ie, provide detailed descriptions of the current status of each of the gateways and hubs and the progress being made to accelerate their growth, identify development issues and challenges associated with these strategic locations and make recommendations to support and advance their future growth.  These findings and key recommendations are now being prioritised in the development plans for these cities and towns.</p>
            <p eId="para_4967">In addition the National Development Plan 2007-2013 attaches a high priority to more balanced regional development and to securing progress on the various infrastructure projects identified as essential to enhance the competitiveness of the Gateways informed by the Gateway Investment Priorities Study.</p>
            <p eId="para_4968">In tandem with the NDP annual reporting and monitoring, an NSS monitoring framework is being developed to identify how investments are being prioritised and to assess how well the NSS is working in practice, both in terms of policy alignment and key outputs achieved.</p>

            <p eId="para_5024">The intake of new appeal cases in 2007 increased by over 12% compared to 2006.

            <p eId="para_5026">In recognition of the key role the Board plays in relation to delivery of local and national infrastructure, the demands arising from sustained record levels of appeals over recent years and the implementation of the 2006 Act, sanction was given in 2007 for a considerable increase in the Board's staffing resources.  The total authorized staff complement has increased by 26% to 172, while Board membership rose from 10 to 11 with the appointment of an additional temporary Board member.</p>
            <p eId="para_5027">The Board has expressed confidence that with a lower intake of cases this year, the increased resources made available and other measures to improve productivity, considerable progress will be made over 2008 towards achieving the strategic target of determining appeal cases within an 18-week period.</p>

            <p eId="para_5033">Following the announcement on 19 May 2008 that the project in question would not now be going ahead as planned, my Department and Dublin City Council have met on a number of occasions to examine the options available for ensuring that this regeneration can proceed.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_5044">I propose to take Questions Nos. 570, 574 and 586 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5045">Under the terms of the Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant Schemes, my Department recoups 66% of the expenditure on individual grants to local authorities.  Information on local authority activity under the schemes in 2006 is published in my Department's Annual Housing Statistics Bulletin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library and on my Department's website, www.environ.ie; comparable data for last year will be contained in the 2007 Annual Bulletin to be published shortly.  The administration of the Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant Schemes, including the processing of individual applications, is a matter for individual local authorities.  All applications received under the Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant Schemes prior to 1 November 2007 are being dealt with under the terms of those schemes and local authorities are encouraged to process the remaining applications in a sympathetic and flexible manner, having regard to the needs of the applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_5046">Following my Department's review of the Schemes, a revised framework of grant aid was implemented in November 2007 to assist older people and people with a disability with their accommodation needs.  One of the primary aims of the review was to streamline the administrative and operational procedures governing the schemes thereby ensuring that applicants would not be subject to undue delays in accessing grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_5047">The revised Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability, which replaced the old Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant Schemes, provide for systems of medical prioritisation, standardisation of costs, flexibility regarding quotations and improved arrangements for the use of Occupational Therapists and access to contractors.  These mechanisms enable authorities to manage the schemes efficiently and to tackle any backlogs of applications which may have built up.</p>
            <p eId="para_5048">Combined capital allocations of €1,343,550 and €1,308,060 were notified to South Tipperary County Council and Clare County Council, respectively, on 21 May 2008 for the operation of the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability in private houses in 2008.  The revised schemes are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department, together with 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  It is a matter for local authorities to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each of the schemes, from within the combined allocation notified to them by my Department, and to manage the operation of the schemes in their area from within this allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5049">Requests for additional funding for the operation of the schemes are dealt with in the context of the reallocation of surplus resources from other local authorities and, as such, allocations provided to local authorities are generally revised during the course of the year where expenditure is higher or lower than anticipated.  Applications for additional funding from authorities will be considered by my Department in the light of any savings emerging later in the year in other local authority areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_5050">The most recent information received from South Tipperary County Council regarding activity under the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability at 12 June 2008, is set out as follows.</p>

            <p eId="para_5060">Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Retail Planning were published by my Department in January 2005.  These Guidelines reviewed and revised the 2000 Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Retail Planning and dealt in detail with retail warehouses, i.e. those premises which sell bulky household goods.  The Guidelines were issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 which requires planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála to have regard to them in the performance of their functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5061">Annex 1 to the Guidelines contains a glossary of terms and, inter alia, states that retail bulky goods are goods generally sold from retail warehouses where DIY goods or goods such as flatpack furniture are of such a size that they would normally be taken away by car and not be manageable by customers travelling by foot, cycle or bus, or that large floor areas would be required to display them e.g. furniture in room sets, or goods though not large themselves, which would where part of a collective purchase be bulky e.g. wallpaper or paint.</p>
            <p eId="para_5062">The Guidelines also state that a retail warehouse is a single-level store specialising in the sale of bulky household goods catering mainly for car-borne customers and often in out-of-centre locations.</p>

This form of performance based procurement is intended to encourage innovative technical solutions and to produce greater efficiency and cost effectiveness in both the construction and operational phases.  Management of the contract, when placed, will be a matter for the local authority.  The provision of the Wastewater Treatment Plant was taken into account in the Greater Dublin Strategic Drainage Study.</p>

Tenders for the collection network contracts under the Lower Liffey Valley Sewerage Scheme were received prior to 6 May 2008 and accordingly this contract may now proceed.

            <p eId="para_5209">The establishment of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PTRB) has provided a strong regulatory framework for the private rented residential sector. Since its establishment, the Board has achieved considerable success in the registration of tenancies, with in excess of 220,000 tenancies now registered, compared to no more than 30,000 under the previous system of registration.</p>
            <p eId="para_5210">The PRTB has a function of reviewing the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and of making recommendations for the amendment of the Act and any other related enactments, where this is considered necessary. The PRTB has recently identified possible amendments to the Act that may enhance the Board's operations, and these are being considered by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5211">The operation of the dispute resolution service under the 2004 Act is the responsibility of the PRTB itself, given its independent statutory status under the Act. I am conscious that an efficiently operating disputes resolution system is a central part of the Board's work.  I understand that the PRTB is currently reviewing its operations and processes in the context of developing a new Corporate Plan, within which priority attention will be given to the optimisation of all aspects of the Board's work, including its disputes resolution service.  Having fully provided for the funding of the PRTB's activities each year since its establishment in 2004 and having also recently secured a significant increase in the Board's permanent staff from 26 to 40, which is the full complement requested, I am satisfied that the resources now in place are sufficient to allow the Board to address issues arising from its Corporate Plan and discharge its functions efficiently and effectively.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnGormley" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_1086">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_5235">I propose to answer question Nos. 598 and 599 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5236">Irish Ispat went into liquidation in June 2001, having been in difficulty for some time. Initially, the liquidator took over the company's lease on lands and foreshore at Haulbowline Island, Cobh, Co Cork. The State, acting through the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in a co-ordinating role, took over custody of the site from the liquidator in June 2003, as mandated by Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_5237">The mandate required the Department to co-ordinate all legal actions in relation to the site and to cover issues such as ongoing site security, maintenance and other such issues arising once the site was vacated by the liquidator, and also to enable a site investigation to be carried out to assist in determining the best option, environmentally and economically, for site remediation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5238">Steelworks have operated on Haulbowline since 1939 and at a time when such industrial activities were poorly regulated. Inevitably, the nature of the activity generated very large quantities of hazardous wastes which were dumped on the island in an area which became known as the East Tip.</p>
            <p eId="para_5239">Since 2004 the Department in complying with its mandate from Government has: coordinated all legal actions in relation to the site; carried out a comprehensive site investigation; set-up ongoing environmental monitoring; decontaminated and demolished the steelworks buildings; and arranged for a site surface clearance contract with Hammond Lane Metal Company Ltd.</p>
            <p eId="para_5240">These steps have now brought the site to a position where the Government can make an informed decision as to its future use and where a detailed risk assessment of the entire site with recommendations for the appropriate remediation required can be undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_5241">The particular issue which has arisen relates to the uncovering by a sub-contractor of sub-surface waste. Sub-surface excavation of waste was not part of the Department's contract with Hammond Lane Ltd. Owing to the potential extent and nature of the waste, a lack of clarity around the minimum works required to remove it, the potentially wide range of practical measures which might be necessary to remove the risk of pollution and the fact that removal or remedial works conducted in a piecemeal fashion might itself cause environmental pollution, it was the considered view of the Department, following consultations with the Environmental Protection Agency and Cork County Council, that the required course of action in the short term would be to cap the exposed waste with inert slag material. As stated a detailed risk assessment of the entire site will be necessary once it is vacated on completion of the site surface clearance contract and when the Government has decided on the proposed future use of the site.</p>
            <p eId="para_5242">This was not acceptable to one of Hammond Lane's sub-contractors which expressed concern that liability might accrue to it as a consequence of any impact which the disturbed material might cause. By way of reassurance, and in the context of the then proximity of the end of the planned surface clearance works, the Department wrote to the contractor on 18 April 2008 advising that the back-filling approach was what was required. It was stated that the management of the area which had been disturbed would fall to be determined by the Government in the context of the pending decision on the overall future of the site and the resultant more comprehensive remediation which might be required. The contractor was also assured that it would not be expected to accept future liability.</p>
            <p eId="para_5243">Despite these assurances and repeated instructions to stop unauthorised works relating to the sub-surface waste, including by letter from the Chief State Solicitor on 23 May 2008, the sub-contractor refused to leave the site and continued to operate without authorisation and in a piecemeal fashion causing a potential threat to the environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5244">Following legal advices the contract with Hammond Lane Metal Company Ltd. was terminated with immediate effect on 30 May 2008, with instructions to vacate the site by 17.00 hours Tuesday, 3 June 2008. The sub-contractors still refused to vacate the site and continued to operate without authorisation. They only finally left the site following discussions with the main contractor, Hammond Lane Metal Company Ltd, the only company with which the Department had a contractual relationship. The Department has engaged consultants to carry out an independent and rigorous assessment of site conditions following the extensive unauthorised works by the sub-contractors. This assessment, which will begin in the coming week, will involve analysis of soil, slag, dust, surface and ground water samples for all likely contaminants, including heavy metals such as chromium.</p>
            <p eId="para_5245">The consultants previously carried out an extensive intrusive site investigation in 2005 which indicated no evidence of any immediate threat to human health or the environment and they are best suited to determine the best way forward in securing the site from an environmental and health and safety point of view in the short term, and pending a Government decision on its future use.</p>
            <p eId="para_5246">Test results will be assessed against baseline data from the previous investigation which was carried out between August and October 2005 and in the course of which 35 boreholes were drilled on the site and a further 4 offshore. A total of 34 trial pits were also excavated across the site. Geotechnical and environmental samples were taken for a pre-determined suite of analyses. Environmental and geotechnical samples were collected from both the trial pits and the boreholes. Marine sediments and two rounds of groundwater and gas samples were also taken for analysis.</p>
            <p eId="para_5247">The Department is currently finalising a report to update the Government on the outcome of the extensive site investigation and the interim works carried out since 2004. Decisions by Government on the future use of the site will determine the level and extent of further remediation required.</p>
            <p eId="para_5248">My Department and other relevant agencies are properly engaged in the management of this legacy site in a manner which is consistent with good practice and minimisation of risk to human health and the environment.  A coherent overall approach rather than piecemeal action, which could inadvertently cause problems to the local community and the environment, must be taken and that is the objective being pursued by my Department.</p>

After the measurement of the priority areas, Departments will review the situation to see how the 25% reduction can best be achieved.  In that context, my Department, along with other Departments, will begin the process by drawing up a list of relevant legislation operating under its aegis, which imposes a burden on the business sector.</p>

         the position regarding the pilot grant scheme for people who wish to insulate their homes including those who can apply for this grant; the number of grants that have been made to date; the amount of money that has been set aside for this scheme; and the amount that was spent to date.

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_1089">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5338">I launched the Pilot Home Energy Saving Scheme in April with a budget of €5 million for 2008.  The Scheme is designed to incentivise homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of their homes, thus reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.  The Scheme is primarily aimed at older housing stock which is likely to be most in need of energy efficiency retrofitting.  The Pilot Scheme is being administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), together with two local energy agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_5339">The Scheme is operating on a pilot basis this year in three geographical areas — North Tipperary, Dundalk and an area encompassing Counties Clare and Limerick (excluding Limerick City).  Over one thousand applications were received by the closing date of 30 May.  Applications for the fourth module of the Scheme are being invited shortly and the fourth module is not geographically limited and will focus primarily on incentivising a clustered approach including groups of houses and estates, with the objective of achieving economies of scale.  This module is expected to add up to a further thousand homes to the Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5340">Each applicant household is being assigned a Building Energy Rating (BER) assessor to provide a BER rating on the house and advise on the works that need to be carried out to improve its energy efficiency.  Assessments will commence in the coming weeks.  Some 60 registered BER assessors have been appointed to work on the Scheme and have been provided with special training by SEI.  Each householder is required to pay a €100 contribution towards the cost of the BER assessment, with the scheme subsidising the majority of the cost.  A BER assessor's advice will relate to the need for improved attic and wall insulation, more energy efficient glazing, better heating controls and a range of other energy efficiency improvement works.</p>
            <p eId="para_5341">Grants of up to 30% of the cost of works recommended by the BER assessor are available under the Scheme, subject to an overall payment threshold of €2,500 for individual applicant homes and lower levels for clustered applications.  The cost of works for clustered applications is expected to be lower because of the economies of scale.</p>
            <p eId="para_5342">There are no restrictions on eligibility for the Pilot Scheme, other than the geographical boundaries of the three pilot areas.  If more applications under the four modules are received than can be accommodated, a form of selection process will be implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_5343">Preliminary estimates from SEI show that a household participating in the pilot scheme could save up to €500 in energy bills every year as a result of the energy efficiency investments undertaken.  The pilot scheme is expected to result in reduced CO2 emissions of 6,000 tonnes per year, while the full €100 million scheme envisaged in the Programme for Government could be expected to yield CO2 savings of 175,000 tonnes per year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5344">A decision in relation to the roll-out of the Scheme nationally from 2009 will be made in light of the results of the Pilot Scheme and overall budgetary considerations.</p>
