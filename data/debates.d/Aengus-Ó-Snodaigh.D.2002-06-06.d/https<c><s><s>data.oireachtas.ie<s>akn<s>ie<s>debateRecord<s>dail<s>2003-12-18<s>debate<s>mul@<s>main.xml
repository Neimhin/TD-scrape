My understanding was that he was not to make his festive remarks until the close of business this evening. It is in that context that I seek to amend the Order of Business as proposed, namely, that the Dáil should sit for an extra 30 minutes to allow for an explanation from the Taoiseach in respect of confusion that exists about allegations of interference with an enforcement process in County Roscommon. I propose that the Dáil should extend its sitting time until 5.15 p.m. today for that purpose.</p>

If the Taoiseach cannot get back to the House, the Minister may well speak for him but it is important that we do not let the House rise for the Christmas recess with a cloud hanging over it in terms of the ethics of the Taoiseach's behaviour regarding the Roscommon issue. It is important for the Taoiseach, and the Office of the Taoiseach, that the matter be clarified and that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government fill us in on the Planning and Development Act which does not have legal effect in the sections we are talking about to date.</p>

          <p eId="para_34">I wish to oppose it as I did on Tuesday on the series of motions regarding EU regulations covering the whole area of biometric data. The matters involved are of such serious import that they should have been addressed on the floor of this House. They were moved without debate on the floor of this Chamber on Tuesday to committee yesterday where they only had the engagement of one Deputy in real and substantive questioning on the matters concerned. They are coming back to us here this morning where again it is proposed that there will be no debate on the floor of this Chamber. They are a serious set of proposals that will not only have far-reaching consequences for the citizens of third countries seeking new opportunity within the European Union borders but can have spin-off consequences for the citizens of the European Union, particularly our State.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">There is an absolute responsibility on us not to allow measures such as this that have potentially grave consequences for the civil rights of citizens to be agreed without proper scrutiny and debate. I regret to say that the Government's approach to these matters is tantamount to a suppression of public debate and scrutiny on matters that need to be brought to the attention of all citizens. This set of proposals is unacceptable and we will oppose them accordingly.</p>

There is no point pretending this Chamber is a factory producing widgets and parliamentary parties need to prepare for the Dáil term. However, I profoundly object to its being a week of Fridays. The Order Paper states that there will be no Order of Business, no Leaders' Questions, oral and written questions shall not be taken, Private Members' business shall not be taken, matters shall not be raised under the provisions of Standing Orders 21(3) or 31 and the taking of any divisions shall be postponed. This does a disservice to the Dáil and compounds the often ill-informed criticism of how the Dáil orders its business. The Minister should reconsider. If the Dáil is reconvening on 20 January, it should do so in the usual manner with an Order of Business, Leaders' Questions, Question Time and so forth. Otherwise, we will compound our original error. The Government is not fooling anybody by putting forward this cosmetic arrangement.</p>

The members of the Government will recall that when we were in Government in 1996, we held the Presidency of the European Union. It was a challenging, arduous and strenuous six months. I wish them well in their endeavours. We will be happy to assist as much as we can in the work of advancing Ireland's position in Europe and strengthening the new Europe on the world stage.</p>

It is also fitting that we have this opportunity to hope that the next six months of the Presidency of the European Union will be productive in finding a consensus which the smaller countries have to date not been able to subscribe to in regard to the draft constitution and the negotiations that will take place. I ask the Government to take into account at least one part of the legacy of Charles Haughey who dubbed the Presidency a "Green" Presidency. I am not sure what colour the Government will choose this time. It would be wise, given that Ireland is at the bottom of the league in terms of the Kyoto Protocol, to have some shade of ecological thinking there, as it does not appear to get a high priority from the Government so far as action is concerned. I ask the Government to take that into account so that after the six months Presidency, Ireland will not be seen to be at the bottom of that particular environmental league in Europe?</p>

They will be at the helm of the Irish Presidency and we will have strong and acute differences in the approach to the work ahead of us. I would hope it will be an important and fruitful time. I urge the Minister and his colleagues to take on board the 13 priorities for the Irish Presidency that Sinn Féin has proposed.</p>

I thank Deputies Kenny, Rabbitte, Sargent and Ó Caoláin for their good wishes to the Government in the context of the Presidency and the unquestionable support which I know they will give in terms of making the Irish Presidency the success we all hope it will be. I had the opportunity earlier to extend Christmas greetings to you, a Cheann Comhairle, and to be associated with the wishes expressed here to everybody associated with the work of the House and to express the hope that Members will have some time off to relax. Some Members, such as Deputy Stagg, who tend to be more energetic than others, particularly need the rest. Notwithstanding some of what is said in the House at times, at a time like this we come together a little more and let the people see we are human like the rest of them.

My advice to Deputies – I put my medical hat on as I often do on these occasions – is to take some time and have a break. It is necessary to ensure good health in the coming year and that the Members will be fighting fit when the Dáil reassembles on 20 January.

Seafarers are entitled to expect from the Government and the people of Ireland that the search and rescue services would be on a 24-hour basis and would be reliable. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to give that guarantee. Therefore, reluctantly, I had to make the decision I made yesterday. I assure Deputy McGinley that any matters he has raised will be fully investigated. It is important to remember this is a life and death service. I have only one set of criteria when faced with that risk, that is to ensure a full-time, 24-hour service is delivered. That can be done. Unfortunately, it is not possible for the Air Corps to do it.</p>

        <heading>Independent Monitoring Commission Bill 2003 [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage.</heading>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_174">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_255">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_256">I thank Deputies for their willingness to take this legislation today. That is what I am supposed to say, but at this late stage I thank the Deputies for their willingness to take the legislation at this stage today. This reflects the Dail's continued support for attempts to bring peace and political stability to Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">The purpose of the Bill is to provide in our law for the establishment of the Independent Monitoring Commission which has been the subject of an agreement between the UK Government and ourselves. It may be helpful if I set out in some detail the background to the establishment of the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">Members of this House, who follow developments in Northern Ireland very closely, will undoubtedly be aware of the broad background to the creation of the Independent Monitoring Commission. I will revisit some of the main points in that genesis in order to show where the commission fits into the overall pattern of political progress in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The early months of this year saw a great deal of political engagement between the two Governments and the pro-Agreement parties in Northern Ireland. Our intensive engagement continued through the months that followed, and after much painstaking effort and slow grind, a full and complete audit of all areas of the Good Friday Agreement which remained to be implemented was developed. This engagement included a two-day set of talks at Hillsborough, involving the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair, as well as the parties and a range of Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The result of our engagement was the Joint Declaration, published on 1 May. The Joint Declaration is the two Governments' comprehensive assessment of what remains to be implemented from the Agreement and the most positive way of ensuring that this takes place. Published alongside the Joint Declaration, the agreement on monitoring and compliance sets out some important principles on how confidence and stability in the political process can be sustained and developed, principally through the creation of a new independent body. That new body would monitor and report on the carrying out of commitments regarding the ending of paramilitary activity and the programme of security normalisation in Northern Ireland, as set out in the Joint Declaration. It would also consider claims that any party within the Assembly was in breach of its commitments under the Agreement. In the agreement on monitoring and compliance, the UK Government has undertaken, where such claims are made, to resolve those matters in line with the commission's recommendations and in consultation with the Irish Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The text of an international agreement setting up this new body, now known as the Independent Monitoring Commission, was published in September, and signed in Leinster House on behalf of the two countries by myself and the British ambassador on 25 November last. Members of the commission had been appointed earlier and they have been doing some preliminary work in what I might call "shadow" format.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Membership is broadly based. It comprises Lord Alderdice, the former speaker of the Assembly and leader of the Alliance Party, Mr. Joe Brosnan, former Secretary of the Department of Justice, Mr. John Grieve, a former senior officer with the London Metropolitan Police, and Mr. Richard Kerr, a former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States of America.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">The commission, whose members are all individuals of the utmost integrity and standing, visited Dublin recently and discussed the broad political situation with the Government and its Ministers, including myself. We shared with them our view that the commission can act as a confidence-building mechanism on a wide range of issues, particularly by offering reassurance that the activities which destabilised the institutions in the past will not be allowed to recur.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">While it did not prove possible to reach the agreement that we had hoped for in advance of the elections to the Assembly last month, and while that election has created a number of new imponderables, we must set our minds to managing our way through them.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">I cannot tell the House exactly how the political situation we face in light of the Assembly elections will evolve in the coming weeks and months. Deputies will be aware that a series of discussions has taken place, including discussions at Downing Street yesterday between the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister, Ministers including myself and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and members of the pro-Agreement parties. We now face into an early review of the operation of the Agreement. For its part, the Irish Government will do all it can to help agreement to be achieved among the parties, but this must be in the context of the Good Friday Agreement. It is a fair assessment at this stage that the Independent Monitoring Commission will play a key role in future developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">I will now deal in some detail with the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 defines certain terms used in the Bill. Section 2 provides that the commission will be independent in the performance of its functions and will have the legal capacity of a body corporate. Section 3 deals with the objective, functions and membership of the commission, as well as the appointment of its staff and the proper keeping of accounts by the commission. Section 3(1) provides that the objective and functions of the commission are those set out in Articles 3 to 7 of the agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">The objective of the commission is to carry out certain functions with a view to promoting the transition to a peaceful society and stable and inclusive devolved Government in Northern Ireland. The functions of the commission as set out in Articles 4 to 7 of the agreement are to monitor any continuing activity by paramilitary groups, assess whether the leaderships of these organisations are directing or seeking to prevent this activity, and report to the two Governments on its findings. All that is provided for in Article 4. The second function, provided for in Article 5, is to monitor the British Government's adherence to its agreed programme of security normalisation in Northern Ireland and report its findings to the two Governments. There is also a mechanism for the commission to examine normalisation in the absence of an agreed programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">The third function, as provided for in Article 6, is to consider a claim by any party in the Northern Ireland Assembly that a Minister or Assembly party is not committed to exclusively peaceful and democratic means, or that a Minister or party is failing to observe any other terms of the pledge of office. In so far as a claim relates to the operation of the institutional arrangements under strand one of the multiparty Agreement, it shall be considered by those commissioners solely appointed by the British Government and any findings reported to the British Government only. As provided for in Article 7, the fourth function is to recommend any remedial measures considered necessary,</p>
          <p eId="para_269">Section 3(2) deals with the membership of the commission, as well as with the appointment of its staff and the proper keeping of its accounts and privileges, immunities and inviolabilities as set out in Articles 10 to 14 of the agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">Membership of the commission shall be as set out in Article 10 of the agreement. It shall have four members. Two members, one of whom shall be from Northern Ireland, are to be appointed by the Government of the United Kingdom. These are, respectively, Lord Alderdice and Mr. John Grieve. One member is to be appointed by the Government of Ireland, Mr. Joe Brosnan. One member, to be appointed jointly by the two Governments, shall be a nominee of the Government of the United States of America, Mr. Richard Kerr.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Section 4 deals with the provision by me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of such moneys, premises, facilities and services, including staff, necessary for the proper functioning of the commission in line with Article 12 of the agreement. Section 5 deals with immunities and privileges afforded to the commission. This is similar to the arrangements in place for the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning and the Commission on the Location of Victims' Remains.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Section 5(1) provides that the commission and its property shall be afforded certain immunities and privileges in the performance of official functions. Sections 5(2) and (3) deal with immunities and privileges afforded to members of the commission, its staff and agents or persons performing functions assigned to them by the commission.</p>

The section also provides that the commission and its agents will observe confidentiality in respect of material received.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Section 8 provides for the formal dissolution of the commission in an orderly manner in line with Article 16 of the agreement.

This is necessary to protect communications between the commission and public bodies. The commission itself is outside the scope of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, as amended, as it is not a public body under the Act and it is not intended that the Minister for Finance would make an order declaring it to be such a body.</p>

Section 12 provides that the Act will come into operation by order on such day as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stipulates, following consultation with the Secretary of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">It is in the nature of things that when this House is asked to enact legislation in the context of giving effect to an international agreement, the form of the legislation is to a large extent determined by the terms of that agreement. The agreement, included as a Schedule to the Bill, is the culmination of detailed negotiations between the Irish and United Kingdom Governments. I ask Members to understand that such a process inevitably involves compromises on both sides. I believe the agreement which the House is being asked to approve formally today is balanced and has the potential to make a significant contribution to the quest for political stability in the North. People acting in good faith who are attempting to implement the Good Friday Agreement should have nothing to fear from the establishment of the commission. That is the context in which I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_175">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_279">I wish to share my time with Deputy Deasy. This is important legislation. In the autumn I called for its early publication and I am pleased it has been introduced by the Government at this time. I am equally pleased to state that the Fine Gael party is happy to co-operate with the Minister in its speedy passage through the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">The Bill provides for the establishment of the Independent Monitoring Commission to oversee the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. It was originally promised last May in the Joint Declaration of the British and Irish Governments as one of a number of important confidence-building measures which the two governments had committed to bringing forward. At that time it was hoped the establishment of this monitoring commission would act as an encouragement to the Ulster Unionist Party to agree to the restoration of the devolved institutions of Northern Ireland. While the result of the Assembly elections may not have been anticipated at that time, it is still very worthwhile to proceed with the enactment of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">The Independent Monitoring Commission has the potential to facilitate the re-establishment of the power sharing Executive after the forthcoming review of the Agreement, in the event that the Democratic Unionist Party, which has made clear that it does not object in principle to the concept of power sharing, might agree to the restoration of the Executive. This monitoring commission should prove an additional comfort to them and to other parties as it will provide for sanctions against any party which breaches its obligations under the Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">The institutions are quite fragile and I welcome any mechanism which will be seen to support and protect them. In that context I am very pleased that following their meetings with the pro-Agreement parties, the British and Irish Governments have concurred that the review of the Agreement should be short and focused because that is best for all. It must recognise the enhanced mandate and the new reality of that mandate received by the Democratic Unionist Party. Equally, the DUP must recognise that well over 70% of the Northern Ireland electorate voted in the recent elections for pro-Agreement parties. Their wishes for the process to continue must be respected.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">The review must take place on the basis that the fundamental principles underpinning the Good Friday Agreement – devolution and inclusive power sharing – must be adhered to. In the spirit of the Agreement and for the sake of moving the process on for the benefit of all communities, I call on the republican movement to work to improve the political climate. If the movement is serious about the future of Northern Ireland, it must take further steps towards the required acts of completion.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">On a related issue, I am pleased that later today the Government will publish the Cory report. In the interests of integrity and trust I call on the British Government to honour its commitment to publish Judge Cory's report into allegations of collusion north of the Border. The truth is required so that the necessary political trust can follow. It seems that the model of preliminary inquiry carried out by Judge Cory has been very effective. I urge the Taoiseach to consider such a model to deal with other unresolved allegations.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">I repeat my serious concerns about the Nally report. I refer in particular to the statement issued yesterday evening on behalf of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. It is clear from the statement that Ms Nuala O'Loan, who had carried out significant preparatory investigative work which formed the basis of the Nally group report, received no feedback on how her work was carried forward and dealt with. It was also clear from her statement that she views the allegations made in a far more serious light than does the Nally group. She stated that investigative material corroborated 23 of the allegations made to her office. I appeal to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to furnish the ombudsman with a copy of the Nally report on a confidential basis and invite her comments on its findings. I also urge the Taoiseach and the Minister to consider the adoption of a similar approach to the Omagh bombing as it did to the Cory report. The appointment of a person of the calibre of Judge Cory would be of considerable comfort and hope to the families of those murdered in the bombing. These people need the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">I reiterate my commitment and that of my party to the Omagh families. The reason any of us in this House are involved in politics is to attempt to make people's lives better. I suggest to the Taoiseach that in the case of Omagh and the Nally report, he has an excellent opportunity to do that. These people need our help. They are understandably upset at the Government's handling of the Omagh aftermath. Their concern can only have been heightened by the revelation that the Taoiseach had been less than truthful about the contacts between the Government and the Real IRA after the Omagh atrocity. If we fail to use the power and the privilege of this House to do good and to do our best for these families, then we must ask ourselves what we are doing here at all. This matter is not just about politics; it is about humanity.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">In conclusion, I reiterate my party's support for the Bill and for the establishment of the Independent Monitoring Commission. I repeat my hope that it may help to facilitate the restoration of inclusive government in Northern Ireland.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_290">As the Minister stated, this Bill is a result of a great deal of political engagement and activity between the Governments earlier this year which resulted in the Joint Declaration published on 1 May 2003. Agreements on monitoring and compliance were also made along with the Joint Declaration, the intention being to monitor commitments given with respect to paramilitary activity and to follow up on the security normalisation programme in Northern Ireland. The intention is to act on any claims made against certain parties accused of breaking the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. I regard it as a very worthwhile and necessary initiative. Four people have been chosen and their expertise is impressive.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">I believe the commission will act as an important support for the entire peace process. People in the North need to know that there are structures in place to strengthen and secure the peace process. This is an important confidence-building measure as we try to reinstate the institutions that have been badly destabilised in the recent past. It is difficult to predict what will happen with regard to the Assembly in the coming weeks and months.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">As my party leader, Deputy Kenny, stated, Fine Gael will support the Bill. If it had been initiated three or four years ago, I believe it would have borne fruit. The situation in the North at present might not have happened if the commission had been established earlier. It is worth noting that the two parties most vociferously opposed to this measure are Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party. That is not surprising, given that Sinn Féin has breached its commitments under the Agreement. Sanctions will be imposed on those parties which flagrantly violate the terms of the Agreement. Unfortunately, the DUP has successfully used attacks on the Agreement to bolster itself politically. Sinn Féin has used the issue of IRA weapons to make headway with the electorate both north and south of the Border. The commission's role is important because the political extremes in the North have capitalised on the increased polarisation there. Considering Dr. Paisley's declaration a couple of days ago, the commission's work has become more important. It is not only a monitoring agency, but a safeguard against people who have brought mayhem and misery to this island for 30 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">Only one year ago many sources were telling us that the IRA would comprehensively act on weapons decommissioning and on issues such as punishment beatings, targeting of individuals, surveillance and other violent activities. Paragraph 13 of the Joint Declaration calls for an immediate full and permanent cessation of all paramilitary activity, including military attacks, training, targeting, intelligence gathering, acquisition or development of arms or weapons, other preparations for terrorist campaigns, punishment beatings and attacks and involvement in riots. However, that has not happened. That failure to follow through with so-called acts of completion and to meet the requirements of paragraph 13 is one of the main reasons Dr. Paisley now has a Unionist majority. If the commission had been in place for the past year and had been working effectively, the situation might be different.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">Unfortunately, the commission's role was seized upon by the DUP and the anti-Agreement Unionists. Initially, the body was a reaction to David Trimble's call for an independent body to monitor paramilitary activities. However, the two Governments expanded that role, which was seized upon by the anti-Agreement Unionists who made the charge that it diminished British sovereignty and breached strand one of the Good Friday Agreement, which relates to the internal affairs of Northern Ireland. Jeffrey Donaldson memorably said that the hermetic seal of strand one had been broken. Unwittingly, it became an issue on which extreme Unionists could campaign. No one in the South has any interest in meddling in the affairs of the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">Sinn Féin's dubious reason for not supporting the commission was that it was being set up outside the terms of the Belfast Agreement and that it constituted a concession to the anti-Agreement Unionists, who then campaigned against it. That did not make sense, given that for years Sinn Féin asked for a programme of demilitarisation and then when a body was set up to scrutinise that process, it opposed it. One of the reasons Sinn Féin refused to support it was that the commission would have a key role in determining sanctions, if necessary, for Sinn Féin Ministers in any Executive if the IRA was judged to have been engaged in paramilitary activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said last week that there was little difference between the IRA and Sinn Féin and that illegal IRA activities were funding Sinn Féin's political activities. He was right to say that. The IRA is involved in ongoing paramilitary activities and money is being siphoned to a political party represented in this House. I am sorry I did not say it first, but I am not privy to that information. I fully agree with the Minister's comments last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">Last week's hijacking of a lorry on the Border bore all the hallmarks of a Provisional IRA operation, according to the Garda and the PSNI. It follows on the heels of the discovery of a building construction scam by the Provisional IRA. For decades it has been involved in such activity and nothing has changed. It is no wonder this legislation is opposed by the party which represents those people. The only regret I have about the legislation and the commission is that we did not set it up sooner. As my party leader said, we fully support it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_179">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_298">The Labour Party will not oppose this Bill, although we have some reservations about aspects of it, which we will discuss on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">It seems premature, if not fatuous, to wish the Independent Monitoring Commission well in its work since the background against which it will operate has undergone such a radical change since the idea of a commission was first mooted and agreed. There is, nevertheless, a certain timeliness about this debate. Later today the Government will publish a section of the Cory report, which deals with murderous activities of the Provisional IRA and the allegation of collusion between it and some members of the Garda. We await the Government's recommendations on the matter but, on the basis of reports, it seems certain there will be a continuing spotlight on the campaign of murder carried out by that organisation over many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">In the past week we had the Nally report, which also dealt with the heinous crimes of the Real IRA, particularly the atrocity it committed in Omagh. The Taoiseach told the House recently that he has been briefed about security concerns relating to the continuing activities of the Provisional IRA in a variety of criminal matters, in respect of some of which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently elaborated. Notwithstanding the new environment, it appears that "they haven't gone away, you know".</p>
          <p eId="para_301">There remains a strong argument for seeking to ensure that the operations of democracy here as well as in Northern Ireland are not subverted by underhand, illegal or criminal activity. There is an added dimension when it comes to Northern Ireland. All of us support the development of devolution on an inclusive basis and we all want to see a Northern Ireland that is not only at peace, but that is able to move forward economically and socially and that is confident about dealing with us on matters of mutual interest. The three strands of the Good Friday Agreement, as we have always agreed, are intertwined and when one breaks down, the others are immediately in trouble. However, each strand depends on a degree of trust or at least on the capacity to build trust. The absence of that trust and the apparent absence of mechanisms to build it have led to a situation where the politics of Northern Ireland in the wake of an Assembly election are more polarised than ever.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">Only yesterday, as we know, it was necessary for the two Governments to carry out a sober assessment of the present state of the peace process. Although it remains the case that a majority of the people elected to the Assembly support the Anglo-Irish Agreement, there does not seem to be any immediately apparent way in which the Assembly can meet to elect a First and Deputy First Minister. Until that happens, there does not seem to be any prospect of progress towards an inclusive devolved Government in Northern Ireland. Although the Governments have promised a short sharp review, at this stage it seems impossible to predict a way forward within the terms of the Agreement. As we know, any change to the Agreement, fraught as that would be to secure, would have considerable constitutional implications in this jurisdiction, to say nothing of the unpredictable consequences in Northern Ireland. I will return to that subject later.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">The original purpose of the commission we are discussing is to monitor and report on certain types of activity with a view to promoting the transition to a peaceful society and stable and inclusive devolved Government in Northern Ireland. It seems we are much further from the notion of a stable and inclusive devolved Government in Northern Ireland than we were when the idea of an independent commission was first mooted.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">Although the commission being established under this Bill will report on certain activities on a six-monthly basis, the purpose to which that information will be put, once it is published, may be somewhat dubious. At least it seems clear that, under the Act, and unlike another commission, there will not be a level of secrecy regarding its operations or in respect of its assessments of a kind that appears to have contributed to the collapse of the last negotiations before the Assembly elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">It remains one of the great mysteries that the de Chastelain commission was seemingly in a position to make a major contribution to the development of confidence in Northern Ireland, and indeed to the promotion of a stable and inclusive government, but was prevented from doing so by an obligation of secrecy. That obligation, and the unwillingness of the IRA and its interlocutors to countenance any departure from it, may well be at the heart of the political difficulties we now face.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">In October last, as we all remember, we witnessed on television what was meant to be a series of orchestrated events but in the end it turned into something of a fiasco. In the early part of the day, Martin McGuinness made it clear on radio that he had seen, apparently with approbation, the contents of a detailed statement by David Trimble. Not only was the content of that statement made aware to Sinn Féin but it was said that the party was ready to welcome it. Then Gerry Adams made a statement that contained a strong commitment to wholly peaceful means, seemingly on behalf of all strands of the republican movement, and the IRA endorsed that commitment. Everyone welcomed the progress made so far, and we waited for word from General John de Chastelain. What we saw, however, was a haggard and tired man confirm that he had witnessed a further act of decommissioning. He was unable, however, to convey in any convincing way a sense of its magnitude, the degree to which it represented real progress towards the overall stated aim of removing the gun from Irish politics, or the timescale within which he might complete the job. His demeanour and body language was such that it jarred immediately with the whole expectation that we would be witnessing major progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">So it proved to be. We can infer that David Trimble was ready to announce, based on the de Chastelain report and the earlier statement by Mr. Adams, that in the aftermath of an election, he would work with other parties, including the republican movement, to re-establish and sustain democratic institutions in Northern Ireland. That statement was put on hold and has never been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">We also awaited detailed statements from the British and Irish Governments. We know that those statements would have brought a good deal closer the devolution of policing, and the full participation of all the parties in the management and control of policing, to the newly re-established institutions in Northern Ireland. That, too, would have represented significant progress and would have been widely welcomed as a further buttressing of the peace process.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The jarring moment in the choreography went on to affect the dynamic of the election. The election should have taken place in an atmosphere in which we, and especially the people of Northern Ireland, could bank on the emergence of a post-IRA Ireland. Instead, however, it represented another battle for the hearts and minds of both sides of a still-divided community. The winners on both sides were those who had taken the harder line. The losers were those who had endeavoured to apply reason but had seen that reason thwarted. In the case of the SDLP, the only one of the four main parties to have consistently championed every aspect of the Agreement without reservation, its difficulties were compounded by the fact that it had been effectively marginalised by the two governments in the essentially failed process that preceded the elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">The result of the election is, of course, the outcome of a democratic process and we have to accept that. However, it is out of sync with the deeper yearning of the people of Northern Ireland for a future in which both politics and people can work together. We have always been told that in Northern Ireland a political vacuum is the most dangerous thing. We only have to remember the fact that this past summer has been one of the most peaceful in the recent history of Northern Ireland, in spite of the political vacuum that existed, to realise the hunger for peace and progress that is still a feature of daily life throughout all the former troublespots there.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">The difficulties that face us now derive in part from the earlier point I made about trust. In the context of considering the relationships in and between these islands, and the institutions that have been established throughout them, the Good Friday Agreement is a special case. It is not just an overarching text of constitutional significance that spells out binding rules for the fundamental institutions of government. It is different because it demands of those who are party to it a continuous commitment to its working, rather than simple observance of its rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">Potentially, this is the Agreement's greatest weakness because, ultimately, any party that is unhappy can just walk away. If a significant player walks away, those left behind cannot just carry on because without that one element there no longer is an agreement and its institutions cannot function.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">However, the Agreement could not have been reached on any other basis. We in the Republic knew we were taking a risk when we alone were asked to amend our Constitution unconditionally, as part of a process which would succeed only on condition that all others would thereafter maintain their commitment to its success. We believed it was worth this risk. Along with many others involved in this process, the Labour Party has always pointed to the text of the Agreement as the point of first reference. If something is contrary to the Agreement, it should not be done; if it is an obligation imposed by the Agreement, then it must be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">As a statement of general principle, this still holds true but we have to recognise that this approach is qualified in at least two respects. First, there is a tendency to treat the text as sacred, as if it contained the correct, for-all-time answers to every conceivable question that might arise. No account is taken of the fact that some questions were not anticipated. There is no point in such a case in quoting Scripture to suit one's own end. In addition, the parties to the Agreement all know that some answers were deliberately fudged. To the very end of the negotiating process, they disputed the form of words which would eventually be agreed as the Agreement's text on decommissioning, the interpretation of which now is such a cause of friction.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">The reason the text is ambiguous is that the parties to the Agreement decided it should be. It was the best that could be agreed at the time and it is written in a form of words that is not capable of being forensically parsed and analysed. We know what the decommissioning provisions require but it is not a case where one can ask the simple question as to whether or not those requirements have been satisfied. Instead, the question that can be answered is whether real and substantial efforts are being made – with due regard to the need of parties both to lead their followers and to reflect the limits of their mandates – to ensure that these requirements will, eventually, be satisfied. That requires difficult and careful assessment and constant reassessment. In view of this, constant reference back to the wording of the relevant provisions of the Agreement is necessary but it is not sufficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">Second, when it comes to the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions, claims about the legality of the actions of various parties at various times, by reference to the original provisions of the Agreement, are of only limited relevance. Of course, people can be excluded but if one leg is removed from a chair, it will collapse. Most people, therefore, only remove a leg from a chair if they are confident they know how to turn it into a stool. The truth is that no matter what institutions are established under or alongside the Good Friday Agreement – and this applies, also, to the independent commission established by the Minister in this Bill – the Agreement still stands or falls by the willingness of key parties to work together to find solutions to problems. As long as the parties devote more of their energies to finding problems to fall out about, rather than finding solutions, the Agreement will not find its full expression. The reality is that the peace process was and still remains in too fragile a stage of development to withstand constant forensic scrutiny of every adverse step taken along the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">That is one aspect of a wider reality. A lawyer looks at the structures of new institutions and the rules that will apply to them, and asks what provision has been made if something goes wrong? For a lawyer, there must always be a fall-back position whereby an authoritative pronouncement can be made on what can or cannot be done, and how one may carry on in the light of what has been attempted. An inability in a crisis to give an authoritative and binding answer to the question of what happens next points to a fundamental defect in the rules and, for want of an applicable rule, there may be nothing that can legally be done. A lawyer hates a vacuum. For the proper operation of the Good Friday Agreement, there is no fall-back position. The whole arrangement, in all its three-stranded complexity, is subtended by an assumption that all of the parties necessary to its proper functioning are willing to see it function and will do what is necessary to achieve that end. If they are not, and if they will not, then it will collapse.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">The continuation of these institutions to a stage where they can be taken for granted requires continued commitment by the participants, to an extent that is not matched in terms of any political party operating in assemblies in Dublin, London, Edinburgh or Cardiff, and no one can, under any machinery that is thought up in a process of review, institutionalise this commitment or, within the terms of the Agreement, create alternative machinery to cope with its absence.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The drafters of the democratic programme of the first Dáil Éireann asserted that permanence of government could be secured only in the willing adhesion of the people. I could perhaps add that it needs to be secured too in the willingness of legislators to listen and understand the real needs and desires of the people they represent. The hunger for peace and progress is still alive on the streets of Northern Ireland. When it permeates into the hearts and minds of the politicians of Northern Ireland, we will begin to make real progress.</p>

        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_180">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_320">Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Teachta Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin agus Ball den Grúpa Neamhspleách.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">In general terms, the Green Party welcomes this Bill. It provides for a form of parallel disengagement which the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, recommended to George Mitchell at the time of the first International Commission on Decommissioning. If followed through on its provisions, it will make an important contribution towards demilitarising society in the North, thereby providing the conditions best suited to the building of trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">The Bill is not without its difficulties, however. The paramilitary threat in the future will come, presumably, from the anti-Agreement loyalists and dissident republicans. It will be in the interests of these groups to scupper the demilitarisation agreements. However, the seeds of mistrust are evidently present, even in the wording of the Bill which refers to aspects of secrecy in the interests of national security and private individual security. There is a risk that these types of terms will be abused.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">We know there has been a parallel implementation of this legislation on the British side but the legislation as it pertains to this jurisdiction and the North will need to go beyond the legislation we have here if it is to be effective. Section 6 is interesting. It states: "In performing its functions the Commission shall not do anything that could reasonably be expected to prejudice the national security interests of the State [that is this State] or the United Kingdom".</p>
          <p eId="para_324">In that regard, with the publication of the Barron inquiry report, there is a strong suggestion in that document that what goes as national security in the United Kingdom does not necessarily go as national security in this jurisdiction. That is an important issue that needs to be addressed. It is a question of trust, not just between both sides of the tribal divide in the North but also in both jurisdictions and between the Governments in London and Dublin. The Barron inquiry report suggested that the UK Government did not do all it could to divulge documents that were necessary for Mr. Justice Barron's inquiry. Having listened to people who claim to have been very knowledgeable about the inside track speaking on programmes such as Vincent Browne's radio programme, with damning references being made to spies and espionage, there appear to be a considerable number of hidden agendas.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">In that regard also, there is the prospect, although to do it would be pressing a nuclear button, so to speak, of excluding a party from the Assembly and not giving any reason on the basis of national security. That would not help to build up trust, and that has to be borne in mind. This legislation will not be sufficient to build up the necessary trust, although I hope it will go some way towards that goal.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Section 7 states:</p>
          <p eId="para_327">The Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or any member of the Garda Síochána designated by him [or her, presumably] for that purpose may disclose to the Commission any information in the possession of the Garda Síochána which in the opinion of the Commission is necessary for performing its functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Nothing in any other enactment prohibits disclosure of relevant factual information either to or by the Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">If we are requiring disclosure to the commission by the Garda Síochána, we know from the Morris tribunal and various other incidents and investigations that there is a need to have an independent ombudsman for the Garda Síochána. There is a need for some mechanism which is above reproach and not seen to be biased. That is a matter which needs to be resolved but this legislation will not do that. Parallel measures are needed in that regard. The Garda will argue, understandably, that there are many difficulties in terms of resources. We all have our own constituencies to speak about but having gone through a number of deaths, retirements and turnover of staff, the gardaí in the area where I live now find themselves in a position where they have one extra garda since 1988, yet the population has increased by approximately 50%. If we are asking gardaí to engage with this process above and beyond what is happening currently, they would argue that even to set up an extra checkpoint would be a burden.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">That being said, it is important that the legislation be passed and that some measure of trust is established which can bring back the Assembly and the institutions which were at the heart of the reason it came about in the first place. The organisation which, ultimately, has a good deal to contribute in terms of building up that trust is the IRA, which has been a large spectre in the overall determination of Northern hostilities as well as the politics that have evolved. Full IRA decommissioning is the bottom line in terms of restoring trust on the Unionist side. Equally, and I mean that in every sense, there needs to be an ending of not just paramilitary activity but also British Government demilitarisation, but we are still not at that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">We must not take our eye off the ball when it comes to this legislation. It is important but it appears to be a referee without a whistle, so to speak. Those who have the whistle will not just have to rely on this legislation but they will have to trust each other. That is something for which legislation is no substitute and the sooner we can get to a position where people have the courage to trust, the sooner we will start to see real progress.</p>

          <p eId="para_332">I move amendment No. 1:<entity refersTo="#bill.2003.50.dail.2.amd_1" name="amendment"/>
                    </p>
          <p eId="para_333">To delete all words after "That" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_334">"Dáil Éireann noting that the proposed Independent Monitoring Commission is outside the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and that it has the potential to be used as a mechanism to block political progress declines to give a second reading to the Bill."</p>
          <p eId="para_335">Sinn Féin is totally opposed to the Independent Monitoring Commission Bill 2003, which, as my colleagues and I have stated in this House and other fora, is completely outside the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. This is an enabling Bill for a British Act of Parliament which is not only outside the Good Friday Agreement but undermines it. The Northern Ireland (Monitoring Commission) Act 2003 was not even referred to by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when he spoke on the Bill in the Seanad or in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">It is my guess that few Members of the House have ever heard of this British legislation, or are aware of its serious implications for the peace process. This Bill effectively endorses that legislation and ratifies the agreement between the Irish and British Governments signed by the Minister and the British ambassador, Stewart Eldon, in this House on 25 November. The British Act is disgraceful legislation and the agreement signed by the Minister is, with respect, a disgraceful agreement, which should never have been entered into by an Irish Government. Sinn Féin, as the representative of republican opinion in this State and of the largest body of Nationalists and republicans in the Six Counties, will not accept this so-called agreement which, sadly, so many Deputies seem willing to do without question. The Dáil is being asked on the last day of the session to rubber-stamp serious legislation which has profound implications for the peace process and under a guillotine of all Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The very name of the Bill is a falsehood. The commission will not and cannot be independent. Politically, it was established as a sop to the Ulster Unionist Party dissidents, the very group since made politically irrelevant by the result of the Assembly election. The commission will, in effect, be a creature of the British Government and will rely on information from British intelligence, the British army and the PSNI to fulfil its functions. This is the effect of the Bill and the British legislation to which I have already referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The McDowell-Eldon agreement, this legislation and the British legislation will be open to constitutional challenge as being in clear breach of the Good Friday Agreement. It is often forgotten that as well as amending Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution in 1998, the people in this jurisdiction amended Article 29 to state that the State may be bound by the Good Friday Agreement and that any institution "established by or under the Agreement may exercise the powers and functions thereby conferred on it in respect of all or any part of the island of Ireland", notwithstanding any other provision in the Constitution. This important change in the Constitution was made on the basis of the Agreement as signed by the two Governments and the institutions as set out in the Agreement. The McDowell-Eldon agreement, as implemented by the British legislation and now proposed to be endorsed by this enabling legislation, undermines the Good Friday Agreement, on the basis of which the people voted to change Articles 2, 3 and 29.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">Strand one, Article 25 of the Good Friday Agreement provides that the Assembly, voting on a cross-community basis, may remove a Minister from office. The Northern Ireland (Monitoring Commission) Act, the British equivalent of this legislation, allows the British Secretary of State unilaterally to remove a Minister from office when a motion for exclusion cannot attract cross-community support. This is in clear breach of both the spirit and the letter of the Good Friday Agreement. The British Act goes further and allows the British Secretary of State to exclude someone from office in "exceptional circumstances".</p>
          <p eId="para_340">The so-called Independent Monitoring Commission is designed to facilitate this undermining of the Agreement by the British Government. It is unacceptable that an Irish Government should be party to this through the McDowell-Eldon agreement. The so-called independence of this commission is glaringly exposed in Article 6 of that agreement, which lays down that the mechanism by which the commission considers claims of misconduct by Ministers only involves the members of the commission appointed by the British Government. The only shared position is the 50/50 sharing of the cost of the commission's work. Let us make no mistake, the British Government is in the ascendancy and has overall control.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">This legislation is a recipe for the continuation of the British and Unionist serial collapsing of the institutions and postponement of democratic elections. As we speak, the Assembly remains in suspension by order of the British Government at the behest of unionism, despite the renewed democratic mandates secured at the recent Assembly elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">I do not intend to waste time addressing the detail of the functions of the commission, except to state they are a sham. There is not even the pretence that the activities of the British Government and its armed forces will be monitored in any way. The British Government will face no sanctions, nor will the Irish Government for any failures on its part. I will not address the personnel of the commission as established in shadow form. Suffice to say that if it was composed solely of Nelson Mandela, it could not be independent.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">Article 5 of the McDowell-Eldon agreement purports to address the issue of demilitarisation, or "normalisation" as it is described. It is a legislative trick because it is entirely negated by section 15. The commission shall monitor any programme undertaken by the British only after they decide to undertake such a programme once "satisfied with commitments that have been given on an end to paramilitary activity". Otherwise the commission can only monitor so-called normalisation at the request of the British Government – so much for its so-called independence.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">The Bill and the shabby agreement come before the House on the very day the Government proposes to publish its section of the Cory report and while the British Government continues to refuse to publish its section, and one week after the Barron report exposed the British Government's refusal to co-operate with the inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, yet we are being asked to establish a commission which will rely on the same British military, police and intelligence services for information. Such information will be supplied to the British Secretary of State who may use it to expel a Minister without a cross-community vote in the Assembly.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The British refused to co-operate with Mr. Justice Barron, citing national security interests, yet the McDowell-Eldon agreement enshrines British national security interests in Article 13. The so-called Independent Monitoring Commission will not decide what those interests are. If the British say no to any request from the Commission on the basis of national security, that will be the end of the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">The Irish Government has stated that it is against any renegotiation of the Good Friday agreement. Regrettably, this Bill and the British legislation that preceded it are rewriting that same agreement and without negotiation. I urge Members to reject this Bill and the associated agreement that bears the Minister's signature and that of the British ambassador, on the basis of the valid concerns I have outlined. I urge the House to support the amendment tabled by the Sinn Féin Members in the interests of ensuring that the Good Friday agreement, that had the endorsement of the overwhelming volume of opinion on this island, has the opportunity to flourish and deliver the hope and expectation that so many of us have placed our trust in.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_182">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_347">I support the introduction of the Independent Monitoring Commission Bill 2003, which is designed to monitor and report on paramilitary ceasefires. It will also have the task of ensuring that pledges on commitments in this regard under the Good Friday agreement are carried out. The various parties are just about coming to terms with the results of last month's elections for a phantom Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">At this point, I would like to congratulate Dr. Kieran Deeney on his election as a hospital candidate and for topping the poll in Omagh. Sometimes people leave politics aside and put health first.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">This week's succession of meetings with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, constituted the first testing of the water by politicians in the North's new political landscape. We may yet be in for a few surprises as political pragmatism takes over from the outdated and outmoded battle cries of "No surrender", "Not an inch" and "Ulster says no."  I am reassured by the Minister's emphasis on the part that the Irish Government, in tandem with the British Government, will play in seeking agreement among the various parties in context of the Good Friday agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Prior to this the development of monitoring was <i>ad hoc</i> and depended upon different interest groups. However, the Good Friday agreement introduced a range of new political structures for Northern Ireland. As well as the Northern Ireland Assembly these included the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. The Patten Commission on Policing examined the operation and role of the RUC and produced reforms of that police force. In the course of its public consultations the Patten Commission took note of the fact that community policing and public accountability were of significant concern in many areas. The Parades Commission was given statutory powers to make determinations on parades and demonstrations. In recent years there has been much progress in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">The work of the monitoring commission will, in the first instance, largely consist of confidence building, together with the nurturing and restoration of a stable political process in the North. Part of the process will be to rebuild the trust and confidence necessary to restore stable and inclusive devolved government to Northern Ireland. It will be a function of the commission to report every six months on the status of both the IRA and loyalist ceasefires. This will be welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">The Independent Monitoring Commission is designed to promote the transition to a peaceful society and a stable and inclusive government. In response to Nationalists who frequently express frustration and anger at the level of security force armaments, the new commission will monitor the British Government's programme of demilitarisation in the province. The prominent display of security posts indicates a continuing policy of dominance and is offensive to many people. More vigorous initiatives should be employed towards removing these structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">The level of weaponry retained by paramilitaries of all political hues in Northern Ireland is comparatively greater than in most liberal democracies. The commission should be instrumental in reducing this level significantly. As far as devolved ministries and the Northern Ireland parties are concerned, the British Government representatives will examine how they were honouring their commitments under the Good Friday agreement. The commission will have the function of scrutinising the British Government's programme for the scaling down of military bases, long a serious source of contention among the Nationalist population. Commission members can probe accusations that some political parties were threatening the stability of devolved institutions. Prior to this there was a major deficit in the independent monitoring of paramilitary activity. This will be more than adequately remedied by this commission. It will redound to the benefit of the peace process.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">It is in the interests of all that a monitoring commission should provide an accurate and dispassionate evaluation of the situation. It will certainly be in the public interest and a major contributory factor to the common good that the public will be enabled to distinguish allegations and accusations from fact. The success or otherwise of the Independent Monitoring Commission will rest on its degree of independence from the North's institutions and whether it can take a critical position on State agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">Experience in jurisdictions such as South Africa during a period of political transition revealed the powerful role that a monitoring commission can play if it remains independent. It must engage closely with the structures of the formal political process, however. Retaining its critical independence and engaging in conflict resolution has proved an important factor, as in the South African example, and should be in Northern Ireland as well. This is not naively to suggest that a monitoring commission is a panacea or a replacement for State agencies, political parties or other interest groups, but to acknowledge the contribution it can make when conditions are right, which is not always the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">A number of questions remain to be answered about the new commission. What powers will it have to obtain information from Irish and British security forces? We have had a recent example of the level of co-operation to be had from the British forces in the North, as regards the Barron report. That was a poor report. The impression the report gave was that they did not want to know. What will its relationship be with the Garda Síochána and the GOC of the British army in the North? How much will it cost? Where will it be based and how will it be staffed? Will it be able to investigate past and current alleged violations of the Good Friday agreement?</p>
          <p eId="para_357">An independent commission already operates in Northern Ireland, namely General John de Chastelain's Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. That commission operates with a considerable degree of secrecy and its achievements are difficult to evaluate. The onus will be on the Independent Monitoring Commission to work in a much more open and transparent manner. There will need to be reassurance that intimidation is ending and that paramilitaries in both communities have ceased to stockpile arms.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">There is no doubt that Northern Ireland is an infinitely safer place today than before the Good Friday agreement. However, abuses continue daily, adversely affecting the lives of many innocent people. A limited number of people with disruptive agendas are still determined to undermine progress and stability in Northern Ireland. The Good Friday agreement committed all participants to the total and simultaneous disarmament of all paramilitaries and major demilitarisation on the part of the security forces. The Independent Monitoring Commission will have a major part to play in the process in parallel with the de Chastelain Independent International Commission on Decommissioning.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_359">Time is limited and we are operating under the shadow of the Order of Business agreed earlier in the House. I do not want unduly to prolong this debate. I welcome the wide support across the House for this measure. It is an encouraging sign. I thank Deputies Deasy, Rabbitte, Kenny and Connolly for their warm words of support for this agreement. The Sinn Féin contribution, of course, is discordant and is in a tiny minority. It is swimming against the tide not merely of history and logic but also against the tide of truth in this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">The Good Friday Agreement was founded on one proposition, that the participants acknowledge that they would not only abstain from the use of violence but also oppose the use of violence by others. That is in the preamble to the Agreement. Opposition to the use of violence is not an empty formula. It means one takes every step to use one's influence to prevent the use of violence or the threat of the use of violence by anybody with whom one has any influence.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">The Sinn Féin Party has come to the House yet again with the threadbare distinction between what it says in public on this matter and what happens on the ground. That threadbare distinction has become even thinner. Deputy Ó Caoláin dubs the agreement between the Irish Government and the United Kingdom Government as "the McDowell-Eldon agreement" to satisfy a Sinn Féin propaganda desire to personalise this matter but this is an agreement between two sovereign Governments and, as is evident from this debate, it has the overwhelming support of the parties in this House. It is not a personal choice of mine. On behalf of the Irish Government, I am doing the job the Irish people and the vast majority of its elected representatives have asked me to do and are endorsing as appropriate in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">It was implicit in the Good Friday Agreement that there would be an end to paramilitarism in Northern Ireland and that all involved would use their best endeavours to bring about that end. In that context, it is time we acknowledged one problem. What I found particularly distasteful during the debate was the assertion by Deputy Ó Caoláin that he spoke as a representative of republican opinion in this House. I deny him that status. He is not the representative of republican opinion in this House. The vast majority of Members of this House are republicans and I am one of them. My intuition as to what real republicanism stands for is as good, if not much better, than Deputy Ó Caoláin's.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">The Deputy dubbed this agreement as disgraceful. He said it is, effectively, in breach of the Good Friday Agreement. If Deputy Ó Caoláin believes that, let he and his colleagues go to the Four Courts and make that case before the independent Judiciary of the State. If not, he should abandon the proposition that it is in breach of the Agreement. The Government is acting in support of the Agreement and is taking the steps necessary to ensure the Agreement prospers. It is not seeking to breach or undermine the Agreement or to kick at its foundations but to ensure that some people in Northern Ireland deliver on the implicit and explicit commitments they gave in connection with the Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">The provisional movement, consisting of the IRA and Sinn Féin, comprises people who constantly mask one truth about themselves. Far from regarding the institutions and Constitution of this State as legitimate, they state, on the contrary, that the Army Council of the IRA, the executive of that body and the convention, which is another attribute of IRA organisation, have democratic legitimacy and enjoy a continuous thread of legitimacy that dates back to the 1918 general election. That is the provisional position. It carries the implication that such legitimacy is denied to this Parliament, the will of the people in this State and the Constitution. The mythology of the provisional movement is that its members, and a few people who are unknown to the great majority of Irish people, carry within them a moral legitimacy and mandate which is superior to the laws and Constitution of this State and any agreements made by the Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">The truth, and this must be constantly repeated, is that Sinn Féin Members owe a deeper loyalty to this mythological view of Irish history than to the democratic organs of the State. They never deny that when it is put to them. If I am wrong, I ask them to deny it during the remainder of this debate. We will not hear it denied because that is the subservient, illogical, unhistorical and undemocratic yoke that sits around their necks.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The time has come for the people of Northern Ireland to be released from the threat of paramilitarism. That time came when the Good Friday Agreement was signed. The time has come and gone for some people to resile from moral ambiguity, ambivalent language and the practice of speaking from both sides of their mouths on where legitimacy resides in this State and in Northern Ireland. I remember with cringing clarity Deputy Ó Caoláin being asked, on the Vincent Browne radio programme, whether he would recommend people who had any information on the Omagh bombing to bring that information either to the Garda Síochána or the Police Service of Northern Ireland. I recall the obfuscation and deliberate evasion. It does not lie in the mouths of those who deny legitimacy to the Irish State even to advise those who know something about the murderous atrocities carried out by people claiming to be republican to bring those people before the Bar of justice North or South of the Border. The Deputy can now say what he wishes about that event but the tape exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">It is that fundamental moral ambiguity, writ large and infecting a series of issues, that has bedevilled progress on this island in implementing the Good Friday Agreement. It is this incapacity to deal fairly and squarely with the issues that has brought lack of trust and ill-feeling to the centre of Northern Ireland's politics. It has poisoned all the efforts of those who believe in the Good Friday Agreement to bring about renewed progress. I do not claim that all blame lies with the Provisionals—</p>

          <p eId="para_370">I listened carefully to the comments of Deputies Kenny, Deasy and Rabbitte on the outcome of the election. Of course, it presents new difficulties. However, let us remember other aspects of the result. One is the fact that 70% of the electorate in Northern Ireland voted for parties which support the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_372">Including Sinn Féin. Those parties are now entitled to have, within that 70%, the requisite degree of trust to bring about the reinstatement of the Executive and the institutions in Northern Ireland. They are entitled to look to Sinn Féin to make the necessary moves to bring about a clear and unequivocal state of affairs within Northern Ireland and on this island, to indicate that paramilitarism is over, that it has no future in Northern politics and that the paramilitaries are no longer pulling the strings behind the scenes. This is what people want to hear. It is what the provisional movement in its entirety can deliver when and if it chooses.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that the Good Friday Agreement is an agreement of constitutional importance and validity. It acknowledges that there must be a capacity to change and a process of review. We have arrived at that review but much more should have been achieved beforehand. Yesterday in Downing Street, the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister made it clear that the governments intend to set about the review with energy, focus and a sense of urgency to bring it to an early and fruitful conclusion. It is possible within that process to make such changes as are necessary to bring about the full implementation of what everyone thought they were voting for in the referenda held North and South of the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">In that context, the onus is very much on Sinn Féin, as the largest Nationalist party in Northern Ireland, to address the real issues of polarisation which have been magnified by the outcome of the election. It must undertake to address these issues with a sense of responsibility, having regard to what was the party's explicit and implicit commitment throughout the process. This was not merely to have nothing to do with violence, but to oppose the use and threat of violence by others, including the IRA.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">The two governments set out in paragraph 13 of the joint declaration what they believed this meant. Their view on the matter is shared by 95% of Irish people in regard to what violence or the absence of violence does or does not entail. It certainly means the ending of paramilitary activity, punishment beatings and preparation for operations of a paramilitary or unlawful kind. It is for Sinn Féin to convince the entire provisional movement that this is what it signed up to and it is what must be delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">On the other side of the equation, there has been a polarisation in Unionist opinion in Northern Ireland. There are many good men and women among the Unionist community who are looking to this House, this State, and even to this debate for some indication that there is a reciprocal sense in this State of what they want most of all, namely, to bring about democratic and constitutional politics in Northern Ireland, not politics which run in parallel with paramilitary activity and the activities of paramilitarists.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">It has been said on occasion that the unity of the provisional movement must be carefully conserved in all these matters, which is correct. I see the political logic in this. However, I say equally forcefully that the unambiguous demands of the Good Friday Agreement are that the provisional movement in its entirety should take on board what it purported to sign up to, which is the end of paramilitarism.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The commission threatens no one. It does not, even within its own terms of reference, carry the seeds of unfairness. It merely provides to those who want to see the end of paramilitarism some objective yardstick as to whether everyone in the Northern Ireland process is or is not abiding by the terms to which they agreed in public. The strong opposition being voiced to the agreement by a small minority of Members of this House is nothing compared to the expectations of the great majority of Irish people, North and South of the Border, that the Good Friday Agreement should finally be made to operate in accordance with the peaceful democratic and constitutional mandate which the people of Ireland have given to all the Members of this House, and public representatives in Northern Ireland, to bring about the working of the Agreement on a day to day basis.</p>

It was not the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, or his colleagues in the Progressive Democrats who took the risks or made the difference. His moralising and his lofty lecturing carried and still carries no weight in the achievement of all that has been achieved in recent years. The Deputies representing Sinn Féin in this House are among those who have taken the greatest risks and are here because of their commitment to political address of the differences and difficulties that have bedevilled us as an island people for generations.</p>

          <p eId="para_394">My clear understanding is that what we are looking at here is a proposition that runs contrary to an international agreement between the two sovereign Governments endorsed overwhelmingly by the people of Ireland. The proposition before us in the Bill runs contrary to the essence, the letter and the promise of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">I have made these points very clearly to the Minister. I reject his remarks not accepting the right to have an alternative view, a different vision and a different opinion. He labelled my contribution as untruths. That is not the case. Time will tell which of us was reflecting on the factual interpretation and understanding of what is involved in the Bill before us.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The Minister is right in that it is about ending all paramilitary activity, but it is also about an ending to the imposed militarisation by the British Government of the lives of ordinary citizens and of whole communities, an ending of oppressive legislation and a new and shared beginning that is respectful of all mandates, which was not in evidence here on Second Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">I proudly stand before the Minister and state that I disagree with him fundamentally on this proposition. I state further that section 1, which claims to offer an interpretation of what is before us, fails to reflect the reality that is at the heart of this Bill endorsing British legislation that gives ascendancy and power to the British Government beyond the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and beyond the terms negotiated by representatives of the Irish Government, the British Government and all those parties who were a party to the Good Friday Agreement, including the negotiating team of the party I represent here. I indicated I will be opposing the passage of the first section.</p>

I wonder whether it should state that the Bill undermines the intention of those who voted for that Agreement. Those who voted were way beyond the realms of support from my party or the Government parties. Nevertheless, the intentions were still the same, that a framework was built through negotiation and endorsed by the people. That is being lost through what is happening here with this legislation. It is a distortion of the Bill that the definition is not stated clearly.</p>

At the first available opportunity, although they choose to dilate another subject far beyond section 1, they have signally chosen to remain silent on that fundamental issue, from which I draw the conclusion that I was right and they were wrong.</p>

          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_408">In the course of his last contribution the Minister demonstrated once again that he believed he had Sinn Féin over a barrel. That is a foolish notion on the Minister's part and he should be very careful because he is the only one looking over the barrel and he might fall into it. We in Sinn Féin are democrats and are committed to the sovereignty of the people and to the democratic institutions established by them. If the Minister has not heard this from a Sinn Féin spokesman before, I state it clearly in my seventh year in this House, those institutions include this Dáil and the institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement. I wish to make that patently clear to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Section 2(1) of the Bill states that the commission is "independent in the performance of its functions". As I said on Second Stage, nothing could be further from the truth as the Minister knows all too well and he knows my points are valid. Any concept or construction which seeks to hold a party accountable for actions by others and subjects that party to sanctions runs contrary to democratic norms. There is no independence in that. Elected representatives get their mandate from the people, no less than the Minister. The idea in this proposition that the British Government has a right to disenfranchise a section of the electorate by virtue of the unilateral powers vested in it by this Bill is contrary to the notion of independent action and is a travesty of democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">I have great respect for many on the Government benches, whom I know personally and who are highly committed to their constituencies and are proud of their service to the Irish people. I acknowledge that they serve the people but they do not fully understand or appreciate what this Bill will do. We are almost lone voices on this matter. I invite them over the Christmas break to sit down, analyse and study carefully what is involved in this because the only 50-50 position between the Irish and British Governments on the Independent Monitoring Commission is the cost. In each of the elements negotiated the British Government has taken the lion's share.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">I am speaking about independence. Section 2 covers the status of the commission and the affirmation in the first part of that claims independence. There is no independence, as the Minister knows well, because he has given the British Government the power of unilateral action over the involvement and participation of democratically elected voices within the Northern institutions. If the British Government acts on the basis of recommendations or reports from the so-called Independent Monitoring Commission and gives effect to its power and powers of sanctions as now vested in it by the passage of this legislation, it will be in clear breach of the Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">The Minister should mark my words because every avenue will be explored to ensure that a defence is presented in support of the democratic right of all elected voices on this island to properly participate within the institutions and structures guaranteed by the Good Friday Agreement. The British Government has usurped the Agreement and in signing an agreement with the British ambassador, the Minister is complicit in accommodating that, with a Bill complementary to one already passed by the British Parliament. How many of the Deputies here have had the opportunity to study the so-called Northern Ireland (Monitoring Commission) Act 2003 and recognised the dangerous powers it vests in the British Government?</p>

        <speech by="#JohnEllis" eId="spk_240">
          <from>Mr. Ellis</from>
          <p eId="para_446">I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Donovan.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">I welcome the opportunity of making a small contribution on the National Economic and Social Development Office Bill. We all welcome this Bill and hope it will be passed and brought into operation as soon as possible. We are all aware that the office has been open since last February. This gives us an opportunity to look back on the economic development that has taken place in this country over the years. We are all aware that enormous strides have been made in that area. This Bill will provide structures to what has been an ongoing <i>ad hoc</i> operation in terms of development and relations in general, at a social or economic level. With this Bill we have an opportunity to regulate the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">We have seen enormous progress in this country over the past ten or 20 years. I recall the sort of problems we faced when I first became a Member of this House, which is perhaps further back than people might care to remember. The basic infrastructure, such as telephones, rail and road transport was lacking to a serious extent.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The first great step in Ireland's economic development was the introduction of free education. It was put crudely that free education was the opportunity to take the brains from the bog rather than leaving them in the bog. As a result of free education most people who desired it were given the opportunity to avail of second level and third level education. The benefits of free education may not have been foreseen at the time but the generation after the first beneficiaries of free second level education was fully aware of its importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Ireland's economy is now regarded as one of the most advanced in the world. Over 70% of the population have a third level qualification, which is of significant benefit. This statistic includes degree holders and those with training qualifications. It is important to ensure the education system continues to develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">The National Economic and Social Development Office Bill may be summarised as a national policy and institutional framework which is consistently highly focused on competitiveness and employment creation, innovation and problem-solving. The establishment of such a body will no doubt make a significant contribution to economic development.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">The rate of unemployment is at present the lowest in memory. During the recent economic downturn in other parts of the world, the Irish economy managed to continue to enjoy positive growth. This demonstrates the efforts of groups such as the trade unions, Government and local authorities. Every member of society, those dependent on social welfare and the employed, made a contribution to the development of the country. It is now regarded as the place to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">The economic development has not been exclusively concentrated, as some would argue, on the eastern seaboard and in the major cities. Development of the road and rail infrastructure means that no part of the country will be far removed from first class services. Last week saw the further roll out of broadband technology. It is probably the greatest technological development to take place in our lifetime and will encourage economic growth and lessen isolation. I look forward to broadband being available throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">Over the years some NESC reports seemed gloomy about the prospects for economic development, but they always made a positive contribution on the subject of the improvement of the economy. It is imperative to establish a full-time National Economic and Social Development Office. For many years there were <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements which worked very successfully but they did not have the back-up and services necessary. The establishment by the Government of the National Economic and Social Development Office will make a significant contribution. The Bill is sponsored by the Department of the Taoiseach. It demonstrates that the commitment of the Taoiseach and the Government to national economic and social development is wholehearted and total.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">This Bill will allow for sustained growth. The National Economic and Social Development Office will include NESC and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance. The primary role of NESDO will be to add value to the work of its constituent bodies by creating the conditions under which joint projects can be pursued and the potential for duplication minimised. The Bill sets up a grouping that will be co-ordinated and it will assist in the development of the entire economy. The most important decisions taken in recent times, such as the decision on decentralisation, will be of significant benefit. Rural areas will have the benefit of an influx of people in State employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I am pleased that Carrick-on-Shannon is to receive a section of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and another section is to be added to those already in Sligo. The Central Fisheries Board is being relocated to Carrick-on-Shannon. It is not desirable that centres such as Dublin, Cork and Galway grow at the expense of rural Ireland. Whether one lives in the north of Inishowen or Cahirciveen, one is entitled to have the same opportunities for development as those living in Dublin. It is no longer a hindrance to live outside the Pale.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">Many parts of the country benefit from much better social and educational facilities than in Dublin. The development of institutes of technology has made a significant contribution to economic and social development in the regions. They are a source of third level education which had previously been regarded as being beyond the means or young people or their parents. It has given those who did not have the chance of a degree course an opportunity to develop up to degree level. Many institutes including, the Sligo Institute of Technology, now offer degree courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">The National Economic and Social Forum has a particular mandate to evaluate and monitor the effectiveness of the policies and programmes for tackling inequality. This includes the issue of social inclusion in the context of social partnership agreements. We are all aware of the benefits of social partnership agreements. The trade unions are to be complimented for the manner in which they stood up to some sectional interests to ensure the full implementation of their recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The Irish workforce has made an important contribution to the economic development of the country. I welcome the Bill and I look forward to ensuring that the National Economic and Social Development Office makes the same contribution as legislated for in this Bill as it has done in the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement in the past.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DennisODonovan" eId="spk_241">
          <from>Mr. O'Donovan</from>
          <p eId="para_460">I welcome the Bill and I am glad to have the opportunity to speak. I thank Deputy Ellis for sharing his time with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">This Bill is a major step forward. We must compliment the Taoiseach on developing the National Economic and Social Development Office. It comprises the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance. It is important to put this in context. During the 1960s Seán Lemass was credited with the industrial revolution. The Taoiseach must take credit for the revolution in modern technology and for bringing success to this country, which is probably second to none in the world in terms of economic and social development and growth. When the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance, he was able to work with the social partners and the trade unions to bring forward development plans which were crucial in ensuring stability.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The previous speaker mentioned free education, which was introduced in 1967. There were approximately 2,000 students in UCC when I was a student there. There are now more than 10,000 students at the college. The Cork Institute of Technology has approximately the same number of students. That is a significant increase over 20 years. Our success in that area should be recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">Many of my family live in America and other countries. When I travel abroad, whether to Great Britain, other countries in Europe, America or Australia, I get the impression from people who left our soil many years ago that they are envious of the Government's success. That did not happen overnight or by accident. The previous speaker said we have the lowest unemployment figures he can remember. They are the lowest unemployment figures in the history of the State. It was predicted by some of our opponents 12 months ago that our inflation and unemployment figures would rise. However, that has not happened, due to the success of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. The prediction six or nine months ago was that inflation would rise to 6% or 7%. However, it has decreased significantly in the past two or three months.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Despite the forecast of doom and gloom, our unemployment figures are still low. When one compares that to other countries, such as Germany, whose unemployment figure is 10% or 11%, France, which has a similar unemployment rate, and the United Kingdom, we have done significantly well. I read recently that our GDP is the third best in the world. That success is linked to the approach taken by the Taoiseach. He must take credit for that success. If our inflation and unemployment figures and our interest rates were rising out of control, we would hear about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">We should not forget our past. I was obliged to emigrate and the unemployment rate was at a record high when I came back in the early 1980s. Some 60,000 or 70,000 people left the country each year during the mid 1980s. Interest rates were at 18% or 19%. I remember a time in the mid 1980s when farmers' backs were against the wall as they had to borrow to develop their farms and to carry out environmental works to prevent pollution. They were encouraged to borrow money. Interest rates increased from 6%, 7% or 8%, which are extremely high by current standards, to 18% or 19%. Surcharges meant that the figure was higher than that in some cases. During the 1980s some people could not borrow money. Banks insisted that people had to save a minimum of £4,000 for at least two years before they would give them a loan. They would not take the risk. Everything has changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">We often hear criticism about the housing situation in this country. I recently met representatives of the construction industry. It has reached its limit in terms of the number of houses built this year. It has delivered approximately 65,000 houses, which is phenomenal given the size of our population. If we can build 65,000 houses, America, which is the biggest economy in the world, should build approximately 2 million and the UK should build 900,000 housing units per annum. However, they are not building half that number. I am not saying there are no problems as regards social housing, but we have had significant success in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">The previous speaker mentioned infrastructure. When I was elected to the Seanad in 1989, I did not have the Newbridge bypass on my journey from west Cork to Dublin. The Kildare bypass was recently opened, which will help motorists to save time on a long journey. The Watergrasshill bypass and the Lee Tunnel were built recently and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, recently opened the Skiberreen bypass. If it had been said in 1990, which is not long ago, that Watergrasshill or Skiberreen would be bypassed and that the Lee Tunnel would be built, people would not have believed it. Our economy was not doing well and the emigration and unemployment figures were high. The country's morale was at its lowest in the history of the State. The Government has done extremely well.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">I praise the Taoiseach for bringing this Bill before the House. This will be the catalyst for further success. We have done well in this country and Dublin is probably the fastest growing city in Europe. There are still problems. We need Luas and an underground link from Dublin Airport to the city centre. Other infrastructural developments are also required, but much of the work is being done. I am delighted the Cashel and Fermoy bypasses have started and plans are under way for the Mitchelstown bypass. I welcome the Minister's announcement that he is proceeding to build a dual carriageway from Dublin to Cork. As someone who commutes on that route, I look forward to that development.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">I wish you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and everyone in the House a happy and holy Christmas and a prosperous new year. I hope we will all be back here this time next year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_242">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_470">I do not want to rain on people's parade in terms of partnership and the importance of this legislation. However, the introduction of this Bill should be an opportunity for us to seriously debate the position of social partnership as it has developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">The NESC celebrated its fortieth anniversary this year, yet we are seeking to create a super structure to incorporate that in a legislative framework. I have not heard the full extent of this debate but from those whose contributions I have heard, there is no consciousness of the serious weaknesses in the partnership model as we have developed it. It is time for a searching analysis of the way in which the partnership model works.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">Many people were dismayed by the benchmarking process, whereby insiders in the partnership system put a deal together. The information on which pay settlements were to be based was never made available to the taxpayers who have had to pay for it. All the information was shredded and was not available under the Freedom of Information Act. No one receiving the awards knew why they were to get them. The Government was supposed to embrace a serious agenda to change the public service. Some 75% of the award was to be conditional on that reform, yet the Government put forward no such agenda. None of the so-called partners was pushed beyond any of its established positions as part of the benchmarking agreement to deliver quality and improved public services to people who depend on them. Instead, we will see next year, as we have this year, many services for the most needy in our community being curtailed because pay is pre-empting budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">We have seen cuts in the crèche allowance for the most disadvantaged children. I know the sort of people who are in receipt of this allowance in my area and they are highly disadvantaged families who need this support. The same argument applies in respect of those who require the dietary allowance. We have ended up doing the very opposite to what a sensitive partnership arrangement should have done. That is not an accident; it has happened because of serious flaws in the way the partnership has been put together. Patients, parents, consumers, environmentalists and others had no seats at the partnership talks. Essentially, the partnership comprises the old producer-dominated structures. Trade unions and employers are still the first division players who drive the partnership's agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">It is no surprise that we have created rip-off Ireland in recent years, having given such credence to the views of producers in our system while ignoring consumers' rights. We have some of the worst consumer legislation, which has remained unchanged in recent years. Any initiatives on consumer protection have come from the EU, which we seek to transpose into our domestic legislation, but consumers have no say in the partnership model and neither do parents. As a result, the producer unions and management companies have called the shots on education reform. The parent organisations are extremely weak and we still have no accountability for what is happening in our schools. For example. we do not know what the literacy standards are in any of our schools because there is no obligation to create structured reports on school performance. This is no accident. It is because of the way in which we have given producer interests so much control in the partnership process and they have slowed down the pace of public service reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">They may not be paragons of virtue on the neighbouring island but they have certainly started to reform the accountability of educational institutions. Under a more accountable system here, we might be able to find out why a school is not doing well and then do something about it. Most schools that are not performing well are probably in disadvantaged areas where teachers are working hard with the most disadvantaged pupils, yet they do not get access to additional resources because we, the legislators, do not see what the problems are. We do not get the sort of reporting that we ought to. A genuine partnership that tries to embrace such problems would not tolerate a situation where one in five students leaves school without sitting the leaving certificate. One in six leaves school unable to read or interpret the instructions on the side of an aspirin packet. That is a blight on the education system. Unless we face up to those difficulties and put in place structures to bring them continually to our attention, we will be failing to develop a proper partnership model.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">It is no accident that Sustaining Progress, the deal the Government cut with the various partners, including the unions, has never been debated in this House. No one regards that as strange. Some 166 people were elected to this House to shape the way the country is run and resolve conflicts in society – and there are many such conflicts that need to be addressed – yet that partnership agreement never came up for debate and our views could be expressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">All the previous agreements were debated in the House but, perhaps unconsciously, the Government now sees the Oireachtas as being less and less important in making decisions about our economy and society in general. Whether deliberately or by accident, the Government has become an ally of the lobbyist approach whereby important conflicts are not resolved openly here by elected representatives but in back rooms where aficionados of different bodies have access to the Government in order to shape and conclude deals. That is not the sort of political accountability we want to see in a modern democracy. If partnership becomes allied to this diminution in the importance of the Oireachtas, as it has in recent times, it will be a bad deal both for social partnership and parliamentary democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">The Oireachtas is effectively copper-fastening what is already there, while the Taoiseach has the power to change matters as they evolve. However, there is no attempt by either the Taoiseach or his Ministers to challenge seriously whether the partnership deal is achieving what we want it to do. The collapse in the importance and public recognition of the Oireachtas has occurred because alternative fora are available to people who want to influence the decision-making process. These fora are predominantly unelected and unaccountable.</p>

          <p eId="para_482">I will be happy to give Deputy Richard Bruton another few moments, if he so wishes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_247">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_483">I will be brief. We should step back and ask whether or not the partnership as it is now constituted – with the first division players, including the employers and trade unions, and a mixed group representing the community and voluntary sectors – is really meeting the needs of a modern democracy. There are big issues concerning the accountability of the decision makers in that partnership process and how the Oireachtas should interface with the developing partnership model. Giving the Oireachtas 15 places on the National Economic and Social Forum is ridiculous. It is not the way in which the Oireachtas can hold the partnership model to account. We, the elected representatives, should hold these bodies to account for their decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">The partnership process was born at a time when the economy had become a basket case and deep industrial divisions were costing us jobs. People came together to deal with those issues and avoid self-destruction but because partnership was part of an important recovery period, we have overlooked its weaknesses and have been unwilling to scrutinise it properly. Unfortunately, I do not see in this legislation any way in which the Oireachtas and its elected Members can challenge the often false consensus that passes for this type of debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">I heard a former trade union leader – I will not name him, although most people will know to whom I am referring – remarking recently at the 40th anniversary of the partnership process how conformist the system had become and how much uniformity of opinion was emerging through the process. That is bad because many of the challenges we face require robust debate by elected representatives, such as ourselves. That sort of robust debate is being lost, however.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach" eId="spk_248">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Ms Hanafin)</from>
          <p eId="para_486">Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí ar fad a labhair ar an mBille seo, a Bill which allows us to implement one of our commitments under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, namely, that the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, NCPP, would be located within the National Economic and Social Development Office.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">It is some months since the Bill started its passage through the Dáil and quite a number of Deputies have spoken on it. Even in the few months we have been discussing it, we have witnessed the way the economic climate has changed, both globally and at home. It is in that context, when looking at this particular Bill, that we can see the importance of it in terms of how well the economy has done, the way we managed to overcome the challenges facing us and in comparing what happened in 1987 when the idea of partnership started. That is something that was addressed today by Deputies Ellis, O'Donovan and Bruton. It is useful to remember the position in 1987—</p>

          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_488">Partnership started 40 years ago.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_250" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach">
          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_489">Sorry, I mean the national agreements. The first national agreement was back in 1987 and it is worthwhile remembering, as Deputies pointed out today, that the unemployment rate was 17.5%, inflation was 12%, emigration was at its highest and, as the two Deputies on this side of the House mentioned, the infrastructure and borrowing situation we were in at that time. We have come a long way from that and built an economy that is much admired, not just here but abroad. The progress made has been outstanding. It is always useful to remind ourselves that the unemployment rate is just over 4%, the inflation rate is just over 2% and that we remain a very competitive country. The reason we are so successful is because of partnership and the various agreements negotiated. We strongly believe we need to continue that if we are to remain competitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">The discussions with the social partners over the past number of years focused realistically on the economic position but also on the social situation. They deal not just with competitiveness but also with economic growth and ensuring that people across the board can benefit from the process. The one point I would probably accept from Deputy Bruton is that we may have missed an opportunity to discuss Sustaining Progress in this House. That is something that probably should become part of our regular agenda when agreements are reached and it is something we will look to in the future. The goals are ones to which we all aspire: economic inclusion based on full employment; consistent economic development that is socially and environmentally sustainable; social inclusion; a commitment to social justice; and a continuing adaptation to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">I am disappointed that from the beginning to the end of this debate, each of the Fine Gael contributions have been critical of the partnership process.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_251">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_492">As are the partners themselves. The Minister of State should talk to them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_252" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach">
          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_493">It cannot be a coincidence that it started with the contribution of the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Kenny, when he decided to question the whole process. There is no problem with questioning a process but to be entirely critical of the way it has worked is too negative a view of a process which has obviously worked for the benefit of this country for the past number of years and which continues to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">I do not accept that partnership is a type of club that excludes the disadvantaged in our society and which only has people of influence in it. One only has to look at the membership of the community and voluntary pillars to see that sitting around the table are individual members like CORI, the INOU, the NYC, Protestant Aid and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. Those very groups represent the most disadvantaged in our society. There are various other strands including Age Action Ireland, representing older people, the Irish Council for Social Housing, the Children's Rights Alliance, etc. How can one claim, therefore, that it is an advantaged club and that the people who should be socially included are being left out?</p>
          <p eId="para_495">Another major point which has come up frequently in this context is that those who sign up to partnership agreements do not represent the rank and file membership of the organisations they represent. Benchmarking has crept into this debate as well. What saddens me about the benchmarking debate, particularly from the perspective of Fine Gael, is that it appears to think that benchmarking will be paid to anonymous people doing anonymous jobs sitting in anonymous places. What we are talking about are the nurses in our hospitals, the gardaí on our streets, the teachers in our schools and our public servants who ensure that the mechanism of government works well. These are the people who will benefit from benchmarking and who will, from next month, get the money they deserve for the work they are doing based on a comparative process of salaries at other levels here and abroad. It is to their credit that the various groups involved in working out benchmarking ensured that people down the line would gain in terms of their salaries and, in return, give the type of service expected of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">Deputy Bruton talked about the role of partnership in education. He will be the first to admit that over the past number of years the concept of partnership, albeit not formally recognised in much legislation although it is in some, has crept into many of our schools. As late as yesterday I was in a school in my own constituency, St. Anne's in Shankill, albeit to announce its new building, and I met 30 parents who go into the school every morning to do reading classes with groups of children. That is a direct involvement of parents in that school every day. One of the parents told me that if they see a child one day who is not good at reading it might be because the child is just tired but if the same child is not good at reading the following day and the day after that, obviously there is a problem. That is the type of partnership that is working on the ground and will tackle the type of issues Deputy Bruton talked about in respect of literacy. The concept of partnership exists but what has to be overcome is the fear among parents in disadvantaged communities that they are being excluded in some way from the school but that will not be addressed by way of legislation. That has to happen by way of encouragement, entitlement and working closely together on the ground. I believe that is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Another issue raised in terms of social partnership was whether the process was inclusive. Of all aspects, the NESF is a good example of how the social partnership institution can be inclusive. We have talked here about the various bodies involved in it, and it is a forum on which we can have representatives of the Oireachtas, employers, unions, farming organisations, the voluntary and community sectors, central and local government and Independents. It might be useful, however, if all the parties in this House made their nominations to that body so that Members of the Oireachtas could have their voice heard on it. It is unusual to have that combination of people sharing their thoughts, developing policies and coming up with ideas. It is intended that this will continue because I am aware it is successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">As a woman I regret the fact that the National Women's Council and the Community Platform decided not to accept the terms of Sustaining Progress. I believe they not only isolated themselves but many women also. Not being part of social partnership is to their detriment if not to the detriment of the partnership process as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">One of the issues raised by a number of Deputies in the debate was the question of resources. The savings being made are as a result of the three bodies being relocated into one premises in Dublin. There is no effect on staff, and there will not be any cutbacks in that area. It is just a saving in terms of relocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Another issue raised was the importance of the small economy, etc., but Deputy Carey raised the idea of being competitive. The role of partnership 40 years ago and in 1987, when we had the first agreement, was quite different from what it is now but that does not mean it is not valid. It is as valid today as it was on the first day but it is playing a completely different role now to the role it played then. That is why I find Fine Gael's criticism of it particularly disturbing. Instead of examining how it reflects the type of society in which we now live and its current social and economic requirements, the party appears to do little other than knock it. I would be worried about the future of partnership if the Fine Gael Party was ever elected to Government. Partnership has delivered a strike free economy, wage agreements and the involvement of social partners in a manner never achieved before.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">I hope we will be able on Committee Stage to tease out some of these ideas and that in doing so, Deputies will come to realise and accept the value of the various bodies working in this area, particularly those referred to and to which the Bill refers. I am sure Deputy Finian McGrath, who made a number of particularly interesting points on the legislation, will participate in the Committee Stage debate.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism" eId="spk_256">
          <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</from>
          <p eId="para_510">I met the IRFU on 10 December and received from them further proposals on development options for Lansdowne Road, with a view to providing state-of-the-art facilities which would address the stadium requirements of the major sporting bodies. These proposals are complementary to the options tabled by the IRFU and FAI earlier this year, involving the provision of a 65,000 seater stadium at a number of locations, including Abbotstown and Lansdowne Road.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">These discussions were resumed on 16 December when I met IRFU and FAI representatives in my office. They presented supplementary information by way of elaboration on the 10 December proposals. The thrust of this latest proposal is to present an option for the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road capable of meeting the needs of the major sporting bodies. I am having this new material evaluated in consultation with the Office of Public Works, which acts as technical adviser to my Department on the project.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">With regard to the opening up of Croke Park or possible lease arrangements, I reaffirm my frequently expressed public view that this is a matter for the GAA alone to consider and decide on. My position on this issue is known. I do not, however, wish to engage in hypothetical speculation on issues around suggestions that the GAA should lease Croke Park to the Government or any other methodologies for that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">Taking account of the issues highlighted in the various proposals for stadium development, the outcome of my discussions with the sporting bodies as well as the information gleaned in response to the initiative to secure privately funded facilities, and taking into account the likely demand on the Exchequer to fund such a facility, it is my intention to present to the Government for decision the various options for meeting the stadium needs of the sporting organisations at the earliest possible date. In this regard, I wish to place on record once again that the Abbotstown site will be one of the options before Government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_257">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_514">Surely the Minister agrees it is now time to move from vanity to sanity and from dreams to reality? The time for dithering, obfuscation and procrastination is now over. A report by Ove Arup Consulting Engineering is strongly in favour of building a new stadium at Lansdowne Road, which would include seating for 50,000 people and cost approximately €250 million, of which €80 million would be returned to the State in tax. The facility would be a new, modern international stadium with strong aesthetic qualities, which would receive positive recognition internationally due to its world class facilities. It would also have a minimal impact on adjoining residents because of the curved profile of the east and west stands and the low level of the north and south stands. It would concentrate spectators towards the centre of the pitch and capacity would be adequate for most fixtures. In addition, it would be good value for money and could accommodate GAA fixtures. Surely the proposal warrants an immediate decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">I am concerned that the Minister has again stated he will make a decision at the earliest possible date. Will he be more definitive and clarify when he intends to make a decision on the proposal by the IRFU, which is supported by the FAI, the Fine Gael Party and, I am sure, the other party spokespersons on sport? Fine Gael and other parties have been recommending this solution to the Government for four year. It is now decision time. The IRFU and FAI are losing out considerably due to Government inaction and its failure to make a decision. We are faced with the potentially embarrassing situation internationally of the FAI being forced to decide shortly where to play home matches, while the IRFU could also be forced to consider other options, including playing their home matches abroad. Opening up Croke Park is another question.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_517">The issue before us is about making a decision on a well-costed stadium proposal. Will the Minister make a decision and present definitive proposals to Cabinet in January? Will we have a decision in one month?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_260" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_518">This Government has nothing to be ashamed of with regard to the provision of sports facilities or investment in sport, which has been massive. Since the Taoiseach first brought the position of sport to the Cabinet table in 1997, the amount of money allocated for sport has increased from approximately €17 million to €176 million per annum. Developments, such as the national aquatic centre, have been a tremendous credit to the Government and country.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">It is incorrect of the Deputy to suggest I have been dithering. The opposite is the truth. In September last year, the Government made a decision to the effect that it could not proceed with the proposal at Abbotstown from Exchequer funding due to economic circumstances and mandated me to seek expressions of interest from the private sector, which I duly did. Once these were evaluated, I asked the sporting associations, the IRFU and FAI, to make proposals, which they did. Subsequently, they sought an opportunity to provide some clarity on their proposals, which they also did, and the Office of Public Works has been examining the proposals in the interim. In those circumstances, I fail to see the logic of Deputy Deenihan's argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">The current position is that I have sufficient information, other than the final evaluation of the latest document presented by the IRFU and FAI, to go to Government. This documentation should be ready soon and I have stated publicly my wish to bring the relevant memorandum to Government for decision at some point in January. As I have pointed out on numerous occasions, the memorandum will include the various options the Government can consider and, having done so, it will, in its wisdom, make a decision. I have also repeatedly indicated my personal desire to construct a new stadium, because the IRFU and FAI unquestionably require a home. I believe the sporting public has also identified the need for such a stadium.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_261">
          <from>Mr. Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_521">Each time the Minister has been questioned in the House in the past six months, questions on a national stadium have been taken as a priority. However, despite all the reports, it seems that no conclusion has been reached. When the relevant reports from the IRFU and the FAI came on stream I thought a decision would finally be made. The Minister has conceded that all the Opposition parties have supported his endeavours.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">Media coverage on the latest meetings of the IRFU and FAI indicates the total cost of their proposals would be €250 million. When the VAT reclaim etc. is removed that brings it down to a possible €85 million. Will the Minister say whether an offer of £50 million from Mr. J. P. McManus is on the backburner as regards a national stadium and facility? Mr. McManus has a reputation for supporting all sports, including soccer, due to his links with Manchester United. It would be a cheap stadium for the Government if one was to take the reclaim of the VAT and the offer of £50 million into account. That would possibly put the provision of the IRFU and the FAI at around €35 million, which would make it good value for them. This would be an obvious solution given the problems facing the FAI as regards the European and world championships and the safety and health factors that the IRFU will face.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">Is it not time that we put this to bed and moved on? It is raised continuously at Question Time and is covered regularly in the media. I was concerned when, within a few days of his meeting with the FAI and the IRFU, the Minister indicated that he would like Croke Park to be opened to other sports. That may muddy the waters in terms of the Government's intentions. A concrete proposal now exists, which, given the facts as regards costs presented in the media, could be the cheapest option for the Government. I would ask the Minister to bring this to Government, get it done and dusted and allow the IRFU and the FAI to move forward with their plans for the Six Nations Championship and the world championships and allied arrangements. Will the Minister say when a decision will be made and when this matter is to be put to bed once and for all? Let us stop muddying the waters and be positive as regards reaching a decision.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_262" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_524">I have been clear and consistent from the outset as regards this issue and have repeatedly stated that a new stadium is necessary. I have also been fair and open with all of the sporting organisations concerned. I let them know my views and my door has been open at all times to discuss the issue. On 10 December, the IRFU requested further time to make another submission and I gladly acceded to that because I believe all sides of the argument deserve a hearing.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">Deputy Deenihan, in the course of his contribution, seemed to indicate that the Ove Arup report comes down in favour of Lansdowne Road. That is a matter for interpretation. Others will strongly argue that any stadium should be at Abbotstown on the grounds that it would provide the opportunity for future Governments to build a campus there which could host major international events in years to come. They pointedly refer to the tremendous success which the National Aquatic Centre has been during the recent European short course championships. Experts on swimming from across Europe were laudatory of the facilities and records were broken. It is a great tribute to the resilience and progress of Irish sport that the Government has located such a facility there.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">In answer to Deputy Wall, I have not had the opportunity of advising Mr. McManus of the precise proposals, but I am sure I will in due course. When I do, Mr. McManus will no doubt make up his own mind. However, I would like to record again my deep appreciation of the magnificent gift of £50 million he has offered the State towards the construction of a national stadium. I hope this has dealt with the matters raised. The issue is one which requires decision. It is clear from FAI and IRFU statements that these bodies regard their positions as untenable. I fully understand and appreciate that and have articulated that view.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_263">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_527">I thank the Minister for his reply and note that today's questions are largely on the same theme, sport. That generally reflects public opinion. Will the Minister say if he has been involved in any meetings with the GAA, formal or informal, with regard to the future use of Croke Park and if he considers that such meetings might be of benefit? If the Government was to lease Croke Park, it would remove the dilemma of Rule 42 for the GAA. This would make sense. As Deputy Deenihan stated earlier, we have many international matches next year and it would be terrible if we had to go abroad when a fantastic stadium such as Croke Park exists. There should at least be discussions on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">Does the Minister believe it would be beneficial to take a lead role and invite the IRFU, the FAI and the GAA to round table talks? Their respective constitutions may not allow any of these bodies to initiate such talks but the Government should take the initiative in this regard. That might be beneficial for all three organisations. Religions that are diametrically opposed to each other can share the same church buildings. Sports bodies should be able to share the same facilities as well. In general, the same sports fans go to soccer and GAA matches and go racing. Such a move would facilitate such sports people. To have a world class stadium used in this fashion would send out a positive message about Ireland. I would ask the Minister to take the initiative in this regard. Croke Park is officially used only 21 times per year. That is an under use of a fantastic resource. Will the Minister consider taking a lead role by inviting the three national organisations to talks?</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_529">I doubt if there has been a Minister who has met the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI on more occasions within the same timeframe, since I assumed this portfolio. As regards Croke Park, even if the GAA hierarchy wanted to negotiate it could not do so, as Deputy Connolly will be aware. It would require a vote of the congress of the GAA to lift Rule 42. As regards the resolution of the problem, I have consistently stated that Croke Park on its own is not the solution. That much is clear. The FAI and the IRFU have also made it clear on numerous occasions and have outlined their cogent reasons in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">As I have been outlining for some time, the memorandum is being finalised and it will go to the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">Since I was appointed Minister, and I do not mean to blow my own trumpet, there has been clarity about the options. We have also engaged fairly with the relevant sporting organisations. The sporting public wants the issue resolved to ensure that rugby and soccer can prosper. Indeed, it is also the public's wish that the same would apply to our national games.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_532">All Members agree that a second stadium is needed for rugby and soccer. The question is about where and when. It is also important that the Minister state his personal preference. Will the Minister confirm that the Government will make a definitive statement in January on whether the stadium will be in Abbotstown or Lansdowne Road? Will the Minister indicate his personal preference? It is a fair question and he must have a preference. The IRFU and the FAI firmly support the Lansdowne Road proposal. That should be enough to convince the Government that this is the optimum site. Fine Gael has always favoured the Lansdowne Road option because of cost and location. The infrastructure already exists and that would save money. There is also a feeling among the sporting fraternity that this is the optimum site.</p>

          <p eId="para_533">The principal Opposition parties have been most supportive of the concept of a new stadium for which I am grateful. It would be unfair not to acknowledge it.

Did the Minister make him aware at that meeting that the IRFU and the FAI did not see Croke Park as the answer to all their problems? My second question relates to the costs of the proposed new stadium at Lansdowne Road. The cost is said to be €250 million. If the same 55,000 seat stadium that is proposed for Lansdowne Road was located in Abbotstown, would the cost be the same?</p>

          <p eId="para_543">The question of whether the proposed stadium for Lansdowne Road could be transferred to Abbotstown for the same cost reminds me of the song "If We Only Had Old Ireland Over Here". It is a difficult question that will have to be resolved by the Office of Public Works, which will cost the various options we will subsequently put to the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">I have tried to keep all the sporting organisations informed of progress on the options. People have been frustrated by the fact that meetings had to take place, reports had to be produced and examined by the Office of Public Works and that the issue has to be brought back to the Government. However, I have no intention of going to Government with half-baked proposals. I will go with proposals that are solid in their own right and let the Government make its decision.

Such a meeting might yield results in the context of there being a positive proposal to discuss but, at this point, I am not in a position to put a definitive proposal to any of them and they are aware of that. Until I am, I doubt that a meeting of the type envisaged by Deputy Connolly, although the suggestion is well intentioned, would be of benefit.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_280">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_550">On 29 January 2003, the Government authorised me to invite expressions of interest by way of public invitation from the private sector in participating, on the basis of a PPP, in the capital redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre in or around the vicinity of the site of the existing theatre. My Department, with the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works, is working to implement that decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">To be compatible with the functions, profile and status of a national theatre and to address the acknowledged defects with the existing theatre, a redeveloped premises would need to meet certain requirements. It would need to be a signature development, representative of a national theatre in the 21st century. It would have to be in an appropriate civic setting and form part of the overall urban regeneration represented by the O'Connell Street integrated area plan and the north-east inner city plan. There would be three significant enlarged auditoria – the Abbey, the Peacock and a third multipurpose space. There would also have to be: a dedicated education and outreach facility; a publicly accessible archive; restaurant/bar; improved public areas; disabled access for audiences and artists; and best practice theatre production facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">For the Abbey and the Peacock to function efficiently, effectively and without compromise, their basic functioning must not depend on movement of goods and people by mechanical lift. In essence, this means that the stages of both the Abbey and Peacock theatres must be positioned at ground level. In addition, both theatres must have easy access, also at the same level, to the scenery store and the prop store. It is agreed between the management of the Abbey and the Office of Public Works that there is a requirement for a ground floor footprint that is considerably larger than now exists. For the theatre to stay in its existing location, therefore, it will be necessary to acquire properties adjacent to the existing premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">The Office of Public Works has received a report from property consultants who were engaged to assess the property acquisition issues arising in this context. That report is now being considered. The ultimate timeframe that will apply to this development is not yet clear.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_555">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. Given that the Abbey Theatre will celebrate its centenary next year, it is important to make progress on this issue. The Government decided four years ago to build a national stadium and as yet there is no stadium. I hope the Abbey saga will not continue for another four years.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">Is the Minister familiar with the two reports commissioned and completed in 2001 by his predecessor? Would it be a good idea if he revisited the proposals contained in the report? Would it be possible for the report to be published? I understand the reports suggested that the problems now being faced by the Office of Public Works and the Abbey authorities regarding space could have been resolved by moving to Grand Canal Harbour.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">In the context of providing a new national concert hall, surely it is not too late to consider the possibility of a joint venture between the National Concert Hall and the Abbey Theatre? There is a model for this in Sydney which some of us visited recently. The chief executive of the Sydney Opera House would be willing to advise on his experience in Sydney, having travelled throughout the world, including to Japan, America and Europe, looking at similar models where opera and drama are conducted under the one roof. This saves a lot of expense. There could be joint ticketing and a state-of-the-art facility. It could be an icon which would represent this generation. Before proceeding further, the Minister might revisit the reports. Perhaps he should get advice from people like the chief executive of the Sydney Opera House who comes from Lurgan. It is not too late to go forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">In the event of the Office of Public Works getting the required space, when does the Minister propose proceeding to a formal invitation for expressions of interest in the event of a definitive decision being made to go ahead with the Abbey project on the existing site?</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_559">Obviously reports of this nature contain commercially sensitive information on properties and so on. Therefore it would not be desirable to publish them.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">On the question of timeframes, the best I can do is take each step at a time. There is little point in speculating as to what timeframes might be involved because I do not know. If we are to have meaningful invitations for expressions of interest, it is important to have a realistic chance of attracting worthwhile responses. It is important at this point to get the process right from the point of view of securing a successful long-term outcome. Proper preparation must be done and, unfortunately, time is of necessity involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">On Deputy Deenihan's suggestion in regard to the Sydney Opera House, I wish I could convince the Minister for Finance of the merits of the Deputy's suggestion. In the current climate, I am not hopeful of doing so. We are trying to proceed by way of a PPP.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_283">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_564">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 6 and 11 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">Irish traditional arts are a precious and fundamental part of our national cultural life. In an increasingly uniform world, our arts, like our language, say something special about who we are, where we came from as a people and what distinguishes us and our culture from others in the world. Very many people enjoy the traditional arts, but even those whose taste runs in other directions would say that our distinctive Irish art forms are special, that they are worth protecting and that if we lost them we would be much the poorer.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">I am aware of the sense of dissatisfaction that exists within the traditional arts sector with the treatment that the sector has received over the years. Accordingly, I have now set up a special committee on the traditional arts under the Arts Act 2003, as I promised, to examine these issues in detail and to furnish a view to the council by September 2004. The committee's task is to formulate advice to the Arts Council, not to dictate to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">The special committee system is in my view a well balanced one. The chair, who is selected from the membership of the council, and two ordinary members, are appointed by the Minister of the day, with the remaining two ordinary members appointed by the council itself. The terms of reference for the committee provide that its advice should include specific recommendations regarding the future role of the Arts Council in respect of support for the traditional arts, taking account of existing support systems, facilities and funding programmes for supporting the traditional arts across all Government Departments, non-Governmental agencies and local authorities; the applicability and relevance of the terms ‘amateur', ‘professional' and ‘voluntary' in contemporary practice in traditional arts and, if the committee considers it appropriate, proposals for an effective framework for assessing funding proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">This should include a review of whether the position of the traditional arts in the cultural life of the nation is appropriately reflected in the assignments within the council's authorised staffing complement. Proposals must be framed in accordance with the Government's current policy on the need to reduce public service staff numbers.</p>

          <p eId="para_569">The Minister will be aware that when the Arts Bill was being debated major reservations were expressed by the arts community on section 21 of the Bill. It is a long time since that flawed Bill was debated but as it has been passed there is nothing we can do. Even though the Minister is passing the issue on to a special committee, there may be some room for him to intervene. What steps will he take to ensure traditional music does not become divided from other sections of the traditional arts? When section 21 was being debated, it was pointed out that if there was a traditional section on one side—</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_572">The objective of the amendment to the relevant section of the Arts Act was to ensure there would be no marginalisation or ghettoisation of the traditional arts or any part thereof. This has been achieved by the establishment of a standing committee which will advise the Arts Council. There will be no council within a council. The Arts Council will not be dictated to by me or by the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">I am anxious to ensure that we will have a coherent policy for the traditional arts in the future. I have made clear on a number of occasions the importance of the traditional arts remaining within the mainstream of Irish art forms. This is uppermost in the minds of the Arts Council and the committee dealing with the traditional arts. If a coherent policy is formulated arising from the deliberations of the standing committee, which will be of limited duration, we should then try to secure sufficient funding to enable the policy to be given artistic expression.</p>

          <p eId="para_574">When the Arts Bill was going through the House, section 21, on which we all received numerous representations, was the part most debated. I happen to agree with the structure the Minister has put in place. It is reflective of what is required to obtain an overall picture of the position of the traditional arts. My only concern is that, as has been stated in the media, this committee must report back by 1 September 2004.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_579">It is true the time is limited. I appreciate Deputy Wall's support for the amendment when it was introduced. It is short because there is growing expectation among people interested in this area that at long last a coherent policy will be established and they will be able to see results from the Arts Act in the short-term. I hope we can achieve that. To ensure it happens, we have placed a heavy responsibility on the members of the committee. They fully understand this and realise that much time and work will be required to formulate the advice the committee will give to the Arts Council. However, the Arts Council itself is constantly making progress and will perhaps be able to develop the policy over the longer term.</p>

          <p eId="para_580">Will the Minister confirm whether the standing committee will report directly to the Arts Council or to the Minister himself? A commitment was made to set up a standing committee on education. Does the Minister intend to direct the Arts Council to carry out a similar process in this area? Will he confirm it is his wish that the Arts Council should provide for the traditional arts more than 1% of its funding, as it has done in the past? Does he think the report of the standing committee will ensure adequate funding for the traditional arts?</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_583">I set up the committee in the sense that I instructed that it be set up. The Arts Council appointed the chairperson and I appointed the other two members. The advice from the committee goes directly to the Arts Council, which formulates the policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">With regard to the percentage of funding to be given to the traditional arts, Deputy Deenihan will be aware that under the legislation the Arts Council is entirely independent in the exercise of that function and must be allowed, for sound reasons, to make that decision itself. I have expressed the wish that the traditional arts be adequately funded, but I have no direct control over the matter. My function is to try to obtain a sufficient amount of money from the Minister for Finance for the Arts Council, which allocates the funding independently. I am pleased that the amount of money for the Arts Council budget for next year has been increased by 19%. This should be of enormous benefit to the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">I have expressed a desire to institute a standing committee on education and I know Deputy Deenihan has also expressed this wish in the past. It is a praiseworthy objective. I am not sure whether we will set up the committee in the immediate future as I am concerned about having too many standing committees at once. We will keep the matter under review and I will consider it seriously.</p>

          <p eId="para_588">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 30 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">I am close to finalising the composition and membership of the high level group to implement the tourism action plan recommended by the tourism policy review group and I expect to make an announcement in the near future. Notwithstanding the setting up of the implementation group, a number of the recommended actions directed at my Department and the tourism State agencies are already under way. For example, the tourism unit of my Department has been reconfigured, advertisements seeking expressions of interest for the national conference centre have been placed in the media and bilateral consultations have taken place with the Department of Finance on taxation and with the Department of Health and Children on the anti-smoking regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">Fáilte Ireland's recently published summary operational plan for 2004 outlines how many of the recommendations in the report of the review group have been incorporated into its operational planning in the areas of product development, skills training and tourism marketing. A welcome development by Fáilte Ireland has been its new initiative to address the cost of insurance across the sector in co-operation with industry representative groups, including the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">Similarly, Tourism Ireland has completed an examination of the recommendations contained in the report of the tourism policy review group that affect the areas within its remit. It has incorporated a number of these into its three year marketing strategy and detailed operating plan for 2004, which I launched in Dublin last week. Their marketing, trade activity and access strategies are in line with the review group's overall framework. While the bulk of marketing resources will be focused on the best prospective markets for Ireland – Britain, the United States, France and Germany – Tourism Ireland will also continue to look for opportunities in developing markets. It will play a leading role in supporting additional direct, convenient and competitive access services into Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_592">Will the Minister confirm that this high level implementation group will have clear responsibility and a timeframe for each set of actions? Will the group address the question of competitiveness? During the last Question Time I mentioned that Ireland has the highest wine tax, the second highest beer tax and the third highest spirits tax in Europe. It is now the second most expensive of the 15 EU member states. Although it was fifth from the bottom in 1999 it is now markedly more expensive than our main competitors, such as Greece, Spain and Portugal. It also has the second highest VAT rate in the eurozone – Germany has the highest. Our VAT rate, 13.5%, may be compared to those of France, 5.5%, and Spain, 7%. Will the high level implementation group tackle these major issues?</p>
          <p eId="para_593">Our greatest problem is competitiveness. We are pricing ourselves out of the market. Most of the price increases responsible for this are directly controlled by the Government, in the form of the Minister for Finance. He did nothing about this in the recent budget other than to increase the tax on petrol, which added to our lack of competitiveness. Will the implementation group address this issue when it implements the recommendations of the report?</p>

          <p eId="para_597">The issue of competitiveness is dealt with in the report. The implementation group will be charged with implementing all recommendations which are feasible. In that regard I intend to appoint a tightly knit group. Within a period of six months we will seek a progress report. After the implementation group has been in existence for a year there will be a forum where it will be possible for interested parties to discuss with the group its progress on implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">I regard the task of the implementation group as of pivotal importance. It will ensure that Ireland's tourism image and product remains at the highest standard and that we are able to compete with the best internationally and that we have the relevant access to enable people to get here. I am confident those whom I have identified as suitable for membership of the implementation group are capable of doing the business.</p>

If there is a need for legislation, will the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment have to deal with it? To say the group will look at insurance in the overall is a bland statement. Given that a Department other than the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and Sport deals with insurance, how will the link be created to address what is the major problem? The Minister was correct in what he had to say about addressing the insurance problem. How can it be done if it is not in the realm of his own ministerial control and is not linked to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment?</p>

          <p eId="para_603">The closing date for receipt for applications under the current round of the local authority swimming pool programme was 31 July 2000 and 55 applications have or are being dealt with under this round. Because of the long lead-time associated with such projects, it can take some time for projects to come to fruition. Of the 55 projects, 11 have been completed, four are under construction and 40 are at one of the three principal pre-construction stages of the approval process. Of these 40, five are at tender stage, 18 are at contract document stage and 17 are at the preliminary report stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">The provision in my Department's Estimates for 2004 for the local authority swimming pool programme is €15 million. This represents an increase of 67% on the estimate provision of €9 million for 2003. All of the 2003 provision of €9 million will be spent by the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">The normal provisions applying under the programme will continue to apply in 2004. Projects must complete each of the four principal stages – preliminary report, contract documents, tender approval and construction. The maximum grant available under the programme is €3.8 million, subject to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Grant-aid is formally allocated when a tender has been approved for the project. In addition to pool construction, approved grant aid may also be applied towards the cost of a toddler pool, sauna and steam room.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">Approval for projects in 2004 will depend on a range of factors, the most important being the availability of project financing in the local authority, some of which have more than one project within the programme. In addition, such factors as compliance with technical and procedural requirement at each of the various stages of the process and the nature of managerial arrangements must be taken into account.</p>

          <p eId="para_607">I congratulate the Minister on getting more money this year for the swimming pool programme. How many projects are ready to proceed to construction? What amount of money will be allocated to these projects? When will he announce the next round of projects to be given the go ahead? Has he given any consideration to a league table, whereby local authorities would know where they stood and who is next in the queue, as has happened with the schools building project in the Department of Education and Science? Has any decision been made this year on swimming pool projects?</p>

          <p eId="para_608">On the question of the status of the projects, 11 have been completed, four are at construction stage, five are at tender stage, 18 are at contract document stage, and 17 are at preliminary report stage. I understand that of these 17, five are seeking approval of preliminary reports, one is preparing a new preliminary report, seven are preparing preliminary reports and four have submitted feasibility studies.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">The maximum grant aid is €3.8 million. It is clear that the number of pools that can be sanctioned must be within my budget for swimming pools. We are making progress. Sometimes progress can be slow because of the various stages involved and that creates its own difficulties. I am anxious to see the swimming pool programme progress in the course of the next year. More funds are available under the programme than heretofore.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">The sanctioning of contract documents and approval for tender procedure is dependent on the stage which the project has reached. Our view is that we may have sufficient funding to advance to tender stage about four pools next year.</p>

Two pools in adjoining constituencies in Naas and Athy have made application for funding for refurbishment works and some new facilities.</p>

      <b>Ms McManus</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</b>
      if he will make a statement on the Estimates for his Department for 2004.
      [31566/03]

        </question>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_315">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_619">The allocation for my ministerial Vote group, as published in the Abridged Estimates for Public Services on 13 November last, is €432.2 million. This Vote group consists of Vote 35 in respect of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, which has been allocated €423.7 million and Vote 18, the National Gallery of Ireland, with an allocation of €8.5 million. I am very pleased that the allocation for my Department, representing an increase of 8% over the 2003 figure, will enable me to continue the Government's programme for the development of the arts, sport and tourism sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">With regard to the arts, film and culture areas, the total funding increases from €93 million in 2003 to almost €112 million for 2004. With a 19% increase in funding for the Arts Council to €52.5 million, I am able to provide the council with the financial commitment to continue and develop its work. I have also been able to increase significantly the financial resources that will be available to the Irish Film Board. The successful organisation of the cultural programme associated with the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the organisation of an Irish festival of culture in China and the celebration of the 100th anniversary of Bloomsday will be particular priorities in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">In relation to the sports sector, I have been able to secure increased funding of over €176 million for 2004, which includes an amount of €67 million in respect of the activities of Bord na gCon and Horse Racing Ireland. With such a significant increase in funding for the development of sport, I am able to increase support to the Irish Sports Council to €30.75 million to allow it to continue and enhance its wide range of programmes aimed at increasing participation in sport at all levels. This increase is particularly appropriate in an Olympic year. Increased funding is also provided for the development of sports facilities throughout the country in 2004. The Deputy will be aware that the 2004 sports capital programme was advertised on 30 November 2003 with a closing date for receipt of applications of 16 January 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">The Estimates for 2004 also include an allocation of almost €114 million for tourism services, representing an increase of 6% over this year. Here the emphasis will be on increased funding for the tourism marketing fund where a record provision of €31.5 million will enable major marketing programmes to be rolled out in key target markets. There is also increased support for the tourism State agencies to begin the process of implementing the recommendations of the tourism policy review group which sets out a new vision and strategy for Irish tourism for the ten year period to 2012.</p>

          <from>Mr. Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_623">Why has the allocation for advertising and publicity in the Minister's Department increased by 100% this year? Is this because of the EU Presidency? Why has the figure increased from €75 million to €150 million?</p>
          <p eId="para_624">Can the Minister explain the reduction from €170 to €70, which is 59%, in loan subsidies for small business expansion? If the Minister does not have the information to hand, will he send it to me at a later stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_626">Funding for the arts plan was lower than expected last year. Now that the Minister has more money available, how long will it be before the arts plan is back on track?</p>
          <p eId="para_627">Is an increase in the number of local sports partnerships envisaged? There are only 14 or 15 of them at the moment. Is it planned to increase funding to existing partnerships and to increase the number of partnerships? They are very effective.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_319">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_628">It is appropriate that the Deputy should ask that question. The Sports Council increased the number of sports partnerships by four during this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">The implementation of the arts plan is a matter for the Arts Council itself. The council will decide how to proceed. The concept of multi-annual funding of an arts plan is something the Arts Council decided itself. That is fine, except that the Minister with responsibility for the arts must go to the Minister for Finance every year to discuss his budget for the following year. It is simply not possible for any Minister, irrespective of who he or she is, to give a guarantee of roll-over funding, as the Arts Council proposed. Things just do not work like that. The Minister for Finance must look extremely carefully at his priorities, options and resources and do the best he can for the country. That is not an easy task. I am particularly grateful to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, for his deep understanding of the problems of the arts sector. The manner in which he responded has been magnificent and the arts sector across the country acknowledges that.</p>

          <p eId="para_630">Is Tourism Ireland responsible for the tourism aspects of our inland waterways? In Kildare we have two canals and the rivers Barrow and Liffey, but we do not seem to develop our waterways to their true potential. A number of boating companies operate on the canals and on the Barrow but they do not seem to reach their potential as waterways in other countries do. Does development of the waterways as a tourist attraction come within the Minister's remit?</p>

        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_321">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_631">For the most part the inland waterways are in the control of the Office of Public Works. I know this because I was for a period in the early 1990s Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works. The Office of Public Works is certainly responsible for the Ballinamore canal. Tourism Ireland's only responsibility is for marketing the country on the international stage and, in doing so, it refers to tourism facilities such as the inland waterways. Fáilte Ireland does the same when advertising within the country. The Office of Public Works has most to do with the inland waterways.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_640">I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 15 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">My entire core Department is being transferred to Killarney. The cultural institutions – the National Museum of Ireland, the National Library of Ireland and the National Archives – which form part of my Department will remain in Dublin. Three State agencies under the aegis of my Department are also being decentralised. The Irish Sports Council will transfer to Killarney, the Arts Council to Kilkenny and Fáilte Ireland to Mallow.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">A wide range of factors has been taken into account and balanced in selecting locations for the new decentralised offices. These factors include the need to achieve a fit with the national spatial strategy, in terms of the gateways, hubs and their respective catchments; the location of existing decentralised offices; the desirability of clustering a Department's decentralised units within a region; the importance of respecting the scale and character of locations in terms of their capacity to absorb the number of new jobs involved; the existence of good transport links by road, rail and air; and the general infrastructural capacity in the areas selected. There are approximately 146 staff serving in my Department, 223 in Fáilte Ireland, 45 in the Arts Council and 24 in the Irish Sports Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">The building occupied by my Department in Kildare Street is owned by the Office of Public Works which also leases the building in South Frederick Street and the Irish Sports Council's premises in Fitzwilliam Square. The Arts Council has commercial lease arrangements with two landlords for adjacent buildings in Merrion Square. The total rent is €249,748 per annum. Termination arrangements must be negotiated for the unexpired portion of the leases, 14 and 13 years respectively, and the council is seeking professional advice in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">Fáilte Ireland staff are located in office accommodation at Amiens Street, which is owned by Fáilte Ireland and which houses, in addition, a direct training centre, and in leased premises at Baggot Street Bridge and Pembroke Row which accommodate 76 and 53 staff, respectively. The rent for the premises on Baggot Street Bridge and on Pembroke Row is €345,140 per annum, with the leases due to expire in September 2060, if we are around for that, and March 2017, respectively. It is not yet clear what, if any, penalties or advantages will arise in the case of the early termination of these leases.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">The Secretary General of my Department briefed departmental staff union representatives and the chief executive officers of the three agencies on the day the decentralisation programme was announced. The matter was also discussed at a meeting of the Department's partnership committee on 15 December. I was to have meetings with the chairs and chief executive officers of the three agencies on 17 December but unfortunately I had to go to a funeral in County Clare and was therefore obliged to cancel the meetings, which will take place in January. Finally, for the information of the House, Deputy Parlon was not responsible for decentralising my Department to Killarney.</p>

          <p eId="para_648">We are lucky that some civil servants are being decentralised to Athy and I welcome it. What is the timescale for this? It is very important that there is no interference with any of the State agencies which will develop tourism and that they are not fragmented. In other words, the linkage between them should be maintained. Has the sub-committee on decentralisation been set up in the Minister's Department or is that in its infancy? Has the Minister received requests from civil servants seeking to be moved to that famous county, Kerry?</p>

I presume the Minister is going to consider the option of leasing the buildings, rather than terminating all the contracts. Keeping them and leasing them to someone else might be more financially advantageous than terminating the leases.</p>

There are those who might say I could take out a consultancy on decentralisation so we will try to do it as early as possible. The assignment of the leases is important and I am sure the leases will allow for that provision to occur.</p>

          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_654">This issue is connected with the unauthorised development of quarrying at Glenanommer townland, Athleague, County Roscommon. I am grateful to the Taoiseach for coming in here this evening to clarify the matter because it is an important issue. Given that the Dáil will not be sitting again in plenary session until 27 January it needs to be clarified before then. The Dáil will sit on 20 January but we will not have an opportunity to put questions to the Taoiseach. When this matter arose I was mystified to hear a Kerry county councillor on "Morning Ireland" explaining the Taoiseach's position and Senator Brady was on television at lunchtime also explaining the letter.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">Any letter coming from the Taoiseach's office is the responsibility of the Taoiseach, especially in a situation of this serious nature involving an enforcement order by Roscommon County Council. One is inclined to be sympathetic to the circumstances of the owner of the property and I share that feeling. It is, however, a cause for concern that this matter was not in the Taoiseach's constituency. If people felt they needed to make overtures to Roscommon County Council why was it not done by a local representative, although that too would have been questionable? A letter from the Taoiseach to a middle-ranking official in Roscommon County Council suggesting that he would be grateful if action was taken could be interpreted as saying that if that line of action was not taken he would be very ungrateful.</p>

          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_657">For a middle-ranking official to get a letter of this nature could be seen as a form of intimidation. It was wrong for the Taoiseach to use his office to attempt to interfere in a legal enforcement process involving an unauthorised quarrying development in County Roscommon. The officials could feel intimidated and pressurised into terminating or freezing the legal proceedings in this case. In any case of this nature there are the developers and those who are affected by the development. It was unfair not to take into consideration other parties affected by this. I am glad the Taoiseach has come into the House to explain how he could have seriously interfered with the enforcement, which is effectively a legal process being undertaken by a local authority.</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_333">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_658">I am grateful to Deputy Allen for raising this matter on the Adjournment and I am happy to take this opportunity to come into the House and clarify it. I accept the Deputy's point that it would not be possible not to deal with it, although it is a constituency matter for which I am not answerable in this House. No Taoiseach is answerable in the House for a constituency representation but I do so because there is a break coming up and I appreciate Deputy Allen's point.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">As Deputies are aware, today's edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i>carried a front page story that suggests I interfered in the planning process. In a statement issued this morning I categorically refuted this disingenuous charge. After reading the comments made here this morning in the House, I am pleased to have this opportunity to deal with the matter in the Chamber. I am saddened to see that the Opposition sought to make a political football out of what was a compassionate gesture on behalf of a constituent with a close family member suffering from cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">In the interests of accuracy, and as requested by Deputy Allen, I want to set out for Members the factual position as to how this issue was dealt with by my constituency office and on the basis of the information made available to it at the time. On 10 November 2003, Mr. Kevin Murray, who is resident in my constituency, attended a clinic in my office in Drumcondra. As I was otherwise engaged on Government business, the clinic was taken by my constituency colleague, Senator Brady. Mr. Murray informed Senator Brady about the operation of a family quarry at Scrine, Rahara, County Roscommon and that this was the subject of an unauthorised development case taken by Roscommon County Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">At the clinic, Mr. Murray also stated that his brother was at that time attending St. Luke's Hospital receiving chemotherapy treatment for cancer. He made the point that the case with Roscommon County Council was causing much stress for his brother at a time when he was receiving critical and debilitating medical treatment. Mr. Murray asked if there was any possibility that, on humanitarian grounds, the case could be put on hold until his brother's treatment had finished.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">On 12 November, two days after Mr. Murray met Senator Brady at the constituency clinic, a letter was issued from my constituency office stating that I would endeavour to assist in this matter. On that same day, 12 November, another letter was issued to Ms Marion O'Grady, the planning enforcement officer of Roscommon County Council. The relevant section of this letter concerning Mr. Murray's brother states, "brother, Brian, is in St Luke's Hospital at present receiving Chemotherapy treatment for cancer and I would be grateful if you could arrange for this case to be put on hold until Brian's treatment is complete."  In concluding this letter, Ms O'Grady was asked if she could look on this request sympathetically.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">I want to unequivocally state that the only motivation in making representation on this matter was from a compassionate perspective. It is a blatant distortion of the truth to suggest that there was any attempt to interfere in the planning process. At no time did I seek to influence the council's decision regarding the unauthorised development case. My involvement related solely to a request that the matter would be put on hold until Mr. Brian Murray had completed his medical treatment. This was done on humanitarian grounds. As I made clear in a reply to one of Deputy Allen's questions, the reason I got involved in this is because his brother lives quite near me in Drumcondra.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">It is important to also put this letter in context in terms of the information Mr. Murray gave to my constituency office. The quarry had been in operation since 1939. In 2002, Roscommon County Council conducted an investigation into its planning status. The result of the investigation was to find that there was no contravention of the planning code. An official in the planning enforcement section of the county council had written to Mr. Brian Murray on 23 August 2002 – he gave us a copy of the letter – in the following terms:</p>
          <p eId="para_665">I wish to inform you that following investigation by the Planning Authority, it was found that the above operation was a small scale development and that Planning Permission exists in respect of same by virtue of pre-1963 usage. The Planning Authority will not, therefore, be taking any further action in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Between August 2002 and October 2003, the view of the planning authority obviously changed. I understand that the view of the county council is that the nature of the activities on the quarry had changed and that planning permission was therefore now required. Neither I nor my constituency office staff was in a position to offer a view on compliance with the planning Acts, as the issue of "intensification of use" raises complex issues of law and fact, as the quarry industry has made clear today. What was clear was that there was a dispute and that there were two sides to the story.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">The county council had issued a planning enforcement notice on 15 October 2003. This meant that Mr. Brian Murray had 28 days from that date to comply with the notice or else he would face criminal charges. Senator Brady was informed that because Mr. Brian Murray was receiving chemotherapy treatment in St. Luke's hospital in Dublin, he was not in a position to take matters in hand at the quarry and could not make his case effectively to the county council. The deadline for compliance with the notice was approaching and Mr. Brian Murray was extremely distressed by the whole situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">For these reasons, Senator Brady thought it reasonable that a letter be sent in my name. It is important to make clear what the letter did not state. It did not state that the activities at the quarry were in compliance with the planning code, it did not seek to influence the county council's interpretation of the planning laws and it did not ask that legal proceedings should not be taken. In effect, all the letter asked for was that proceedings would be put on hold until Mr Brian Murray was well enough to deal with the problem, one way or another, particularly given that he had received a letter 14 months earlier indicating that he had no difficulty and that he had planning permission.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">Earlier today I took the opportunity to speak to my constituency colleague, Senator Brady, who manages the Fianna Fáil constituency office in Dublin Central. Senator Brady has confirmed that I did not personally sign this letter. However, I take full responsibility as a public representative for the correspondence issued in my name.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">I particularly want to take issue with the suggestion this morning that officials in my Department conducted an incompetent search of records. The facts are that on 1 December 2003, a journalist from the <i>Irish Independent,</i> Brian McDonald, contacted the Government Press Office by telephone with the following questions, and I quote:</p>
          <p eId="para_671">Did the Taoiseach or anyone on his behalf make representations or otherwise communicate with a planning authority in respect of a planning enforcement notice or similar notice in recent weeks. If so, why was this done? What was the nature of the communication? Will the Taoiseach make available to the journalist a copy of such communication? Will he comment on the matter?</p>
          <p eId="para_672">This query was e-mailed to staff in the my private office and my constituency office. Members of my staff asked if there was any more information, to which the press office stated that the journalist said, it "relates to a planning matter in the west of Ireland". An initial trawl of the records based on this scant information was carried out but nothing was found.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">The Government press officer contacted the journalist on 3 December to relay this information and stated that she would continue checking but if more information could be made available it would help in the search. On 5 December, the Government press officer again contacted the journalist to ask if any further information was available, to which the journalist said he had nothing more. The Government press officer said that we had checked all the relevant sections and based on the information provided at the time it appeared that the Taoiseach had not made any such representations. The Government press officer asked the journalist to come back to her, if he could be more specific.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">On 17 December, the journalist contacted the Government Press Office again. This time he said he had more information and was able to quote a reference number to the correspondence. He then asked two questions, first, why was he told that the Taoiseach did not intervene and, second, does the Department wish to comment? In response to this, I emphasise that up to that point in time in his dealings with the press office, he had not been told at any stage that I did not intervene. It was simply pointed out to him that my office had not been able to locate any reference which matched the inadequate information he provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">Armed with the specific reference number, the Government Press Office was immediately able to get a copy of the correspondence. The Government press officer telephoned the journalist to respond, first, that the Department ran a check but did not receive enough information initially, so nothing showed up and, second, that the Taoiseach was making a case on compassionate grounds on behalf of a constituent as requested. While Mr. McDonald contacted my office and made an inquiry regarding a representation, this was not specific and did not sound familiar to any of the staff in my office. This is hardly surprising given that my constituency office dealt with more than 600 pieces of correspondence in the week in which the letter was issued to Roscommon County Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">I utterly reject any imputation that I attempted to interfere in the planning process. I was simply seeking, on compassionate grounds, more time for the close relative of a constituent, who was undergoing very distressing and debilitating cancer treatment, to deal with the matter. As a public representative in this democracy, I contend that it was 100% legitimate for me to raise this matter on behalf of a constituent with the local authority concerned, and that my constituency office dealt with this in a totally appropriate manner.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_677">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to air this matter by way of this process. It relates to the subject matter of a parliamentary question, which I tabled on numerous occasions during the past three years, particularly during the past two years. This matter relates to a request for the Minister for Education and Science to respond to the often submitted documentation relating to the needs of the local post-primary school in Maynooth, to which my children went to school.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">This school was built to accommodate approximately 650 students but now has 811 on the roll book. This is an exceptionally good school and a fine crop of students have graduated from it every year since it was established. It has done a great job but it is sad that it is now incapable of complying with health and safety regulations by virtue of the poor condition of some of the accommodation whereby old and dilapidated prefabs have to be used to meet requirements, thus putting teachers and students at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The Minister's reply to a parliamentary question I tabled yesterday is confusing. He took a number of questions together, which is a cause for concern. The reply is in the form of a group photograph and in a group photograph of that nature individual schools do not always come out to the best, as in the case of individuals in a group photograph who sometimes are not reflected to their best advantage.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_681">In his reply the Minister states that the proposed large-scale building projects for the school referred to by the Deputy are listed in section 7 of the 2003 school building programme, which is published on the Department's website, which we have all been invited to visit on previous occasions. He said the proposed projects are at the early stages of architectural planning and have been assigned a band rating by the Department in accordance with the public criteria for the prioritising of large-scale projects. I regret to inform the Minister that in this case, all stages have been proceeded with long ago. Planning permission was granted more than two years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">It is now entirely a matter for the Department to respond to the school's needs and ensure than in the future an accurate response is given to a simple question. There is nothing so annoying to the people who are concerned – in this instance, parents, pupils and teachers – than to get a reply which is not factual. I ask the Minister to take up this issue again, look at the proposal as it is and in future try to at least assess such issues on the basis of factual information.</p>

          <p eId="para_685">The 2004 building programme has just been published on the Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>. This programme is a further major step in progressing the Government's consistent commitment since 1997 to deal with school accommodation needs. It details in excess of 170 significant school building projects that are being authorised to proceed to tender and construction in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">The building project for Maynooth post-primary school is listed in section 9 of the 2004 school building programme and is at an early stage of architectural planning. The project has been assigned a band 3 rating in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. The indicative timescale for this large-scale project going to tender is post 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">Regarding band ratings, the Department will consult with the education partners early in 2004 on the prioritisation criteria to ensure they have the optimum precision and are fully tuned to meeting the priority accommodation needs of the primary and post-primary sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">The programme will be updated early in 2004 with details of how the additional €30 million funding announced in the budget will be spent. In addition, it is open to all schools to make applications for grant aid for refurbishment works under the recently announced summer works scheme. The Department operates this innovative scheme, which enables schools to undertake refurbishment works during the summer holidays, on a hands off basis. Application forms and further details on the scheme are available on the Department's website.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">Large-scale projects that are not going to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme are being reviewed with a view to including them as part of a multiannual building programme from 2005 onwards. The Department of Education and Science expects to be in a position to make a further announcement on this matter during 2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_701">As I informed the House on 18 November last, the Government, in June last, agreed in principle to the provision of a national conference centre through an open competitive procurement process.

          <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</from>
          <p eId="para_713">I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 16, 20, 26, 29, 115, 118, 120 and 121 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">This Government has over the past five years committed about €260 million to support investment in sporting facilities at local, regional and national levels. By doing so it has enabled the creation of a sporting infrastructure which has revitalised communities throughout the length and breadth of Ireland. I have at all times acknowledged that there is also a need to address the significant gap which exists at present in the availability of modern stadium accommodation to house major international sporting events.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">I pay tribute to the vision, imagination and energy of the GAA in delivering the world-class 80,000 capacity stadium at Croke Park which is a source of such pride to us all. Nevertheless, all of the major sporting bodies – GAA, FAI and IRFU – acknowledge that there is also a need for a second modern stadium in Dublin. This is a point of view with which I am in full agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">As I have indicated to the House on previous occasions the question of how to deliver modern sports stadium facilities continues to be the subject of very active dialogue between myself and the sports bodies mainly concerned, the FAI, IRFU and the GAA.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">I have at all times made it clear in my discussions with these agencies that my preference was for the development of a national stadium at a greenfield site at Abbotstown. Deputies will understand, therefore, that it was a matter of real regret to me that in September 2002, the Government found it necessary in the prevailing budgetary circumstances to say that it was no longer in a position to commit Exchequer support on the scale required for the realisation of the national stadium project. In those circumstances and with the approval of the Government, I set about exploring the potential for securing private sector investment in place of Exchequer resources for this project. My initial enquiries established that while there is considerable interest among private investors in entering into partnership for this project, the terms on which such a project could be realised were likely to present difficulties for some or all of the parties involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">In my consultations with the sporting bodies I sought to establish where their preferences lay. In response to my invitation to the IRFU and the FAI to set out their priorities, these organisations jointly commissioned Arup Consultants to draw up prioritised proposals. I received Office of Public Works's comprehensive analysis of the Arup report in mid September. Since then, I have had further discussions and consultations with interested parties and obtained further information in regard to development options for Lansdowne Road at a meeting in my office on 16 December with FAI and IRFU representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">Taking account of the issues highlighted in the various reports, the outcome of my discussions with the sporting bodies, the outcome of the analysis of the responses to the initiative to secure privately funded facilities and having regard for the likely demand on the Exchequer to fund such a facility, it is my intention to bring to the Government at an early date the various options for meeting the stadium needs of the organisations. It would clearly be inappropriate for me at this stage to anticipate what the Government may eventually decide.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">With regard to the availability of Croke Park I wish to refer the Deputy to the position which I articulated earlier today in response to Priority Question No. 1. I have not entered into negotiations with the GAA with a view to having Croke Park made available to house other major sporting fixtures.</p>

          <p eId="para_726">All group tourism travel from China requires an authorised destination status, ADS, agreement and China has 26 such agreements in effect with other states as well as agreements with Hong Kong and Macao.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">The Irish Ambassador in Beijing is currently negotiating on our behalf a memorandum of understanding, MOU, between my Department and the Chinese National Tourism Administration, CNTA, for authorised destination status. The MOU under negotiation is similar to the MOU initialled by the EU with the CNTA on 30 October which, for technical reasons, applies only to the Schengen states, with the exception of Denmark.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">I am confident that agreement will be reached in time for the bilateral MOU to take effect around the same time as the EU MOU, namely in the spring of 2004.</p>

          <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</from>
          <p eId="para_740">I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 23 and 114 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">The latest official CSO figures for tourism to Ireland, released last week, show an increase in visitor numbers of almost 5% for the first nine months of the year. If this level of growth is maintained in the final quarter, the tourism agencies will have succeeded in delivering on their highly ambitious targets for the year. It is worth emphasising that these targets were set this time last year before Iraq and SARS emerged as critical setbacks for the tourism sector globally. Taken as they are, these figures indicate that Ireland's performance in 2003 has been positive and represents a strong endorsement of the marketing strategies employed by the tourism agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">Performance on a market-by-market basis is also encouraging, with Ireland increasing its share in many of its major tourism markets despite the intense competition this year. Ireland has managed to increase numbers from Britain, where outbound tourism has been flat, by 3.6% in the first nine months of the year. Similarly, in mainland Europe, Ireland appears to be outperforming its main rivals in the German, French, Italian and Spanish markets, with mainland European visitors up by 8.1% for the first nine months of this year. The north American market also appears to be turning the corner with strong growth achieved this year for the first time since 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">The overall forecasts for the year from the tourism agencies are also positive with a projected 3.7% increase in overall visitor numbers to 6.1 million, with Britain up 2.6%, mainland Europe up 6.5% and north America up 6%. If this level of growth is achieved, it would represent a good performance in a very difficult year. Comparative overall visitor numbers for 2000, 2001 and 2002 are 6.2 million, 5.8 million and 5.9 million respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">Recognising the value to the Irish economy of tourism, I am very pleased to say that Government investment in support of tourism next year will be well over €110 million. Of this, almost €70 million will be spent in support of the marketing and promotion activities of the tourism State agencies, including the largest ever provision for the tourism marketing fund of €31.5 million. This is both a reflection of the importance attached to marketing as a driver of growth and a strong endorsement of the performance of the two agencies in delivering value for this substantial Exchequer investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">Last week I had the pleasure of launching both Fáilte Ireland's and Tourism Ireland's marketing programmes for 2004. Once again the two tourism State agencies have set an ambitious target of 4.4% growth in visitor numbers for the year ahead. Notwithstanding intense international competition, I am confident, that having set out such a comprehensive suite of marketing activities across all markets and product niches for next year, the industry, with the support of the tourism State agencies can deliver on these ambitious targets.</p>

          <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</from>
          <p eId="para_747">Under the national lottery-funded sports capital programme administered by my Department, funding is allocated to projects which provide sports and recreational facilities at local, regional and national level. While the majority of the funding allocated under the programme goes to voluntary and community groups, it is also open to local authorities to submit applications for funding. For example, under the 2003 programme grants to the value of €6.5 million were allocated to ten municipal projects – either directly to local authorities or to projects where the local authority was working in partnership with a sports club or a community organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">It has been a key objective of sport policy, particularly in the past three years, to support a number of multi-sport centres under the management and control of local authorities. Such projects must, like all others, comply with the terms and conditions of the sports capital programme. Examples of multi-sport centre projects allocated funding under the sports capital programme in recent years include those for Finglas, Ballymun, Monkstown and Ringsend in Dublin; Waterford City, Navan, Trim, Carlow, Letterkenny, Sligo, Ennis, Athlone, Ballina and Portlaoise. Of these, the Athlone sports centre, which includes a swimming pool, has been completed and is open to the public, while those for Ballymun, Finglas, Letterkenny and Portlaoise, apart from receiving grants through the sports capital programme, plan to include swimming pools as part of their overall sports complex and have applied for funding under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is also administered by my Department, to that end.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">The 2004 sports capital programme was advertised in the national press on Sunday, 30 November 2003 and Monday, 1 December 2003. The closing date for receipt of completed applications is Friday 16 January, 2004. All applications received will be evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. Following this assessment process it is likely that further municipal projects may be selected for funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">Under the local authority swimming pool programme the maximum grant available is €3.8 million, subject to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is also available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">The provision in my Department's 2004 Estimates for the local authority swimming pool programme is €15 million, an increase of 67% on the estimate provision of €9 million for this year. Expenditure under the programme in 2002 was €3.9 million. It is expected that the total allocation of €9 million for this year will be fully utilised.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">A total of 55 applications have or are being dealt with under the current round of the local authority swimming pool programme which commenced as of the end of July 2000. Of the 55 projects, 11 have been completed, four are under construction and 40 are at one of the three principal pre-construction stages of the approval process. Of these 40, five are at tender stage, 18 are at contract document stage and 17 are at the preliminary report stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">This Government intends, as it committed to do in the Agreed Programme for Government, to put in place a long-term strategic plan to ensure the development of sports facilities throughout the country. The first step in this process has commenced with a review of the existing sports capital programme under the Department's expenditure review programme. The purpose of this review is to establish what has been achieved under this programme over recent years with a view to identifying gaps in the existing provision and procedures and setting priorities for the future. The expenditure review will be completed by the end of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">A similar review of the local authority swimming pool programme has recently commenced and the results of both will feed into the overall strategic plan for the provision of sports facilities.</p>

          <p eId="para_760">I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 34 and 109 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">The over-riding priority for the Presidency, in so far as my own portfolio is concerned, is to ensure that normal EU business is conducted efficiently and effectively particularly given the additional workload and complexities associated which the accession of ten new member states. I will be chairing the Education, Youth and Culture Council for those items in the cultural and audio-visual spheres which fall under my remit. One of main issues for discussion during our Presidency will be the Commission's proposals for post-2006 EU support programmes in the field of culture and film.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">In order to advance the work programme in the field of culture, my Department is hosting three major events during the Presidency: a seminar on cultural and linguistic diversity in Killarney on 11 March; a seminar on the music industry in Dublin on 19 and 20 April; and a meeting of a European Group on Digitisation of Heritage and Culture to be followed by a conference on digitisation to take place in Dublin on 28 and 29 June. We are also supporting an Arts Council seminar in Cork in May which is aimed at facilitating greater networking among NGOs in the arts field.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">The main priority in the sports area will be the European Year of Education through Sport. The Minister for Education and Science and I will host the European launch of this important year for sport in an EU context. The launch, along with a conference on the topic, will take place in Dublin on 29 and 30 January in Croke Park. Throughout the year we will seek to promote the importance of sport within the education system, particularly in promoting social inclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">While tourism, <i>per se,</i> is not an area of competence for the EU, Ireland recognises the importance of the tourism sector in Europe and the opportunity which the Presidency presents to consider the key issues facing the industry in a European context. In that context, I have asked Fáilte Ireland to organise a business-focused conference on competitiveness and sustainability in tourism during our Presidency. The conference will take place on April 5 in Dublin Castle.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">The Deputies will also be aware that I recently announced details of our cultural programme for the Presidency, the main focal point of which will be "A Day of Welcomes" on Saturday, 1 May 2004, to mark the accession of ten new countries into the European Union. This Presidency is different from previous ones because it coincides with the accession of ten new countries to an enlarged Europe. This historic occasion will place Ireland at the centre, not just of European affairs, but also of the world spotlight. It is an opportunity to showcase the unique cultural aspects of Ireland and the famed Irish welcome, as well as celebrating the qualities and individuality of each of our new European neighbours. Each of the new member states will be officially welcomed into the EU by an Irish city or town, which has been invited to take part in the programme. This will involve showcasing local cultural and commercial activity and each town will have a specific cultural showcase event. The ten Irish towns and cities are Bray, Cork, Drogheda, Galway, Kilkenny, Killarney, Letterkenny, Limerick, Sligo and Waterford. These towns and cities will contribute to this wonderful and important occasion through music, poetry, street theatre and pageantry.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">The day of welcomes will be at the heart of a national weekend of celebration to mark the occasion. The weekend will commence on the evening of Friday, 30 April with a fireworks extravaganza in Dublin. Groupe F, a leading European pyrotechnics company, will be commissioned to create 20 minutes of the largest fireworks spectacle in the European calendar. The celebrations will culminate in a major concert of Irish and international stars in Dublin on 1 May and I hope to be in a position to announce further details of this in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">St. Stephen's Green in Dublin will be transformed into a sea of marquees, stands and stages to host the European fair, which will take place in St. Stephen's Green, Dublin, on Saturday, 1 May and Sunday, 2 May 2004. Up to 100,000 visitors are expected to pass through the fair over the weekend to enjoy the sale of food and produce from all over the new EU and see innovations in fashion, textiles, technologies and cultural activity. It will also act as a forum for tourism, business and commercial linkages.</p>

          <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</from>
          <p eId="para_786">The overall public policy objective for Irish sport is to promote and encourage a vibrant and active sports sector, especially in areas of disadvantage, with increased participation, good quality, sustainable facilities and opportunities for people to play an active role in sport. Within this policy context the talents, potential and needs of competitive and the elite are also cherished and supported in their pursuit of excellence and success in top sport. There is also a high correlation between active involvement in sport and healthy lifestyle.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">My Department's role is to provide the overall policy framework and the necessary funding to assist in the provision of sports facilities and to enable its State agencies, the Irish Sports Council, Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon, to carry out their various functions in relation to the promotion and development of sport and to liaise with and monitor the effective delivery of Government policy, adherence to Government financial requirements and standards of good governance by these agencies. I refer the Deputy in this regard to the 2003-2005 statement of strategy of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism which is accessible on the Department's website.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">The departmental strategy for sport guides the Irish Sport Council's actions in its promotion and development of sport as outlined in its statement of strategy 2003-2005, Sport For Life. Funding for the Irish Sports Council has increased from just over €13 million in 1999 to in excess of €30 million for 2004. My Department also, under the terms of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, continues to fund the development of both the sports of horse and greyhound racing. Next year Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon will together receive about €66 million from the fund for the continued development of both sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">In addition, the Department, in keeping with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government has undertaken to develop a new strategy for the provision of sports facilities in Ireland and carry out an audit of existing sports facilities throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">The impact of my Department's role in sport can be gauged by the very significant increase in the level of Government funding for sport from €17 million in 1997 to over €176.2 million for 2004, which has facilitated the provision of a greatly enhanced range and quality of sports programmes for all age groups and levels of ability in a nationwide network of high quality sport and recreation facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">My Department's sport capital programme has been enormously beneficial to clubs, sports organisations and community groups in every village, parish and town throughout the country. Since 1998 on the sports capital side alone my Department has allocated almost €267 million to over 3,500 projects around the country. On top of this we have also committed over €57 million towards the provision and upgrading of local authority swimming pools, which are so important to the provision of sports and leisure opportunities for all members of the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">The new 50 metre swimming pool at the University of Limerick and the National Aquatic Centre at Abbotstown which has just hosted the very successful European Short Course Championships are key facilities in the context of our high performance strategy for elite competitors as well as for clubs, learners and fun swimmers.</p>

          <p eId="para_801">The regional tourism authorities were established in 1964 by Bord Fáilte under the Tourist Traffic Acts to administer tourism at regional level. At present there are seven tourism regions, six of which are administered by regional tourism authorities, RTAs, and the seventh, the mid-west, by Shannon Development.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">Bord Fáilte – now Fáilte Ireland – carried out a review of the RTAs in 1999. One of the key features to emerge from the review process was the introduction of a formal annual performance contract, between Fáilte Ireland and each RTA, covering such issues as funding, visitor servicing, marketing and promotion, tourism development, and co-ordination. These contracts set out the role and services to be provided by the RTAs and lay down indicators for measuring performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">Following the recent restructuring of the State institutional arrangements for the delivery of tourism policy at national level, and on foot of the recommendations of the recently published report of the tourism policy review group, consideration is now being given to how best to establish a closer correlation between the identified core visitor servicing and development functions provided at regional level and the State financial support provided through Fáilte Ireland and Shannon Development.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">Given the current configuration of the regional tourism authorities as companies limited by guarantee, my understanding is that legislation would not be necessary if the outcome of the work described in the previous paragraph suggests that some restructuring of RTAs is required. While the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has primary responsibility for the legislation governing Shannon Development, I understand, subject to confirmation from the Attorney General, that while legislation would be required to amend its geographical remit, legislation would not be required to effect a change in its tourism function only.</p>

Achieving that goal has long been recognised as a major challenge and is something that is fully reflected in the programmes and initiatives operated by Fáilte Ireland, the National Tourism Development Authority, and in the action plan set out in the recent report by the tourism policy review group.</p>

It has put the emphasis on an agenda for action highlighting 70 individual recommended actions that will support the development of the tourism sector over the next decade. While many of the actions proposed by the review group will have an impact on the regional distribution of tourism, key actions in this regard include those relating to product development, tourism promotion, access transport and the appropriate infrastructure and arrangements for the delivery of tourism at regional level.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">Having set out my overall policy position in relation to regional distribution of tourism, I should add that I have no direct responsibility in relation to individual actions or measures relating to tourism development in so far as specific areas of the country are concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_816">My Department's contribution to the RAPID programme has been delivered mainly through the prioritisation of existing FÁS programmes funded from the 2003 budget.

          <p eId="para_827">IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland, including its regions and areas. IDA's strategy for the Dublin area is to attract and expand major FDI projects, moving up the value chain while doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">Since September 2002 eight significant investment projects have been announced for the north side of Dublin city. Job creation in these projects will continue throughout 2004. These projects-expansions are as follows. On 16 September 2003 it was announced that eBay, and its secure on-line payment subsidiary PayPal were establishing new business operations in Blanchardstown with the creation of 800 jobs by 2005. The company is moving into its new 50,000 square foot facility in February 2004 and already employs 60.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">On 8 May 2003 a major expansion was announced for Gerard Laboratories of its Pharma facility at Baldoyle Industrial Estate. The expansion of the company's tabletting facility will involve an investment of almost €40 million and will create an additional 380 jobs by 2010. The company currently employs approximately 300 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">On 23 April 2003, it was announced that Accenture, Ireland's leading management consulting and technology service company, is planning an additional 150 jobs before the end of the year. The new jobs, which will be concentrated in the company's operations in Dublin, are being created in response to increased demand for the company's services, and will cover a broad range of areas, including software development, web services, business processes, IT outsourcing and application management.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">On 14 April 2003, it was announced that Overture Services Inc., the global leader in commercial search services on the Internet, had established its new search services and operations centre at East Point Business Park and will employ a multinational workforce of nearly 100 editors and customer service representatives by the end of 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">On 12 March 2003, it was announced that Google, the world's leading Internet search company, is to establish its first operations centre outside the US, with the support of IDA Ireland. The centre will be a key link in Google's global business, serving Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The investment will create more than 200 jobs over the next three years with recruitment already under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">On 21 February 2003, it was announced that multinational company Ingersoll Rand planned to create 200 new jobs over the next two years in its global export sales and service trading company, Ingersoll-Rand International Limited, IRI.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">On 14 November 2002, it was announced that up to 150 new jobs are planned by Hertz European service centre in Swords. The jobs, to be created by 2004, will offer opportunities from entry to management level.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">On 18 September 2002, Symantec Corporation, the world leader in Internet security, was approved IDA assistance for two new investments. The two investments are for the establishment of a Symantec security response centre, the company's only research and development facility in Europe, and for the expansion of the existing facility following its consolidation as the European operations centre. The investments will add approximately 250 new high quality and high skill jobs over three years. The company is continuing to implement this expansion project and currently employ approximately 450 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">IDA Ireland is continuing to market north Dublin as a potential location for inward investment. E-business continues to be a focus for IDA Ireland in the area, especially amongst the existing client base. For example, IBM has added an e-procurement activity to its Mulhuddart technical campus, which represents a significant enhancement to their existing facility. The IFSC, with over 450 companies employing 9,000 people, will continue to expand and create high value jobs in financial services and IT.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland will bear fruit in terms of additional overseas investment and jobs for the people of north Dublin during 2004.</p>

      <b>Mr. F. McGrath</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
       the position regarding developments in the reduction in the price of insurance. 
      [31840/03]

          <p eId="para_839">The CSO publishes monthly indices of costs for a number of classes of insurance. These statistics show that there was an increase of 37.6 index points, 54.4%, in motor insurance between October 1998 and October 2002. I am pleased to report that there was a reduction of 8.4 index points, 7.9%, in motor insurance between October 2002 and October 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, which came into being on 1 May 2003, has a wide regulatory remit, covering consumer protection and prudential supervision of practically all of the financial services, including insurance. One of the recommendations in the report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board relates to gathering of statistics on motor insurance and claims costs by IFSRA. Last week IFSRA published its first set of comparative tables of motor insurance quotations on its website. Regular surveys will be published on the IFSRA website at three monthly intervals.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">The annual insurance report contains information on aggregate insurance premiums paid to insurance companies in respect of various classes of business. Responsibility for publishing this report has transferred from my Department to IFSRA.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">While the pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents Governments from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite, Governments are free to take action to improve the functioning of the insurance market.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">The insurance reform programme that I announced on 25 October 2002 comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. I have made it clear that I consider there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be undertaken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to businesses and consumers. Indications to date are that the reform programme is having its desired effect, as is illustrated by the reductions in motor premia to which I have already referred. More reductions are expected. Reductions are also expected in employers' liability and public liability insurance premia, which represent a significant burden for businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">I am confident that the measures the Government is putting in place to reform the Irish insurance market will attract new players into the market and lead to further downward pressure on premia.</p>

          <p eId="para_846">IDA Ireland continues to promote County Monaghan for foreign direct investment, including Monaghan town which has been designated a hub under the national spatial strategy. This is in line with the Government commitment to help regional towns to build scale and create opportunities which will increase their attractiveness for investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">Enterprise Ireland's strategy is to develop further the food and furniture sectors in County Monaghan. The agency is actively promoting the Lough Egish food park as a location for food companies in the region. In 2003 to date, Enterprise Ireland has approved funding of over €2.1 million to assist the development of 24 companies in County Monaghan, including €0.87 million for research and development in food, furniture and engineering companies. The agency has also approved funding for community enterprise centres in Castleblaney, Ballybay, Monaghan town, Lough Egish and Emyvale.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">From January 2000 to date, the Monaghan County Enterprise Board has approved financial support of €1.4 million for 118 projects resulting in the creation of 80 jobs. The board, in partnership with Monaghan County enterprise fund and Armagh City and District Council, have established the Armagh – Monaghan digital corridor to attract inward investment-indigenous industries into the corridor.</p>

          <p eId="para_1068">The person named submitted an application form for an allocation of suckler cow quota from the 2004 national reserve under category D, which caters for regular applicants under the suckler cow premium scheme who require additional quota to ensure viability of their holdings. He indicated on his form that he would be applying for suckler cow premium in 2004 in respect of four animals. Since he already had four suckler cow quota rights, it was accepted in my Department that the person named intended applying for four additional quota rights from the national reserve. Following processing of his application, it was established that he satisfied the criteria for an allocation of quota under category D. He was allocated four suckler cow quota rights from the reserve, which brought his total quota to eight quota rights and he was informed accordingly on 12 November 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">I have arranged for an official from the quota section of my Department at Michael Davitt House, Castlebar, County Mayo, to contact the person named on this issue.</p>

Payments of the premium from then on will be incorporated into the single farm payment, and will be based on the milk quota available on a producer's holding on 31 March 2005. Therefore, a milk producer who purchased quota in 2003 will qualify for the decoupled dairy premium in respect of that quota provided it is still available on his or her holding on 31 March 2005.</p>

          <p eId="para_1236">I first announced in my Budget Statement in December 1999 that the Government intended to proceed with a new, more radical, programme of decentralisation. Following the announcement, there was extensive consultation with interested parties which included meetings at official level between the Department of Finance and other Departments and with each of the Civil Service staff unions. There was also a meeting between the staff unions and me the purpose of which, generally, was to hear the latter's views and concerns. The strategic management initiative implementation group of secretaries general provided advice, at the request of the Government, on how implementation of the new programme could enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the public service. Heads of relevant Departments provided views, at the request of the Government, on the experience of their respective Departments with the previous programme of decentralisation. A major public service union provided advice, in response to an invitation from me, on the development of criteria for the programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_1238">The Government had to take account of and balance a wide range of factors in selecting suitable locations for the new decentralisation programme which I announced on budget day. Of these, one involved the need to achieve a fit with the national spatial strategy. Some 2,650 of the approximately 9,000 jobs in respect of which decisions have already been made are moving to gateways and hubs identified in the national spatial strategy. With six of the hubs identified under the national spatial strategy benefiting from the new decentralisation programme and two of the remainder already having decentralised offices, the hubs are offered the opportunity to build on the key role envisaged for them under the strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239">The strategy also identified the need to strengthen county towns and other medium sized towns. Almost all of the locations included in the programme are explicitly mentioned in section 4 of the strategy which outlines how each region will participate in its evolution. The relocation of public service employment to towns such as these underpins the important role which many of them must continue to play into the future.</p>

      further to the proposed programme of decentralisation set out in the Budget Statement, in respect of the relocation of 300 ordinance workers to Dungarvan, as there are only 200 employees based in Dublin; if this means that the six regional offices and in particular Sligo will also be relocated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_1288">As I stated in my financial statement, the programme of decentralisation of Government Departments and agencies will be implemented through the transfer of staff on a voluntary basis. As such the payment of removal or relocation expenses will not arise. In circumstances, however, where staff are required to relocate, there is provision for the payment of removal expenses. A mortgage allowance is not provided for in such expenses.</p>

          <p eId="para_1291">I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 72 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292">As the Deputy will be aware, IFSRA has just published a consultation paper regarding the funding of its operations. I understand a copy of this paper has been circulated by IFSRA to each Deputy. As the Deputy will note from the executive summary of the paper, IFSRA estimates that the total cost of regulation in 2004 will be in the region of €39 million at current prices. This figure includes some start-up costs associated with setting up the new organisation structure. Once approved, IFSRA's statement of the estimates of income and expenditure for 2004 will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">IFSRA informs me that as at 30 November 2003, there were 274 whole time equivalent staff currently directly employed by it. The support services – personnel, IT, etc. – for these staff are provided by the Central Bank and the Financial Services Authority of Ireland. Some further recruitment is planned by IFSRA as it has taken on new functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">With regard to the impact of the cost of regulation on certain sectors of the financial services industry, I draw the Deputy's attention to paragraphs 3.4 and 3.5 of the consultation paper. The extent of cost recovery by IFSRA will take into account, <i>inter alia,</i> the impact of the levy on competitiveness, the ability to pay of certain sectors, the inclusion or otherwise of certain costs of the regulator and the implications for the industry of equitable treatment of different financial services providers. Views are being sought by IFSRA on these matters during the consultation process. When the consultation process has been completed, IFSRA will be making a submission to me regarding the proposed levies to be charged to the industry in 2004. I will consider any issues arising in that context.</p>

          <p eId="para_1299">I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 77 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">The Irish language has the status of a treaty language in the European Union. This derives from the fact that the treaties are in Irish and that Irish is listed as one of the languages in which the text is authentic. Each successive treaty is published in Irish as well as in the 11 other languages, with the texts in Irish being equally authentic and having equal status with those in all other languages.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">Irish is not one of the official and working languages of the institutions of the Union as provided for in Article 1 of Regulation 1/1958. As I stated in replies on 2 December and again on 17 December, this situation will not change after 1 May next. The status of Irish in the EU, which is reflected in our accession treaty, was determined by a letter of 23 July 1971 from the then Minister for Foreign Affairs to the President of the European Council outlining the Government's views. The draft constitutional treaty under consideration at the Intergovernmental Conference would fully maintain this position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302">The Government continues to monitor developments with a view to availing of any appropriate opportunity which may arise to enhance the status of Irish in relation to the EU. In the current negotiations on the reform of the staff regulations for EU officials, it is proposed that officials will be required to demonstrate an ability to work in three languages before their first promotion and that one of these languages can be Irish.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kitt)</from>
          <p eId="para_1304">Through its overseas development assistance programme, the Government provides considerable resources to address the basic needs of developing countries, including in the health and education sectors. At the multilateral level, the Government contributes to a number of UN bodies involved in the promotion of human rights and development. Ireland is a major donor to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. In 2002, we contributed €2.539 million to this office, of which €250,000 was earmarked for work in the areas of HIV-AIDS, gender and disability. In 2002, we allocated €200,000 to research by the office on the rights of people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">At the International Labour Organisation – ILO – Ireland is supporting a multi-annual programme focused on disability and the workforce. The ILO, with assistance from Ireland, is developing a range of activities to support small enterprise training targeted at women with disabilities. With our support, the ILO is also undertaking a systematic examination of the range of laws in place in developing countries to promote employment opportunities for disabled people. Based on this research, the ILO will provide advice to governments, employers' and workers' organisations on policy, legislation and programmes relating to people with disabilities. At the bilateral level, the Government supports development co-operation programmes in six countries in sub-Saharan Africa and in Timor Leste.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">Our development co-operation in these countries has moved away from specific stand-alone projects and towards pooled donor funding in support of health and education systems. This sector-wide approach to development co-operation is in line with international best practice. It means that we are basing our assistance on our partner countries' national health and education strategies rather than on a donor-driven development agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307">The specific needs of people with disabilities are more likely to be addressed if they are integrated into broad nationally owned health and education strategies, rather than dealt with through a stand-alone ring-fenced fund. Development Co-operation Ireland, through its close dialogue with partner governments in the development of national health and education programmes and through its funding of these sectors, is in a strong position to advocate for national policies to focus on the needs of people with disabilities. In some cases the Government, through its funding of non-governmental organisations and missionaries, has allocated specific funding for projects to support people living with disabilities. Development Co-operation Ireland is providing €457,000 for a project to support independent living and full civic participation of disabled people in Serbia. The project, which is being implemented by the Catholic Relief Services and a local NGO, the Centre for Independent Living, will assist in the training of personal assistants who will then facilitate an independent lifestyle for disabled people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1308">In many developing countries, conflict and its aftermath have left many thousands of non-combatants seriously disabled, particularly by landmines. Ireland is funding the clearing of landmines and has also funded efforts to assist those disabled by mines to rebuild lives and livelihoods. The needs of people with disabilities are recognised both at the multilateral and bilateral levels in the Government's official programme of development assistance. The Government will continue to place a strong emphasis on this issue as it works in partnership with developing countries to fight poverty and social exclusion.</p>

          <p eId="para_1310">As I have said before in the House, we have modelled our approach to sponsorship on that applied by the very successful Danish Presidency and my officials have had discussions with their Danish counterparts on all aspects of sponsorship including possible conflicts of interest. In line with the Danish model, it was decided that, rather than approaching individual companies, we would seek expressions of interest from companies through the various umbrella groups for business in Ireland, such as the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, the Irish Hotel Federation and the Society of the Irish Motor Industry to outline the sponsorship possibilities. In this way, the offer of sponsorship for the Presidency was available to all. We have also been clear that all sponsorship will be in the form of goods and services – no cash sponsorship will be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311">All expressions of interest in sponsoring the Presidency are vetted by an interdepartmental committee with responsibility for planning for the Presidency. If there was any likely risk of a conflict of interest, the interdepartmental group would not enter into any commitments with that company. There is no question of the sponsorship arrangements in any way compromising the conduct of the Government in the course of the Presidency or in the future in any fashion. This was made clear during discussions with the companies involved.</p>

      [31754/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_395">
          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1382">The RAPID programme is designed to harness the opportunities and resources of the national development plan, NDP, through the front-loading and prioritisation of investment to the 45 most deprived communities in the country. These include 25 urban areas and 20 provincial towns. This does not involve additional funding to that being provided under the NDP. The area implementation team in Athy has submitted five proposals under the RAPID programme. The current position on each proposal is outlined below.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383">Ke-Athy-001 refers to the construction of a new community college in Athy. The proposed large-scale building project for Athy Community College is listed in section 7 of the 2003 schools building programme which is published on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>. The new school project is at an early stage of architectural planning. It has been assigned a band 3 rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. I have just published details of the 2004 school building programme on my Department's website.</p>
          <p eId="para_1384">Ke-Athy-002 refers to home-school liaison for Scoil Mhichil Naofa national school and St. Patrick's CBS. The home-school community liaison scheme was last expanded in September 1999. This expansion included any remaining schools designated as disadvantaged that did not have a home-school community liaison service. There are no plans to further expand this scheme. In the event of any future expansion of the scheme, I assure the Deputy that the needs of Scoil Mhichil Naofa and St. Patrick's CBS will be fully considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1385">Ke-Athy-003 refers to an early start programme for Scoil Mhichil Naofa national school. This proposal relates to the early start pre-school pilot project. The early start project, which was launched in 1994, is in place in 40 selected schools in disadvantaged areas. The project is aimed at children aged between three and four years who are considered to be most at risk of not reaching their potential. It provides young children with an educational programme to enhance their overall development and lay a foundation for successful educational attainment in future years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1386">The question of developing and funding particular pre-school initiatives or the extension of the early start project to additional schools will be considered by the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education. This centre, which was established in 2001, is charged with developing appropriate quality standards in respect of a wide range of issues affecting early childhood education. The development of these standards is pursuant to the objectives outlined in the White Paper on early childhood education, Ready to Learn 1999. The centre will also develop appropriate forms of early intervention and support for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and children with disabilities by building on the experience of existing programmes. The RAPID proposal Ke-Athy-003 has been sent to the centre for their consideration in this context.</p>
          <p eId="para_1387">The Ke-Athy-012 proposal seeks to expand Kildare youth service activity for Athy's youth. The Athy youth project received an allocation of €70,174 in 2003 under the special projects for youth scheme. Due to the large number of existing commitments in the youth sector, it was not possible to provide any additional funding for the Athy youth project this year. The matter will be reviewed in 2004 in the context of available resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1388">Ke-Athy-017 is an application for the inclusion of Athy in the school completion programme. The school completion programme – SCP – which was launched in 2002, incorporates the learning experience and best practice derived from previous early school leaving initiatives. It assimilates the existing eight to 15 early school leaver initiative – ESLI – and the stay in school retention initiative – SSRI – at second level. Athy Community College, which is one of the schools in Athy seeking admission to SCP, is already in the SSRI.</p>
          <p eId="para_1389">The objective of the school completion programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage which support the retention of young people in education. Eligible schools were selected on the basis of their retention rates from the Department's post-primary pupil database. This analysis also identified the main feeder primary schools. These did not include those primary schools located in Athy. The inclusion of further schools in the project strand of the school completion programme is currently under consideration in my Department.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_397">
          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1396">The Commission on Public Service Pensions examined and reported on the pension arrangements of public servants generally. The implementation of the Commission's recommendations is a matter in the first place for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1397">As part of budget 2004, the Minister for Finance announced certain changes decided on by Government to pension arrangements in the public service. These changes largely represent the implementation of recommendations of the Pensions Commission; these recommendations were themselves the subject of a further report by a joint management-union working group which reported in October 2003. The report of the working group did not contain agreed recommendations on many issues, including issues relating to teachers' pensions. As mentioned earlier, the budget changes reflect the Pensions Commission recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1398">The measures announced include changes which will apply only in the case of new entrants to the public service and some changes which will apply in the case of staff currently in service. In the case of new entrants, the following changes were announced to take effect from 1 April 2004, except in those cases where, for legal or technical reasons, a later commencement date is required: the minimum pension age will be increased to 65 for the generality of new entrants to the public service, including teachers; the compulsory retirement age of 65 will be removed for new entrants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1399">The Minister also announced that he is proposing changes to the pension terms and conditions of serving staff along the lines recommended by the Commission including: – amendment to the existing formula used for integrating public service and social welfare pensions so as to make better provision for current and future staff on lower pay levels. Such a change would also be of benefit to some existing pensioners. Integration applies to public servants in full PRSI class; introduction of a single additional voluntary contribution type scheme for the public service, ie the Scheme for Public Employees Additional Retirement Savings – SPEARS.</p>
          <p eId="para_1400">The Minister also announced that he will examine the feasibility of implementing the Commission's recommendation for the payment of a survivor's pension to non-spousal partners and also the possibility of providing for some form of optional early retirement with payment of actuarially reduced benefits, which would have a cost neutral effect, as recommended by the Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1401">Finally, the Minister announced that the Government has decided not to accept the Commission's recommendations in relation to the introduction of an additional 1% pension contribution or the use of a new index for the purpose of determining pension increases. These recommendations would have applied to serving staff, with the new index also applying to existing pensioners, had they been accepted by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1402">The new minimum pension age of 65 will apply to new entrants to employment in the education sector, including teachers, from 1 April 2004 as will the removal of the compulsory retirement age for them. Apart from those measures, my Department awaits detailed proposals on the implementation of the Commission's recommendations from my colleague the Minister for Finance in so far as they relate to teachers and other groups in the education sector.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1421">"Giving Children an Even Break" subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage and my Department's approach is now refined to ensure that the individual ‘at risk' pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, my Department now provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</p>
          <p eId="para_1422">Primary schools participating in "Giving Children an Even Break" are in receipt of a range of additional supports including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the Programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1423">These levels of disadvantage were established as a result of a comprehensive survey of primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) in March/April 2000 at the request of my Department. Over 2,300 primary schools identified as having pupils enrolled with characteristics of disadvantage are participating in "Giving Children an Even Break".</p>
          <p eId="para_1424">Any school in which there was at least one pupil which satisfied any of the criteria associated with socio-economic disadvantage is entitled to additional resources under "Giving Children An Even Break". Resources are allocated to schools on a sliding scale and schools with greater proportions of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds are allocated proportionally more resources than those with fewer numbers of such pupils.</p>
          <p eId="para_1425">Every participating school is entitled to a special €63.49 per capita grant in respect of the percentage of pupils with diadvantaged characteristics and schools receive a minimum of €952.30 per annum. A total of 157 schools in Donegal are currently in receipt of such funding under "Giving Children An Even Break".</p>
          <p eId="para_1426">Schools categorised as urban in "Giving Children an Even Break" with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils are supported, where necessary, through staff allocations to implement reduced pupil/teacher ratios of 20:1 in junior classes (infants through second class) and 27:1 in senior classes (third through sixth class). There are three schools in Donegal included in this category.</p>
          <p eId="para_1427">Schools categorised as rural with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils have been allocated the services of a teacher coordinator who will work in clusters of four or five schools. There are 97 schools in Donegal included in rural clusters. In addition, rural schools whose geographical locations did not facilitate inclusion in clusters are receiving grants to cover teaching services. Two schools in Donegal are included in this category.</p>
          <p eId="para_1428">One of my key concerns in relation to tackling disadvantage is to improve the level of integration between the various educational disadvantage programmes operated by my Department. In this regard, I have requested the Educational Disadvantage Committee, established in March 2002 under the Education Act, 1998, to undertake a "root and branch" review of all of the programmes in order to ensure optimum synergy and integration between them. The Committe is currently engaged in this review.</p>
          <p eId="para_1429">Details on the number of schools located in Donegal included in "Giving Children An Even Break" in previous years will be forwarded to the Deputy directly.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1433">I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 to 94, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1434">A grant totalling £6.1 million was issued to all schools in December 2000 in order to support schools in the implementation of the arts education section of the curriculum. The aim of the grant was to facilitate the purchase of necessary teaching and learning materials e.g. musical instruments. It was also envisaged that this grant would encourage schools to engage in activities which would promote aspects of the music curriculum, such as inviting a composer to the school. The grant amounted to £13 per pupil, subject to a minimum of £780 for schools of 60 pupils or less.</p>
          <p eId="para_1435">The Primary Curriculum, launched in 1999 for implementation on a phased basis, includes a revised programme in music, which has composition as one of the strands. The curriculum document in music is accompanied by detailed guidelines for teachers. These guidelines contain suggestions on approaches to implementing all aspects of the music curriculum, including composition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1436">The Primary Curriculum Support Programme was established in 1999 to provide professional development support to teachers to assist them in implementing the curriculum. The PSCP is engaged in a wide range of support activities, including organising seminars for teachers, visiting schools and providing tailored support for individual schools and clusters of schools. At this stage, English, Gaeilge, Mathematics, Visual Arts, Science and Social, Personal and Health Education have been implemented and Music is one of the next subjects to be introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1437">This year, following a request from teachers' representatives, I announced a year of consolidation and review of areas of the curriculum that have already been introduced. It is planned that the in-career development programme for music will take place for all primary teachers in the school year 2004-2005, and that teachers will begin to implement the programme during the following school year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1438">A team of trainers for music and an assistant national co-ordinator have been recruited to support this development. The trainers are currently planning their inservice programme and using the new methodologies in their own classrooms and sharing their experiences and expertise with the colleagues on the staff. The trainers also work closely with the Education Centre Network in the provision of evening and summer courses. Composition is an integral component of these courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1439">A six week evening course was completed for primary teachers by the Donegal Education Centre this month, covering all three strands of the Music Curriculum, with the support of trainers from the Primary Curriculum Support Programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1440">Our schools have a long and proud tradition in teaching music and our national profile in the music industry greatly exceeds expectations for a country of this size. I am committed to ensuring that schools are fully supported in continuing their excellent work.</p>

          <p eId="para_1455">A census of children with special educational needs in all national schools has recently been conducted by my Department. Data from the census is currently being collated and the information sought by the Deputy will be forwarded to him in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_1456">With regard to the development of services, significant levels of special educational needs supports have been allocated by my Department to schools in recent years. For example, the number of resource teachers has increased from 104 in 1998 to approximately 2,500 currently in primary schools, to help cater for pupils with special educational needs in integrated settings. The needs of schools for resource teaching support, and the basis of allocation of that support, are being kept under review.</p>
          <p eId="para_1457">The number of learning support teachers in the primary school system has increased from 1,302 in 1998 to 1,531 at present. This level of investment has enabled every primary school in the country to avail of the services of a learning support teacher and it is not my intention to expand this service in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1458">Currently, there are 108 special schools catering for approximately 6,000 pupils. These schools employ an estimated 1,090 teachers. In addition, there are approximately 500 special classes attached to mainstream primary schools catering for an estimated 4,000 pupils. Additional schools and classes may be established by my Department on the basis of assessed needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1459">Since the establishment of the National Educational Psychological Service – NEPS – in September 1999, the number of psychologists assigned to the agency has tripled, rising to 127 psychologists at present. The Government's decision to establish NEPS included the specification that there would ultimately be 184 psychologists in NEPS in addition to approximately 16 psychologists employed elsewhere in the educational system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1460">I intend to recruit additional psychologists to make up the shortfall, as resources permit, and bearing in mind the general staffing constraints that exist at present. Pending the expansion of NEPS to all schools in the country, my Department has allocated funding for schools that do not yet have access to the NEPS service to commission psychological assessments from private practitioners. NEPS has issued details of how to avail of this scheme to all schools.</p>

      his views on the contention of the National Competitiveness Council that too many young people shy away from business and instead pursue careers in the professions and that the emphasis in the Irish education system accorded to courses which prepare students for life in the professions has resulted in a costly misallocation of talent; and his plans in this regard.

        </question>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_412">
          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1508">The Competitiveness Challenge 2003 Report highlights that too many people shy away from business towards the professions, and argues that further inclusion of entrepreneurship in second and third level curricula is necessary to address this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1509">It is worth noting that the Annual Competitiveness Report 2003 ranks Ireland as first out of 12 countires examined concerning the proportion of science and engineering graduates per 1000 of the population aged 20-34. Meeting the future skill needs of industry is about producing flexible creative well balanced individuals with a capacity for sound judgment and action, and with a range of core skills and competences that can facilitate lifelong learning and responsiveness to change. The curricular reforms introduced in recent years in the school system are designed to achieve this objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1510">At primary level, in the revised curricula, critical attention is being applied to the development of core communication skills and literacy and numeracy, fostering the skills and motivation for learning to learn, and using information and communication technologies to enhance learning. A basic understanding of scientific principles and methods is also provided for. A key objective is to encourage children to be active agents in their own learning, to engage in collaborative active learning, to develop high order thinking skills, to be able to observe, collate and evaluate evidence, question, summarise, analyse and interpret, and to develop problem solving skills. All of these skills form an important basis for lifelong learning, and for creating a culture of enterprise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1511">At post primary level, major curricular reforms have been introduced since 1994/95 to strengthen the vocational and technical dimension of senior cycle second level programmes, and to promote multi-skilling. The overall thrust of these reforms is to offer a broadly based relevant education with a range of choices and levels to meet diverse interests and needs. The Schools IT Initiative and the language initiatives also play an important role in this. The Transition Year Option, the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme and the Leaving Certificate Applied programmes all provide for action learning approaches, community based learning, a strong focus on personal development and teamwork, and a work experience programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1512">As part of this approach mini-company activities are supported whereby students plan, develop and manage a mini enterprise or organise a major event such as a trade fair or fashion show. Teamwork, multi-disciplinary learning, interpersonal and communications skills, planning, evaluation, and mastery of business concepts are all part of this process. The Link Modules within the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme provide for formal assessment of learning in this area, as do the Tasks carried out by students under the Leaving Certificate Applied programme. Overall, some 43,000 second level students engage in work experience each year as part of these 3 programmes. In addition, the national IBEC Education Links Scheme, the County Enterprise Boards, Chambers of Commerce, and a variety of voluntary and other agencies have been promoting links between schools and business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1513">At Post Leaving Certificate level some 28,000 students participate in programmes of integrated education, vocational training and work experience, predominantly in the business and services sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1514">At third level, industry links are supported through provision of industrial liaison officers in third level colleges, establishment of on campus business incubation units, graduate enterprise schemes and provision of courses, such as the Accelerated Technician Programme, which have a substantial in-company training element. Major investment in Research and Development is also being made under the National Development Plan to enhance the research, technological development and innovation capacity of the third level education sector in line with strategic priorities. The aim is to boost human potential in world class research, science and technology, strengthen inter-college and international partnerships, and facilitate collaborative efforts with industry to ensure a research and development culture in all sectors of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1515">Third level graduation rates by faculty are broadly in line with international trends, and the distribution of places across faculties must take account of a number of factors such as economic needs, employment trends, student demand and availability of staff and facilities. The position will continue to be monitored by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.</p>

      his views on the statement by the National Competitiveness Council that participation in part-time education by adults here is disappointing and that there is a structural bias against part-time education in the higher education system that hinders the upskilling of workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1518">The latest figures available to my Department indicate that in the 2001-2002 academic year a total of 34,965 part-time students were enrolled in third level institutions aided by my Department. This compares with a figure of 124,589 for full-time students.</p>
          <p eId="para_1519">The concept of lifelong learning is key in terms of supporting broad strategic objectives for a knowledge-based economy and in addressing issues of social exclusion. The 2002 report of the taskforce on lifelong learning pointed out significant participation rate gaps for adult learners in full or part-time education between Ireland and the EU. The provision of opportunities for part-time learning is of significant importance in this context. A recent major milestone in this regard has been the development of a national framework of qualifications, led by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland. This framework promotes access, mobility, progression, transfer and transparency of prior learning and in so doing provides an important support for learners participating in part-time education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1520">As the Deputy will also be aware, I have invited the OECD to carry out a review of higher education in Ireland. The context for the review is provided by Ireland's strategic objective of placing its higher education system in the top rank of the OECD in terms of both quality and levels of participation and by the priority to create a world class research, development and innovation capacity and infrastructure in Ireland as part of the wider EU objective for becoming the world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy and society, as agreed in Lisbon, 2000. The review will examine the role of higher education institutions as centres of education, knowledge and research in respect of their public, social and economic responsibilities and will consider the interface between the higher and further education sectors in meeting these overall needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1521">The capacity of the higher education sector for promoting lifelong learning, the transition to the knowledge society, knowledge and technology transfer to the economy and society, supporting spatial strategy, and in meeting the international challenges to learning and research institutions will be key aspects of the review. The comparative Irish performance will be examined by reference to other OECD countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1522">The review will, among a range of policy issues, examine how institutions in the higher education sector might best respond to the needs of their students through developing new and innovative approaches for a more learner-centred approach to the design and delivery of academic and other services. It will also look at how approaches to the resourcing of higher education can best enable achievement of the strategic objectives established for the sector.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_414">
          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1524">I am aware of the demands by voluntary secondary schools for increased funding, including for the reasons referred to by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1525">The funding of voluntary secondary schools is structured mainly on the basis of capitation grants with additional grants for secretarial and caretaking services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1526">The standard <i>per capita</i> grant for voluntary secondary schools has been significantly increased in recent years and now amounts to €266 as against the rate of €224 that applied in 1997. I wish to draw the attention of the Deputies to the recent announcement in the context of the 2004 Estimates to a further increase in the standard <i>per capita</i> grant with effect from 1 January 2004 to €274. This increase will bring the <i>per capita</i> grant in the case of disadvantaged schools to €312.</p>
          <p eId="para_1527">This announcement builds on my commitment towards enhanced "equalisation" funding measures for voluntary secondary schools. In addition to the <i>per capita</i> of €25 that was introduced under the school services support initiative for second level schools in September 2000 and now stands at €99 since January last, secondary schools have benefited from a further increase of €28 bringing the grant for such schools to €127 from January last. This <i>per capita</i> grant was in addition to a range of equalisation grants of up to some €15,500 per school per annum that were also approved for voluntary secondary schools. For a secondary school with 500 pupils, this amounts to additional “equalisation” funding of almost €30,000 per annum and overall additional support services funding of approximately €80,000 per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1528">A further measure of my continuing commitment in this regard is my recent announcement in the context of the 2004 Estimates that the support services grant of €127 per pupil is being further increased from 1 January 2004 in the case of voluntary secondary schools to €131, a <i>per capita</i> increase of €4.</p>
          <p eId="para_1529">A measure of the increase in overall funding for secondary schools is that by comparison with 1997, a secondary school with 500 pupils now receives extra annual funding of up to €105,000 per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1530">Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is in my view, in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific initiatives, including those referred to by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1531">I am committed to improving further the funding position of voluntary secondary schools in the light of available resources and to addressing the issue of equity raised by voluntary secondary schools. At a time of increased financial constraints, the recent announcement of further significant increases in the funding of voluntary secondary schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</p>

          <p eId="para_1533">The level of capital funding available for the primary and post-primary school building programme for 2004 amounts to €387 million and in excess of €200 million of this will be targeted at primary school projects. This compares very favourably with the €342.9 million available in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1534">I have just published details of the 2004 school building programme on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>. The programme is designed to give the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students and to give assurance that the building programme is being operated in an open and transparent manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1535">The programme clarifies the progress to be made on individual projects in 2004. It is evident that substantial inroads will be made in 2004 into projects that have been waiting for funding for some time. An innovative feature of the 2004 programme is the introduction of a new initiative for capital grants for smaller scale improvement works for both primary and post-primary schools which I announced last week. The new initiative, to be known as the summer works scheme, is designed to fund smaller scale works to those schools that are most in need of resources.</p>

      the progress to date in regard to the implementation of the RAPID programme for Athy; the amount of moneys made available for the implementation of the programme from his Department for Athy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</from>
          <p eId="para_1589">As the Deputy will be aware the RAPID programme, revitalising areas through planning, investment and development, aims to target the most disadvantaged areas of the country for enhanced development. No additional funding has been set aside for the programme but rather these areas are prioritised for support within existing budgets. The main programmes operated by my Department where a particular focus exists on RAPID areas are the national lottery-funded sports capital programme and the local authority swimming pool programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1590">One of the stated main objectives of the sports capital programme is to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities. The programme is run on an annual basis and allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1591">For the 2003 sports capital programme, following consultation with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, DCRGA, it was decided that disadvantaged areas were those that have been designated by Government for special support through the schemes administered by DCRGA, that is, RAPID 1, RAPID 2, local drugs task force areas and CLÁR areas. Athy is one of 20 urban locations covered under the RAPID 2 programme. The 2003 programme was the first for which RAPID 2, and accordingly RAPID designation in Athy, was in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1592">A total of 1,337 applications were received under the 2003 sports capital programme. Of these, two were located in the RAPID area of Athy, both of which had to be deemed ineligible, as they did not meet with the minimum qualifying requirements under the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1593">It is open to sports clubs and community organisations in Athy, should they wish to do so and should they have projects which satisfy the terms and conditions of the programme, to submit applications to the 2004 sports capital programme. This programme was publicly advertised on 30 November and 1 December last and the closing date for the receipt of completed application forms is Friday 16 January 2004. Projects which meet the basic qualifying conditions and which are located in RAPID areas will again be prioritised under this programme as they were under the 2003 programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1594">Under the local authority swimming pool programme, projects which are developed in areas designated as disadvantaged, qualify for financial support at 90% of the eligible cost of the project subject to a maximum grant of €3.8 million. Contract documents submitted by Kildare County Council for the Athy swimming pool project are under consideration in my Department. Grants for swimming pools are not approved until a tender for the project has been approved.</p>

          <p eId="para_1652">As already indicated, in response to Question No. 83 on 18 November last, the Tourism Policy Review Group identified competitiveness and value for money as one of the key strategic drivers of success for Irish tourism and listed some ten specific actions to deliver the strategy. These require responses from both the private and public sectors, and the list includes proposals in relation to taking responsibility for restoring competitiveness, inflation, benchmarking, customer relations, management capability, high standards for competitive advantage and training.</p>
          <p eId="para_1653">None of the ten specific recommendations on competitiveness listed in the report is directed to me or to my Department. However, as I see it, my primary role is to ensure that a coherent action plan is implemented quickly and effectively. To this end, I am close to finalising the composition and membership of the high level group to implement the tourism action plan recommended by the Tourism Policy Review Group and I expect to make an announcement in the very near future.</p>

          <p eId="para_1656">Government support for the promotion and development of the arts is channelled in the main through the Arts Council, which will receive funding of €52.5 million in 2004, an increase of some 19% on the 2003 figure. The Arts Council, of course, operates independently of Government in the context of its own funding decisions.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism" eId="spk_427">
          <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</from>
          <p eId="para_1661">The national lottery funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, is the major source of funding available for the provision of sporting facilities for sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. Only projects with a clearly defined sporting aspect are considered eligible for the purpose of securing recommendation for grant funding. The programme is advertised on an annual basis. The types of projects funded include indoor sports halls, community sport facilities and sports playing surfaces, changing rooms and shower facilities available for the usage of individual clubs and community organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1662">Following assessment of applications received under the 2003 sports capital programme, a total of over €52.8 million was allocated in grant funding to 617 projects. This included an allocation of over €13.4 million to 108 projects classified as ‘community-mixed' under the programme. Since 1998, under the sports capital programme, almost €267 million has been allocated to over 3,500 sport or recreation projects in clubs and community facilities in villages and towns throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1663">The 2004 sports capital programme was advertised in the national press on 30 November and 1 December last. The closing date for receipt of completed applications is Friday, 16 January 2004. All applications received will be evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1664">This Government intends, as it committed to do in An Agreed Programme for Government, to put in place a long-term strategic plan to ensure the development of sports facilities throughout the country. The first step in this process has commenced with a review of the existing sports capital programme under the Department's expenditure review programme. The purpose of this review is to establish what has been achieved under this programme over recent years with a view to identifying gaps in the existing provision and procedures and setting priorities for the future. The expenditure review will be completed by the end of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1665">The swimming pool capital programme under my aegis provides funds for grant-aiding the provision of new and the refurbishment of existing local authority swimming pools, some of which are operated by local community groups. The provision in my Department's Estimates for 2004 for the local authority swimming pool programme is €15 million. This represents an increase of 67% on the estimate provision of €9 million for 2003. The maximum grant available under the programme is €3.8 million, subject to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. In addition to pool construction, approved grant aid may also be applied towards the cost of a toddler pool, sauna and steam room. The balance of the financing must be provided by the local authority directly or a combination of local authority funding and other group financing such as from community groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_1666">The scheme applies to pools provided by local authorities themselves or by other bodies where the application for capital funding is supported by the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1667">Where a project is being undertaken by an organisation other than a local authority, the proposal must be considered, supported and submitted by the relevant local authority. Before supporting a project, the local authority would have to be satisfied that the proposal was viable, that the balance of funding required to complete the project was available and that the project, when completed, would have a satisfactory level of public access.</p>
          <p eId="para_1668">To assist the Department in formulating future policy on swimming pools, the Department has commenced an expenditure review of the local authority swimming pool programme. This review is examining, among other things, how the programme has worked to date, the benefits which have accrued to the areas where pools have been built through the existing programme and what amendments, if any are required to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of the programme. In that context the potential of a PPP approach to swimming pool provision is being considered.</p>

          <p eId="para_1673">By way of direct support, my Department's ACCESS scheme of capital grants for arts and culture infrastructure will provide €45.71 million to 44 projects during the life of the scheme, which will greatly increase access for people and communities all around the country to arts facilities and activities.</p>

All applications are assessed on income and medical needs grounds and should be made to the local health board for processing.</p>

          <p eId="para_1698">The position is that the Voluntary Health Insurance Acts give explicit powers to the VHI board in determining the nature of the cover to be provided under its health insurance products for the treatment and care of members. Similarly, the regulatory framework covering health insurance business generally provides for insurers to determine the nature of, and manner in which, benefits for the treatment of members under their plans are provided. This is subject to providing a specified minimum level of benefit, mainly relating to in-patient services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1699">The matter raised by the Deputy relates to operational and business decisions which are a matter for the VHI board. In that context, inquiries made to VHI Healthcare has confirmed that out patient radiotherapy treatment is covered under its insurance plans. Treatments for radiotherapy are provided at two public hospitals, St. Luke's Hospital, Rathgar, and at Cork University Hospital. Benefits are also provided at the Mater Private Hospital and St. Vincent's Private Hospital, Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_1700">Recently, a new package of benefits has been agreed with the consultant radiation oncologists, for patients receiving radiation treatments on and after 1 October 2003. The new comprehensive benefits provide full cover for consultant day care radiation including consultations and assessments of the patient throughout the course of radiotherapy treatment and psychological support for the patient and their family if required. The new benefits also incorporate one follow-up out patient consultation after the course of radiotherapy treatment has been completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1701">VHI Healthcare estimates that over 2,700 patients will benefit from these treatments in the first year.</p>

Applications for sponsorship are made to the individual health board-authority which are responsible for their own selection processes. Vacancies for permanent positions are then reserved to which the sponsored students are appointed on successful completion of the course. Selection criteria are designed to establish not only the suitability of candidates for sponsorship but also their suitability for subsequent permanent appointment as public health nurses by the board-authority.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1744">The Minister established a working group. At present it is examining the provision of home support and personal assistants for people with disabilities. It is comprised of representatives of the Department, service providers and service users.</p>
          <p eId="para_1745">The group intends to produce a draft set of standard policies and procedures covering various aspects of personal assistance and home support services for consideration by the health boards early in 2004. It will consider the direct provision of personal assistance services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1746">A sum of €3 million is being made available in the 2004 budget for services for people with physical or sensory disabilities to meet priority service pressures as identified by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards, in consultation with other relevant agencies. The service pressures include respite, home supports and personal assistants, services for people with significant disabilities, support services for children with disabilities, and the provision of aids and appliances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1747">My Department has been and continues to work with the health boards, people with disabilities and their families on the development of a range of support services. They aim to enable an individual with a disability to live as independently as possible within their communities for as long as possible. In cases where residential services are required, the aim is to provide them in a manner that maintains the independence of the individual to the greatest extent possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_1755">I have been informed that the doctor concerned in the case is currently fully registered as a medical practitioner by the Medical Council.

          <p eId="para_1756">The SEHB has informed me that it has concerns on foot of difficulties experienced in seeking the return of the medical and nursing notes of a patient. This could be considered to be in breach of the provisions of the Medical Council's ethical guide. Standards on professional confidentiality and the media are also addressed in the guide.</p>
          <p eId="para_1757">The board has also informed me that it is aware that the person was in contact with a patient from the board. Last April it wrote to him asking him to desist from further contact with the patient.</p>
          <p eId="para_1758">Under the Medical Practitioners Act 1978, the Medical Council was established as the statutory authority that oversees the registration and regulation of doctors. It also evaluates the suitability of the medical education and training provided by any body within the State. The council, on receipt of a complaint from an individual or agency about a registered medical practitioner, is in a position to commence fitness to practise proceedings to take appropriate action when there are grounds to do so. Arising from section 45(5) of the Medical Practitioners Act 1978 information about findings of any fitness to practise committee on any matter referred to it and the decision of the council, on any report made to such committee, cannot be made public unless and until any person so investigated is found guilty of professional misconduct or unfit to practise medicine without such person's consent.</p>

          <p eId="para_1772">The International Agency for Research on Cancer operates under the aegis of the World Health Organisation. It classified radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas, as a class A carcinogen. Radon has been shown to cause cancer, specifically lung cancer, on the basis of human epidemiological studies. Prolonged exposure to elevated levels of radon gas in an enclosed area can be a contributory factor in increasing the risk of lung cancer, particularly where other factors such as cigarette smoking are involved. My Department has been advised by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland that while smoking is the primary cause of lung cancer worldwide, it is estimated that 10% of lung cancer deaths in Ireland each year may be associated with radon exposure, many of which will be among smokers rather than non-smokers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1773">The monitoring of radiation levels in the State is carried out by the RPII, which operates under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The institute identified areas at greatest risk from high indoor radon levels.

The RPII also provides a radon measurement and advisory service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1774">Radon in the workplace is subject to health and safety legislation.

      his plans to deal with the increase in obesity among adults and children in 2004.
      [31843/03]

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_457">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_1778">Earlier this year the SLÁN survey was published. It revealed that reported rates of overweight and obesity have increased in both adult men and women from 1998 to 2002, inclusive. Obesity rates for men have risen from 11%, reported in the survey in 1998, to 14% in 2002 and from 9% of women to 12% in 2002. The increase in obesity is accompanied by a significant increase in levels of physical inactivity. Numbers of those reporting no physical activity at all have increased among men, from 21% to 30%, and women, from 20% to 25%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1779">One of the key strategic aims in the national health promotion strategy is to increase the percentage of the population that consume the recommended daily servings of food and maintain a healthy weight. A key objective of the strategy is to implement national healthy eating guidelines. Food and nutrition guidelines for primary schools will be published shortly. They will aim to educate children on nutrition and enable them to make healthy food choices throughout life. The primary aim of the health strategy, Quality and Fairness, is to achieve better health for everyone through a population health approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_1780">National campaigns support the implementation of these strategies whose aim is to raise awareness of nutrition and physical activity. The campaign Let it Go – just for 30 minutes focused on the message that even minor increases in levels of activity can lead to positive health benefits. The national healthy eating campaign has concentrated on encouraging people to eat four or more portions of fruit or vegetables per day. As part of these campaigns health boards provide regional and local focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_1781">As a direct result of the cardiovascular health strategy there are now 36 additional community dietitians. They formed partnerships with community groups to provide nutrition education, cookery programmes and healthy eating projects. The majority of boards have been resourced to run specific targeted, focused, sustained programmes aimed, in particular, at those on low income. Physical activity co-ordinators have also been appointed to each board. Their task is to promote physical activity amongst the population as recommended in the national strategies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1782">The results of the recently published survey demonstrate that further action needs to be taken in order to halt and reverse obesity trends. Obesity has been linked to increased prevalence of diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. My Department recognises the need to respond to the information rapidly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1783">A multidisciplinary task force comprising of the key stakeholders will be assembled shortly. It will be charged with planning and implementing a strategy whose primary aim will be to halt any further increase in obesity levels.</p>

In October the compulsory purchase orders and environmental impact studies for the northern section, which is 46 km in length, were published. An oral hearing may be held early in 2004. A CPO and EIS for the southern section are expected to be completed in early 2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_1904">As I indicated in the reply on 30 September, the new driving test report was introduced in February 2002 as a customer service initiative to make the report more easily understood by driving test candidates. It grades faults according to their seriousness under various headings and aspects of driving. In comparison with the former report sheet it provides more information on the aspect of driving where a fault is incurred. Driver testers also use the report as a marking sheet and faults are recorded as they occur during the test. Pass or failure is dependent on the number and type of faults incurred and they are clearly indicated on the report sheet. The new report sheet was positively received. At present I do not propose to amend the report sheet but the layout and content will be kept under review.</p>

          <p eId="para_1906">It is my policy that all bus and rail transport operators should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility to the mobility and sensory impaired.</p>
          <p eId="para_1907">Over the past three years Bus Éireann has pursued a policy of replacing its urban bus fleet with new low floor wheelchair accessible buses. At present the company's entire regular urban fleets in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford are low floor. It also has 20 low-floor wheelchair accessible buses on a number of rural routes and six low floor double deck buses on the Dublin to Ashbourne route. A number of other low floor commuter services are in the pipeline.</p>
          <p eId="para_1908">Since 1990 all new coaches purchased by the company for inter-city services have a kneeling facility. It allows the front of the coach to be lowered to allow for easier access. However, in common with almost all European operators, all the coaches operated by Bus Éireann on its inter-city routes are not accessible for people in wheelchairs. Accessible coaches for scheduled services are not in commercial production. It is uncertain when such a coach will go into commercial mass production. Bus Éireann will monitor developments. A company official is involved in COST 349. It is an EU funded research programme whose objective is to develop guidance on the construction and design of inter-urban and international coach and bus systems in respect of the needs of people with disabilities. Recently my Department engaged with representative organisations of private bus operators with a view to developing a programme for the roll-out of accessible bus services.</p>

          <p eId="para_1963">The issue of the Shannon dual gateway is one that I must consider in the context of EU-US negotiations currently under way. Formal detailed negotiations took place between the EU and the US in early October and last week in Brussels. During negotiations a special committee made up of all member states assisted the Commission. Ireland is represented by a senior official from my Department. It is unclear how long negotiations will take.</p>
          <p eId="para_1964">In dealing with the issue of the dual gateway status of Shannon airport, in addition to the impact on the mid-west region, I must take account of wider considerations, especially the opportunities for new business for Ireland not exploited at present due to the limitation on the number of US destinations open to Irish airlines. I must also seek to complement, in policy terms, the impending establishment of an independent Shannon airport and the work of the Shannon board designate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1965">Recently the tourism policy review group gave its report to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. It recommended that my Department should immediately renegotiate the Ireland-US international air agreement in advance of an EU-US agreement in order to remove the present US gateways restriction. Change in the area is inevitable. Officials are currently holding consultations, on my behalf, with the trade unions representing airport staff. I will consult the new board designate of Shannon Airport in the near future. Recently I spoke to interest groups from the Shannon region. I will decide what steps to take after consultations have been concluded.</p>

          <p eId="para_1972">On 5 November the group submitted an application for staffing grant assistance under the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme 2000-2006. It was forwarded immediately to Area Development Management Limited. The company carries out a thorough assessment of each project proposal on behalf of my Department. On completion of the assessment process, the application will be considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, that makes funding recommendations to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_1973">Support towards staffing costs under the programme is only available to community based child care projects that meet its criteria, show that they are addressing disadvantage and support the child care needs of disadvantaged parents who are in employment, education or training.

          <p eId="para_1975">The persons concerned applied for asylum in the State but subsequently withdrew their application and applied for residency on the basis that their Irish born child was born in February 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1976">Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L and O, the separate procedure that then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases that were outstanding on that date. At present there are a large number of cases outstanding, including the case to which the Deputy refers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1977">Since the persons in question do not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction the issue of permission to remain will be considered. This will be done only in the context of a ministerial proposal to deport them. They will be notified of the proposal and given an opportunity to make representations. If, in the light of their representations and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, the Minister decides not to make a deportation order they will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis. At this stage I cannot say when the file will be examined because of the large number of cases on hand.</p>

          <p eId="para_2041">I would prefer if Loughan House was operated by the Prison Service within a prison system that functions on a sensible, reasonable and cost effective basis. Achieving that will require significant cost restructuring in all prisons and places of detention on foot of proposals put to the Prison Officers' Association for new staff attendance arrangements and elimination of overtime working. As already announced, the Government has decided that, in the event of no agreement on proposals, Loughan House will be run under new management outside of the prison system.</p>
          <p eId="para_2042">I have made it clear to the POA that I want to move forward. Yesterday negotiations with the association commenced in the Labour Relations Commission. I hope that consensus can be reached. A successful outcome would enable Loughan House to continue to operate as an open centre run by the Prison Service.</p>

          <p eId="para_2056">I am sure the Deputy will be aware of the up to date position regarding my proposed change agenda aimed at eliminating overtime payments and reducing other costs in the Prison Service. In that context the Government approved on 11 November the progressive implementation of a number of measures in the event of failure to reach agreement with the POA. These measures include taking two open centres out of prison service management and mothballing two other institutions. These measures have implications for staffing levels elsewhere in the organisation and will give rise to redeployment of staff to other prisons.</p>
          <p eId="para_2057">The approved measures also include the holding of a competition for the recruitment to a new entry level grade of prison officer. The Prison Service is carefully examining the detailed arrangements which would need to be put in place to give effect to this aspect of the Government decision. Pending that review and the outcome of the redeployment of staff from the four institutions mentioned, I cannot say how long the current panel will continue.</p>

This cap is being reviewed, taking account of the need to ensure effective competition in this sector of retailing and ongoing developments in retail formats, while also having regard to issues of proper planning and sustainable development.

          <p eId="para_2083">The results of the statutory assessment of local authority housing need, which was undertaken by local authorities in March 2002, indicated that a total of 48,413 households were in need of housing. Detailed information on the results of the 2002 assessment has been published in my Department's September 2002 quarterly edition of the Housing Statistics Bulletin, copies of which are available in the Library.</p>
          <p eId="para_2084">It is expected that local authorities will achieve 5,500 house starts in 2004 under the main local authority housing programme. This includes 500 new house starts under regeneration programmes. Through the various social and affordable housing schemes, it is estimated the needs of more than 12,500 households will be met in 2004, compared to almost 8,500 households in 1998.</p>

          <p eId="para_2326">From 1997 to date, my Department has issued approximately 7,600 excavation licences. I have arranged for a copy of the database reports detailing the archaeologist and the location of their excavations to be forwarded electronically to the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_2327">On completion of an excavation, the archaeologist holding the licence is obliged to furnish a report to my Department. This report should include a full account of the stratigraphy, features and finds including any specialist reports that were required. My Department ensures information on excavations is provided annually by contributing to the research, editing and publication of the Excavations Bulletin, which contains a summary report of excavations carried out in the relevant year. Recently, the 2001 edition of Excavation Bulletin was launched and I will arrange for a copy to be forwarded to the Deputy. The information is also available on a dedicated website, at www.excavations.ie, which is funded by my Department. My Department is examining the feasibility of making copies of all reports received publicly available. The care and conservation of artefacts retrieved from excavations, including the right to access them for research purposes, are matters for the National Museum of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_2328">Developers fund the majority of excavations and consequently expenditure relating to these are not available to my Department. While value for money is a matter between individual developers and excavators, fuller publication and dissemination of results would undoubtedly enhance this.</p>
          <p eId="para_2329">My Department has made improvements to the licensing framework by improving efficiencies in the provision of licences. There is scope for further improvements to the system, which, among other things, will assist in the publication of results and which will ensure timely submission of reports by archaeologists, and these matters are being considered.</p>

          <p eId="para_2340">I propose to take Questions Nos. 207 and 208 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2341">The allocation of €300,000, which I announced on 10 December 2003, relates to the initiation of a language awareness campaign, the aim of which will be to inform prospective parents and parents of children between the age of 0 and 5 years, who are resident in the Gaeltacht, of the advantages of choosing Irish as the main language of the household. While the campaign will focus primarily on parents in that target group, it is expected to generate an additional benefit of heightening awareness nationally regarding the advantages of possessing fluency in Irish. This approach is in line with the relevant proposals contained in the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta.</p>
          <p eId="para_2342">While television and radio advertisements will form part of the campaign, specific measures will also be undertaken to provide support and advice to parents who wish to raise their children with Irish, including the provision of suitably designed literature. I expect the campaign, which will be implemented by my Department in association with Údarás na Gaeltachta, will be ready to launch early in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_2343">This is a practical, costed measure that recognises the importance of transmitting the Irish language from one generation to the next and addresses the need to speak Irish to children as much as possible in the early years of their lives. I am confident the allocation of €300,000 provided will be sufficient to deliver real benefits within the framework outlined above.</p>

      <b>Mr. R. Bruton</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
      if her attention has been drawn to the fact that the means test for the carer's allowance contains no extra allowance for a parent who is caring for three children who all need constant care; and if she will introduce a change to the means test along the lines applied in the higher education grant which would raise the income disregard in cases in which there is more than one person cared for.

          <p eId="para_2404">The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people on low incomes who look after those in need of full-time care and attention. As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test, in which the income of both the carer and his-her partner is assessable, is applied to the carer's income. This ensures resources are directed to those in greatest need.</p>
          <p eId="para_2405">Provision has been made in successive budgets for substantial increases in the income disregards. From next April, the weekly income disregards will increase to €250 for a single carer and to €500 for a couple. The effect of this increase is that a couple with three children, earning a joint income of up to €29,458 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance. The same couple, if they had an income of €47,400 could still qualify for a reduced rate of carer's allowance, free travel, household benefits and the respite care grant.</p>
          <p eId="para_2406">In addition, where the income being assessed is earned by the carer's spouse the following amounts are deducted from the carer's income: €2.54 per week in respect of each child maintained by the couple; and amounts paid in respect of PRSI, union dues and travel expenses. Carers of more than one incapacitated person are entitled to an additional 50% of their rate of payment. This is an acknowledgement of the particular difficulties, both financial and personal, which are faced by these carers. These recipients also receive a double respite care grant in June each year. Budget 2004 made provision for an increase of €200 in this amount to €1,670 from June 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_2407">The Deputy's proposal to change the carer's allowance means test along the lines of the higher education grants means test is one of a range of proposals which are made from time to time. All these proposals would involve additional expenditure and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</p>

          <p eId="para_2411">A widow or widower who does not qualify for a contributory pension and who does not have dependent children may receive a widow-er's non-contributory pension. Those with dependent children may qualify for the one-parent family payment, OFP, which includes income disregards to recognise the additional costs and difficulties that lone parents with young children may face in participating in training and employment. Changes in the arrangements regarding widow-er's pension would have financial implications and would only be considered in a budgetary context.</p>

          <p eId="para_2415">The pre-1953 old age contributory pension was introduced in May 2000 to enable people with pre-1953 insurance who could not qualify for pension under normal qualifying conditions to receive a pension. Those who qualify receive a payment at 50% of the maximum rate. To be eligible a person needs 260 paid contributions at the appropriate rate, which can comprise a mixture of pre and post-1953 contributions. The appropriate rate in the case of pre-1953 contributions refers to contributions made under the National Health Insurance Acts. It is open to any person to apply for this special pension scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_2417">The application for carer's allowance of the person concerned was disallowed by a deciding officer who, having considered the medical evidence furnished in support of the claim, and the views of the Department's chief medical adviser, decided that the care recipient was not in need of full-time care and attention as prescribed in the statutory provisions. She appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office and the appeals officer considers that an oral hearing is required. This will be arranged as soon as possible. Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers.

          <p eId="para_2419">Social welfare payments can be broadly divided into three types: contributory social insurance payments, entitlement to which is dependent on PRSI contributions paid or credited; non-contributory social assistance payments, entitlement to which is determined by reference to an individual's means, and other payments or benefits, paid to all qualifying persons irrespective of means or contributions – for example, child benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_2420">In the case of contributory pensions or other non-means tested payments, as payments are made without reference to income it is not possible to indicate the numbers who depend on their social welfare payment as their sole source of income.

Persons below a certain means level or with no assessed means receive the maximum rate of payments as appropriate.</p>

          <p eId="para_2532">The objective of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to meet immediate, short-term income maintenance needs. The crèche supplements, which have been provided under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, were intended as a short-term income support for the parents of children who were referred to child care for medical. family support or child protection reasons by the health board public health nurses or social workers. However, in many cases, the supplements have been in payment for long durations and for reasons which are outside the scope of the original intention of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_2533">My Department has written to the health boards that pay crèche supplements, informing them of my decision in this regard and outlining the cost of these payments in their functional area. In addition, my officials met health board representatives to discuss all of the measures I announced in the context of the Abridged Estimates Volume 2004, including crèche supplements.</p>
          <p eId="para_2534">The Northern Area Health Board has confirmed to my Department that the crèches in its functional area that receive support from the board will not close as a result of the withdrawal of supplementary welfare allowance crèche supplements. The board is examining the financial support it provides to these crèches and will seek whatever additional funding is deemed necessary within its child care and family support budget for 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_2535">My officials have also met officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has responsibility for child care supports, and that Department is considering the scope it may have to provide support to the crèches in question.</p>

          <p eId="para_2537">Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_2538">Rent supplements are subject to a means test and are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of €12 which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_2539">The South-Western Area Health Board was contacted on behalf of the individual in question and advised that in the course of a review of her rent supplement an error was discovered in the calculation of the amount of rent supplement paid for the period June 2003 to October 2003. Maintenance payments of €30 per week were not taken into account in the means test thus giving rise to an overpayment of rent supplement. The health board does not propose to seek recovery of this overpayment.</p>
          <p eId="para_2540">However, the individual in question also had a previous overpayment of rent supplement which arose when she took up work but did not advise the health board of the change in her circumstances. The recovery of this overpayment commenced in 2002 with a once off contribution. I have been advised that, following unsuccessful attempts to agree a repayment schedule, the individual was notified a deduction of €20 per month was proposed from her rent supplement to secure recovery of this overpayment. The health board is satisfied the individual was fully aware of this overpayment and of the intention to seek recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_2541">The correct rate of rent supplement, including the deduction for the overpayment, went into payment on 24 November 2003.
