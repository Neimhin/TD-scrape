          <p eId="para_9">I agree to this and I commend the Government on its contribution to date to the catastrophe in Haiti.  I will not have time to speak on the debate, so I would like to a make a point now.  We have a Naval Service vessel that is a fully equipped hospital ship.  There are medics and doctors queuing up to give of their time free of charge to assist in this catastrophe.  I request the Tánaiste to see to it that this ship is made ready and sails for Haiti.  It is a fully equipped hospital ship and could do enormous beneficial work offshore, just as other countries are doing during this tragedy.  As it will be located offshore, it will be immune from earthquakes, and doctors and nurses in this country are more than willing to stay on that ship and carry out essential operations for those who have been devastated by the earthquake.  It would represent an invaluable contribution from the Government and I will support it wholeheartedly if it commits to it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_11">We in the Labour Party welcome the provision of time to debate what has happened in Haiti.  A disaster of this magnitude can only be dealt with by armies and professional aid agencies.  When the genocide in Rwanda occurred, I chaired the European Council of Ministers.  It is unfortunate that neither the United Nations nor other multilateral or international bodies have learned much about preparedness for events of the scale and magnitude of these disasters.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">It is essential, at a time when ordinary people are donating large sums of money to the Irish aid agencies, all of whom are extremely experienced in these fields, that we also make a contribution to Haiti in terms of the Defence Forces.  Assets of this capacity — the Defence Forces, the Fire Service and so forth — can help to deal realistically with a disaster of this magnitude.  I welcome the opportunity to have a debate.</p>

          <from>The Tánaiste</from>
          <p eId="para_13">As the Deputy will be aware, the Government pledged finance for Haiti.  I commend Irish people who have been very forthcoming in support of the appeals.  This morning, a transportation of food aid left Dublin for Haiti.  The issue raised by Deputy Kenny could be considered in the context of the debate and the further response to support people, that will be necessary for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">Some members of the rapid response corps have been deployed to Haiti and a number of others are available to go there if requested.  Some of these matters could be considered further by the Government in the context of the debate.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" as="#Leas-Cheann_Comhairle" eId="spk_13">
          <from>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</from>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_16">I will change direction slightly, if I may.  The Government destroyed the concept of social partnership which existed here for many years.  While partnership was never perfect, the air traffic controllers action, which the Minister for Transport indicated is doing enormous reputational damage to Ireland, would never have happened or got this far if the national implementation structure was still in place.  It is clearly a requirement that both sides step back and that, in the absence of the national implementation structure, the dispute be moved immediately to the Labour Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">The Tánaiste is the Minister with responsibility for industrial relations.  What action does the Government propose to take this morning to ensure airports are kept open, further reputational damage, as referred to by the Minister for Transport, is not done and people are enabled to go about their legitimate business and travel into and out of the country?  Given the reduction of 8% or 9% in economic growth last year, it is imperative and essential that every single aspect of our country ranks among the best.  With an action of this type doing such damage this early in the year, I ask the Tánaiste, who has responsibility for industrial relations, to answer to the country and tell us what actions the Government will take this morning to assist in this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_19">As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is aware, with the demise of social partnership, there is absence of a structure.  This matter must come before the Labour Court, which is the last line of defence.  I want to know what the Government proposes to do in this regard.  Businesses are incensed at the situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_21">The Government is very concerned about the impact of the industrial action and the consequences for passengers and the economy that arose yesterday.  The Labour Court was in touch with both sides yesterday evening, with a view to inviting both sides back into the Labour Court for exploratory talks aimed at avoiding further disruption.  The Government view is that the resolution of these types of industrial relations disputes is best served in the Labour Court, which is available on Friday and over the weekend to try to address these issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">In the matter of secondary legislation, what is the position regarding the commencement order for the emergency legislation providing for reductions in civil and public service pay?  The leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, raised this matter with the Taoiseach yesterday.  We cannot find a commencement order in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>  or the Oireachtas Library.  The Taoiseach promised to indicate whether the order was made for the deductions in Civil Service salaries.  If it has been made, why has it not yet been published?</p>
          <p eId="para_24">In the course of the debate on the Bill, the Labour Party pointed out that, as drafted, the legislation would apply to a wide range of non-governmental organisations, voluntary organisations and organisations funded by the Health Service Executive, including many community organisations, the Red Cross and Leader programmes.  The Government specifically introduced an amendment to restrict the measure to public servants who were paying the pension levy.  The HSE is issuing a series of notifications to grant aided and voluntary organisations ordering them from 1 January to reduce salary payments to staff in line with the Government's Bill.  The HSE letter states that the reductions in salary will also apply to staff in grant aided agencies which are not specifically included in the legislation.

When is the legislation to abolish the National University of Ireland likely to come before the House?  My colleague and Labour Party spokesperson on education has submitted notice to the office of the Ceann Comhairle to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  The Minister for Education and Science has extraordinarily decided not to use this House but rather to announce outside this House that he is to abolish the National University of Ireland.  Which item of legislation in the Government legislative programme will achieve this option?  Is it proposed to add to the legislative programme as circulated to achieve this?  There will be an opportunity for my colleague to discuss this in some detail.</p>

What legislative measures do the Tánaiste and her colleagues propose to introduce to deal with this issue?  A Bill that was described by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as ground-breaking and earth-shattering was passed with all-party agreement in this House last year.  He promised results, but his Government has failed to deliver.  When that legislation was passed last year, the Tánaiste and her colleagues raised expectations that the Garda Síochána would deliver.  How can they tally the passing of tough legislation with the fact that almost 800 members of the force, some at very senior level, retired last year?  The Minister for Finance promised that senior officerships in the Garda would be filled.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Peter Power)</from>
          <p eId="para_243">On behalf of the Government I extend our sincere condolences to the people of Haiti and, in particular, those who lost loved ones in last week's earthquake.  Our thoughts go out to the family of Andrew Grene, who tragically lost his life in the disaster while serving with the United Nations.  The Government also extends its sympathy to the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr Ban Ki-moon, and to the families of all UN personnel who lost their lives.  We also extend our condolences to the family of the Concern employee killed in the disaster and express our sincere hope that another employee reported missing will be found safe and well.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">It is now more than a week since the catastrophic earthquake struck Haiti and it is clear that the death toll will be well over 100,000.  The scale of the devastation is unimaginable, with most of Port-au-Prince and Haiti's other main cities almost completely destroyed.  Few countries in the world were less equipped to deal with a disaster of this magnitude than Haiti.  For the hundreds of thousands of people left homeless and those desperate for medical attention and life-saving aid, help cannot come quickly enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Ireland along with the rest of the EU, the UN and the international community is doing everything possible to provide assistance and ensure it reaches those who need it most.  While many have given up hope for missing family members, search and rescue operations miraculously continue to find survivors.  On Tuesday four people were pulled from under the rubble by international teams.  Yesterday a ten year old girl and her eight year old brother were found and there are reports that a five year old boy has been pulled from the ruins of his home by his uncle.  Many hundreds of lives have been saved by rescue teams, both local and international, who are working tirelessly to free those trapped inside collapsed buildings.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Inevitably, however, over the coming days the focus in Haiti will move from the search and rescue phase to trying to address the needs of those left homeless by the earthquake.  Millions have lost their houses and many others whose homes are still standing are too afraid to return for fear of the after shocks.  Medical treatment for the injured is vital.  Facilities are improving as field hospitals arrive, and with them more doctors and medical supplies, but the needs are still overwhelming.  I thank Deputy Kenny for his constructive contribution on the Order of Business and am pleased to inform him that Irish Aid has been working closely with the Department of Defence since the disaster struck.  Two members of the Defence Forces have joined the technical team which was deployed to Haiti to assess our response.  Officials from Irish Aid have been in contact with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland to examine how the participation of Irish medical professionals can be facilitated.  The technical team will make recommendations on how we can best contribute to relief efforts and Deputy Kenny's helpful proposal will be incorporated into our response.  The risk of infection from delays in carrying out surgery and the spread of disease is enormous and must be dealt with if thousands of further deaths are to be avoided in the coming weeks.  The fact that the rainy season is due to begin in March means that the international community has only a limited time to address these issues and avoid a public health catastrophe.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">I pay tribute to the response of the Irish people to the events in Haiti.  The public has demonstrated an extraordinary level of generosity in supporting appeals from NGOs and UN agencies over the past few days.  Millions of euro have been donated at a time when many people are feeling the effects of the recession, have lost their jobs or saw their salaries reduced.  This level of generosity towards and solidarity with the people of Haiti is something of which all of us in Ireland can be proud.  My own office has received many calls from members of the public asking how they can help.  I commend each and every member of the public who has contributed.  Their support will mean the difference between life and death for many of those suffering the effects of this disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">I pay particular tribute to the many Irish people working in Port-au-Prince and elsewhere in Haiti to distribute aid, provide medical attention and, wherever possible, to save lives.  Irish people are daily risking their personal safety to bring relief to the Haitian people.  All of those working with the UN, NGOs or as part of private initiatives deserve our recognition and thanks.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">I am pleased to report to the House that the Government's response to this disaster was swift and decisive.  Within hours of the earthquake, Irish Aid was in contact with NGOs such as Concern and Goal to make emergency funding available.  Our mission in Geneva and our emergency and recovery unit were in communication with the UN from the early morning of 14 January to assess the scale of the disaster and likely needs.  By lunchtime of that day, we had pledged €2 million to support the initial emergency relief effort.  Of this, €1 million was allocated to a United Nations emergency appeal for Haiti, of which €300,000 was immediately paid out to the World Food Programme and the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, respectively, the latter of which is co-ordinating the international relief effort.  A further €250,000 was paid out to the Red Cross and the remainder of the funding is being channelled through NGOs such as Concern and GOAL.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">Irish Aid, the Government's overseas aid programme, has freighted 84 tonnes, or 16 lorry loads, of emergency equipment to Haiti.  These were transported by air to Santo Domingo from our emergency stockpiles and then by road to Port-au-Prince, where they arrived last night.  Included in the shipment are plastic sheeting for emergency shelters, blankets, kitchen sets, jerry cans and large containers for water storage.  In total, we have provided enough supplies to shelter up to 8,000 families and to provide them with the water and basic infrastructure needed for survival.  The supplies will be distributed by the Concern and GOAL operations in Haiti.  I take this opportunity to compliment the work carried out by these and other Irish aid agencies working in Haiti.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">Three members of the Irish Aid rapid response corps have deployed to Haiti.  These are an electrical engineer and an information technology expert, who have been assigned to the World Food Programme, and a security consultant who will work with GOAL.  Corps volunteers provide highly specialised skills to humanitarian agencies operating in crisis situations and can be deployed within days or even hours of a disaster.  Other corps members with specialised skills in engineering, logistics and water and sanitation are on stand-by and we expect them to be called upon in the coming days and weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">We have also dispatched an Irish Aid technical mission to Haiti, supported by a member of the Defence Forces, to assess how Ireland can best contribute to the international relief effort and to make recommendations as to how we should direct our funding.  The team will advise me on the short and medium-term needs in Haiti and will liaise with the organisations we are already supporting to ensure that Ireland's contribution is managed in a co-ordinated and effective manner.  Our team arrived last night and has based itself at the airport in Port-au-Prince.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">The total value of the Government response both financially and in kind is almost €3 million and there is every possibility that this figure will increase further once we have a clearer and more comprehensive picture of Haiti's needs.  This figure is in addition to our ongoing contributions to the United Nation's central emergency response fund which was established following the 2004 tsunami to provide the United Nations with a ready pool of emergency funding for crises such as that in Haiti.  Within days of the earthquake, the United Nations drew down US$25 million to fund the international relief operation and this money has already begun to make an impact.  Ireland was one of the countries which pressed for the establishment of the fund.  We have contributed €73 million since it was set up in 2006, including €20 million last year.  We can be proud that our funds are helping to save thousands of lives in Haiti, as they have in other disaster areas throughout the globe.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">The Government and my Department drew many lessons from the 2004 tsunami.  In the aftermath of that enormous tragedy we reflected on how we, on behalf of the Irish people, could respond more quickly and effectively to future disasters.  We identified those parts of the system which could be improved and put in place the structures that allowed us to react quickly to the Haiti disaster.  For example, we established the rapid response corps to meet the need for highly specialised skills in a major emergency and to harness the significant talent and volunteer spirit which exists in Irish society.  We developed emergency stockpiles of humanitarian materials in depots around the globe, precisely so that we could react as we have done.  Thousands of people in Haiti are receiving lifesaving supplies as a result of this initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">The Irish response is part of a combined European Union relief effort in Haiti totalling €122 million.  This was agreed at an emergency meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council which I attended in Brussels on Monday.  In addition to this financial support, the Union is providing 400 rescue workers from a variety of member states, as well as field hospitals, medical posts and almost 300 medical personnel.  At Monday's meeting I stressed the need for a unified, co-ordinated approach to the Haiti operation.  I also called on our fellow member states to make clear to the people of Haiti that we would stand by them as they rebuild their country.  I am pleased the European Commission has indicated it will contribute €300 million to the long-term reconstruction of Haiti.  In addition, the European Union will convene or co-convene an international meeting on reconstruction once the initial humanitarian relief phase has run its course.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">While there has been some criticism of the speed of the international response, the difficulties in getting supplies and workers into Haiti are substantial and have been exacerbated by the almost total destruction of its infrastructure.  This was a poverty-stricken country before the earthquake with only the most basic transport and communication network.  The little that existed was severely damaged, meaning the international relief effort has had to begin almost from scratch.  The best means of transporting supplies is by sea, but the main port was badly damaged and until last night completely closed to shipping.  Even now it has only extremely limited capacity.  In addition, the airport at Port-au-Prince is small and ill-equipped for an operation of this size.  The road from Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic to Port-au-Prince is of poor quality and extremely congested.  While it is only 300 km long, the journey can take up to 18 hours and security escorts are required in places.  Under these circumstances the response of the international community, led by the United Nations, has been commendable, although admittedly insufficient to meet Haiti's enormous needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">The Haiti earthquake is a disaster that has shocked the entire world with its scale and intensity.  The impact on an already vulnerable nation has been catastrophic and it will take many years for Haiti to rebuild itself.  Ireland's response, whether through the provision of much needed funds, through our emergency supplies or our highly-skilled personnel has undoubtedly saved many lives and will continue to do so in the weeks and months to come.  That said, it is inevitable that Haiti will continue to require the support of Ireland and the broader international community into the longer term as it rebuilds and slowly makes the transition from relief to development.  The challenge for us, and for the rest of the world, will be to stand with the Haitian people during that difficult transition as they reconstruct their shattered lives and country.  I am confident we will not be found wanting in that regard.</p>

        <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_236">
          <from>Deputy Billy Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_258">I extend my sympathies to all the Haitian people who have lost loved ones and suffered catastrophe.  I acknowledge in particular the family of Andrew Grene, the Concern employee, and all the United Nations employees who have lost their lives.  Every death is a tragic loss and it is awful to see the images on our television screens.  One must commend the media, particularly RTE television and radio, for driving home the terrible extent of the disaster.  It is unfortunately the case that it is once again one of the poorest parts of the world upon which this catastrophe has fallen.  It is akin to the population of Cork and Galway together being wiped out overnight.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">Haiti was struggling long before this earthquake occurred.  It is the poorest country in the western hemisphere, with 80% of the population living below the poverty line and 54% in abject poverty.  Moreover, approximately 38% of the population are under 14 years of age.  Some 3,000 troops of the United Nations stabilisation force were based in Port-au-Prince before this disaster occurred.  Irish Aid agencies and voluntary groups have been active there for some time, and a house-building exercise was recently undertaken by Irish volunteers.  I understand Mr. Denis O'Brien is heavily involved there in a telecommunications capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">One issue on which there is no policy difference in this House is in respect of the work done by Irish Aid.  When I became spokespersons for foreign affairs, spokesperson rather, although I accept I do the work of two or three, one of the areas where I considered there might be a gap was in Irish aid funding.  Anecdotally, one hears about the wastage of money.  We have a good system in place.  The Minister of State, since he came to office, and his officials are to be commended on the work they do.  While it is unacceptable, some things may go wrong or funds can go astray but what is important is that once problems are detected, they are dealt with and systems are put in place to ensure they do no recur.  We should plough on with the current policy.  The points I raise are in the context of being constructive in terms of how we move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The Minister of State referred to criticism about the speed of the international response.  That is something that will come up time and time again.  Templates can be put in place but I do not know if a perfect template can be devised for disaster response.  We have a modern democracy but we were slow to react when we had snow over Christmas.  It took us several days to respond.  One can imagine the difficulties one encounters when one is faced with a country many thousands of miles away with an infrastructure that was almost non-existent and that which existed was knocked out, especially the communications system, the airport and the port, which left access by means of a poor road from a neighbouring country.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">The Minister of State can play a role at European Union level to drive the impetus to establish an international template for disasters.  He referred in his speech to the fact that we have learned from the tsunami.  I am sure that is the case.  It is difficult, however, to put in place a structure and control when a disaster occurs.  Things cannot be righted overnight, but a certain system and broad a template could be put in place.  I am not familiar with the scheme that was put in place and how we can learn from it.  The one thing we learn from history is that things keep recurring.  We saw that in terms of the economy.  When one reflects on events in the cold light of day it is as clear as the nose on one's face what will happen.  Natural disasters will occur, perhaps not tomorrow or the next day, but they will happen in the future.  We must examine the response systems we have in place for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">I acknowledge the role of the Americans.  In recent years they have received much bad press in this House.  It is important to acknowledge the work they have done.  They have positioned approximately 10,000 troops to assist in Haiti.  It can be beneficial if an existing structure is superimposed on a place such as Haiti.  I saw on television that one local resident said the system there had failed and that the country should be occupied.  I am sure that is not the solution but it is of benefit if one can bring organisation and command and control to a disaster area such as Haiti.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The Minister of State referred to the many calls he received to his office.  I am somewhat critical of the Government even though I am hugely supportive of the concept of the rapid response corps which was mentioned in the White Paper on Irish aid some years ago.  My understanding is that it comprises approximately 150 people with expertise who are generally drawn from the public sector and possibly some aid agencies, but I am not sure about that.  That corps could be greatly expanded.  There are many people in the private sector who are keen to assist in Haiti at the moment but it is difficult to fit them into the existing structure.  We need to consider opening up the rapid response corps to the private sector and increase its strength to up to 3,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">I am sure that if the Minister advertised for volunteers to go to Haiti, without any difficulty there would be a queue outside the Irish Aid centre on O'Connell Street as far back as the gates of the Phoenix Park and the North Circular Road.  We must harness that potential in a productive way.  There is no point in people arriving at the airport with tents on their backs seeking to link up with people to go to Haiti as that would give rise to as much difficulty as it would solve.  Perhaps the Minister of State would consider expanding the panel of people on whom he depends for the rapid response corps.  ESB personnel went to France when power difficulties were experienced there some years ago.  The rapid response corps could be composed of different categories that could be used according on the needs of each disaster, for example, medical technicians, engineering technicians and communications technicians.  However, the system would have to be formalised at home before one could send out people to various areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">A second aspect of this matter relates to the European Union battle groups that caused much contention in the first and second referenda on the Lisbon treaty.  They were depicted as tanks rolling into Baghdad.  I can see my Labour Party colleagues empathise with that image.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_267">We will put John O'Shea in charge of one of them.  He really wants to lead a military force into every country that has a disaster or other problem.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_238">
          <from>Deputy Billy Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_268">I do not think a sufficiently strong tank has been built to cater for the needs of Mr. O'Shea.  They might implode.  The image of the EU battle groups is completely at variance with their purpose.  They could be equally called the EU humanitarian aid groups.  One of their tasks is humanitarian aid.  They comprise 1,500 personnel.  The current one is Polish-led.  It has trained for six months and is on stand-by for six months and is ready to move within 15 days.  I am sure its centre of operations has a plan in place to move at a day's notice if it had to go to Haiti.  The great thing about the battle group is that the structure is already in place and it could be allocated to an area.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The EU has given approximately €120 million and has pledged another €300 million.  We should consider the concept of making personnel available.  The Secretary General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, has sought additional personnel.  However, with the best will in the world, bringing people through the UN structure can be difficult, as one is involving several different nationalities who have not trained together or met beforehand.  Speed is of the essence in such cases.  The Government could push to see if there is a requirement that the EU would be ready to send what I will call a humanitarian aid group to assist.  We have a commitment to that concept but this country is not on-call, so to speak, until the first half of next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">The rebuilding of Haiti is another issue.  Everything has a cost, but we should bear in mind that when the country is being rebuilt it should be done in such a way as to ensure it is earthquake-proof, if that is not too strong a description.  The buildings must be constructed in such a manner that the possibility of them falling down again is limited because, as sure as night follows day, there probably will be an earthquake there again in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Another issue I wish to raise relates to the aid agencies.  The Minister referred to it yesterday.  One sees advertisements on the television urging people to donate to several different aid agencies.  I accept we cannot be too prescriptive in this House but it would be useful in terms of economies of scale and the development of expertise if, under the auspices of Dóchas, aid agencies would consider taking a geographic area each rather than spreading themselves too thinly over too many areas.  For example, it would be wonderful if Concern was the only aid agency in Haiti.  Perhaps the Minister takes a different view, but it would be so much easier to channel aid, assistance and development.  Instead of answering the calls of ten different agencies, one would be dealing with one agency responsible for a specific area.  That is something the aid agencies must consider.  It is my understanding that there were only three aid agencies with Irish connections operating in Haiti prior to the disaster, namely, Concern, Christian Aid and Médecins Sans Frontières.</p>

          <p eId="para_280">Too much of it is a bad thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I am a great believer in economies of scale.  One can have one organisation, one job, or one organisation, ten jobs, but not ten organisations, one job, because the job would not be done as effectively as it could be.  That is something we could consider.  I know there is competition between aid agencies for media space and fund raising, and every one of them has very honourable intentions and makes a contribution and plays its own part.  However, if the effort was more streamlined and focused, everybody might benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">The Minister of State referred to the challenges that face us in the future.  Would it be possible to take refugees from Haiti and should this be considered?  Would it be of benefit to the Haitian people?  I am not sure of the answer but attempts are being made in Haiti to get those people in the capital to go back to the provincial regions from which they came to take the pressure off the capital.  As I am sure the poverty in the regions is far greater than in the capital, this may not be an option.  I am not sure this possibility is being examined or whether it could be a solution, but if it could alleviate the plight of Haitians, we should consider taking refugees from Haiti.  God knows, we have enough empty residences throughout the country that could house people.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">To recap, I empathise with the people of Haiti but I recognise that this alone is not good enough.  I believe the Government has acted in a constructive and positive manner.  There is a great willingness on behalf of Irish people to assist.  Every time there is a disaster, no matter how bad things are at home, Irish people put the best foot forward.  What we must do as a country is ensure that this energy and commitment is channelled in the right direction and that people have an opportunity, through a structured system, to go and to assist.  I am not sure that this system is in place at present, with the best intentions in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">This event drives home the extent of the poverty that exists across the globe.  It is Haiti today but it could be Indonesia, Thailand or somewhere else tomorrow.  We should never lose sight of the fact that, irrespective of how bad matters are financially here, and there is a temptation to cut the aid budget which has suffered in the past two years, we should hold what we have at present.  I say to the Minister of State to keep up the good work.  Any support or assistance we on this side of the House can give will be given.  When we put out statements or other information, it is not as a criticism but by way of trying to be constructive.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">I am very happy to support the presentation on the disaster that is taking place in Haiti and the regular flow of statements that have come from the Minister of State.  I agree, and it is very important, that in Parliament we would convey our sympathy to the people of Haiti.  Tragically, the figure for those who have lost their lives is probably as high as 200,000, with 250,000 people who have serious injuries and 1.5 million who have lost their homes, and it is calculated that 2 million need serious assistance and 3 million have been affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">Taking this debate where I believe it should go in regard to our positive response, the Irish public who are listening to or watching our proceedings should be thanked for their generosity apart from the State aid that has already been committed.  While we will turn in a moment to the analytical or logistical difficulties that arise, the first point I would make from my own experience and knowledge is that every donation that has been made by an Irish citizen is needed, is being well spent, is welcome and is contributing positively to the reputation of Ireland.  Such contributions, joined with the Government contributions, are how we are seen.  While people may say in the case of the tsunami or Somalia that this happened or that happened, the interesting point is that the kind of contributions that were made in Ireland were found, after the examination post tsunami, to have been the most effective on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">That having been said, Haiti is not a blank page.  Two years ago, it experienced hurricanes.  I calculate that approximately 10% of what was pledged by major donors to Haiti two years ago has arrived on the ground.  The commitment for post hurricane reconstruction was at one stage of the order of €400 million.  There will be many excuses with regard to civil society, whether the structures were in place on the ground and so on.  I want to report positives in this regard, in particular the reception given to the vital assistance being provided by the United States military at this time, which is welcome and a great opportunity for the view by Haitians of their neighbour, the United States.  It is something to be built upon.  There is great importance attached to the construction of what one is doing, why one is there and what is the purpose behind one's aid.  This is reflected in the difficulty, for example, of finding acceptance for less than 1,000 troops in the Dominican Republic, the immediate neighbour.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Haiti is not a <i>tabula rasa</i>.  It comes with a certain kind of history — poverty neglected, international commitments not delivered, a president elected but gone into exile and now living in Cape Town, a military usurpation of democratic choice and, following that, a lacuna which produced serious factions which damaged the civil society.  I want to be positive, however.  It is incredibly important to concentrate on the post disaster reconstruction effort.  It is very important to be able to build on the new awareness that will be there and to create something new.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">In regard to Aceh, for example, the single biggest capital project coming from the United States, which is of a road infrastructure type and valued at approximately $240 million, is just now being done.  In that case and others, the Irish public need to be told this information.  It is not a case for stopping giving to these organisations, because they can be very well co-ordinated through Dóchas.  If there has been a failure of donations, it is not this that has actually gone wrong.  It is often a case of pledges which have not been delivered by very serious donors.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">My other point concerns the media.  I would hope the media will give time and space to a consideration of the future of Haiti.  I was present in Somalia during the Somalian famine, when one could hardly move given the number of cameras in one's way, be it in the refugee camp in Mandera in the north or, where I was, in Baidoa, where people were dying at a rate of 130 a day.  As soon as there had been a bogus landing in the middle of the afternoon, allegedly to protect warehouses, the international media flew away.  Somalia deteriorated into being a stateless place.  It was taken over by different factions but, all of the time, the structure had been there upon which a future could have been constructed.  I refer explicitly to the clan system, but Western thinking was not able to take the clan system as a good basis for the reconstruction of the civil society.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">It is necessary to see past where we are now to find how Haiti can be reconstructed, internally as well as with regard to its relationship with its neighbour.  There is also, for example, Lara Marlowe's report today on Captain McInerney's views of what he is doing there and what it is like to be welcomed.  Indeed, as the President said in one of his rare interviews, when one has a need like theirs, one does not matter who is landing on the grass.  I support that approach as it is desperately needed to save those lives which can be saved.  It is also necessary to deliver the required medical facilities while early amputations are being performed and where life itself is at stake.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">During discussions on the reform of the United Nations the idea of a United Nations-led logistics unit became a wonderful prospect.  Such a unit would have been in the best position to balance the separate logistical requirements of civil and military responses.  Both responses are needed but there would be an acknowledgment of legitimacy for a unit led by the United Nations which was capable of balancing two systems of intelligent logistics and their delivery.  The strengths of the NGO sector lie in its capacity for assessment on the ground and distribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">In Somalia, one of the biggest issues was around tracing people.  People who have lost children or elderly relatives will be anxious to find out where they are.  The various agencies, such as the International Red Cross, do different things and require different expertise.  I am very happy with the quick response of the Irish Government and the fact that it reports to us on its meetings in Europe.  I am less than happy at the response of Baroness Ashton because this is an opportunity to give leadership.  We are not simply adding in a European Union component and I would like the European Union to ally itself to the United Nations hegemony in its response.  In fairness to people whom I have often criticised, the US Administration would have welcomed such an arrangement as it would have enabled it to get on with what it is good at.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">This is the largest blow a United Nations body has taken in terms of the loss of personnel on the ground.  I associate myself with the sympathies already expressed on that matter.  Nevertheless the UN presence, which numbered 7,000 before the earthquake and until the point the hurricane hit, was perceived by many as not so much preparing for a new Haiti and moving on towards reconciliation but keeping people quiet by suppressing all the different political opinions.  New skills are required, not just in logistics but in how one reconstructs a place, taking history into account while creating models for the future.  There is a role for applied political science in this regard and there is an opportunity to create new balances among the neighbours in this region.  The Dominican Republic had a special relationship with the Bush regime but that is now changed and the Obama regime is trying to create a new international image for the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">The positive actions of Irish donors, including NGOs and the Irish Government, have been of immense value to the reputation of our country.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_251">
          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_298">I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy and condolence to the Haitian people, the United Nations personnel who lost their lives, the Concern employee and the Irish citizen working with the United Nations.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">This is a tragedy of colossal proportions.  In the tsunami five years ago between 150,000 and 160,000 lost their lives whereas the estimate in Haiti is already 200,000 and growing in what is a small country of 9 million people.  It is a huge disaster and a terrible tragedy.  It is not simply an act of God as there has been massive poverty and mismanagement in Haiti for generations, which has given rise to the absence of proper infrastructure.  In the case of housing, much accommodation is in the form of shanty towns unable to deal with something as substantial as a major earthquake or its aftershocks.  Many people are living out in the open and afraid to go back to their collapsed or semi-collapsed homes because of what might happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">Haiti was a disaster waiting to happen.  An increasing number of events have given rise to similar disasters such as the tsunami and we can almost predict that what has happened in Haiti will happen again in a few years in some other part of the world.  The public response has been excellent.  The lord mayor has organised a collection in the past week for organisations such as Goal, Trócaire, Concern and the Red Cross and the response has been unbelievable.  I have no doubt the public response will far exceed the national response, which has also been very good and I compliment those involved on how quickly it has been put together.  I also welcome the way in which the disaster fund has been supported by the Irish Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">There is a plethora of NGOs, some of which have had no previous contact with Haiti and that is part of the problem.  Individual activities by different countries and by different organisations are well intentioned and the aid is pouring in but it lacks co-ordination.  It lacks direction, focus and leadership and a centralised approach is needed.  We must learn lessons from that because what has happened in Haiti will happen elsewhere before too long, as we knew that what happened when the tsunami struck five years ago would happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">The European Union is the largest single aid donor in the world and we are part of that organisation.  Since the Lisbon treaty we have moved towards the European Union becoming an entity which is very much concerned with providing world leadership in humanitarian aid and attempting to end world poverty.  We have established a High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy and are in the process of establishing a new external action service.  We have a solidarity clause which commits each member state to offer mutual support if there is a natural disaster of this nature.  We should expand that policy on a global basis.  We act in conjunction with the United Nations and in the conference the EU will shortly hold on reconstruction the first item on the agenda should be the logistics of natural disaster rapid response co-ordination under a centralised national aid agency leadership.  Some €4.5 billion has already been collected by a similar international meeting in Sharm el Sheikh, held a year ago for the reconstruction of Gaza, but because of the intransigence of the Israelis not a single penny has been spent.  The European Union is the body to show the necessary leadership as outlined in the Lisbon treaty which we have now adopted.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">I would like Ireland to press for a huge new initiative under the auspices of the European Union in regard to future disasters because such an initiative has been missing in regard to this tragedy, notwithstanding the enormous goodwill shown by discrete aid agencies around the world and the Irish public.  Rarely has less than €20 been dropped into collection tins in Ireland to help the victims of the earthquake and €50 is the norm.  It is a colossal contribution but we should ensure structures are in place to guarantee that a focused, co-ordinated leadership is given to such disasters in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_304">Ba mhaith liom comhbhrón ó chroí a ghabháil thar cheann Shinn Féin agus thar mo cheann féin le clann Andrew Grene a fuair bás sa chrith talún i Haiti.  Bhí sé ag obair ansin mar chuntóir speisialta do cheannasaí na Náisiúin Aontaithe i Haiti.  Déanaim, dar ndóigh, comhbhrón ó chroí chomh maith le gach clann agus le stát Haiti é féin agus le haon duine a chaill gaol sa tragóid mhór atá tar éis tarlú agus atá fós ag tarlú i Haiti.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">Last Tuesday's earthquake in Haiti, measuring 7 on the Richter scale, was a tragedy of epic proportions.  Like millions of other people, I have been watching the unfolding humanitarian crisis there with a sense of horror and helplessness.  The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon has described it as the worst disaster in decades.  Now that we have seen the full scale of this tragedy we would agree about the scale of the disaster.  Up to 200,000 people are feared dead, many more are injured and some are still trapped in the rubble.  The UN has confirmed that 37 of its staff were killed, 150 injured and 300 are missing.  Up to 1.5 million people have been made homeless in a very short period.  This has happened not as a result of a war that was waged over months but it happened in seconds following this event.  The full scale of the tragedy is still unfolding as people move out of the capital and see the effects of disaster.  There have also been aftershocks and the scale of the aftershock yesterday with possibly more to come is worrying.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">The UN has estimated that 3 million people in need of aid and food.  Haiti was one of the poorest countries in the region, which was totally dependent on the UN and other food aid, and added to that it has now suffered this environmental disaster.  The figures are staggering and it is hard to capture that scale of the disaster.  Some sections of the media have managed to do so.  It brings into perspective the effects of the flooding that occurred here in recent months.  Considering what people here have gone through, their response to this disaster has been tremendous.  People understand that it does not matter how bad we think things are here, there are people who are much worse off.  There has also been a huge response to this disaster from countries throughout the world.  Large donations of money have been pouring in from all over the world and that is to be welcomed.  The World Food Programme has pledged 15,000 tonnes of food and the UN has also stepped up to the mark.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Millions of euro in aid has been given to Haiti and the response by the Government has also been tremendous.  In addition to the €20 million already donated to he European emergency fund, more is pledged.  While I may be critical of the approach of some Irish aid organisations, the response of those organisations that have been actively working on the ground and who understood the scale of poverty in Haiti has also been tremendous.  I encourage people to help them in whatever way possible.  These organisations have been struggling to cope because of the economic downturn, yet they managed to step up to the plate and have their volunteers in place ready to deliver aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">While the response of the international community has been extremely generous, the aid is only stating to trickle down to some of the people affected.  It is a pity that has taken so long.  That is one of the criticisms of the response and one of the features following every natural disaster.  I recall during the debate following the tsunami a few years ago we asked why did it take so long for aid to be delivered to the people in Sri Lanka.  The world has to get to grips with that issue.  That is one of the reasons we have the United Nations.  It is also one of the reasons we need a civil rather than a military response, a point to which I will return.  Within the western world, the rich part of world, we require to have on stand-by a better, quicker and more urgent response to natural disasters.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">Many of the earthquake victims have been left to fend for themselves.  The relief has been hampered by problems such as the lack of coordinated planning and infrastructure within Haiti, which has not helped matters.  There also has be something of a state of paralysis among some of the agencies and the commentators about a much hyped security problem — I believe it is much hyped — in the capital and outside it.  Earthquake survivors have been left to fend themselves because aid has not reached them.  In those circumstances people will scavenge for food.  This is survival.  Aid is not available.  Some people call this looting but it is survival.  A refusal to deliver aid to those areas exacerbates the problems in those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">I urge people to read an article in the today's edition of the <i>The Guardian </i> by Ingio Gilmore, a journalist, who has managed to get into Haiti. The article states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_311">As a member of the media covering the tragedy in Haiti, it's with a sense of alarm and astonishment that I've witnessed how some senior aid officials have argued for withholding aid of the utmost urgency because of sensational claims about violence and insecurity, which appeared to be based more on fantasy than reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">This is a good article.  It is critical of GOAL, undeservedly so in some ways, but the journalist has simply reported what the leader of that agency has said in this respect.  I have seen such reports in the media including on RTE.  A few nights ago there was coverage of the reporting of violence and gangs there but Charlie Bird then reported that there was no violence.  Who is one to believe, one's own person on the ground or a story that is being created to instill a sense of instability and insecurity and justify hundreds and thousands of soldiers being put on the streets, an issue to which I will return?</p>
          <p eId="para_313">The article also states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_314">Any violence is localised and sporadic; the situation is desperate yet not dangerous in general.  Crucially, it's not a war zone; it's a disaster zone — and there appears to have been little attempt to distinguish carefully between destructive acts of criminality and the behaviour of starving people helping themselves to what they can forage.  For Haitians and many of those trying to help them, the overriding sentiment is that a massive catastrophe on this scale shouldn't have to wait for aid because blanket security is the absolute priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">It has been tremendous to see the work the Haitians have been doing to pull themselves together and it shows that human beings have a capacity to pull together and overcome adversity.  Heroic efforts have been made by aid agencies and those on the ground to try to overcome the effects of the disaster and to start planning for the future because people cannot continue to live in tents and buildings that have half collapsed.  The difficulties have raised questions about the ability of the international community to organise a relief effort of this magnitude.  One of the factors that has contributed to the scale of the disaster was the lack of proper infrastructure and proper building practices in Haiti in the first instance.  It is one of the poorest countries in the region and before the earthquake 80% of the population was unemployed and 60% of the people were living in abject poverty.  There were major problems in Haiti before the disaster, much of that has contributed to the chaos in the first few days after it.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">Since achieving independence form the French in 1808, Haiti has had a turbulent history of unstable government and foreign intervention that has left the economy in a weak state.  It only produces 40% of the food it needs and up to last week more than half of Haitians lived on only $1 a day.  There are very few paved roads and minimal utilities.  Since 2004, when President Aristide was overthrown in a violent coup and the country was convulsed into violence by rival gangs vying for power, order has been maintained because of UN interventions.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">As if this were not bad enough, there have been a number of other natural disasters in recent years.  Severe flooding in 2004 left 2,000 dead.  In September 2004, Hurricane Jeanne left 3,000 dead because of flooding.  In 2005, more people were killed and much destruction caused by Hurricane Dennis.  Previously, in 1998, hundreds had been killed in violent storms and hurricanes.  That was what the Haitian Government already had to cope with.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">The weakness of the Haitian economy has meant that investment in infrastructure has not been sufficient.  That is one of the key issues that will need to be dealt with when we are past the immediate aftermath of the latest disaster.  Haiti and its infrastructure will need to be rebuilt and that will require long-term investment, not just a disaster fund.  The collapse of public buildings such as the Parliament building and much other Government infrastructure in Port-au-Prince was one reason for the initial lack of co-ordination among the Haitians themselves.  In the aftermath of the earthquake, the Red Cross found there were no state ambulances.  That puts into perspective what the aid agencies and other bodies are attempting to deal with when they get there.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">I pay tribute to all those who are contributing towards the rescue effort and I encourage people, if at all possible, to contribute more.  The agencies are performing a great service under the most trying circumstances.  However, there are some countries that seem to be treating the disaster as a PR exercise, and we must ask why these nations were not doing more to help Haiti before this disaster, in view of the fact that some of them are former colonial powers which are largely responsible, through their actions over centuries, for the decline in states such as Haiti and have profited from the injustice of colonialism.  They should be providing more aid on an ongoing basis and not just in the event of a natural disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">I also wish to highlight the positive role being played by other countries in the area.  For example, Cuba, one of Haiti's neighbours, had 400 medical staff stationed in Haiti even before the earthquake, and they have managed to keep the hospitals open as well as setting up field hospitals and so on.  This type of attitude and the solidarity and generosity from the Cubans and others has been replicated in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">There is too much reliance on the armed forces in responding to international crises, and we must consider the implications of this for national sovereignty and sensibilities.  In particular, when we consider the role of the USA in Haiti, I find it questionable that it should be in charge of the overall effort.  The UN needs to assert its authority and ensure that the US troops remain for only as long as required in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, allowing the UN to take over as quickly as possible.  Haiti must be rebuilt properly, with a sustainable economy and a sustainable infrastructure.  Otherwise, we will be revisiting this issue at some stage in the future.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Peter Power)</from>
          <p eId="para_322">I thank Members on all sides for their contributions, which were extremely constructive and, in many cases, complimentary.  It is very much appreciated by the Government, given that this is a non-partisan issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">There were so many constructive suggestions that I would like to discuss every one of them, but time will not permit.  Thus, I will discuss the two or three themes that were common to all contributions.  The compliments to Irish Aid and my officials are much appreciated.  They have been working flat-out over the past eight days to deal with this issue and make sure our response is comprehensive, co-ordinated, swift and decisive, and it has been all of those things.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">The speed of the response from the international community was raised by all speakers.  We must appreciate that no matter how quick a response is, it is never quick enough; it can never be instant.  We must remember that the circumstances are unique: Haiti is a country that was already on its knees, with an extremely poor infrastructure which is simply incapable of absorbing the international response, although many countries desired to respond very quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Both the UN and Ireland have learned lessons from previous disasters and have pre-positioned stocks around the world.  The aid that was sent would not have arrived anywhere near as quickly if we had not done this.  Deputy Timmins mentioned the Rapid Response Corps, which was established in response to the criticism, after the 2004 tsunami, that a huge number of people arrived on the scene at once and were falling over each other and generally getting in the way.  What is needed in the immediate aftermath of a disaster is a small number people who are highly skilled in logistics, communications, medical treatment and so on, and that is what we have put in place.  We have contributed a substantial amount of funding which the UN can draw down immediately, such as the OCHA and CERF funds, to which we have contributed €73 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Deputy Higgins raised the important issue, which was common to all contributions, of the role of the UN in this and future disasters.  In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, a military-style response was required and, thankfully, because of its proximity to Haiti and its shared history, the United States, with its military hardware and infrastructure, was able to respond quickly.  I have no doubt the disaster would have been much worse were it not for the military infrastructure and the ability to respond quickly.  If the disaster had taken place on the other side of the world that would not have been possible, and for this reason the UN must have a rapid response infrastructure.  That point was well made.  The role of the United States has been admirable and crucial in terms of saving lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Deputy Timmins mentioned the issue of aid agencies and I agree with many of his points.  I do not think we can be prescriptive when it comes to our own aid agencies; they are, after all, voluntary and non-governmental organisations.  Concern has been in Haiti for many years.  This morning, I received a briefing from Tom Arnold, who has just arrived back from the area.  He mentioned some of the same concerns that Members have about security in Haiti.  It has been sometimes overstated and sometimes understated, but the situation is fragile.  I will raise Deputy Timmins's views with Dóchas to see whether we can arrange for a more co-ordinated response from the aid agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">As I said, time does not permit me to go into detail on all the issues raised.  However, there is one issue that we will deal with in the House again and again.  When all the cameras are gone and the television crews have moved on to the next disaster, the people of Haiti will still need our help and support.  I made this point forcefully at the European co-ordination meeting in Brussels on Monday.  Rather than saying we will contribute €300 million or €500 million, we need to make a firm political commitment of solidarity with the people and ensure that we are there for the long haul to assist with long-term reconstruction.  In Brussels, the French Minister of State for co-operation, Alain Joyandet, who had just come back from Port-au-Prince, said that such was the nature of the disaster, we would need to talk about building from scratch rather than reconstruction.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">What we have heard from members of all parties today is that the Haitian people have our support and solidarity.  The undoubted resilience that has been referred to repeatedly will be matched by a long-term commitment by the Irish Government and people.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_4">Question again proposed: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</summary>
        <speech by="#BrianOShea" eId="spk_254">
          <from>Deputy Brian O’Shea</from>
          <p eId="para_330">I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the Adoption Bill, on which I have received more personal representations than on any other issue in recent times and about which there has been much anger, sadness and worry.  On the positive side, one of my wife's relatives, who was one of the lucky ones, adopted a little boy just before the Christmas before last.  I have never seen a child who has brought more joy to more people than has this child.  While that is the positive side of adoption, the negative side is represented by one family in particular, which has had a room prepared and furnished for more than 12 months and for which the recent announcement in regard to the curtailment of activity with Vietnam has come as a great blow.  The mother concerned asked me why Deputy Barry Andrews did not make this announcement sooner.  While I accept issues arose pertaining to the UNICEF ISS report and so on, should some action along the lines agreed recently by the Adoption Board not have been taken last August, when the draft report became available?  I refer to the recent agreement by the Adoption Board regarding particular arrangements whereby all couples and individuals who currently possess a declaration of eligibility and suitability for Vietnam may select a new country from which to adopt, subject to the usual submission of a change of country report to the Adoption Board, and also may retain their place in the current Helping Hands Adoption Mediation Agency, HHAMA, list for Vietnam, which is being maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">I acknowledge this was a draft report and I accept the Minister's position that sometimes it is dangerous to make decisions on the basis of a draft report.  However, clear indications were evident regarding the status of the matter and a statement regarding such an agreement with the Adoption Board should have been issued last August so that people who still hoped that Vietnam would open would not be left in the lurch.  The aforementioned woman has suggested that the Minister of State should apologise to those who have been caught in this position.  They consider themselves to have lost six months and are putting the blame at the Minister of State's door.  I make this point because it is how those who have contacted me feel.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">The Labour Party welcomes this Bill and considers the ratification of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoptions to be long overdue.  As my colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, pointed out at the outset of the Second Stage debate, Ireland signed the convention in 1996 but will be the last of the receiving states to ratify it.  Nevertheless, the Labour Party fully supports the Bill, at the core of which is the safety and welfare of children.  While this is exactly as it should be, there are other issues, such as the anguish it causes to families who cannot have children.  Anguish grows when prospective parents are obliged to work their way through a difficult and time-consuming adoption system.  More sensitivity could have been shown to those who were in the process of having a child adopted from Vietnam.  However, that now is in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">My first significant involvement in respect of adoption as a public representative related to Romanian adoptions in the early 1990s following the fall of the Ceausescu regime.  I remember the joy of those who previously had been experiencing great difficulty in adopting because, as Members are aware, the pattern of availability for adoption of children in Ireland had changed over a long period and the number of children now is small in relative terms.  However, bearing in mind the type of representations I have received, the most important issue on which I must focus is the entire area of transitional arrangements as we move from the current position to that envisaged in the Bill.  This Bill, which hopefully will be passed soon, will give force to the Hague Convention.  Article 41 of the convention states "The Convention shall apply in every case where an application pursuant to article 14 has been received after the Convention has entered into force in the receiving State and the State of origin."  In addition, I seek clarification in respect of section 63 which refers to transitional arrangements and which states "If immediately before the establishment day, a foreign adoption described in the Adoption Act 1991 is not yet effected but is still in process as provided for under the Act, the adoption may proceed under this Act as if it were commenced under this Act."</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I intend to read out a sample of the representations I have received on this matter and the Minister of State should respond to them at the conclusion of the Second Stage debate.  I represent people who have grave concerns and who are living with this issue on a day-to-day basis.  Members handle legislation in the Oireachtas and know there are reasons for legislative delays.  Obviously, legislation must be scrutinised and so on but such people wake up to and go to bed with this issue every day.  The first sample is from a couple who live in my constituency and states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_335">We are adoptive parents and members of the International Adoption Association.  We are currently in the process of adopting a second child from Russia.  As you may be aware Irish couples will not be permitted to adopt from Russia when the Adoption Bill is enacted (i.e. until such time as Russia ratifies the Hague Convention).  We wish to bring to your attention the totally inadequate transition arrangements in the Bill.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_336">We are likely to receive a referral in the coming weeks [this letter is dated 11 October] and hope to travel to Russia to meet a child before Christmas.  If everything works out we are likely to be travelling to Russia to effect the adoption and bring home the child in March/April 2010.  If the Bill is enacted in the meantime, i.e. between trips, we will not be permitted to adopt the child and the child will have been denied the opportunity of a family life.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_337">We would he very grateful if you would support ourselves and the International Adoption Association in including some form of transition arrangements whereby couples who have received a referral and who have been approved by the Adoption Board could effect that adoption.  We would be grateful if you would raise this matter with the [Minister and in the debate].</p>
          <p eId="para_338">These reasonable people are excellent parents who are highly committed to bringing a second child into a family in which it would be given an excellent opportunity in life.  They are living this from day to day and they do not know where they stand, particularly if the Bill, as I hope it will, passes into law quickly.  Their fear is their second adoption will be prevented.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">I received a letter from another couple on 2 November under the heading, "New Adoption Bill/Bi-Lateral Agreement between Ireland and Ethiopia", which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_340">We have been approved in Ireland for a second adoption. We already have a little 21/2 year old girl adopted domestically whose birth father is African. We applied to Ethiopia back in April, 2009 and we are currently on the waiting list. We have completed our legal work here and have had our vaccines. We should not be waiting too much longer to be called to Ethiopia to begin our adoption legally in Ethiopia but for the moment waiting on a referral of a baby. There is a new Adoption Bill and will be introduced into the Dail Eireann. The Bill has been already passed by the Seanad and when passed, will finally allow Ireland to ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (the Hague Convention). Such ratification we strongly agree with but have concerns and wish there be clauses in the Adoption Bill to protect us. The Law is expected early 2010.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_341">We would like there to be a Bi-Lateral Agreement set up between Ireland and Ethiopia. We would like there to be two clauses in the Bill. Transition/Interim Clause &amp; Grandfather Clause.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_342">At the moment it is legal for us to adopt a baby in Ethiopia and return to Ireland, however the legal process can take 8 weeks and more in Ethiopia to complete, we may be out in Ethiopia when the law here changes and this leaves our new adopted baby in limbo when we return. We want to be able to complete our adoption. We want to be protected by the Grandfather Clause that in time we would be allowed to adopt another baby in Ethiopia under the grandfather clause.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_343">Mr. Brian Lenihan T.D., then Minister for Children clearly indicated that there would be a grandfather clause" in the Adoption Bill. In it's 2005 Annual Report, the Adoption Board also reported that there would be such a clause. The lack of a grandfather clause is not in the best interests of our existing children. This can be done by re-introduce the grandfather clause, and this can be accomplished by deleting section 81(1)c.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_344">It is unethical to have let us apply to Ethiopia and use another country's resources be strained further in dealing with our application if we were never going to be allowed to legally complete our adoption. It was not in the best interest of our daughter to be given a life vaccine for yellow fever in the belief she was coming to Ethiopia and enjoy the adoption process of her brother or sister if the law here was going to change and stop us from completing our adoption. We have already completed our legal work here in Ireland which we need to send to Ethiopia.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_345">No fee is charged by Ethiopia for adoption either by the State route or by Sr. Luthgarda's children's home the only two children's homes we have our names on the list for. Therefore there is no room for corruption and babies are genuinely in need of loving families and it is in the "best interest of the child". We have all the love in our hearts to love a child from Ethiopia and celebrate Africian culture. We are supported by our extended family and community.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_346">We want to know what information the Minister Mr. Barry Andrews received that made him change his mind from when it was legal for us to apply to Ethiopia for adoption to this turn around to make it no longer legal for us to continue and proceed with our adoption if the Bill is passed by the Dail and written into law in early 2010. We want to know How the "Best Interest of the Child" has changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">The final letter I would like to put on record states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_348">The Adoption Bill, in its current format will mean that Irish people will hot be able to adopt from Countries who have not signed the Hague Convention. The majority of these countries do currently Operate to Hague Standards, which is the current criterion for international adoptions; to be affected here. Barry Andrews has made us believe that this Is essential as it is a requirement of the Hague Convention.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_349">However we found out the Annual Conference of the IAA in the Carlton Hotel Dublin Airport that this is not so. Jennifer Degeling, Secretary to the Permanent Bureau of The Hague Conference on Private and International Law gave a presentation and explained that there was nothing in the Hague Convention which prohibits a Hague Signatory from adopting from a Non Hague Country. . .</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_350">Barry Andrews and his department have taken it upon themselves to insert extra conditions in the Bill which are totally unnecessary. These conditions will prevent people from adopting from countries which have yet to sign to the Hague Convention even though the highest standards of practise are in place in the past few years.  In excess of 2/3 of adoptions to Ireland have been from Non Hague Countries. These countries will be closed to adoptions if the draft bill is not changed to allow adoptions to place from countries which operate to Hague standards.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_351">Barry Andrews said earlier this year that there would be a transitional period to allow people in the process of adopting from Non Hague countries to complete the adoption once the Adoption Bill is brought into law.  He did a U-turn on this fact last week when he said that there would be no transitional period whatsoever. This is unbelievable when you consider the ridiculous amount of time that the process takes in this country.  If transitional periods are not put in place it will not be possible for us to complete the adoption process with our chosen country, this is despite the fact that we were issued a license (Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability) to adopt from this county.  The standards in our new chosen country are exemplary and meet Hague Standards, but this country is not a Hague Signatory.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_352">In his speech on Saturday 10th October in the Carlton Hotel he [the Minister of State] said that "Adoption has always been a fluid process" and that "Countries have always opened and closed". In short I felt he was telling us "Countries open, countries close . . . get over it". I found this utterly reprehensible that "The Minister for Children", would have such little regard for children. The countries he plans on closing are extremely poor and are more focused on feeding their people than signing the Hague Convention; he plans on consigning these children to a childhood in institutional care despite the fact that adoptions from these countries are as safe as any other country.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_353">The credo of the Adoption Board (and rightfully so) is that "Adoption is a service for children", I believe in this credo 100%. How will the Adoption Bill help children in institutions in poor countries whom have yet to sign the Hague Convention, but do operate to Hague standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">In his opening contribution the Minister of State said he had asked the Adoption Board to examine the adoption codes of Brazil, the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand with a view to commencing discussions to put in place administrative arrangements that would facilitate inter-country adoptions with Ireland, which is welcome.  Could he not have done the same in regard to Russia, Ethiopia and Kazakhstan?</p>
          <p eId="para_355">To bring the matter up to date, what role will Ireland play with regard to the children orphaned in Haiti?  Can the Minister and the Adoption Board take urgent action so those parents who want to adopt will have the option of taking children out of this terrible disaster area which has just been discussed in the House in another context?</p>
          <p eId="para_356">I look forward to the Minister of State's response at the conclusion of Second Stage.  Does he believe the issues raised by my constituents and which I have presented to him can be accommodated in present legislation?  If the legislation cannot accommodate them what measures will he put in place and what amendments or changes will he make to the legislation to accommodate the very fair case that people have made with regard to completing adoptions in train and to continue adopting from countries from where they already adopted under the process as it stands?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_255">
          <from>Deputy Damien English</from>
          <p eId="para_357">It is good to see the Minister of State present for the debate because it is a very emotive issue and one which probably touches everybody but mostly the parents and children involved in the process.  It is obvious that everybody speaking on the Bill has been contacted by and has engaged with people involved.  The process may have failed them or they may have been very successful but we have all dealt with such people over the past year.  This has become a very serious issue and one which has time implications, be it for the child to be adopted or for the many children who remain unadopted in some countries, whatever future lies ahead for them or for the families engaged in the process who want to do the right thing for all concerned and to have an opportunity to raise a child in a good solid home.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">I welcome the Bill but I must question why it has taken us 14 years to get to this point.  I accept that like myself the Minister of State was not a politician 14 years ago; perhaps he thought about it then.  I did not read his script so I do not know whether he gave an explanation.  I wonder why it is often years later that these matters are rushed through when they could have just been dealt with years ago and put to bed.  So much time goes to waste here on unnecessary debate, time wasting, days lost and no sittings on Mondays or Friday.  Issues such as this could be passed through the House and be put to bed once and for all.  If we took action years ago, we might not have had the situation that we had for the past 12 months whereby many couples have awaited information and decisions because we would have had clarity and information.  I do not understand a system that leaves a matter such as this to one side for years.  Is it because it was not being pushed by anybody or a group did not exist?  It is a shame that it is causing grief to many people in the year it is due to be finalised.  However, I will not dwell on this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">The Bill modifies the Hague Convention and that is great and will benefit everybody.  It is the proper way to go and nobody here is speaking against it.  I will speak about other issues that could be dealt with in the Bill but they have not been included.  What parents have to go through in the adoption process is unreal and it is not right.  For the majority of parents I met the process has taken four or five years.  That is not right or fair, particularly if a child has been chosen and might be one and a half or two years old by the time the adoption process is completed.  That child misses out on vital time to be given a good opportunity in life and might suffer in the long run because of it.  The Government speaks about early childhood intervention but because of red tape and slow systems, and I accept this is the case not only in this country, some children get left for too long and suffer in the long run.  This is a pity and will affect them growing up in Ireland and interacting with other children in school and could have a lasting impact for the rest of their lives.  We have a duty to try to fix this and do something about it fast; not merely sign the convention years later but move to improve the services.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">I do not see any logic for the process taking four or five years.  I accept many get through it in three years but the majority of cases that I came across, and perhaps they contact us because it takes so long, are taking a long time.  A couple can have a child in nine months without any training, parenting or advice and that is natural.  It is only right that one must go through much scrutiny, courses, advice and interviews for adoption.  However, it should not take four years and one's address should not matter.  The service should be the same in Cork, Galway, Meath or Dublin.  We need to establish targets on how long it will take and the Government and country should guarantee that it will take 18 months, two years or whatever time is agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">It is time measures were put in place so people know with what they are dealing.  Many of those going down the road of adoption have tried other measures to have a child and have been unlucky for whatever reason.  Many years will have already passed before they start the adoption process.  All of sudden one is 32, 34, 38, 40 or 42; time flies very quickly and everyone loses if that time passes.  We have to fix this.  I hope in his concluding speech, or on another day, the Minister of State sets out a plan to improve these services because that is his job.  He needs to push the Government to do so.  The Minister of State has children and he knows the benefits of this.  However, he needs to use his office to make this work and improve the situation for everybody.  The child and the adopting family or single person and the community can only gain from this and it must be right.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">We speak about Dáil reform and the delay in this Bill coming before the House is an example of where it is needed.  Many parents have been left in limbo for the past year awaiting news.  They expected good news in May, August, September and October and they were hopeful.  However, in recent weeks they received bad news and were told the process of adopting from Vietnam was over.  That seems very harsh and unfair.  I question the motives and declarations for this.  I accept a report highlighted major concerns.  The report also mentioned the Government's failure to sign off on the Hague Convention so it is not totally exonerated.  I wonder whether there is more to this; is there something that people cannot be told?  It dragged on and on with interim agreements being discussed and not being discussed.  In some cases the Government intended to reach agreement with the Vietnamese authorities but time ran out.  If this is the case the Government should admit it and people should be told.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">People are very hurt and let down and they have asked us what will happen to them.  They were well into the process and some of them thought they had received a guarantee from the Minister of State last May.  At least 20 couples thought they would get through the process.  Where does this stand now?  Is there any hope that something can be done to facilitate these adoptions?  Is it too late?  After we enact the Bill and ratify the Hague Convention will we stop dealing with the countries that have not ratified it?  From what I have read in statements that is the case.  However, other countries such as France, Spain, Italy and Canada have ratified the convention and still deal with Vietnam and other countries which have not ratified it.  Where do we stand?  If we will deal only with countries which have signed up to the convention what is the reason?  Is it because it will save us time and resources into checking the procedures of those countries and that it will be easier to deal with the countries that have passed through the system and have been given the blessing because they signed up to the convention?  Will we take the easy way out?</p>
          <p eId="para_364">Many children in countries not signed up to the convention need help and want to be adopted and come to Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">Many prospective parents have gone through the process, gone through all the hoops and the red tape, and knocked on all the doors to get certificates, information, bank statements and so on, yet the door was then shut in their faces.  There is a duty to help those people.  If we cannot help them in the country they originally chose, then we have to put them through the system quickly for another country.  They should not be put to the back of the queue, because that is not fair and they do not deserve it.  I ask that the Minister of State address this issue in his closing speech.  Things have changed, so there is a duty to clarify the situation for those prospective parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">I note that many of the children's rights organisations have commended the Bill, and there is nobody out there who claims it is a bad thing.  However, there are concerns about what is missing from the Bill.  It does not deal with provisions for post-adoption services.  Deputy Shatter and other colleagues in the Labour Party have brought up this issue, as well as groups such as Barnardos, the Children's Rights Alliance and so on.  They have asked this question.  It is a golden opportunity to have a full discussion about the services beforehand and especially afterwards.  The services provided afterwards affect the child that has been adopted.  There needs to be follow-on procedures, and every service should be put in place and not left to chance so that we have the right address and the child receives the correct services after adoption.  It is a very delicate situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">This Bill does not refer to the cost of all this, but adoption can be a very costly procedure.  I know couples who remortgaged houses to get the money to go through this process.  I am not saying that is the Government's fault, but it is very costly for some people.  If people are out of pocket because they were hoping to adopt from Vietnam and that door is now closed, we have to find some way to help them continue the process if they cannot afford to do so.  The Minister of State should examine this.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">The Bill does not clearly deal with the transition measures.  What will happen in the short term?  The Minister of State briefly touched on it, but did not clarify matters.  There is now a grey area here, following recent announcements from his Department.  The Bill fails to address the children who are not eligible for adoption in Ireland, and there are more than 2,000 children who have been in foster care for a significant number of years.  I have dealt with only one person affected by this, but I know there are many more out there.  This Bill does not seem to talk about the issue.  Other countries have brought in new policies to deal with children who have been abused, neglected and so on.  What does our Constitution say about that?  Is there a plan for a referendum to make the change to a more modern Ireland?  This Bill might have provided a chance to have this debate and to put those things in motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Many constituents have come to me, both couples and single people.  A young lady living in Athboy, County Meath, was concerned because the Bill fails to provide for sole applicants to adopt, and merely perpetrates the existing extraordinary circumstances required, whereby sole applicants are permitted only as an exception to proceed for assessment.  I would like clarity on this issue.  I accept there are groups out there who say we should not have sole parent adoption.  What is the Minister of State's view?  Why were things not made easier for this type of applicant?  Deputy McHugh also raised this issue.  What formed the Minister of State's decision-making process?</p>
          <p eId="para_370">The other big issue is the grandfather clause.  The Hague convention is about what is best for the child, and surely a grandfather clause makes sense.  If a parent is lucky enough to adopt a child from Ethiopia, Bulgaria, Romania or wherever, it makes sense that if everything went well and they would like to adopt again, that the parents would go back to the same country.  It would be for the benefit of the child, and it might be the child's relative or a community member.  That should be facilitated, but it is not clarified in the Bill.  If we want to do what is right for the child, there is a duty on us to fix this on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">One of the groups involved in this area suggested that parents who adopt a child from a foreign country should be made aware if a second child in the foreign family becomes available.  There does not seem to be any formal procedure at the moment for that.  I am not an expert in this area, and I do not know what kind of contact would continue when somebody is adopted from a family.  However, surely it would make sense to put in place a system whereby a family is notified if a sibling of the adopted child becomes available for adoption.  These children could be given a chance to get to know each other under the one roof.  It cannot be too difficult to arrange this.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The timing of this is wrong, as is the amount of work people have to do.  There are various reasons for that, one of which is a lack of social workers.  What is the plan to fix that?  If we are short of them, then what do we do to get more?  I do not think it is okay to just leave this problem alone.  What is wrong with the system when people drop out of it?  Do we talk to them afterwards?  Do we follow up the case and see what went wrong?  Do we know how long it takes in other countries?  There is anecdotal evidence that it does not take nearly as long as here.  Has that been checked out?  Have Department officials and the Minister of State found out what happens in the UK, France and the US and decided that we will try to achieve what they have done?  If it turns out that it takes four years in those countries as well, perhaps there is a reason for it and Ireland is doing fine.  However, the Minister of State and his officials should provide us with that information.  There is something wrong and it needs to be fixed.  I accept it probably affects only a few thousand people every year, but that is no reason not to put things right.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">If a couple have been through one adoption, I do not understand why it takes so long to go through a second one.  In some cases it takes as long as the first adoption, and that should not be the case.  The couple have obviously passed the various tests and if their child is doing well, how much more can there be to do?  I am not trying to simplify things, but is there a reason to go through the whole process again?  A colleague from the Labour Party mentioned that couples have to go through another course in some places, but not in others.  Standards do not seem to be followed everywhere else.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Is there any effort made to encourage parents who adopt abroad to look at home first?  There is very little adoption in Ireland, and very few children under the current rules in the Constitution would be put up for adoption.  We need to examine that, because many children in Ireland could benefit from being in more stable homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Adoption should be a positive experience, but it often turns into a cruel, harsh and slow process.  That is a shame and we have to fix it.  Many children in my own community in Navan have been adopted from all over the world.  They have been given a great opportunity and they are doing very well.  The more of that we can have, the better.  Many couples want to be parents and are unlucky enough not to be able to have children for whatever reason.  They need the State to step in, to help them and to make sure it happens.  We can learn from other countries in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">There are children taken into care by the HSE and taken away from their parents.  There is always a reason for it, but the process does not always seem 100% clear.  I have been involved in a couple of cases, and it is a grey area where information is always difficult to get.  The parents involved, some of whom are not highly educated, are not always treated fairly by the system.  When they do something wrong or do not behave as good parents there is often a reason.  In these circumstances, one has a sense that official bodies close down, decide the parent or parents have failed and treat them badly as a result.  Sometimes parents need help and guidance and although it is provided in some cases, in others the appropriate assistance, advice and legal representation in cases before the courts are not provided.  We have a duty to recognise these factors and offer assistance as opposed to casting guilty people aside and ignoring their concerns and feelings.  The State must do all in its power to try to reunite parents with children.</p>

Bille an-tábhachtach é an Bille seo a leagann córas uchtála amach don tír seo agus córas chun uchtáil idirnáisiúnta a dhéanamh freisin.  Is oth liom a rá nach bhfuil mórán uchtála ar fáil sa tír seo, ach ar an dtaobh eile den scéal is dócha go bhfuil níos mó páistá choimeád ag tuismitheoirí nádúrtha.

Is é an taobh den scéal atá sa nuacht faoi láthair, an taobh ar a bhfuil an plé is mó faoi láthair ag muintir na tíre seo, an uchtáil idirnáisiúnta, go háirithe uchtáil as tíortha ar nós an Rúis, Vietnam agus an Aetóip.

          <p eId="para_378">I am pleased to speak on the Bill and glad the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, is present.  The Minister of State has faced a certain amount of criticism arising from this Bill, most of which has been political in nature and has been levelled by members of other political parties.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for children, he has an important job to do and his primary consideration must be the best interests of the children.  While many prospective adoptive parents are heartbroken because they are waiting to adopt a child, the Minister of State has a responsibility to make difficult decisions to ensure the best interests of the child come first.  He must also consider the best interests of children who have been legally adopted from foreign countries.  This is a sensitive issue and may be the reason he has been slow to comment and engage in debate on the issue.  It may also explain the reason he is reluctant to describe exactly what happens in some countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">I have met many couples in my constituency office who have been waiting for a long time and have endured all sorts of trials and tribulations as they seek to adopt a child.  They have tried to have children because adoption is not the first choice for couples.  That only a small number of children are available for adoption in Ireland may not be a positive development for adoptive parents, but it is positive for society in general as it indicates that parents are willing to keep their children.  Adoption in previous decades was not always done for the best reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">Adoption is a sensitive issue.  As a parent who has been privileged and fortunate to have two children, both of whom were born since I was elected to the House, I find it difficult to sit in front of heartbroken couples who want to adopt a child.  These couples may believe Ministers do not have a heart but that is not the case with the Minister of State.  He does not lack a heart, particularly with regard to children and the problems experienced by parents.  While adoption is one of the major problems experienced by couples, they often have many other problems.  The Minister of State is aware of these and is well able to deal with them in a sensitive manner.  I pay tribute to him.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">As I stated, adoption is an incredibly sensitive issue for families, couples, children in Vietnam and their parents, as well as children who have been adopted and are loved by their families in Ireland.  In this context, some of the political criticism of the Minister of the State has been over the top.  I do not propose to discuss it in detail as I am aware that couples who wish to adopt are paying close attention to this debate and would not appreciate Members on this side engaging in the type of political point scoring exercise at least one Deputy from the other side has engaged in.  This approach is not helpful to the debate and does not get us anywhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">The Minister of State had no option but to accept the findings of the ISS report.  He had to consider the report carefully given the sensitivities involved in protecting the best interests of the child and of prospective adoptive parents.  For this reason, he had no option but to make the decision he did.  While he will not have relished breaking the news, it is the role of Ministers to make necessary decisions.  I have not received correspondence from prospective parents in light of his decision, although I understand the reason many of them will be highly disappointed.  I feel awful on that basis but I am sure they understand the Minister of State's position, even if they do not like it.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The Minister of State has made a number of provisions and the Adoption Board has agreed to a number of arrangements for people who had hoped to adopt from Vietnam.  This is a positive development which makes options outside Vietnam available to prospective adoptive parents, some of whom had been considering other options in any case.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">The Government has been asked the reason it decided to act in accordance with the Hague Convention.  It would be criticised if it chose not to do so given that the convention is the international standard in these matters.  As such, the Minister of State is duty bound to apply it.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">Prospective adoptive parents will have opportunities to adopt children from other countries when the legislation is enacted.  The Minister of State intends, through some of the procedural arrangements made in the Bill, to ensure the adoption process becomes less lengthy.  At present, adoption takes too long and these delays are getting parents down.  Under the guidance of the Adoption Board and Minister of State, the process will become shorter.  I hope parents and children will be brought together because the most basic instinct of humanity is to have children.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">I thank the Minister of State and wish the Bill good speed.  I hope it will quickly come before the Select Committee on Health and Children for Committee Stage consideration before returning to the House for Report Stage.  It should be enacted as quickly as possible and in that context I am pleased to note the Minister of State is due to respond to the Second Stage debate when I conclude. I am glad that the decision of the Minister of State, although difficult, provides certainty.  In recent months I encouraged the Minister of State to provide certainty when it was available.  He has done so and that is appreciated by potential parents even though the dream, love and generosity has been postponed.  I hope this will be for a shorter period than they have gone through up to now.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
          <p eId="para_387">I thank Deputies for their many thoughtful contributions today and on previous occasions on Second Stage.  Senators made a valuable contribution while the Bill was in that House.  Every Deputy said that this is an area of extreme sensitivity.  In 18 months in this office, I know it is beyond question the most sensitive area and the most difficult to manage because of the sensitivities and the complexity of the issue.  One learns immediately about the sensitivities of the issue but the complexity takes longer.  I refer to the complexity of the domestic situation, the relationship between the Adoption Board, the Government and the HSE, international legal relations between sending countries and receiving countries, overarching conventions such as the Hague Convention and how all of these issues interplay and influence each other.  I also refer to domestic law with regard to domestic legislation since 1952 and how it interacts with the Constitution.  One must come to terms with these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">I began with and still hold the view that adoption is an important form of alternative care and something the Government wishes to promote within the safeguards provided by international conventions and the Constitution.  We are trying to reflect in our domestic law the highest standards that will serve the best interests of children and that these be child-centred in all aspects.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">I will address some comments arising from the issues raised by Deputies and make some general remarks.  It is true that there are inherent risks in intercountry adoption and these cannot be ignored.  In spite of the existence of a bilateral agreement with Vietnam, we must be utterly vigilant about information that comes to our attention, whatever the source.  This is particularly true when the source of information is child protection experts, with the agreement and co-operation of the Government of Vietnam.  We are required to take this extremely seriously.  As Deputy Thomas Byrne said, the ISS report left me with no option but to suspend negotiations on a new bilateral agreement.  Having met many parents in my constituency clinics and having met representative groups whenever a meeting was sought, I am aware of the disappointment this caused.  There is a philosophical attitude and people understand why the decision had to be made.  All along, they wanted certainty but the price of hope was a lack of certainty while we continue to pursue it.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">I was quite confident in June and July when I visited Hanoi, Vietnam that those negotiations would come to fruition and that we would be provided with a new bilateral agreement.  In August the ISS report and the Molisa report came to the attention of the Government.  That was finalised towards the end of November.  I reject the view that the Government was unduly tardy in responding to that and making the announcement on 13 January.  Countries close from time to time.  Vietnam has closed twice, Romania closed, Guatemala, Belarus and other countries have closed from time to time.  Ethiopia and Russia closed in recent times.  It is not to say to people that it is tough luck or that we are insensitive but we must try to make those embarking on the road to adoption aware that this happens.  It is not meant to be discourteous to them and if it came across in that way it certainly was not intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">Many Deputies referred to the transitional arrangements.  In so far as possible, I intend to provide for transitional arrangements.  I intend to make a recommendation to the Government shortly and I will try to accommodate as many applicants for adoption as possible.  It is not easy to identify the point in the adoption process that one must have reached at the time of the enactment of the legislation to proceed to finality.  Is it the point where someone has applied for a declaration of eligibility and suitability, the point where one has received a declaration, the point where one has received a referral or a match in a sending country or where one has met the child or formed a bond with the child?  Various stages must be considered.  The further along the route one goes, the fewer people have reached this point and the less humane one is about the issue.  The process of seeking a declaration is so long that it allows a certain latitude to be as human as possible.  I will make a recommendation to the Government shortly and I will take on board the issues raised by the Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">I accept the delay in processing applications for declarations is too long.  The Bill allows for accredited bodies to carry out the work of determining the eligibility and suitability of an applicant.  By the HSE no longer having a monopoly on this area, I hope we can foreshorten the application process considerably and bring it closer into line with international norms.  We have a robust system and our social workers are excellent in explaining to parents the consequences of international adoption.  The waiting between various meetings and various reports that must be furnished upsets and frustrates people.  It is unnecessary.  We have tried to eliminate that by the provisions contained in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Several Deputies raised the delay in ratification of the Bill.  We are the last country in Europe to ratify this Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Barry Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_395">Yes, to ratify the convention.  When we signed the convention all those years ago, a process began to transpose it into Irish law.  However, a decision was later taken to consolidate all adoption legislation and that lengthened the process.  The consultation process had the effect of lengthening the period of time it took to ratify and transpose the convention into legislation.  Deputy Thomas Byrne referred to the sensitivity we must all exercise in the comments we make about children already adopted here, of whom there are many.  They are adopted into loving homes and are thriving.  No one doubts that a child in an orphanage who is perfectly adoptable really benefits from adoption into this country.  We must be sensitive in discussing issues about Vietnam and the inherent risks in intercountry adoption referred to at the beginning.  When we talk about those we must remember there are children already here who are bullied in school over these issues because we are not as sensitive as we could be.  From time to time that prevents me explaining to Deputies why we are slow, why we are not putting information in the public domain or communicating certain issues.  That is partly the reason for it and the sensitivity is appreciated by parents and Deputies who have a good grasp of the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">Many Deputies spoke about this country's constitutional bar on the adoption of children of marriage.  It would be possible for such children to be the subject of domestic adoptions if they were from other countries.  Domestic adoptions usually arise when the mother of a child who was born outside marriage subsequently marries and the child is adopted by his or her stepfather.  There are approximately 200 such adoptions in Ireland every year.  The Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children is examining a wording that would allow for more domestic adoptions in Ireland.  If the people agree to include that wording in the Constitution, it is hoped that it will allow more domestic adoptions to take place.  It might even relieve some of the difficulties we have here.  In the UK, there are more domestic adoptions but fewer inter-country adoptions.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Recent events in Haiti, which were mentioned, underline some of the problems with international adoption.  We all have a strong urge to try to help children who are in Haitian orphanages.  I have had private discussions with Ministers and other individuals about what we can do.  Small children who lost their parents in the earthquake may have aunts and uncles or grandparents who survived.  International agencies will make every effort to try to reunite such children with their families.  Haitian parents who lost their children may be happy to adopt domestically.  I would like us to help by supporting the reconstruction of orphanages and by facilitating the provision of respite accommodation to children and parents, as we did after the accident at Chernobyl.  It may be possible for us to agree fostering arrangements.  The difficulty with adoption is that a Haitian parent might come to Ireland in three or four years time to look for his or her child.  They might find that a bond has already been developed between the child and the adoptive parent.  It is clear that the State would be liable if it had not carried out the correct adoption procedures with due diligence.  This underlines some of the difficulties that exist in this area.  Adoption should not necessarily always be the first option for people who have a strong urge to protect and care for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Article 9 of the Hague Convention, which is set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill, indicates that it is the duty of the central authority to promote counselling and other post-adoption services.  The Law Reform Commission has recommended that the Child Care Act 1991 be amended to ensure that specified post-adoption services are provided by the HSE.  The post-adoption services provided by Barnardos are funded by the HSE.  In the submission it made to the Joint Committee on Health and Children, Barnardos said it had carried out 108 individual sessions of this nature.  It is possible that post-adoption services will come under more pressure as more adoptions involve older children.  There will be a greater need for such services in the future.  People need to understand that services are already being provided and funded by the State and are provided for in the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Reference was made to the right to access information that helps one to trace people involved in adoptions.  The Adoption Board has been operating a national adoption contact preference register for the last few years.  The issue of tracing can cause serious, complex and sensitive issues to arise.  When I read the board's 2008 annual report, I learned that over 6,500 applications to be entered into the contact preference register were made in the first few years of its existence.  Approximately 350 matches were made in 2008.  While there is an awful lot of interest in the register, matching can have limited success.  Clearly, there needs to be a balance between the right to privacy of a person who gives up a child for adoption and the right of a child to know who his or her parents are.  It is hard to reflect those balancing rights in law.  Deputies should be aware that the Adoption Board can apply to the High Court when certain issues arise, for example, if a child has a medical condition and wishes to obtain more genetic information about his or her natural parents.  That issue is covered to that extent.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Many Deputies discussed whether step-parents should have to go through the adoption process.  That question has also been raised by Barnardos and the Adoption Board.  The question of whether natural parents should have to adopt their own children is of particular interest in this context.  I have a great deal of sympathy with the arguments that have been made.  I accept that the guardianship legislation may need to be amended to cater for step-parents and natural parents.  I suggest that the special guardianship provisions would be particularly appropriate to step-parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">I thank Deputies for their contributions and look forward to the Committee Stage debate.  I accept that many issues will arise when we consider specific aspects of matters that have been raised in general terms on Second Stage.  The Bill before the House will finally give Ireland an opportunity to comply with the Hague Convention.  As I said in my opening remarks, we will then be in a position to deal with other countries that comply with the convention, some of which I mentioned.  The new regime of adoption in Ireland that is being opened will provide greater certainty for parents and will achieve a child-centred adoption process in Ireland.  Everybody wants such a system, which follows best practice and is ultimately in the best interests of children.</p>

          <p eId="para_408">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this ground breaking legislation, which shows that Fianna Fáil delivers on its promises when it is in government.  My party's commitment to civil partnership was set out in its pre-election manifesto and affirmed in the 2007 programme for Government.  This Bill has far-reaching consequences for same-sex couples.  For the first time in Irish law, gay and lesbian relationships will be given official recognition.  This new legal status is accompanied by a range of rights and responsibilities, including pension rights, succession rights, maintenance obligations and protections in the event of domestic violence.  It would be unacceptable in a modern society to continue to ignore same-sex relationships.  The over-riding aim of the Bill before the House is to bring about positive changes to same-sex relationships, on profound and practical levels.  Some of the provisions in the Bill that have received less publicity are also important.  The Bill will introduce financial protections for cohabiting couples in same-sex and opposite-sex relationships.  It will make a redress scheme available to unmarried opposite-sex couples and unregistered same-sex couples, so that financially dependent people can enjoy some protection at the end of a long-term cohabiting relationship.  The cohabitants' scheme will put in place a legal safety net for people in long-term relationships who may otherwise be financially vulnerable at the end of a relationship, whether through break-up or bereavement.  The Bill gives legal recognition to cohabiting agreements, thereby enabling cohabitants to regulate their joint financial and property affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">It provides legal certainty on the status of cohabitation agreements made by couples who wish to regulate their financial and property affairs but do not wish to marry or enter into a civil partnership and do not want to be included in the redress scheme.  These provisions are particularly important in light of the recent surge in cohabiting couples, which have become the fastest growing form of family unit in the State.  Currently, cohabiting couples lack a number of legal protections even where they have been together for years.  Contrary to common belief, common law or <i>de facto</i> marriage has no legal standing in Irish law and does not offer legal protection to either partner in the event of a break up of a relationship or the death of a partner.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The civil partnership provisions raise complex legal issues.  The Bill has been carefully framed to balance any conflict between the Constitution's special protection for marriage and the rights enshrined in Article 41.  Certain material distinctions between civil partnership and marriage therefore remain.  For example, there is no provision for the adoption of children by civil partners or for religious ceremonies as the basis for registration of a civil partnership.  Were the provisions of the Constitution not addressed, the Bill would have been vulnerable to legal challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">The Bill will improve the rights of same sex couples without weakening anyone else's.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform put it best when he stated: "This Bill takes nothing from anyone but what it gives is profound and is positive."  Calls have been made to include a clause in the legislation to provide for freedom of religious conscience.  This would be a broad provision which would give an absolute right to discriminate against people who are registered as civil partners.  Providing such an exemption could lead to serious unintended consequences and the withholding of services.  A bank could refuse to allow a couple to operate a joint account, a restaurant could refuse to take a booking for two men or a person may be unable to visit his partner in a hospital run by a religious order.  As such outcomes would be contrary to public policy, an exemption based on freedom of conscience could not be contemplated.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Fianna Fáil is the republican party and it is our aim to build a republic founded on the ideals of equality and dignity of every member of the human family.  My party stands for an open and inclusive society.  Over the past two decades, as Irish society has become more open, Fianna Fáil has been to the forefront of reforming legal discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  In 1989, a Fianna Fáil Government steered through the Oireachtas the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, which makes it an offence to distribute material or use words and behaviour that is threatening or abusive or likely to foment hatred against persons on certain specified grounds, including sexual orientation.  This principle was subsequently extended into the area of broadcasting.  Fianna Fáil brought forward the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, which finally brought an end to the unfair criminalisation of homosexual practices.  The Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2004 made it an offence to discriminate against people in employment or in the provision of goods and services on a range of grounds, including sexual orientation.  Through these legislative means the State has clearly indicated that individuals are entitled to receive fair and equal treatment, whether they are gay, lesbian or heterosexual.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">As the law stands, same sex couples have no way of formalising their relationships in the eyes of the State or society.  They obtain no benefits from our tax, welfare and inheritance regimes and cannot assume legally binding obligations to one another.  These significant lacunae will be addressed by the Bill before us.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ChrisAndrews" eId="spk_266">
          <from>Deputy Chris Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_414">I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I am proud to be a member of a party which has advocated legal reform in this area.  Credit is due to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  The Bill will have no negative impact because it builds on previous equality legislation introduced by Fianna Fáil.  It deals with the issue of freedom of conscience and our legislation is sufficiently robust to address any issues that arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">I have met the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network to discuss the Bill.  It is clear that both organisations recognise it as progressive legislation.  The Government's efforts to bring the Bill before the House demonstrate that we remain active on social issues even while we continue to focus on our economic and financial problems.  The media think that everything starts and ends with finance but a significant body of legislation on other matters is being progressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">Irish society and the traditional family unit have changed dramatically over the past 20 years.  A one size fits all approach can no longer be taken because provision must be made to protect people in loving same sex relationships and couples who choose to cohabit rather than marry.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">According to the excellent brief prepared by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, cohabiting couples are the fastest growing form of family unit.  The 2006 census revealed that cohabiting couples account for 12% of all family units, compared to 8% in 2002.  The number of cohabiting same sex couples is also on the rise, having grown from 1,300 couples in 2002 to more than 2,000 in 2006.  The law as it stands does not give any legal protection to cohabiting couples, even where they have lived together for many years.  Many couples may not realise their vulnerability until they experience break up or the death of a partner.  This Bill seeks to address these concerns.  Given past difficulties in Irish society, it is difficult to understand why anybody could object to this positive proposal, the overarching objective of which is to encourage and support loving relationships.  It is irrelevant whether those relationships are same sex or otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">The Bill will rectify the unacceptable situation where a broad section of society was thus far unprotected legally.  For same sex couples it establishes a new status of relationship which is legally recognised by the State.  It provides for a scheme of registration of civil partnerships for same sex couples, together with a range of rights and duties following registration to include shared home protection and succession and pension rights.  It will also allow cohabitees, whether opposite or same sex, to regulate their own financial matters and will provide for a limited redress scheme where a cohabitee is left economically dependent.  Under the Bill, legislation relating to mental health, immigration and domestic violence, for example, will be amended to ensure the same provision for same sex partners as for spouses in opposite sex marriages.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Although the Bill is extremely progressive, I acknowledge that it does not offer an equivalent to marriage for same sex couples and, for this reason, it will not satisfy everybody.  However, it would be churlish not to acknowledge that it is a major step forward which, for the first time, offers recognition and protection to those in same sex relationships.  That said, the legislation should include greater reference to children of civil partners.  I accept that there are constitutional barriers, as referred to by other speakers, which must be addressed.  I am certain, as sure as night follows day, that legislation will be introduced in due course which offers children of same sex couples the same status and protection as those of opposite sex relationships.  In the meantime I am concerned that children of same sex couples are left somewhat isolated and vulnerable as a consequence of this omission in this legislation.  However, it is not appropriate to deal with these issues in this Bill.  These concerns will inevitably be addressed in future legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">Since the Bill was flagged some time ago, I have met several couples in loving same sex relationships and found that they were, broadly speaking, pleased with the proposals.  Many gay people had been of the view that this type of legislation would never be introduced.  I spoke recently to a friend raising a child with her same sex partner and she was extremely sceptical that these measures would become law.  I will be pleased to send her the transcript of today's debate.  Many gay and lesbian people were not confident this day would ever come.  In this context it is important to acknowledge the commitment of the Government not only to economic issues but to social policies.  I warmly welcome the Bill, which represents an enormous step forward for our society.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_267">
          <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
          <p eId="para_421">Like other Deputies, I welcome the publication of this Bill and the opportunity for a serious and considered debate on its provisions.  Although I broadly support its intentions, I propose to address some of the issues that have given rise to public debate and controversy outside the House and to outline my concerns with the Bill as drafted.  There is a myriad of legal anomalies derived by the Bill that may result in its provisions not impacting as beneficially as may be intended by the Government and the Deputies speaking in favour of it.  The Bill highlights in different ways the oddity of many of the family law provisions that currently apply to married couples and the need for reform.  It is ironic that when enacted this Bill will clarify areas of law with regard to gay couples that are not addressed by legislation in respect of heterosexual couples.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">I will begin by addressing the main issue that resulted in demonstrations outside this House following the publication of the Bill before Christmas.  There is broad support from the gay community for the legislation, but there are some who are disappointed that it refers to civil registration and civil partnership as opposed to marriage.  I accept that the Minister had to address the issue in the way he has because of Article 41 of the Constitution which protects the family based on marriage.  If, instead of using the formula "civil partnership", the Bill referred to marriage <i>simpliciter</i>, there would have been a serious risk of a constitutional challenge to the legislation and therefore a substantial delay in its enactment.  Alternatively, that constitutional challenge might have come following the enactment of the Bill and its signature by the President, or the latter may have decided to refer it to the Supreme Court.  We might have had litigation going through the High Court and Supreme Court and one or two years would elapse before clarity could be applied to the legal situation.  The Minister therefore had no choice other than to use the formula in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Those in the gay community who are concerned that their relationship is not referred to as marriage should note that in practical terms, the provisions that apply to the celebration of a civil marriage ceremony between a heterosexual couple are exactly the same provisions which apply to the celebration of a civil partnership ceremony between a gay couple.  In other words, the relationship is marriage in everything but name.  The Bill plays with semantics in the hope it is constitutionally on the right side of Article 41.  It is not beyond possibility that when the legislation is enacted, somebody may challenge its constitutionality.  If so, I hope that challenge is unsuccessful.  I hope it does not arise because it will create difficulties of a temporary nature for people.  I welcome the fact that a gay couple in a permanent, intimate relationship can have afforded to them under the legislation recognition of that relationship such as that which now extends to many gay couples in other countries across the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">There are, however, anomalies in the legislation that bear some reference.  For example, section 105 is headed "Nullity of Civil Partnership".  As well as dealing with certain aspects of nullity that apply to married couples that form part of existing statute law, section 105 sets out all the grounds on which a civil partnership can be annulled.  It was in or about 1975 that the first report was published detailing the reason that we need legislation on nullity for heterosexual couples.  The irony is that large parts of the nullity civil law applied by the High Court and Circuit Court to heterosexual couples is law as prescribed by the matrimonial courts of the Church of Ireland and inherited by the civil courts as part of Church of Ireland canon law all the way back to 1870.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">Since the foundation of the State, this Parliament has never enacted a single statute setting out clearly to the courts the grounds on which a marriage between heterosexual couples can be annulled.  Over the years those grounds have changed and varied as the Judiciary has sought in the pre-divorce era to develop them to facilitate couples to extricate themselves from relationships that were clearly a disaster from day one until more recently when the Supreme Court was perhaps trying to restrain the enthusiasm of judges in lower courts from granting annulments in the civil area.  They are less sought now that divorce is available.  I say to the Minister that I welcome the fact there is clarity in the Bill as to the circumstances in which a civil partnership may be declared a nullity.  It is about time the Government recognised that there should be similar clarity for the vast majority of the heterosexual community who enter into civil marriages.  It is extraordinary.  We must be the only country in Europe which has no legislation that details clearly all of the circumstances in which a civil, heterosexual marriage can be annulled.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">A particular anomaly relates to something Deputy Chris Andrews quite correctly referred to.  This applies to both gay couples and to cohabitees.  The Bill is entirely blind and in denial when it comes to children.  There are cohabitees, both gay and heterosexual, in long-term relationships who have children, and who live in such relationships, have done for decades and will continue to do so.  If they are cohabitees, following the enactment of the Bill they may qualify for various protections in the law that they can utilise.  In the context of gay couples, the legislation prescribes all sorts of legal protections, extends various important statutory provisions to them and sets out the legal remedies available when the relationship breaks up.  With regard to cohabitees, equally, it sets out the legal arrangements that apply and the orders the courts can make when the relationship breaks up.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">There is nothing about children.  The Bill does not recognise that when a relationship of cohabitees breaks up, provision may have to be made for children just as there is following the break up of a marriage.  The Bill is apparently in denial that there are gay couples who have children.  One may have a gay couple who has gone through a civil partnership registration and within the relationship there might be a child from a previous relationship that they both parent for many years.  An issue arises about whether the non-biological parent has any obligations to that child in the same way as in a marriage a husband may be regarded as having obligations to a child fathered by someone else prior to the marriage taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">The Bill, in the same way as the Government and its various predecessors, is in denial about the availability of methods of assisted reproduction.  We have no legislation in this House on this area.  We had a major Supreme Court judgment on the matter prior to Christmas involving a heterosexual couple, but we also had a Supreme Court judgment only in December on a dispute between a gay father whose sperm was used to facilitate a party to a lesbian relationship to have a child.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">I cannot understand the proposed legislation.  The Government has had the wisdom to bring the legislation before the House.  We have had a myriad of family law legislation that recognises that when marriages break up and when the courts are addressing the consequences of the break up, they must not only provide protection for spouses, particularly dependent spouses, but also for dependent children.  Why does the legislation ignore the position of dependent children?  This is not a political critique.  This is simply an area that the legislation does not address, but which, as Deputy Andrews indicated, was ably and succinctly addressed by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">Under the heading "Parental Rights" on page 16 of its brief it states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_431">The Bill contains few references to children of civil partners or cohabitants, and makes no provision as to custody, guardianship, adoption or affiliation.  [I presume "affiliation" means supports.]  In general, Civil Partnerships are treated in terms of the partners only.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">It further states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_433">Similarly, the provisions on dissolution do not generally require the court to consider whether proper provision has been made for any dependent children.  Section 127 of the Bill sets out the general considerations to be taken into account when making maintenance or other orders on dissolution.  [That is dissolution of a civil partnership.]  The clearest of these is "the rights of . . .  any child to whom either of the civil partners have an obligation of support".</p>
          <p eId="para_434">In other words, the court must have regard to that, but the court can make no support order for such child.  It can only make a support order for the partner.  If we take the contrast, when a decree of dissolution or divorce of a marriage is granted, the courts have an obligation to make "proper provision" under the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 for spouses and children.  Under that legislation the courts have an obligation to make "proper provision", the same phraseology, for the gay partner who requires it, but there is silence as to children.  What objection is there to recognising reality?  Are we trying to pretend that gay couples whose relationships break up do not have children?  We have an obligation to ensure that those children are treated equally to any other child in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">The committee of which I am a member has been labouring for two years on the rights of children.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, is a member of the committee and the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has dropped in two or three times but beyond that we have not seen him.  I appreciate he has a lot of other obligations.  I do not mean that in a snide way but if he had been at those meetings more comprehensively he might have understood that.  We intend to propose a constitutional amendment to ensure that all children are treated equally but, at the same time, we are introducing legislation in this House which is intended not to treat equally children of gay civil partnerships and cohabitees.  I do not understand why.  Is there a fear that there would be some public backlash because we acknowledged reality?  People engage in a myriad of different relationships of various natures and children in all circumstances should be treated equally.  No child should ever be discriminated against because of the circumstances of their parents or because of the nature of the status of their parents or their parents' relationship.  We will come back to this on Committee Stage, I hope, and I hope the Minister will consider addressing the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">I wish to refer to the provisions relating to cohabitees.  There is a need to provide for recognition given that, when people cohabit in relationships and the relationship breaks up, there are often issues that have to be addressed which are similar to those which have to be addressed when marriages break up.  I can only describe some of what is contained in the legislation addressing this as bizarre.  It will give rise to extraordinary court cases of great difficulty and will result, I believe, in the provision of minimal real protection for the people concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">Section 170(1) states: "a cohabitant is one of 2 adults (whether of the same or the opposite sex) who live together as a couple in an intimate and committed relationship" — this is the definition.  Section 170(3) states: "For the avoidance of doubt a relationship does not cease to be an intimate relationship for the purpose of this section merely because it is no longer sexual in nature."  Let us assume that after living together for five years, the relationship breaks up and a cohabitee — we will presume it is the female cohabitee because most often that is the person who is at most economic disadvantage — goes to the courts to look for some sort of support order or property adjustment order under this provision.  What will happen?  The other cohabitee — the man — who does not want to make any provision, will want to ask the court to examine the minutiae of the intimacy that they engaged in.  Will we have judges being asked to examine the number of occasions per week, month or year in which people engaged in sexual intercourse?  Will men and women have to give explicit detail under cross-examination of the nature of their sexual interactions?  Will they be put through this sort of degradation?  Will we leave it to the subjective assessment of judges to determine what level of sexual interaction amounts to sufficient intimacy and at what point need it stop?</p>
          <p eId="para_438">We are told in subsection (3) that sexual relations, seizing of themselves, would not exclude a person.  It would have to be first established that there were some intimate relations.  What if one was intimate for four years, not intimate for three years and then the relationship broke up?  Does one qualify?  If it was the other way around and one was intimate for two years and continued living together for four years, does one qualify?  I have no idea, and neither will anyone else.  The other criteria in section 170 are quite reasonable but I ask the Minister to reconsider the issue of the duration of the period people have resided together.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">I have said all along that the legislation ignores children.  It does a very weird thing in regard to cohabitees.  One is a qualified cohabitee if one was in a relationship of cohabitation with another adult for two years and have given birth to a dependent child.  However, if one has not had a child, one does not qualify unless the couple have been living together for three years.  Why the difference?  The fact one has a child under this legislation gives one no entitlement to claim support for the child in any case.  Why introduce this?  I do not understand it.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">There is a decision of the High Court with regard to a couple who lived together for some years, a child was born and they broke up.  Under existing law, which is defective, the mother sought adequate provision by way of a lump sum for the child.  The court held that, for constitutional reasons, because the father was still married, though he and his wife had not lived together for many years, one could not provide a lump sum for the benefit of that child but one could do so for marital children in similar circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">The law in this area is riddled with problems and this Bill will exacerbate it.  In the context of children born outside marriage to couples who resided together, or even just generally born outside marriage, this legislation affords an opportunity to address the anomalies that have arisen as a consequence of a judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Sheehan in the McE case — I should make a declaration of interest because I appeared for one of the parties in the courts in that case.  That judgment has turned the law back substantially from where we thought it was, and it needs to be addressed in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">To conclude, all of the provisions in sections 170 and 171 relating to cohabitees need very substantial rewording and consideration.  All the focus on this Bill has essentially been on the provisions relating to civil partnership and gay couples but there are enormous anomalies with regard to couples cohabiting.  There is a failure to provide the proper protection that is necessary when cohabiting relationships break up.  For some reason, instead of ensuring that when they do break up, to use the phrase of the legislation in other areas, proper provision is made for the dependent person, there is a sort of redress scheme which ensures, and is designed to ensure, that only some assistance is given to someone who is economically dependent.  That creates an anomaly.  If a man and a woman live together for 30 years, most of the assets are in the man's name but the woman has been intimately involved in that man's family life and business life, and they have cohabited.  If she has some degree of income of her own but the man is left with ownership of substantially more of the property, under these provisions, the woman will get nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">The final problem is, of course, that none of these provisions apply to anyone whose relationship under cohabitation breaks up before the Bill commences.  That is a little time-bomb ticking away that could create disaster in the lives of many people.  My suggestion is that this provision should be amended to ensure these provisions and amended provisions apply, in so far as there is any value in them, as and from the date of publication of the Bill rather than as and from the date of the Bill's commencement.  Otherwise, we could have hundreds of individuals very badly affected by some persons extricating themselves from relationships to avoid meeting their financial obligations to others with whom they have lived for many years.</p>

        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_268">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Martin Mansergh)</from>
          <p eId="para_444">This is landmark legislation, which I welcome.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is justified in claiming it as an example of civic republicanism at work.  I believe he can say this with more conviction than might have been possible in the past.  As in 1993, when homosexuality was decriminalised, he has decided to go the whole way, with the obvious caveat of the status of marriage.  Other than that, it is a thorough-going piece of legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">One could also say that, as in 1993, the legislation is a demonstration of the benefits of coalition Government.  Undoubtedly, the decriminalisation of homosexuality was pushed up the agenda by the formation of a coalition with the Labour Party.  Without detracting from the initiative and policy of my own party and Minister, the Green Party is entitled to a sense of co-ownership of this legislation.  My belief is that this legislation provides the substance of equality, though the status of marriage is missing.  There are two groups of critics.  On one hand are those from the gay and lesbian community who complain that it does not include conferral of the status of marriage.  On the other side critics say the legislation, to all intents and purposes and in substance, amounts to marriage and they oppose it for that reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">There is common ground in our understanding of the Constitution that a constitutional referendum would be required to introduce the status of same-sex marriage.  It is better to take this step now.  In the successful divorce legislation of the mid-1990s, rather than the unsuccessful legislation in 1986, all the ground work had been done in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill introduced by Deputy Shatter in the late 1980s, in which details of substance were largely dealt with.  Divorce became a form of final marital separation, leaving only limited modalities to be addressed.  If a decision is made by the people at some point in the future the vast majority of practical questions will have been dealt with in this legislation, such as in the areas of taxation and inheritance.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">The argument was made that divorce would alter the nature of marriage as a life-long commitment.  The people listened to that argument but decided, albeit by a very narrow majority, to override it.  In a registry office in England recently I heard it stated that marriage under the laws of that state was between one man and one woman.  This dealt not only with same-sex marriage but the issue of polygamy, which is permitted by certain religions.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">A view which has some backing from the wisdom of ages is the one that marriage as we understand it today is probably the best framework for procreating and rearing children.  A same-sex marriage or partnership cannot procreate children.  I am aware that children of heterosexual marriages may endure appalling circumstances and that children of same-sex partnerships may have a near-ideal upbringing but I am talking about the average situation.  It will ultimately be for the people to decide if the differences which exist are vital and overriding factors or whether the status of marriage should be conferred on same-sex couples.  Under the 1938 Constitution such fundamental socio-moral issues have generally been reserved to the direct judgment of the people as a matter of direct democracy, as opposed to the representative democracy which deals with most other questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">Deputy Shatter dealt with the issue of children where there is a separation involving a same-sex couple, which I am sure will be teased out on Committee Stage.  In such a situation the primary responsibility of the biological parent is clear and one can imagine very few situations where responsibility for the child would be conferred on the non-biological member of the couple.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">All of us on the other side of the fence will have received correspondence and e-mails opposing this legislation, in the vast majority of cases on religious grounds.  There has been reference to Sodom and Gomorrah and I reread the verses this morning.  The iniquity of the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah is not actually closely specified.  The word "sodomy" has a certain meaning but there is nothing in the Bible to specify the conduct or relationship to which it normally refers.  We are living in the aftermath of the disastrous earthquake in Haiti and, notwithstanding the use of the phrase "acts of God" by insurance companies we are long past thinking of natural disasters as some form of divine retribution for wickedness or iniquity.  Some non-natural disasters can be linked to bad human behaviour but that is a separate issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">We have been reminded by a certain Northern saga in recent weeks of a passage in Leviticus but, except for such things as the Ten Commandments, we rarely assign a lasting validity to or are guided by the Mosaic law of a nomadic people of thousands of years ago.  When the civil partnership legislation was published I happened to be in church the following Sunday and the verse of the lament of David for Jonathan was read out, which I would like to read into the record.  The verse reads:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_452">I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan; very pleasant hast thou been with me, thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.  How are the mighty fallen . . .</p>
          <p eId="para_453">If one studies the Bible closely, one will note that Jonathan was married.  No specifics are given of the precise nature of the relationship between Jonathan and David but if one is to refer to the Old Testament, that passage is at least as striking as the passage on Sodom and Gomorrah.  Therefore, one cannot draw any definitive conclusions.  I am not aware nor have I seen quoted anywhere any statement by Christ on the subject of gay relationships.  They are statements on adultery and so on.  There are one or two passages from St. Paul but they are not stronger than his inveighing against fornication in general and various types of non-regular relationships.  At one point he said it would be better to be celibate but if one has to, then get married.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">The issue is nonetheless one on which churches have taken what can only be described as a very strong position; the Catholic position is well known.  We know that the issue of homosexuality has been hugely divisive in the Anglican communion.  Most of us look on in horror where Sharia law in other parts of the world leads young men, in particular, to be executed for homosexual acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">Some proposals have been made for what would in effect amount to discrimination, namely, that offices of the State should be allowed to withhold or not participate in civil partnership ceremonies.  My view is that if one takes up a public appointment, one must carry out the duties that the law prescribes and those duties will change from time to time as the law changes.  We should not give sanction effectively to homophobia for conscientious reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">Like Deputy Flanagan, I would have some regret concerning the matter to which he referred, but I also accept the argument that perhaps this is not the appropriate context to address it.  Perhaps another context should be chosen to address issues regarding the situation of siblings, they being a brother and sister who have a certain status.  I refer in particular to the inheritance tax position of people who have lived together for a long time in a sibling but non-intimate relationship.  There is a loose end in this respect that may need to be tidied up.  When I spoke on this matter on a previous occasion, the Leas-Ceann Comhairle took grave exception to any equation of siblings with same sex partners.  So be it, and I respect that argument but that area needs to be examined.  The Colley report did refer to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">I look forward to a detailed and intensive debate on Committee Stage.  This is the type of legislation for which sufficient time should be allowed.  I am sure the Minister will be open to constructive suggestions for its improvement and amendment in this and in the other House.  This is a very important Bill and one that will be remembered as having been passed by this Dáil.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CiaranLynch" eId="spk_269">
          <from>Deputy Ciarán Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_458">Some 17 years ago this House decriminalized homosexuality in Ireland and today we are debating legislation to give legitimacy to those relationships in a proper civil code.  This debate marks a coming of age and maturity of a modern Ireland.  In essence, this Bill is a milestone, as Ireland moves from a theocracy to a democracy.  It was interesting to listen to the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, metaphysically struggling with aspects of the Bill.  I recall a time when Ministers brought legislation to Archbishop McQuaid for his approval before it was passed in this House.  I would not envy the task of a Minister if he had to bring this Bill to Archbishop McQuaid and the response to it he would likely get.  This legislation is a milestone and I am pleased Fianna Fáil in particular and the Green Party have brought it forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">It should be noted that it was the Labour Party in government that decriminalised homosexuality and that it was a Private Members' Bill introduced by my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Howlin, at the start of this Dáil term, that instigated this issue coming onto the legislative programme.  I remember the Minister at the time gave a commitment to bring forward legislation in response to the Labour Party's Bill in 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">There are many contexts, interpretations and opinions about the Bill.  There is a strong opinion that it is the gay community's aspiration to have full legal equality with their heterosexual peers, as that is as it should be.  That is the policy of the Labour Party, as stated in this House and affirmed at our Labour Party conference.  However, the best is often the enemy of the good.  The introduction of full civil marriage for the gay community would require a constitutional referendum, as has been indicated by other speakers.  This is the advice of the Attorney-General and our party's legal advice.  At present there is far from a majority of this House in favour of putting this issue to the people, let alone surety that such a referendum would be carried.  While a criticism of this Bill might be that it is a stagist approach, I do not view that as a bad thing.  Therefore, I see merit in this legislation for those members of the gay community who cannot wait for a time when these circumstances change, particularly for gay and lesbian couples who need the protection of the law now, rather than the consolation of an ideal further down the road, irrespective of whether that be a constitutional referendum on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">I also see merit in the provision for a couple, one partner of whom is ill and the other who has no recognised rights as next of kin and is fearful of losing the family home or shared tenancy in the context of the legislation as it is currently structured.  This Bill will provide for the rights of a survivor of a relationship to inherit the home in which the partners have lived all their lives.  It will allow them to benefit on the same terms as their peers from their partner's hard work by giving them access to pension entitlements.  All these are measures are to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">Another point I welcome is the nature of the scheme set out for gay and lesbian couples.  At the beginning of this debate when Senator Norris first published his Bill there was much talk of allowing for non-conjugal same-sex unions, for example, two unmarried sisters who live in the same home and for other situations.  This Bill makes quite clear that the parties to a civil partnership must be of the same sex and in a conjugal relationship.  This is welcome because to put the committed, loving relationship of a gay or lesbian couple on a par with two siblings in terms of the standing offered to it in law was a fudge in the first instance and did not recognize the significance of those in gay relationships looking for proper legal protections in their relationships. We have yet to see tax and social welfare provisions to complement this legislation, but the Government has assured us these will reflect the principle of equality and will be introduced in the near future.  We certainly hope so.  It is important that these matters are ironed out when we come to Committee and Report Stages.  It would be a dreadful pity if, this time next year when the Finance and Social Welfare Bills are going through the House, there are anomalies still hanging over that will mean the Bills need to be significantly redrafted.  It is important that this Bill achieves its intentions and that when future Social Welfare and Finance Bills are introduced, as well as other matters relating to taxation for same-sex couples, we do not find ourselves in an ongoing redrafting process.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">The Bill has comprehensively failed to deliver with regard to the children of individual parents in same-sex relationships.  Deputy Shatter also mentioned this in his contribution.  The Labour Party addressed this issue in its Civil Unions Bill by proposing a significant change in the law relating to children.  Our legislation would have made the best interests of the child the primary criterion for the courts in family law cases; this would address a number of the points made by earlier speakers.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">This Bill, however, fails the children of same-sex parents in several crucial ways.  Any child of a parent party to a civil partnership will not be able to seek maintenance from the non-biological parent and will have no rights of succession if the civil partner of the child's biological parent dies.  The non-biological parent, moreover, cannot seek guardianship or custody of the child during the lifetime of the biological parent.  Bizarrely, civil partners will not be able to be considered for joint adoption of a child, although this is rendered nonsense by the fact that either civil partner, regardless of sexuality, may apply to adopt individually under current law.  Thus, it makes no sense that an arrangement in which the stability of a couple relationship is offered to an adopted child is prohibited.  This will also require significant and detailed examination on Committee and Report Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I refer to the redress scheme for cohabitants.  Although the issue of civil partnership has been the subject of much of the public debate on the Bill, the second part — namely, that dealing with cohabitants — will probably affect many more people, irrespective of sexuality.  The scheme is a long-overdue update to Irish family law which was recommended by the Law Reform Commission several years ago.  There will be a significant change whereby two people who are in a relationship and have been living together for three years, or two years where a child has resulted from the relationship, will automatically be termed qualified cohabitants.  As a result, they will be conferred with a number of rights and duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">This scheme will provide legal protections to a large portion of the population.  The most recent available data note that there are 120,000 people in cohabiting relationships, a third of whom have children.  The arrangement will offer particular protection to a group that is currently very vulnerable: stay-at-home unmarried partners, who are currently in a complete legal limbo.  Part 15 of the Bill also allows qualified cohabitants to seek various remedies, such as maintenance, property and pension adjustment orders, provided certain conditions are met.  A qualified cohabitant may also claim provision from the estate of his or her deceased cohabitant, subject to stated conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">One weakness of the Bill that the Minister might be willing to address is with regard to the rights of civil partners of whom one has become a qualified cohabitant since the civil union was formed.  Dr. Fergus Ryan pointed out an anomaly in the legislation, which is that a property adjustment order or pension adjustment order in favour of a qualified cohabitant cannot be made in such a way as to affect the rights of a spouse or former spouse.  Similarly, an order for provision from the estate of a deceased qualified cohabitant cannot affect the legal right of a surviving spouse.  However, no such safeguards apply where a qualified cohabitant is or was a civil partner.  In effect, the court can make an order in favour of the qualified cohabitant even if these orders affect the entitlements of a civil partner.  I ask the Minister to indicate in his closing comments whether he would be willing to consider an amendment to correct this on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">The purpose of the Bill is to introduce equality into Irish society.  However, this cannot be a type of equality that is separated into components or is based on only one Act.  I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, talk about this earlier.  A concern is beginning to surface whose motivation and intent I would question.  I refer to the commentary on the possibility of adding a conscience clause to the Bill with regard to civil registrars who object to presiding over civil partnership registrations due to their religious or other convictions.  It has been suggested that an opt-out clause be inserted for civil servants and others who are obliged to perform public duties in accordance with the law.  To my mind, either the legislation guarantees equality or it does not.  Whether a person is a member of a local authority or the HSE or is working for the State in a registrar's office, the law which will apply as a result of the passage of this Bill compels that person to carry out his or her duties.  There should be no opt-out clause.  If a person is a public servant, he or she has functions to perform.  There is a separation between theocracy and democracy, and a civil partnership registration is a secular event, not a religious one.  It should be well within the functions of registrars to perform this as a secular service.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that those who wish to have the responsibility of a civil union are provided with the right to do so.  The success of the civil partnership Bill will be measured by how it resolves issues of property, inheritance and entitlement; how it gives recognition and a sense of place to those who are currently disenfranchised; and, ultimately, how we as society define ourselves and the type of Ireland in which we wish to live.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">I and other speakers made mention of the phrase "gay community".  Who are the gay community?  They are family members, relatives, work colleagues, colleagues in the House, and members of our society who should have the same legal entitlements as any other member.  When this issue was being debated previously in the House, in the form of a Labour Party Private Members' Bill, my children asked me when I returned from the Dáil at the end of the week what I had done in work.  When I explained to them that we had been debating the Civil Unions Bill, their response was that surely such legislation was in place already.  Irish society has moved on; the children of Ireland have moved on.  This House is playing catch-up with the type of modern society in which most Irish people now live.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">It is natural and necessary that people form unions with each other.  This Bill recognizes the rights and responsibilities that must be established to cater for those relationships that are currently outside the existing legislative framework.  People in relationships wish for, and are entitled to, the legal security that can be granted by the State.  Nobody should be deprived of that right because of his or her sexuality.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_472">I listened to the contributions of previous speakers and I wish to refer to the points made by Deputy Shatter regarding what he rightly pointed out should be improvements to this legislation, with particular reference to the rights of children.  In statistics supplied by the Central Statistics Office, I came across a startling fact on the increase in the number of cohabiting couples in the ten-year period between 1996 and 2006.  In 1996, there were 34,300 cohabiting couples with 23,000 children, while ten years later the corresponding figures were 121,800 and 74,500, respectively.  During that same period between 1996 and 2006, the number of cohabiting same-sex couples increased from 150 to 2,090.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">The previous speaker commented that society is changing and it surely has changed.  For many people in our society, for religious reasons in particular, many such changes have been difficult to accept.  In the 29 years since I first was elected to this House, I have been through the entire gamut of changes, ranging from contraception to divorce and to the famous referendum on so-called abortion.  It is flippant to state that this caused a great deal of unrest in society because it caused huge problems.  I saw Members of this House grappling with their conscience in respect of many of these issues, particularly during my period as Government Chief Whip from 1982.  I have always stated that in so far as is humanly possible, when introducing such legislation one should always try to respect the views of all members of society.  People genuinely hold views that differ from those I might hold, possibly on religious grounds or whatever, and I try at all times to accept this to be a fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">Nevertheless, our society has changed greatly on foot of our membership of the European Union with 26 other member states.  As for different religions, the population now includes people who adhere to all types of religions and in some cases to none.  Members' role as legislators is to make certain that civil rights exist and that they are protected.  It is to face reality in order that in circumstances in which someone dies or there is a break-up, society can deal with the division of the spoils in respect of homes, properties, pensions or whatever.  Members are now moving to deal with the fact that the number of cohabiting couples, both same-sex and heterosexual, has increased greatly.  This legislation constitutes a genuine attempt to deal with this. While I will support the Bill, it is important for the Government to be open to changes.  Those who are listening on the Minister's behalf should accept good ideas introduced on Committee Stage and the Government should be open to changes, particularly those that would be beneficial to children in such relationships.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">I wish to deal with one aspect of this legislation on which I am sure many Members have received the same correspondence as have I.  It pertains to the concept of penalties imposed if someone does not agree to the civil partnership arrangements on genuine grounds of conscience.  Section 23 deals with this issue and provides that a registrar who, without reasonable cause, fails or refuses to issue a civil partnership form shall, on summary conviction, be liable to a fine of up to €2,000 or imprisonment of up to six months.  While I do not believe this will ever happen, it can cause a great deal of unnecessary upset.  I do not believe that someone who has a genuine religious difficulty with his or her conscience should be imprisoned for six months and to do so would be ridiculous in this day and age.  Moreover, as I noted, this will never happen.  I have heard arguments to the effect that unless such a provision was included, people in hotels would refuse to rent out a room or that people would refuse to serve meals.  However, this is a ridiculous argument because at present gay couples stay in hotels and have meals like anyone else and are entitled to so do.  I have never come across an instance of anyone being refused.  Consequently, putting up such arguments is ridiculous.  Although I am certain this issue will never arise, but why create the problem?</p>
          <p eId="para_476">I note that in Britain, the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay, introduced an amendment in the House of Lords to deal with this issue there, the wording of which has been forwarded to me.  I suggest that the Minister should consider this matter and ascertain whether it is possible to make a provision in cases in which there are genuine conscientious objections, in order that this matter can be dealt with.  As the amendment was introduced to the House of Lords by Lord Mackay, a former Lord Chancellor, it is easily obtainable.  My point is that it should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">I do not stand over any form of discrimination against anyone on grounds of religion, colour or sex matters.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_479">No.  However, our equal status legislation rightly bans discrimination and creates an offence of discrimination.  Therefore, someone who wishes to discriminate can be dealt with under existing legislation.  People should be educated into believing that one should not interfere with the religious rights of others, which are their own business.  The job of Members is to deal with human situations in which circumstances such as a break-up, death or whatever dictate that people's property rights should be protected.  This also is the purpose of this Bill, particularly in respect of cohabiting couples and in particular to the rights of the children.  Were we to educate society into thinking like this rather than always thinking of such matters in religious terms, we would have a far better society.  Sticking people into jail for six months will only make martyrs out of them and I do not discern a necessity for such a legislative provision.  As I noted, legislation already exists to deal with any form of discrimination and the Equal Status Act can be used to deal with that issue at any time.  However, it would be worthwhile to try to understand other people's points of view and to relieve them of any difficulties they may have with regard to their own conscience.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">I welcome the fact that this legislation deals with same-sex relationships.  People are living together perfectly happily, which is their business.  Members' business as politicians is to ensure that if something happens, such as a break-up or a death of one of the parties, there is protection for the other partner.  This is what this legislation endeavours to do.  Unfortunately, cohabiting couples do not have rights currently and if one of the partners dies, particularly the income earner, this can result in a horrific scenario for the surviving partners and children.  There is no such thing as common law marriage and, therefore, there are no legal rights.  The Bill endeavours to deal with this issue and not before time because I have dealt with too many cases where surviving partners and their children have suffered greatly.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">There is cross-party support for the legislation but on Committee Stage if we can deal with people's fear in a rational and reasonable way while, at the same time, making sure we do not encourage any form of discrimination, we should do so.  Amendments may be tabled to strengthen the rights of children.  In 2006, cohabiting couples had 74,500 children.  That is a significant number and it is probably nearer 100,000 today.  They are human beings and their rights must be protected at all costs.  I wish the legislation well and I hope people understand our job, as legislators, is to protect people's rights regarding property and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">During the divorce referendum debate I was confronted by a priest outside a church who said I should have been ashamed of myself because I supported divorce.  I asked him what problems he had with divorce.  He said, "It is contrary to the teachings of the church".  I put the following simple question to him: "If I arrived to your church with my partner and said I wanted to get married and you arranged and performed the religious ceremony and then invited me to sign the register, which is the civil part of the marriage and I said, ‘No, Father, I am not interested', would I be married?".  He said I would be married in the eyes of God.  I asked him whether I would be married in the eyes of the State and he said I would not.  I explained to him that all we were doing was allowing the civil aspect of marriage to cease under certain conditions.  We were not interfering with the religious marriage, as it was up to each individual to decide whether he or she should remarry following a divorce.  I said that was his business and that our business was to deal with the civil aspect of marriage.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The same argument applies in principle to this legislation.  The rights and wrongs of cohabiting couples, whether they are gay or heterosexual, is a matter for each individual.  Our duty is to ensure where there is a break up, death and so on, safeguards are in place, particularly where children are affected.  If that message can be understood by people who are concerned about this legislation on religious grounds, we will have done a good job.  However, in Great Britain, an amendment proposed by Lord Mackay provides that where somebody has a genuine conscientious objection, they should not be put in prison.  Plenty of others can perform what has to be performed and a big issue should not be made of this because all it will do is divide society.  I ask that we discuss the possibility of adopting a similar amendment on Committee Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_273">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_484">I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  For too long people have been in same sex and cohabiting relationships without enjoying the same protections under the law as married couples.  This derives from a failure of the Government to recognise the legitimacy of their relationships and the changing attitude in modern society in this regard.  This has led to inequities in the way same sex couples and thousands of unmarried and cohabiting heterosexual couples have been treated by the State, including partners being unable to visit loved ones in hospitals on occasion, problems with inheritance and property rights and issues under the tax and social welfare codes.  Many other problems are faced by such couples for which the State has not made adequate legal provision to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">My party and I believe equality and civil liberty are cornerstones of republicanism and they are among the most important ideals we, as legislators, must uphold in this society.  With this in mind, I welcome the change in attitude of the Government reflected in this legislation but the Bill stills falls short of being a comprehensive solution to the problems faced by same sex and cohabiting couples.  Legal eagles suggest traditional civil marriages have the protection of the Constitution, which is not afforded to the types of relationships being recognised in the Bill.  The legal protections I seek to be included in the legislation will, therefore, not be guaranteed under the Constitution.  I do not agree with the legal experts because I have read the Constitution on a number of occasions recently and it makes no reference to "husband and wife".  It refers to "spouses" regarding the dissolution of a marriage and to the importance of the woman in the home.  That is discriminatory language, which needs to be amended.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">There is no reason we cannot legislate for civil marriage for all couples.  The 1916 Proclamation, which was supposedly the guiding document for the Constitution, calls on us to cherish all the children of the nation equally and that is often quoted.  The spirit, theory and practice of republicanism should be to promote equality and, in that spirit, this issue needs to be revisited properly and constitutional protection needs to be afforded to the reforms I seek.  These reforms should be included in this Bill or another Bill dealing with proper civil marriage for all.  A constitutional referendum should be held to deal with discriminatory language, which implies the woman's place is in the home.  A committee of the House has dealt with the need to insert defined children's rights in the Constitution and that would be appropriate in the context of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">The Bill falls short regarding social welfare entitlements, inheritance rights, child maintenance and adoption and I will return to these issues later.  I am sure many Members, like myself, have received a great deal of correspondence in recent weeks and months from concerned constituents regarding the legislation.  Some were concerned that it has not delivered the full and proper recognition of civil partnership that they were promised and some were concerned that it does not give full rights to marriage.  Civil partnership recognition in the Bill does not go far enough and does not adequately give the protection required.  There is inequality between the protections and rights given for marriage as it exists at present and to those who will be in civil partnership unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Many people are also worried about the effect this legislation will have on the institution of marriage and the traditional family unit.  We received many queries from members of the clergy, religious orders and lay people from various denominations expressing concern that the Bill may interfere with their moral obligations or religious practices.  Sinn Féin recognises that the maintenance of a strong and stable family unit is and always will be an essential component in raising the youth of our nation and in turn assuring the prosperity of our country in the future.  We also acknowledge that religious organisations have the right to hold particular views on the definition of marriage and what constitutes a legitimate relationship as long as this does not infringe on the public good.  The definitions of State marriage and religious marriage are different; they involve different duties and responsibilities and this needs to be recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">I am assured that while the provisions of the Bill do not go far enough, they do not interfere in any way with the traditional forms of marriage and family.  The Bill expressly states that its aim is not to change the definition of marriage as protected in the Constitution.  I regret that because there is a need for a proper definition and clarity on exactly what is a family.  This needs to be contained in either legislation or the Constitution.  Is the unit of an abusive father who beats his wife more deserving of constitutional protection than a loving same-sex couple with children or a single parent raising a number of children?  The Constitution should protect all equally but in particular it needs to define children's rights so they have primary consideration and protections.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">As I stated earlier, the Constitution does not mention husband and wife; it only mentions a mother with regard to her place within the home and spouses in the case of dissolution of marriage.  A broader definition should be allowed to be legislated for through a constitutional amendment.  Far from having a negative effect on traditional families in Ireland, I believe the Bill will have a positive effect on families that have previously not been fully protected under Irish law.  This Bill will go some way towards belatedly filling a hole in Irish family law and can only be positive to society as a whole.  I cannot see how full civil marriage for same-sex couples is contrary to the constitution and I will return to this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">In much the same way as it would be a dereliction of duty for parents not to care for and nurture their children, or for a religious organisation not to advocate its beliefs and care for the moral needs of its congregation, it would be a dereliction of duty on our part as legislators not to embrace the concept of equality for all and acknowledge the realities of modern society and provide appropriate legal protections for all citizens.  It is the Government's role to ensure that all people are protected under the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Co-habitant couples are the fastest growing form of family unit in Ireland.  Earlier, I heard somebody mention the significant jump in the number of those living in such relationships as reflected in the recent census.  It is also just and right that our society no longer sees same-sex relationships as a crime, but rather as a legitimate way of life.  When it comes to the family unit, however, legislation has once again fallen behind social reform.  It is our duty to redress this situation, and the Bill goes some way towards this although not far enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">If there is a threat to the traditional family unit, it does not come from progressive legislation of this kind but from the harsh policies of the Green Party and Fianna Fáil Government.  Negative equity, huge mortgage repayments related to the property boom, the unfair tax burden on lower-income families, the over-reliance on two incomes to make ends meet, cuts to benefit payments, increases in the cost of medical care, prescriptions and child care, high unemployment and the slow but sure erosion of fair conditions and hours of work all contribute to a threat to the family unit as traditionally perceived.  These are what are putting an enormous strain on people trying to maintain relationships and create a stable family environment in which to raise their children.  Sinn Féin has been outspoken in our opposition to policies that we believe are detrimental to the economic and social wellbeing of families and communities.  We believe it is by helping families cope with the realities of these tough economic times that we can best ensure that they stay together and prosper.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">People have also expressed concern that there may be legal or employment issues emanating from a refusal to provide services based on moral objections to the new types of relationships suggested in the Bill.  Our answer to this concern is simple: discrimination law should apply in these cases.  In the same way as it is illegal for people to discriminate against clients based on race or religion, it would also be illegal for people to discriminate against clients based on sexual orientation or family type.  It is the responsibility of all people, particularly those performing a public function, to provide a satisfactory service to their clients or to ensure that another party is brought in to provide that service to a satisfactory standard.  The onus is on them to provide the service if they are public servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">Another issue many people raised was that the Bill fails to address non-intimate relationships, for example, those of a carer or two siblings living together.  While I recognise these may be covered by other legislation, it would be helpful to conduct a review to ascertain whether they receive fair and equitable treatment under the law and whether there is a need for amendments that could be tabled on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">I stated that I would return to the shortfalls of the Bill.  Prior to Christmas, I attended a protest outside the House organised by MarriagEquality.  I was surprised to hear about the number of rights which will still not be enjoyed by couples after the Civil Partnership Bill has passed.  There will be a difference between the rights of those who are married under the current law and those who will be in civil partnerships.  More than 220 rights will not transfer equally to those involved in civil partnerships.  There is no equity.  If a married person leaves a will, his or her surviving partner will receive at least one third of the inheritance regardless of what is in the will.  However, in the case of civil partners, children can apply to the courts to have that share reduced.  The same applies if a person does not leave a will; children can apply to reduce the amount to which a surviving partner is entitled.  A civil partner in the same situation must apply for each order separately.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">In respect of registering a partnership, all couples need to give three months' notice before marrying or obtaining a civil partnership.  One can apply for an exemption to this rule, for example, if the person is terminally ill.  The conditions on these exemptions are different for marrying couples and civil partners.  There are also differences in providing free and informed consent.  There are differences when relationships end and people split up.  There are differences in issues in the home, providing for children and the dissolution of partnerships and marriages.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">A foreign same-sex marriage is not treated in the same way as a civil marriage here, nor are foreign same-sex divorces and dissolutions.  There are also equality issues for transgender people.  There is also a range of inequalities in the tax and social welfare code.  One of the ways to deal with these issues is to allow same-sex couples marry in a civil ceremony, where all rights are equal across the board.  Another way is to change the legal definition as to what constitutes a family, and to change the Constitution to allow for legislation in that area.  We could change the Interpretation Act 2005 for tax and social welfare purposes to ensure it clarifies marriage as including civil partnerships.  The term "child" could be altered to include the child of a civil partner.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">As Members of this House, we will try to tease these issues out with the Minister to ensure that the Bill is the best possible.  I am realistic enough to understand that this Government will not go as far as I would like to see it go on civil partnership.  However, there are anomalies that are not addressed and which need to be tightened up to ensure that the Bill will progress.  Even though the Bill does not go far enough, I will not oppose it.  I am disappointed that we are not dealing with a civil marriages Bill that gives full rights to same sex marriages, but an inadequate Civil Partnership Bill 2009.  I will not oppose it, but I will try my best to attend on Committee Stage.  As I am not a member of the committee, I cannot put amendments down in my name.  I can raise them and deal with them on Report Stage, but this hampers Members in trying to deal with Bills in a positive way and play as full  a role as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">This Bill is a step forward.  We have gone a long way and I recognise that.  I commend the Government for having taken this step, but I regret that it did not go the whole way.  We will be back here again much sooner than people think.  The Bill will throw up other anomalies, which when challenged in court, will lead us to dealing with this issue.  We should look at our EU partners that have the same traditional associations with Christian churches that have taken the full step, and this has not affected those countries.  The social fabric of Spain and Portugal has not collapsed and the naysayers should look at that.  This is a positive Bill, but it does not go far enough.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_501">I am very pleased to contribute to this debate and I congratulate the Government on bringing this Bill forward.  I know that some speakers do not feel it goes far enough, but it is useful to remind ourselves from whence we have come.  It is well within living memory when homosexuality was a crime in this country.  Before that, it was even considered to be an illness.  Awareness and enlightenment has slowly come, but it has come nonetheless.  This is not about a liberal agenda, but about a human right.  The same rights afforded to heterosexual couples should be afforded to same sex couples.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">I feel very strongly about this because we have seen some tragedies.  I have seen them in my own community, where people have fallen ill and their partners have not been afforded visiting rights to the hospital.  This is deeply upsetting for both the patient and his or her partner.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">This is a welcome move by the Government and the Bill enshrines in law rights that should be available to everybody in our country.  Couples who are together for years are treated differently by the tax man.  They do not have security of the home they have built together, which is deeply disturbing.  Therefore, the Bill is welcome as it will end this injustice.  If a partner dies prematurely and his or her wish to be a donor is not expressed in writing, the surviving partner is not able to express the opinion of his or her loved one and this is another wrong.  The wrongs are myriad and this Bill seeks to address that, which is very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">It has been pointed out that the issue of children and their rights may not be fully covered in this Bill, which is something that should be examined on Committee Stage.  Deputy Flanagan referred to the case of a same sex couple where the mother died and the remaining partner did not have any rights over the child, and that was extremely upsetting for all concerned.  There are always two sides to the people involved.  There is security for the surviving partner in terms of property rights and the ability to continue to nurture a child, while there is a peace of mind for the person who is passing on, as that person knows that his or her partner cares for the child as much as he or she does and will be there to continue on, without being obstructed by the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">The Bill is not clear on co-habiting non-conjugal couples.  I am talking here about siblings living together for many years, which is not an uncommon situation in Ireland.  These people should be included in this Bill for the purposes of treatment under the tax laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">The main thrust of the Bill is to right a wrong that we have allowed happen to people who are in same sex relationships.  I am pleased to take part in this debate and delighted that, at long last, we will have true equality for same sex couples.  Outstanding issues in the area of same sex marriage and civil unions can be addressed at a later date.  This legislation is progress and all progress is welcome, although it often comes incrementally and not quick enough for those who seek it.  Nevertheless, progress has come.  I hope all sides will support the Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_507">I listened with interest to my colleague, Deputy Reilly, state that change has come.  It has been my experience in this republic and Chamber that change does not come but is driven by the passion and energy of citizens who want to be free.  It is dragged through against the resistance of conservatives who believe that anything other than the order they have inherited cannot stand because any change would lead to the entire edifice falling down around their feet.  This change has not come, nor has it matured or found its place in the sun because today is different from yesterday.  What is different today is that a reluctant, so-called republican Government, which more properly earns the title of "publicans' Government", has been forced to bow to the inevitable but it has not bowed far enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">This is a fundamentally bad Bill.  While it introduces some necessary changes, these changes could have been introduced many years ago.  I recall, as an Opposition spokesperson for finance in 1991 and 1992, making proposals in this Chamber to at least harmonise the tax code for the non-conjugal couples to whom Deputy Reilly referred and the cohabiting couples to whom Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred.  I was told on the floor of the House and in friendly off-the-record exchanges with officials and the Minister for Finance that the tax code does not anticipate social change.  This was an unwritten law within the Department of Finance.  While this is not an unreasonable observation given that it is not the duty of the Department or a Finance Bill to anticipate or promote change, the Department has an obligation to reflect change.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">This State is six years away from the centenary of the declaration of the republic in 1916.  While we have come a long way in terms of time, we have an awful long journey to travel if we are to make the republic a reality.  In any republic, on any continent of the globe the fundamental principle is that all citizens are free and equal before the law.  If and when this legislation is enacted, whether in the current or an amended form, we will not be able to say we have a republic in 2010 because all citizens will not be free and equal before the law.  There will be those of us who are free citizens and happen to enjoy the status of being married, those of us who are free and able to enjoy the status of having a civil partner, those of us who are able to have children naturally, with medical assistance or by adoption and those of us in loving relationships who will not have that right.  This is not republican legislation.  It does not deliver and does not go far enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">The Labour Party has been to the fore in promoting liberation in this area and other areas.  In the time remaining to me, I will address those who express a concern that we have a secular agenda.  In the words of various commentators in the media, my party is anti-religious, has no respect for the belief systems of other citizens in this republic and wants to drive some form of secularisation of the State to the point at which religion would have no place.  None of this is true.  The place in the western world where religion flourishes most is the United States, a republic where there is a complete and absolute separation between church and state.  The places where the church languishes either in irrelevance, dispute or abandonment are the countries in which it used to dominate, namely, Italy, Spain, Portugal and even Poland.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">I need not mention where we, in this island, are today.  Next month we will have the spectacle of the Irish bishops, who have been summoned to another country by the head of another state who happens to be the head of their religion, answering for their behaviour in this country.  We do not know what will be the outcome of this development.  There was, however, a time when these same officeholders would have told this assembly what to legislate for and how to legislate and that we could not trespass beyond the boundaries they had set for us.  That day has gone and will not return in my lifetime and, I hope, the lifetime of my grandchildren.   They will, I hope, be republican citizens who will be free to choose to believe and practise whatever they want and, when summoned before a court, will be equal in the eyes of the republican Constitution, both as believers and non-believers.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">Let me say this on the issue of belief.  Everybody is a believer.  There is no such thing as a non-believer, just as there is no such thing as a non-national, non-Catholic or non-person.  There are citizens who believe different things.  Some people believe in God, while others believe in atheism, humanism or agnosticism.  We all believe and need the protection and security of a republican state and its constitution to give equality in terms of the rights of belief and to behave in a manner informed by our conscience.  We need the laws and courts of the land and the enforcers of those laws to ensure that the manner in which we behave and act out our beliefs does not impinge on the liberties, rights and beliefs of our neighbours.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">Attempts to argue there are those among us who have a destructive, secular agenda are the sting of a dying wasp.  This claim is not true.  We have a liberating republican agenda which seeks to complete the task commenced 94 years ago in this city on this island when the republic was proclaimed.  The ringing poetry of the Proclamation is not echoed in the words of our Constitution which does not treat all the children of the nation equally and, as a consequence, does not treat all citizens of the nation equally.  Some day the words of the Proclamation will come true.  Members of this House will make them law but we will not do so today or for as long as a Bill of this temerity, timidity and inadequacy is put before us by a Government which claims to be the republican party when its better boast is to be the publicans' party.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">It is necessary in this discourse to recognise that what cannot be achieved today should not get in the way of making as much progress as possible or serve as an excuse for doing nothing.  What cannot be achieved today cannot be used as an excuse for not remembering that while we will only be able to do some business because of the conservative majority on the Government side, the majority will have the full and final word on how far this assembly can go.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">There is a wonderful inscription on the base of the Parnell Monument at the top of O'Connell Street, a beautiful piece of sculpture, architecture and design.  Among the many phrases Parnell uttered to the greatest imperial power at that time were the immortal words:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_516">[N]o man has the right to set limits to the march of our nation.  No man has the right to say [. . .] "Thus far shall thou go and no further"</p>
          <p eId="para_517">We will go as far as the Constitution allows us to go, but that is not the end destination.  Until such time as we arrive, this will not be the Republic signed up to in the Proclamation of 1916.  That task remains to be done.</p>

        <b>Deputy Phil Hogan</b>
         asked the

         his plans for severe weather emergencies; if he will support local authorities financially to deal with the aftermath of the recent severe weather; his plans to do so; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#JohnGormley" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_276">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_519">All local authority major emergency plans, including sub-plans for responding to severe weather events, are based on A Framework for Major Emergency Management, which became operative on 30 September 2008.  The framework and the plans detail a co-ordination structure that enables the principal response agencies — local authorities, An Garda Síochána and the Health Service Executive — to work together to optimum effect and to integrate with other services including the Defence Forces and voluntary organisations.  These co-ordination structures can be used whether a major emergency is declared.  It is a principle of emergency management internationally that the response to emergencies builds from the basic organisational units with capability to respond.  In Ireland, the principal response agencies are based locally and, where necessary, regionally.</p>
            <p eId="para_520">As regards financial support for local authorities arising from the recent severe weather, details of extra costs that may arise are not yet available.  The potential costs associated with roads repairs will be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport.  Costs that may arise in respect of the repair of water mains damaged by the frost and the supply of water to residents who lost mains water supply will be considered when full details are available.</p>
            <p eId="para_521">Having attended the national emergency response co-ordination committee, and in light of the interaction of the various Departments and statutory agencies, I am satisfied there was an active and sustained response to the recent severe weather conditions by the local authorities and the other principal response agencies, with the support of the Defence Forces and co-operation of other statutory and voluntary bodies.  It will be important to learn from experience and accordingly a review of the emergency response co-ordination and inter-agency arrangements will be undertaken.  This will assist in determining what further improvements can be achieved and identifying any relevant lessons that can be learned from the experience here and in other European countries over recent weeks.</p>

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_522">I thank the front line services in local authorities and in all statutory bodies and agencies for the tremendous work they did over the past few months in dealing with flooding in the first instance and frost and snow in the past few weeks.  In spite of funding cutbacks and staff cutbacks, they made a major contribution to keeping essential services going at local level.  This was a first test of the Minister's national emergency plan.  The website of the office of emergency planning was difficult to understand, stating: "a national framework for response to severe weather emergencies is being developed to ensure that all existing local severe weather plans are appropriately coordinated and linked."  I want to bring this to the attention of the Minister and ask a question on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_526">Linkage and co-ordination is required.  What linkage and co-ordination was carried out by the Department when it received plans from local authorities at the end of 2008?  What appraisal was carried out?  Was the Minister satisfied with all these particular plans and did he sign off on them?  When will he receive submissions from local authorities indicating what moneys are required in order to deal effectively with the repairs to roads, water and other infrastructure damaged in the recent winter weather?</p>

            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_527">Regarding the last question, as Deputy Hogan knows, I have already received responses from local authorities.  Deputy Hogan referred to this being a first test, but the flooding also presented a test.  We reacted immediately.  I was in a helicopter the very next day and visited Cork, Ennis and Ballinasloe.  On every occasion I met with the managers.  It was clear to see that at local level the co-ordination plans were working very well.  On each occasion I met the emergency services.  I am glad Deputy Hogan praised their efforts because they are fully deserving of praise.  Their task was monumental and they went about it with great civic spirit.  The communities also deserve praise for the way they dealt with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_528">Deputy Ciarán Lynch may be interested in the fact that I met with two managers from Cork, Cork city and County Cork, and assured them that this Department would not be found wanting when it came to dealing with additional costs.  We met with County Galway managers in Ballinasloe and I assured them of my support.  Last December, I recouped savings in the Department and over €16 million was paid out to 19 local authorities for exceptional costs arising from the floods in November.  The frost and severe weather we experienced recently has just come to an end and we are still considering the damage in a range of areas.  We have heard much on potholes in roads recently but that relates to a different Department.  In respect of water infrastructure, I will examine proposals from local authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_535">I have asked the Minister if he will give an undertaking in the House that additional funds will be provided to deal with water and other infrastructure.  The Minister has some responsibility as a member of Government in charge of local government to ensure that services provided by local government are properly funded in respect of roads.  It is only recently that local roads were transferred to the National Roads Authority and the Minister for Transport.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has a responsibility to ensure that local authorities are properly funded.  The Minister did not open his mouth about the €173 million cut in roads last April.</p>

            <p eId="para_536">I do not agree with the Deputy.  The roads function and funding for roads, as Deputy Hogan knows too well, transferred to the Department of Transport.  Deputy Hogan referred to websites earlier.  I have looked at websites of various councils and have seen the budgets for winter maintenance.  I discovered that Fine Gael, which has a majority on many of these councils, decided in its wisdom to cut the winter maintenance budget.  Deputy Hogan can check this for himself.  Deputy Hogan has a responsibility at local level because Fine Gael is in charge of those budgets.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_550">At the end of 2009, 1,933 units had been sourced and approved under the social housing leasing initiative.  Some 1,413 units — 1,331 unsold affordable units and 82 units sourced from the private sector — had received full approval by that date.  A further 520 private units had been given provisional approval.  Some 437 of the fully approved units are considered to be operational, as signed lease agreements are in place.  They are either occupied or are in the course of occupation.  Given that I did not introduce the initiative until February 2009, this represents significant progress.  It shows that the initiative, even at this early stage, is starting to deliver.  Under current arrangements, unsold affordable units are leased to approved housing bodies for a period of five years.  During this period, the properties are used to accommodate households that are eligible for social housing support.  The local authority retains ownership of the units throughout the lease period.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government recoups to each local authority the interest payments liable in respect of the loans taken by the authority to fund affordable properties in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_551">The average monthly cost for each affordable unit is €365.  This compares to an average monthly cost of €456 for all other lease projects.  A breakdown of the cost by unit size is not available.  A total of €642,000 was spent under the leasing initiative in 2009.  The full-year cost of the fully approved units is approximately €12 million.  We will not set targets for additional delivery, in so far as affordable housing in general is concerned, this year.  We will have regard to developments in the housing market.  The emphasis will be on continuing to make progress with measures to ensure the most effective deployment of already delivered but unsold affordable homes.  I refer to their use for social housing purposes, for example.  The ultimate intention is that the bulk of the affordable units transferred to the social housing leasing initiative will be offered for sale in due course, either to social tenants or under affordable housing arrangements.  The last time this issue was raised on Question Time, Deputy Ciarán Lynch asked for a breakdown of the cost of affordable units, as opposed to private units.  I apologise for the failure to send that information on to him.  It is included in today's response.</p>

            <p eId="para_554">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  It seems that this initiative is taking on a life of its own.  When the Minister of State announced in this Chamber that a long-term leasing programme was to be introduced, Deputies understood that it involved privately owned developments.  Given that a significant sum of money was involved — we were told that €20 million a year would be spent over a 20-year period — questions were asked about whether this represented a bail-out for developers.  We were told that the local authorities would hand back these properties to developers in 20 years' time.  It now appears that over two thirds of these properties are affordable homes that are currently vacant.  I understand that local authorities have 3,000 vacant affordable homes that they cannot sell.  Do I understand correctly that just 82 of the approximately 1,500 properties that have been approved for leasing have come from the private sector?  Has the Minister of State met the target that was set for the acquisition of privately owned properties for leasing?  The figures I have mentioned do not indicate that is the case.  Can the Minister of State explain why this initiative is becoming predominantly based on affordable homes?</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Finneran</from>
            <p eId="para_555">This scheme, which was introduced in February 2009, was extended to voluntary bodies in September 2009.  It was appropriate that many local authorities concentrated on dealing with their own unsold affordable stock during the first period of the scheme, as we did not want national stock to be sitting idle while people remained on the social housing lists.  We will have to accept that local authorities prioritised that area.  There is a natural lead-in to any new scheme — everything does not take off immediately.  It is worth mentioning that we were within a small number of units of meeting the target of 2,000 that was set for 2009.  In addition, hundreds of applications are being processed at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_556">I do not accept that it is inappropriate for affordable houses to be used as part of the long-term leasing scheme.  It is appropriate to include in the scheme properties in which public money has been invested.  Approximately 1,300 such units are available, which is not that many.  As of October 2009, local authorities estimated that they had 3,100 affordable homes on hand.  Some 1,300 of those homes have been approved by the Department for temporary use as social housing under the leasing programme, with a further 800 in the process of being sold.  According to the local authorities, fewer than 1,000 available units are on their hands at present.  It is worth recording that 1,300 houses were sold under the affordable housing scheme in 2009.  There continues to be a significant take-up of the scheme.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ciarán Lynch</from>
            <p eId="para_557">The Minister of State's response suggested that there is no clear strategy for dealing with two issues — the number of vacant houses throughout the country and the specific problem of affordable housing.  Can the Minister of State tell the House how many vacant private properties there are in the State?  I am not sure if he has the figures to hand.  I will understand if he does not.  It has been suggested that the accurate figure is anything between 50,000 and 300,000.  Can the Minister of State give the Chamber any audit figures in response to that?</p>
            <p eId="para_558">The difficulty with the affordable homes scheme is that the prices were set at the height of the property bubble.  The properties that came on to the market last year had prices that were agreed two years earlier.  Does the Minister of State agree that the fundamental difficulty with these properties is their price?  If they are to be sold, I suggest that he should consider arranging for the prices to be dropped to reflect the current reality of the market.  Everyone in this Chamber understood that the leasing initiative was put in place to acquire private properties for long-term leasing purposes.  I will not comment on whether we agree with the politics behind that.  If this scheme is to be opened up to affordable housing, so be it.  When the scheme was announced, the target of 2,000 properties related to privately owned properties.  How many of the properties that have been acquired are privately owned?</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Finneran</from>
            <p eId="para_559">The Deputy has asked three questions.  I have already said that 1,331 affordable units have been approved under the social housing leasing initiative.  The local authorities and the voluntary bodies have acquired 289 and 313 private properties, respectively.  As I have said, applications in respect of hundreds of other private properties are being processed at present.  The scheme has had some success in the short period since it was established.</p>
            <p eId="para_560">The Deputy also asked about vacant houses.  I accept that all types of figures have been cited in the public media recently.  We understand, on the basis of information compiled on a professional basis by our researchers, that the normal number of empty dwellings was exceeded by between 122,000 and 147,000 at the end of 2009.  Deputies will appreciate that there are always houses that someone has bought but not yet moved into, for example.  Such vacancies are short-term, by and large.  Our figures are usually pretty accurate.  I appreciate that people on the academic side have said there are 300,000 vacant houses.  The report prepared for us by DKM provided estimates of total stocks of empty properties of between 228,000 and 253,000.  The number of houses that are available for use is in region of 122,000.</p>

        <b>Deputy Phil Hogan</b>

         if, in view of a High Court decision in favour of An Bord Pleanála in October 2009, whether he is supporting a Supreme Court appeal against the grant of permission by An Bord Pleanála for the Galway city outer bypass; the discussions he or his officials have had with the person (details supplied) initiating the court action on this matter; if financial or other supports are being provided by the State; if he has supported other cases in which objections or litigation were initiated against planning authorities or An Bord Pleanála; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_562">Separate judicial review proceedings challenging An Bord Pleanála's decision to approve part of the Galway city outer bypass project were taken by a residents' group, Hands Across the Corrib, and an individual, Mr. Peter Sweetman.  The grounds for review included claims that the board had erred in law in giving its approval and had misinterpreted provisions of the habitats directive.  The State was named as a respondent.</p>
            <p eId="para_563">Arising from discussions with the European Commission, it was clear that infringement action against the State and possible injunctive proceedings were likely to ensue if the project proceeded based on this planning consent.  Following consultations with the Attorney General, the State contended in the High Court that An Bord Pleanála had misinterpreted the habitats directive.  On 9 October 2009, the High Court upheld the board's decision.  Following the High Court ruling, the State and Mr. Sweetman separately sought leave to appeal the judgment to the Supreme Court.  Leave to appeal was granted on 6 November 2009 on the basis that the issue involved a point of law of exceptional public importance.  The correct interpretation of the habitats directive is critical not only for the purpose of this project but also for future projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_564">Neither I nor my Department have had discussions with Mr. Sweetman or Hands Across the Corrib in regard to this case.  Neither party is in receipt of financial or other supports from my Department.  The question of who meets the costs of various parties to the case is a matter for the courts to determine.  I have not supported any other objections or litigation initiated by Mr. Sweetman or Hands Across the Corrib against local authorities or An Bord Pleanála.</p>

            <p eId="para_565">The Minister would agree that everyone in Galway would like the matter to be resolved because the outer bypass is an essential part of the city's infrastructure and will benefit the people of the area.  Is it not unusual that the Minister cannot discuss the matter with the National Roads Authority without recourse to the High Court?  Is he supporting the Supreme Court appeal?  What has been the cost to the State of the proceedings thus far and the estimated cost of the Supreme Court proceedings?</p>

            <p eId="para_566">I am not in a position to outline for the Deputy the costs of the proceedings because, as he will be aware, they will take some time to quantify.  This is a contentious point of law and we have to get it right because the habitats directive is extremely important.  The case revolves around the interpretation of article 6 of the directive and involves the construction of a road through a special area of conservation, SAC.  The road's footprint will comprise over 20 hectares within the SAC and will necessitate the destruction of a sizeable area of habitat, including limestone pavement, which is a priority habitat under the directive.  I have dealt with this matter at length on a number of occasions because I regard it as highly important.</p>
            <p eId="para_567">The board determined that the damage was not significant in the context of the overall site but my legal advice and the clear view of the Commission is that the board's interpretation is not consistent with the directive.  I am advised that the board should have concluded that the damage constituted an adverse impact on the integrity of the site and that consent could only have been granted if the project met the requirements of the derogation procedure provided by the directive.  Derogations are allowed where an overriding public interest can be demonstrated.  It is crucial to point out that the board decided not to avail of this option.  Commission officials have made it clear that if a remedy is not found to setting aside the board's decision, further action would be considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_568">A less costly solution should have been found.  The Minister could have discussed the issues with the Minister for Transport rather than resort to the High Court.  Would he accept that it would have been preferable to address the matter through Departments and State agencies rather than incur these enormous costs?</p>

Mr. Sweetman is a former Green Party candidate.  He is entitled to pursue his action but the fact that the Minister is supporting this at the taxpayer's expense creates the perception that he is on the side of Mr. Sweetman, even though the High Court has dismissed his case.</p>

We have to extricate ourselves from that difficulty.  Following clear legal advice and working in conjunction with the Commission we came to this sensible decision.  I am mindful of what the Commission expects from this country.  We have dealt with a number of infringement proceedings but we cannot afford to continue infringing in this way because we must comply with our European obligations.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_579">In the last ten years a total of €1.8 billion has been invested by the Exchequer in a new water supply infrastructure under the water services investment programme.  Recent water services investment programmes have also included specific sub-programmes on water conservation.  Funding was provided to local authorities to put in place water management systems to monitor water use and losses throughout supply networks, fix leaks and replace defective pipes where repair is no longer an economic option.</p>
            <p eId="para_580">Exchequer spending on water conservation over the last ten years amounted to €168 million.  This investment provides the platform for intensive investment in mains rehabilitation as this is a key priority under the next water services investment programme for 2010-12, which is currently being finalised in my Department.  In inviting local authorities to prepare needs assessments as an input to developing the new programme, the authorities were asked to prioritise key contracts and schemes in this area and they will also be required to prioritise water conservation works as an alternative to new infrastructure provision.  A greater proportion of the funds available annually under the programme will be assigned specifically to water conservation works.</p>
            <p eId="para_581">Current water supply problems are being managed by local authorities as best they can through intensive efforts to identify and repair leaks and by encouraging the public to use water sparingly.  Authorities are also reducing pressure in their systems and, as a last resort, cutting off water supplies at night time in order to optimise the management of reservoir storage.  Arrangements have been put in place to provide tanker water to areas without piped water supplies.</p>

            <p eId="para_582">Everyone was surprised at the extent of the water shortages during the winter crisis, although leaks go with the territory given the weather we experienced.  Ireland does not appear to be as well prepared for the type of weather we experienced this winter as other European countries.  What lessons have we learned about water conservation and leaks?  Has the Minister prepared a plan to prevent future incidents?  His Department provides 70% of the necessary finance for projects and, despite opposition from his Cabinet colleagues, he has held the line on maintaining expenditure in 2010.  However, this will not be enough to meet the requirements of 2015 or the challenges that arose during the severe weather crisis.  When will the Minister make an announcement regarding expenditure for 2010?  Does he propose to devise a new approach to deal with the types of problems that arose during the recent severe weather crisis?</p>

          <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_325" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_583">Local authorities have invested €130 million in water conservation projects since 2003, most of which came from Exchequer funds.  I can say with absolute certainty that this sum will be substantially exceeded in the three-year period of the next water services investment programme from 2010 to 2012.  I will make an announcement shortly in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_584">The degree of leakage varies considerably in different local authority areas from 16.8% to 58.6%.  In Dublin, for example, we have managed through investment to reduce the rate of leakage to some 28%, but that remains unacceptably high.  We must recognise that water is a scarce resource.  I refer here to treated water which costs more than €1 billion per annum.  In other words, domestic customers are mistaken if they believe they are getting free water.  We are all paying for it in some form.</p>
            <p eId="para_585">The programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce a system for metering of water where customers will have to pay for consumption in excess of a certain threshold.  If people were paying such charges already, it is unlikely they would have allowed their taps to run as they did during the recent severe weather.  What is required is a change of mindset.  In this new era water is a scarce resource which must be treated with care.</p>

            <p eId="para_589">I will be glad to assist the Minister in regard to the costings.  Will he indicate the precise level of investment required to bring us into line with our obligations in regard to water investment by 2015 and to deal with the water shortage problems?  In the Dublin city and county area, for example, there is a problem in regard to the capacity of treatment plants.  Can the Minister update us on when investment will be prioritised in that area in order to increase capacity there?</p>

            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_590">As I indicated, we are making assessments and will increase substantially the amount to be invested in water conservation in the same way as we fulfilled our commitment to invest in flood protection.  Investment will happen because it is an absolute necessity.  During the cold snap there was demand in the Dublin area of some 624 megalitres, which broke all previous records.  The level of demand will increase in general as our population increases.  Apart from the need to replace pipes, there are various other issues to consider in this regard.  For example, I have introduced new building regulations relating to dual flush.  Some of the existing pipes were poorly laid, which is a question of building regulations, and consideration must be given to that.  A multifaceted approach is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_591">We will make an assessment of the damage that has been done and investment will continue apace.  The recent difficulties drive home the point that our water supply is precious.  We have had problems in the State with substandard drinking water as a consequence of cryptosporidium pollution.  The current and recent water shortages have been severe, with people in parts of my constituency going without water for seven or eight days.  It is unacceptable in a First World country that people should have to endure what is not merely inconvenience, but hardship.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_593">The facility in question is being advanced by Dublin City Council, acting on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities in the context of their statutory regional waste management plan, by way of a public private partnership, PPP.  The State is not a party to this PPP agreement and has undertaken no financial or other liability in respect of this project.</p>
            <p eId="para_594">As I previously indicated, it is my understanding that the quantities of residual waste currently being collected by the Dublin local authorities may not be sufficient to meet the volumetric contractual commitment which forms part of the public private partnership agreement.  Any inability on the part of the authorities to meet this commitment could give rise to public financial implications which would be a matter for those authorities to address.  My concern in this regard is linked to my determination to ensure that the pathway to economic recovery on which we are now embarked does not lead to a business as usual approach to waste generation or to the management of the waste which might result from increased consumption.  Rather, I am determined to secure significant decoupling of waste arising from future growth and, to that end, I will bring proposals to Government to implement key recommendations of the international review of waste management policy published in November 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_595">In these circumstances, I have decided that the most appropriate course of action is to appoint an authorised person under section 224 of the Local Government Act 2001 to conduct a review of the parameters of the project.  This will address the nature and extent of financial and related risks and consequences which may arise for Dublin City Council in connection with its participation in the project agreement, in a changing policy, legal and economic environment.</p>

The judgment before Christmas by Mr. Justice McKechnie was in line with the contention of the waste industry, namely, that the facility should be reduced in size and that it will have the effect of being anti-competitive.  The authorised officer who will look at the contract will be in the best position to make a judgment regarding all the various aspects of the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_610">Written responses to circular letter MEM 01-09 have been received from 22 of the major local authorities since the flooding event in November 2009.  The authorities which have not provided written reports are Donegal, Fingal, Laois, Longford, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Offaly, South Dublin and Waterford county councils, and Dublin and Waterford city councils.  A number of those local authorities were not seriously affected by the flooding and in some cases detailed reports are delayed until flood waters fully recede so that the full impact can be ascertained.</p>
            <p eId="para_611">In the case of some local authorities, the local services primarily involved in the response to the flooding have subsequently been engaged in responding to the severe weather event.  My Department is following up with all local authorities, and where written responses are not yet available, oral reports have been received.  Interim reports have also been received from the local authorities most affected by the flooding.  I made approximately €16.5 million available to 19 local authorities in December to meet unexpected expenditure incurred in dealing with the immediate response to the flooding in their functional areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_616">I assume the Minister wrote to each local authority.  It would be acceptable and understandable, given the workload faced by local authorities, not just with the flooding but taking into account the Christmas period and the snow and inclement weather that their priorities might have been to deal with the emergencies they faced rather than to write reports.</p>
            <p eId="para_617">What will happen to the information?  Where will it go and will it be brought to the attention of the national emergency committee in a particular format or <i>en bloc</i>?  Will an independent assessment of the data be made?</p>
            <p eId="para_618">I do not imply anything untoward of the local authorities but a certain level of performance indication would be derived from the information that has been sent to the Department.  Will there be an assessment to ensure that the information is accurate and captures all local authority activity?</p>

            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_619">Yes.  I can assure the Deputy that that will happen.  The reports have been circulated to the relevant sections of my Department for consideration and any action that may be required.  The reports were also sent to the Department of Transport, which has responsibility at central government level for national and non-national roads and also to the Office of Public Works, which is the lead Government agency for the implementation of the national flood policy in the matter of flood risk and mitigation.  It is important that when we consider all of the reports, the one Deputy Lynch would be most familiar with is the one from Cork, that we focus on the areas that proved to be vulnerable on that occasion.  As the Deputy is aware, areas flooded that had never flooded previously.  We have to take that into account for future emergency planning and write it into the equation.  All of that is being done.  We are carrying out a full assessment of what occurred during the floods.  All of that information will be fed into the assessment so that we can learn valuable lessons from the experience.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</from>
            <p eId="para_620">Some local authorities were more impacted by the flooding in November than others.  For that reason they would have incurred extra costs.  They may have had to spend more money on staffing hours and the clean-up afterwards.  For example, when I was in Cork recently I read in the <i>Evening Echo </i>of how the county manager of Cork County Council has raised concerns about the costs of the clean-up following the floods and the recent snow given that the council is stretched to the limit of its finances.  I raised the matter previously that Cork County Council had to let go a lot of staff in the past year.  Will the Minister provide extra funding for certain local authorities that are struggling because they have had extra responsibility this year?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CiaranLynch" eId="spk_352">
            <from>Deputy Ciarán Lynch</from>
            <p eId="para_621">I thank the Minister for his supplementary comments.  The emergency situation comes down to two single factors, one is the emergency plans themselves and the other is risk assessment.  The latter determines the level and ultimately the quantity of the response.  The reports being sent to the Minister are intended to capture information on both those matters and how the emergency responses were worked out.  I assume that to a certain extent not everything was foreseen in the risk assessment.  The Inniscarra dam was a case in point where 500 million metric tonnes of water were going through it in a single second.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">As the Minister indicated, there is a particular difficulty in Cork where the western side of the city flooded as opposed to the traditional eastern end of the city which was prone to flooding during periods of inclement weather.  What action will be taken ultimately?  Will we see an adaptation to various emergency plans or to how risk assessment is carried out in future?</p>

          <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_353">
            <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_623">I welcome the request for the information concerned.  Will the Minister broaden the request to take into account all factors that might have contributed to the flooding that took place in November and early December?  Notwithstanding the reliance on climate change issues, there should be more reliance on drainage issues, the need for which has been clearly identified over a number of years.  I accept the Minister is aware of the situation himself, although the recent replies to some of my parliamentary questions would not seem to indicate that.  The public is concerned and the European institutions are ready to provide back up funding provided that a careful and adequate assessment is carried out of the contributory causes of the flooding.  Will the Minister confirm to the House that this will be done, and that the emphasis will be put on the prevention of any recurrence, which can be done with a little effort?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_354" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_624">In reply to Deputy Tuffy, in December I made €16.488,257 million available to 16 city and county councils and three town councils to assist them with the unexpected expenditure involved in responding rapidly to the flooding in their areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_625">Deputy Lynch inquired about risk assessment and how we will use the information.  We must use the information to ensure that in those areas which have now been shown to be vulnerable, for example, the quays in Cork, that we put in place proper flood protection.  We have increased spending on that provision.  It is the OPW which is examining the matter of risk assessment in detail.</p>
            <p eId="para_626">In reply to Deputy Durkan, the preliminary estimate would indicate that the total cost of the damage could be approximately €100 million.  Most of the expenditure is associated with repairs to national and non-national roads and bridges and quay walls in Cork and Limerick.  Other areas of expenditure are connected to water supplies, housing and the general costs of the clean-up.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">I understand that the Department of Finance will shortly decide on whether it is possible to submit an application for assistance under the European Union's solidarity fund.  The threshold of overall expenditure before any assistance would be payable is high at more than €973 million.  I am trying to estimate what will be the total cost.  I understand that the insurance industry has estimated that the total cost could be approximately €250 million.  I do not have the cost for agriculture or other areas.  We are trying to quantify the expenditure.  It is clear from all of those figures that this is something that can cause major damage and personal hardship.  I am aware of that.  When one considers the cost associated with flooding, this is why investment in prevention is such a good investment.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_629">First, as the Deputy will be aware, ministerial and departmental responsibility for matters concerning FÁS training programmes lies with the Tánaiste and Department for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, respectively.  Local authorities have a strong record in carrying out work on behalf of local communities in areas such as the renovation of community buildings and general environmental work of great value at local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_630">Arising out of a meeting between the Tánaiste, myself and the County and City Managers Association last year, local authorities are engaged with FÁS, with the support of my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to explore the potential of their involvement in training and employment opportunities in this regard.  A working group representative of county and city managers and senior FÁS personnel has been established to advance this work as quickly as possible.  Among the issues being considered are general job placements, support for redundant apprentices and placements for graduates and recently unemployed professionals.  The areas referred to by the Deputy will also be considered under the relevant FÁS schemes such as the work placement programme.  I assure the House of my continued support in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_631">I thank the Minister for his response.  Will the Minister give an indication of the number of places that will become available?  As he knows, many people are unemployed who would have no difficulty in getting involved and undertaking some of this work.  Many of our parks have had cutbacks imposed on them by the local authorities as a result of the direct cut in local government funding.  It is essential the public gets a proper service in our parks, that parks are properly maintained and rivers properly drained and cleared out.  The Minister should seek to get these people working immediately and contributing to society.</p>

            <p eId="para_632">I emphasise that this is a matter primarily for the Tánaiste.  However, I would be very happy to highlight the Deputy's proposal to her and her Department.  The maintenance of our public parks and our local authority landscapes is of great importance to local communities.  The constructive proposals that have been made are worthy of careful consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_633">The Deputy asked about the numbers.  I understand existing FÁS schemes, such as the work placement programme which has been designed to provide nine months' work experience for 2,000 unemployed individuals while they retain their social welfare entitlements, can be used to do the type of work envisaged by the Deputy.  It will certainly be brought to the attention of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_638">I welcome the Minister's response to Deputy Terence Flanagan on taking this to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I imagine that the intent of this question and what is proposed is to complement existing local services rather than to replace them.</p>
            <p eId="para_639">On a similar theme, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment's reply to a parliamentary question of mine before Christmas showed there are 2,400 apprentices within six to 12 months of the completion of their apprenticeships who are without work and cannot complete their qualifications until they acquire work.  Given that local authorities, particularly in today's economic climate, are among the biggest procurers of contracts and tenders, would the Minister consider putting a position in place whereby local authority tendering processes would in future take cognisance of the situation and ensure these apprentices could be taken on, even for a temporary period, to complete this training?  At present, the breakdown is that there are 1,650 of these apprentices in the construction sector, more than 500 in the electrical sector, 68 in the engineering sector and more than 100 in the mechanical sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_640">The simple suggestion I make to the Minister is that, as part of the tendering process, a number of these people in Cork, in the Minister's constituency and elsewhere could be taken on and given that six months' to 12 months' experience.  Ultimately, the difficulty they have is that they cannot secure employment either here or abroad until they have that paperwork completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_641">Again, I emphasise that these are primarily matters for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which is why I could not give exact figures to Deputy Tuffy.  The suggestions made by all of the Deputies are very constructive ones.  I will be happy to bring them to the attention of the Tánaiste.  I agree that what the Deputy says makes sense.  In the current economic downturn, we have to be innovative in the way we approach these matters to ensure people can carry out this sort of very valuable work and, as the Deputy says, merely supplement what is already there.  This is not a means of replacing people and we need to emphasise that point.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Finneran</from>
            <p eId="para_643">The provision of affordable housing, including setting of the sale price, is primarily a matter for individual housing authorities.  The sale price of an affordable home is determined largely by its cost.  Where authorities consider it appropriate in the context of reduced open market prices and the continuing need to ensure value for money outcomes, they have the option to reduce the sale price of any affordable house by further subsidisation utilising Part V moneys, clawback or other internal capital receipts on hand.  My Department issued comprehensive guidance to local authorities in April 2009 outlining a range of measures that could be considered in dealing with the build-up of unsold affordable homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">Local authorities were advised that in cases where they believe price is the main factor inhibiting sale and where there would be a prospect of achieving a sale if additional discount was provided, they should consider the option of further discounting.  My Department does not collect information on the number of cases in which local authorities chose this option because it is for local authorities themselves to decide, given their unique position to make judgments on market conditions in their respective functional areas, the most appropriate option to be pursued in individual cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_645">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  It is disappointing he did not intervene or listen to what Fine Gael had to say about Dublin City Council reducing its affordable prices last year.  He should have issued a directive to other local authorities to do likewise.  There is now a situation where they have a glut of affordable housing on their books and it will be a long time before they get to sell those properties.</p>
            <p eId="para_646">Does the Minister of State agree that the affordable housing partnership has not performed since it was set up in 2005 and that it has been a complete waste of taxpayers' money?  The Minister of State said that more than 1,300 social and affordable housing units were provided last year but this is only a drop in the ocean.  Much more needs to be done and should have been done over the years.  Will the Minister of State comment on this and on the fact his policy has failed to link social housing with the private market?  Clearly, the private market has not delivered.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Finneran</from>
            <p eId="para_647">I reject the claim made by the Deputy on this matter.  There is not a glut at this time.  As I explained in an earlier question, our local authorities have been innovative and in the first nine months of 2009 they were successful in selling 1,300 affordable homes, which is a success that should not go unrecorded.  In addition, I have taken 1,300 units into long-term leasing.  At this time, there are fewer than 1,000 units on the books of all local authorities and I am told the local authorities are quite confident of further sales in this area.  On the suggestion of a glut, I am not in a position to direct local authorities to reduce their prices as I do not have the authority.  The local authorities entered into negotiations and made contracts with developers.</p>
            <p eId="para_648">I do not have the figures for every year but they were made available in an earlier question.  I will supply them, but I assure the Deputies that the number of affordable homes provided has been considerable.  The affordable homes partnership continues to play a supportive role with local authorities in the area of marketing and there is a special website for this purpose.  People can also buy direct from the local authority and the affordable homes partnership has contributed in a positive way to making homes affordable.</p>

The Minister did not speak about discounting prices in April because I raised the issue with him and was told he had indicated to local authorities that they should do anything but drop the price.  The current difficulty arises from the fact that local authorities are locked into a contract with developers made at the height of the property bubble.</p>

            <p eId="para_655">We need to review the whole idea of affordable housing.  Affordable housing was a contract with developers and was designed to keep the bubble inflated so that house prices continued to go up.  It also addressed the fact that most people could not afford to buy very expensive houses.  Many people now seem to view affordable housing as no cheaper than housing sold on the open market.</p>

Following a number of requests from local authorities I have agreed that 200 properties should go into their stock in this way.  I have also allowed 1,300 to go into long-term leasing, making a total of 1,500 to people on housing lists.</p>
            <p eId="para_659">In April 2009, I issued detailed guidelines to local authorities on what they could do with their affordable homes.

            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_677">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_678">In relation to the recent sustained period of severe weather, the critical consideration was the response of the relevant statutory agencies tasked with addressing emerging events.  The response arrangements of the statutory and voluntary agencies in dealing with the developing situation were substantially tested.  Some areas of the country experienced more severe problems than others and required more co-ordinated responses by the various agencies.  I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all the staff of local authorities and other statutory agencies and to members of voluntary bodies for their dedication and contribution to ensuring that services were maintained as far as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_679">Up to the Christmas period, local authorities acted to ensure that the national road network remained open for purposes of public transport and access for the private sector for the delivery and receipt of goods and services.  My Department monitored the emerging position and, in light of a deteriorating trend, I convened the national emergency response co-ordination committee.  There was no unnecessary delay in this regard.  The committee facilitated a whole of Government approach and provided a forum for different Departments and agencies to exchange information, agree priorities and ensure that any matter which required a national response was dealt with expeditiously.  This complemented but did not replace the continued co-ordination and inter-agency arrangements at local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_680">The response of the local authorities and the other principal response agencies, with the support of the Defence Forces and other statutory and voluntary agencies was active and sustained.  At all times, the co-ordination and inter-agency arrangements set out in the framework for major emergency management were implemented at local and regional level by the principal response agencies working together with other statutory and voluntary bodies.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_390">
            <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
            <p eId="para_681">I concur with the Minister in his praise of those who worked very hard.  I would liken them to troops in the field who fought bravely to maintain the roads and services.  Is there something about the Minister's constituency and being leader of the minor party in a Government with Fianna Fáil that leads the general to abandon his troops in the middle of battle?  That happened with the leader of the Progressive Democrats who upped and left in the middle of a war.  The Minister's invisibility during the course of this distressing crisis for many householders throughout the country was extraordinary.  I do not know whether he was in the sun enjoying himself along with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, while the people here suffered and therefore was not aware of the hardship they were enduring.</p>
            <p eId="para_682">There is a quarry with salt stocks in Carrickfergus in the North of Ireland.  I understand it is the only such quarry in the country.  Salt can be purchased there for €44 per tonne.  In my area of Fingal only 50% of the roads were gritted.  Most people were running out of their supplies of salt and when they went to buy more it was all gone.  The North of Ireland retains 50,000 tonnes of salt for emergency purposes.  What is our reservoir — which can be a space to accommodate anything — or stockpile of salt?  I understand it is 50,000 tonnes.  Yet, if we were to take a lead from the North of Ireland, proportionally, we would have more than 217,000 tonnes of salt.</p>
            <p eId="para_683">I ask the Minister, as I asked this morning in this House, will he put in place a clearly identifiable individual who will retain authority for salt stocks in this country?  I referred this morning to the excellent work done by Met Éireann in predicting this crisis.  Will the Minister put in place such a person similar to the person who is responsible for our oil reserves?</p>

            <p eId="para_684">As the Deputy knows, this is primarily a matter for the local authorities, which report directly to the Minister for Transport and this matter is co-ordinated by the National Roads Authority.  That authority, which was part of the emergency committee, ensured we had adequate supplies of salt at all times.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">If one was to consider our response compared to Northern Ireland, which the Deputy mentioned, or that of our nearest neighbour the UK and countries beyond there, we succeeded in keeping the national primary route ice free at all times.  That was a remarkable achievement.</p>

            <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan</from>
            <p eId="para_704">I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for the opportunity to raise this issue that needs to be urgently addressed.  There is a need for the Minister for Finance and the Government to make a decision, as a matter of urgency, on whether to extend the moratorium on house repossessions or face to the reality and introduce a NAMA-type scheme for householders, especially those people who have large mortgage arrears and face the strong possibility of their houses being repossessed.  We know from new figures published this week by the credit agency, Moody's, that 6,400 householders did not make any form of mortgage repayment last year.  It is critical that some sort of an arrangement is arrived at immediately, otherwise these people will be at severe risk of losing their homes.  The one-year moratorium on house repossessions is due to finish at the end of this month.  The situation in which these people find themselves needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency and they need assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_705">The Minister for Finance has only kicked to touch on this issue.  The Government introduced the moratorium on house repossessions but since then it has not given any guidance or reassurance to anyone who finds himself or herself in difficulty and faces the prospect of losing his or her home. The Fine Gael Party has introduced the homeowners support scheme, which will help and protect people and ensure that will retain their home.  Family protection is what is needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_706">There are more than 100,000 people on the housing lists throughout the country.  The last thing we need is an increase in the numbers on those lists as a result of house repossessions.  There are 300,000 vacant houses and the Government should help out ordinary people who find themselves in extreme difficulties</p>
            <p eId="para_707">The Fine Gael homeowners' support scheme would allow NAMA to take an equity share in a property after negotiating a write down in the outstanding debt with the relevant financial institution and then the property owner would have an opportunity to service that debt directly with NAMA and an opportunity to buy back the equity stake if the owner gets to sell the property at some stage in the future.  Consequently, NAMA would realise the money at the point of sale.</p>
            <p eId="para_708">We know from figures published by the Financial Regulator that at the end of September last year, 331 residential properties were repossessed by banks, which equates to one home a day having been repossessed.  Yet the Minister for Finance, who is completely out of touch, said in his Budget Statement that only 20 homes were repossessed last year, which is completely at odds with the statistics.  The Minister of State might comment on that in his reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">The reality of repossession was highlighted clearly in the media in December in a High Court case involving a couple who had lost their jobs.  Stepstone Mortgages would not re-negotiate an agreement with the couple to accept a mortgage repayment of €800 a month.  It sought a payment from them of €2,400, which they were not in a position to meet.  These people were not afforded an opportunity by that institution or any help by the Government and now find themselves as part of the homeless and housing statistics.  The Government and the taxpayer will have to pick up the tab.  Clear intervention and help is required for people who find themselves in this difficulty</p>
            <p eId="para_710">We know from the CSO that 77,500 households are in arrears on their mortgage repayments.  The problem will snowball in the months and years ahead.  It is imperative that action is taken now.  The mortgage interest supplement is inadequate and is clearly not helping those who need help repaying their mortgages.  The Government must loosen the qualifying conditions and include sub-prime lenders among the qualifying lenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_711">I hope the Minister will have some good news.  He should either extend the moratorium on housing repossessions or actually face this problem head-on.</p>

            <p eId="para_717">The code of conduct on mortgage arrears, which was published by the Financial Regulator last February, applies to all regulated lenders on a statutory basis and replaces the earlier voluntary code operated by mainstream lenders.  The code applies only to mortgage lending to consumers in respect of their principal private residences in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_718">The main features of the code are early recognition of problems — as soon as even one payment is missed, lenders must communicate with the borrower to establish why the repayment schedule has not been adhered to and how the situation may be rectified; active management of arrears problems — a plan for clearing the mortgage arrears can be developed that is consistent with the interests of both lender and borrower and takes into consideration all viable options open to the borrower; examination of alternative solutions — the lender must explore with the borrower alternative repayment measures, including changing the monthly repayments to help address the arrears situation; and the use of repossession only as a last resort — the lender must not seek repossession of the property until every reasonable effort has been made to agree an alternative repayment schedule with the borrower.</p>
            <p eId="para_719">It is important to emphasise that the code is not due to expire at the end of the month, as the Deputy appeared to suggest.  The code requires a lender to wait at least six months from the time arrears first arise before applying to the courts to commence enforcement of any legal action on repossession, so there is no deadline looming after which this protection will expire.  In the case of Bank of Ireland and AIB, both of which have been recapitalised by the State, this period has been extended to 12 months, also from the time arrears first arise, for the duration of the recapitalisation subscription agreement.  As a further measure, the Minister has been in touch with the Financial Regulator to request that consideration be given to extending the moratorium on mortgage arrears from six to 12 months for all mortgage lenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">The Irish Banking Federation, representing the mainstream lenders, published a statement of intent in November 2009 which provides further reassurance to homeowners who find themselves genuinely unable to maintain repayments on their principal private residence.  The statement has been agreed and supported by all IBF members and is a welcome development.  It is also welcome that the IBF oversight committee on the implementation of the statement of intent will include a representative from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS.</p>
            <p eId="para_721">The House will be aware that there have been a number of developments relating to the Government's commitments in the renewed programme for Government dealing with protecting the family home and helping those in debt.  In particular, I refer to the recent Government decisions on matters relating to indebtedness and mortgage arrears and also personal debt management and enforcement.  Work has commenced on bringing forward options for dealing with these matters.  In his budget speech the Minister refocused mortgage interest relief on those who bought their homes at the peak of the market.  Where a homeowner's entitlement to mortgage interest relief was to expire in 2010 or after, he or she will now continue to receive it up to the end of 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_722">In addition to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, a number of additional support measures are in place, including the mortgage interest subsidy scheme, of which the Deputy will be aware.  The Government also funds MABS, which provides valuable support for families in difficulty.  MABS is the main Government-funded service which provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in matters relating to debt management.  A new debt protocol agreement has been finalised with MABS and the Irish Banking Federation which provides added reassurance for borrowers with the most difficult issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">Historically, repossessions in Ireland have been low.  A comparison of repossession figures from mainstream IBF members — that is, not including sub-prime lenders——</p>

Media reports of repossession cases taken through the courts show that most involve sub-prime lenders, as mentioned by the Deputy, which made mortgages available to borrowers who would not have been customers of the mainstream lenders, often because of perceived higher risks.  Cases in which borrowers stopped payment after a few months, failed to respond to repeated attempts to contact them or even abandoned their houses feature regularly in media reports of repossession cases before the courts.</p>

            <p eId="para_728">All estimates of the extent of negative equity appear to be based on general economic assumptions, but it is difficult to assess realistic price levels when property market activity remains low.  Being in negative equity does not change one's mortgage payments, and the Financial Regulator has estimated that only a small proportion of borrowers with the covered institutions who are in negative equity are in arrears on their payments.  As the House is aware, NAMA, the legislation pertaining to which has now passed into law, is designed to address systemic risk in our banking system.  The suggestion that NAMA could operate for householders is not an appropriate means of addressing the issue of mortgage arrears for home owners.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">Everybody accepts that we have gone through a difficult period.

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_732">The issue of women who were committed to Magdalene laundries is one of the last unresolved issues of the hidden Ireland of institutions, religious orders and the State so eloquently set out in the Ryan report and a whole series of articles, books, films, memoirs and television programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_733">Just before Christmas last year, the Justice for Magdalene group met senior officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  At that meeting, Mr. James Martin, an assistant secretary at the Department, stated that after the passage of the Criminal Justice Act 1960, the State routinely placed women on remand in the Magdalene institutions and paid a capitation grant for each woman so referred.  I welcome the admission by the Department that women were routinely referred to various Magdalene asylums via the Irish court system in an arrangement entered into by members of the Judiciary and the four religious congregations operating Magdalene laundries in the State.  Women were also placed in Magdalene laundries "on probation" by the Irish court system, in some cases for periods of up to three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_734">There is cross-party agreement among many of Members of the Dáil in support of the demand by the Justice for Magdalene group that records relating to all such women and to these institutions should be released.  In addition, it now seems appropriate that the Minister for Education and Science should withdraw the assertion he made on 4 September 2009 that "the State did not refer individuals to Magdalene laundries; nor was it complicit in referring individuals to them".</p>
            <p eId="para_735">The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has come clean and the Department of Education and Science should do the same.  The Minister for Education and Science must come before the House and withdraw these references, as well as his previous references to women in Magdalene laundries being some form of employee in routine employment within the laundries.  There is a need to seek to address the wrong that was done to these women.  They need a forum in which to tell their story, recover their history and be acknowledged by the State.  Many of the survivors, who are not numerous, now are elderly, poor and living in greatly reduced circumstances in Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
            <p eId="para_736">It is welcome that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has entered into a serious dialogue with the representatives of these women.  Last July, on foot of the publication of the Ryan report, the Labour Party introduced to the Dáil a Bill prepared by my colleague, Deputy Quinn, which sought to address some of the proposals in the all-party resolution which followed on from the Ryan report.  This included a proposal to extend for the purposes of redress, the age of majority to the then age of majority of 21.  The Labour Party believes this would deal with a significant number of cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_737">For people under 40, there is almost no memory or familiarity with the laundries or the other institutions in which women were incarcerated, in many cases because they were having a child on their own or because they otherwise had come to the attention of the courts.  Incarceration in such institutions was seen by the court system and a doctrinaire Catholic State as a substitute for female imprisonment.  As I noted previously regarding the school I attended, a laundry was attached to the Sisters of Charity convent, Stanhope Street, that I believe continued until the end of the 1960s.  The same also is true in other parts of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">I believe the public in Ireland and a wide body of cross-party opinion in this House, strongly supports justice and restitution for the women who were incarcerated and who worked like slaves in these laundries.  It is up to the Minister for Education and Science to do this because in the Ryan report and many of the other reports, the Department of Education and Science had a pivotal role in committing people to institutions.  Much has been learned from the Ryan and Murphy reports and a series of small steps remain to be taken in respect of the legacy of the Magdalene laundries.  I believe the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has begun on the right road and the challenge is for the Minister for Education and Science to come before this House and do the same by remedying this historic wrong.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dick Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_739">At the outset, I apologise that the Minister is not present.  I agree with the Deputy that this is one of the most bleak periods and episodes in what, it must be said, was a bleak period in Irish life.  Second, on reading the materials for the response to the Deputy, I note the bulk of them come from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I make this point in advance as a caveat because it may be that the Deputy will seek to retable this issue for discussion with a specific focus on her concerns regarding the Department of Education and Science.  Therefore, the Deputy should forgive me if the reply does not quite touch on the areas on which she sought a response.  However, it is a response to the question that was sent to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I also note, by way of summary, that the materials pertaining to the sentencing of persons, the Probation Act and remand touch on some of the areas to which the Deputy referred.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">On the issue of sentencing persons, there is no statutory power for a court to sentence a person to be detained in a Magdalene laundry or any other such institution as an alternative to imprisonment.  However, it is known from the commission of inquiry into the reformatory and industrial school system in 1934 to 1936, known as the Cussen report, that judges were reluctant to send certain young women convicted of criminal offences to female prisons.  Instead they would send the offender to a home conducted by a religious order, provided that the young woman and the religious order agreed.  The Department does not have details of these cases and the records in question are court records.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">On the issue of the application of the Probation Act, the Probation of Offenders Act provides that where a person is found to have committed a criminal act — I accept that the majority of the young women to whom the Deputy referred committed no such act — but the court is of the opinion that having regard to the age, health or mental condition of the person or because of extenuating circumstances it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment, the court can discharge the offender conditionally on the person entering into a recognisance to appear before it within a specified period not exceeding three years.  In the case of District Court cases, no conviction was recorded unless the person did not comply with the conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">The research to date has established that in 1924 and subsequent years one of the conditions of probation that was imposed in a number of summary cases in Dublin was a requirement that the person reside in Our Lady's Home convent in Henrietta Street.  This was not a Magdalene laundry <i>per se</i> although it did operate a laundry.  The order in question received some payment from the then Department of Justice in the form of an annual grant to the Roman Catholic Prisoners (Female) Aid Society and subsequently directly to the home.  A report exists on the conditions there and there also are references to probationers being sent to the Good Shepherd Convent, High Park, Drumcondra, the Good Shepherd Convent, Gloucester Street, the Sisters of Charity, Donnybrook and the Sisters of Mercy, Dún Laoghaire.  In 1942 and 1943, 45 women were assigned by the courts to such homes under the Probation Act.  It appears that these orders and arrangements were made by the courts without reference to any Department of State.  The requirements of a probation order, including its duration, would be made known by the court to the offender.  The records of such orders are court records.</p>
            <p eId="para_743">As the Deputy is aware, the courts have the power to remand a person charged with criminal offences in custody pending trial and sentencing.  Periods of remand normally are quite short.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for ensuring that there are places of detention which can be used for remand purposes.  In October 1960, the then Minister for Justice approved St. Mary Magdalen's Asylum, Sean McDermott Street and Our Lady's Home in Henrietta Street, Dublin for use as a remand institutions for girls between the ages of 16 and 21 years pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act 1960.  Payments were made by the Department in respect of such cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_744">Prior to 1960, the only option for the courts was to remand such persons to Mountjoy female prison.  Incomplete records are held by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and in the archives relating to payments made in respect of persons remanded to St. Mary Magdalen Asylum, Sean McDermott Street, Dublin.  The Minister is happy to allow access to them in the normal way. However, inquiries made to date indicate that many older files were destroyed by flooding and that it is the practice to destroy support documentation relating to payments after seven years.  It is understood that part of the arrangements with the two institutions was that those remanded were to have same rights and privileges as provided for remand prisoners in Part III of the Rules for the Government of Prisons 1947.</p>
            <p eId="para_745">In general, in the time available and on behalf of the Minister, it is not inappropriate to describe the situation as grim.  I should also add that all the indications are that the majority of persons in such religious institutions did not come through the criminal justice system at all but entered due to poverty, family or other circumstances.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has no records relating to such people.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">The Deputy asked specifically about the position of the Department of Education and Science.  The Minister for Education and Science has indicated that children who were sent to Magdalene laundries from institutions scheduled to the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 can be considered for financial redress if, as children, they were victims of abuse while resident in the laundries.  However he does not intend to otherwise extend the redress scheme to such institutions.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform continues to liaise with the Department of Education and Science, given its co-ordinating role in the area of institutional child abuse and related matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">On a personal level, I wish to add to this response.  It is imperative that a humane approach be adopted to what was, as I noted at the outset and as I am sure the Deputy will agree, probably the bleakest period in Irish history, when any sense of our humanity appears to have been put aside.  I apologise if issues in respect of the Department of Education and Science were not dealt with in this reply.  I hope that if, at a future date——</p>

            <from>Deputy Chris Andrews</from>
            <p eId="para_751">On 10 December 2009, the British Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs issued technical advice on the labelling of produce grown in the occupied Palestinian territories.  It was issued to allow British retailers and consumers to distinguish between products from Palestinian producers and those from Israeli settlements in the region.  That act would give the consumer the ability to choose the produce he or she buys.  I urge the Government to follow the British Government on this matter.  Currently under European law, foods from outside the EU must be labelled with their country of origin.  Products from the West Bank are not differentiated between settlement and Palestinian.  However, under new, progressive UK guidelines, the British Government recommends indicating whether Palestinians or settlers made the product on the labels of West Bank produce.</p>
            <p eId="para_752">Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories are unlawful under international law.  They contravene Article 49.6 of the Fourth Geneva Convention 1949, which prohibits an occupying power from transferring its own civilian population into occupied territory.  The move by the British Government peacefully and constructively sends a message to Israel that Britain recognises that this is illegal behaviour and will provide its citizens with appropriate information to allow them make an informed decision now on whether they wish to purchase foods produced in illegal settlements.</p>
            <p eId="para_753">Israel has shown flagrant disregard for both international law and the human rights of the Palestinians.  According to Mr. John Ging, in 2009, the number of Gazans living in abject poverty trebled to 300,000, which equates to one in five residents of Gaza.  Gaza is one of the poorest and most densely populated places on earth and, for the past three years, the Israelis have maintained a blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has slowly and systematically brought the residents and infrastructure of the area to their knees.  The Government and the international community are failing in their moral obligation to prevent human rights abuses in this matter.  Israel is breaking the law without any repercussions, but it is important to acknowledge that Ireland and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in particular, has been a positive influence and been supportive of the peace process between the Israelis and the Palestinians.  I ask that the Government implements this labelling process without delay as a gesture to the Palestinian people that they are recognised by the Irish people.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DickRoche" eId="spk_426" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Dick Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_754">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue because the plight of the Palestinian people has a particular resonance with the Irish people.  I do not know why that is but I suspect it has something to do with our history.  I am glad the Deputy recognised the Government has been unequivocal in its condemnation of what has happened there.</p>
            <p eId="para_755">In December 2009, the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, DEFRA, issued technical advice to importers and retailers concerning country of origin labelling for produce grown in the occupied Palestinian territories.  The guidelines, which are voluntary, advise on distinguishing between produce grown by Palestinians and by Israeli settlers.  This issue relates essentially to produce grown in the West Bank, rather than Gaza.  There are no longer any Israeli settlements in Gaza.  In addition, because of the ongoing blockade of Gaza, to which the Government and almost every Member are firmly opposed, virtually no Palestinian produce is being exported from Gaza.</p>
            <p eId="para_756">The UK guidelines were formulated in response to pressure from consumers in the UK or from retailers who were themselves responding to consumer pressure.  They involved a lengthy consultation process between the relevant UK Government departments, led by DEFRA, in which the Foreign and Commonwealth Office participated to advise on the political context.   This was followed by the circulation of draft guidelines and a second round of consultations with retailers, importers, consumers and other interested stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_757">The Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have discussed this and he has followed the UK consultation process with interest and he took careful note of the issuing of the new guidelines in December.  It is important to make clear that there is nothing to stop Irish retailers now from clearly labelling goods to distinguish settlement produce.  The example of the UK suggests, however, that many retailers feel more comfortable doing so, or requiring such labelling from their suppliers, when there are clear Government guidelines to follow, to which the Deputy referred.</p>
            <p eId="para_758">The Government's position on settlements in the occupied territories has been clear and consistent.  We consider all the territory occupied by Israel in 1967 to be still occupied territory, we do not recognise any purported annexations of such territory, and we regard all Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory as illegal and contrary to international law.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has repeatedly stated that Israel's failure to comply fully with its commitments under previous international agreements to halt all settlement expansion constitutes a major obstacle to the peace process and the achievement of a negotiated two-state solution.  The Irish people have also made clear, most notably regarding the conflict in Gaza a year ago, their deep concern about the issue of Palestine and the continuing encroachments on the rights and lands of the Palestinian people.</p>
            <p eId="para_759">Produce from the West Bank, including from settlements, is not and should not be labelled as "Product of Israel" but an identifier of "Produce of the West Bank", or something similar, could well mislead consumers into assuming they were buying goods from Palestinian producers.  There is an element of a double edged sword to this.  Many Irish consumers might well wish to be aware if they are buying produce originating in illegal settlements.  I am, therefore, in favour of consumers being given the information to make this choice, and of similar guidelines issuing here.   The Minister for Foreign Affairs is in agreement with this view.  Product labelling is not the responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs but rather a matter primarily for other Departments.  However, the Minister has requested officials in his Department to discuss this with the other relevant Departments with a view to following best practice observed in other countries.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_760">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the following issue: the decision of the Minister for Education and Science to dissolve the National University of Ireland, NUI, without meaningful consultation with the four constituent universities, namely, UCC, UCD, NUI Galway and NUI Maynooth, and the five recognised colleges to which the NUI makes awards, namely, the Royal College of Surgeons, the National College of Art and Design, the Institute of Public Administration, the Shannon College of Hotel Management and the Milltown Institute; having regard to the absence of the publication of the draft legislation, qualifications (education and training) Bill, which is not due to be published until the end of 2010; in advance of the publication of the report of the Hunt group established in February 2009, which is reviewing the overall strategy for third level education; and in the absence of a vibrant and coherent Government policy to promote Ireland internationally as a centre of excellence for third level education.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">In response to the original proposals in the McCarthy report, the NUI published a document in which it stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_762">First, it would not save the State any significant moneys whatsoever. McCarthy claims that abolishing NUI would save the Exchequer €3 million annually. The annual State grant is just less than €13,000.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_763">Secondly, it would seriously damage a valuable national brand at home and abroad. NUI degrees enjoy a high recognition nationally and internationally. This is important, particularly in medicine and health sciences. NUI institutions are increasingly successful both in attracting international students to Ireland and in delivering programmes on campuses abroad. Abolishing NUI would severely inhibit this growing internationalisation.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_764">Thirdly, the member institutions of NUI all support its retention. The four constituent universities and the five recognised colleges all support the retention of NUI and the continuation of its role as the centre of a federal university.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_765">Fourthly, the removal of the NUI role in awarding qualifications would not serve the interests of the NUI recognised colleges.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_766">Fifthly, the abolition of NUI would dismantle a national institution, strongly associated with the State since its foundation in 1908, which has a proud record of support for the language, history and culture of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_767">The promised legislative changes will be incorporated in Seanad reform legislation under the guidance of a Department that cannot get its own legislative act together.  The notion that it will hitch this wagon of institutional reform to the much more dubious train of Seanad reform is absolute nonsense.</p>
            <p eId="para_768">What the Department of Education and Science has done is to create an atmosphere of complete instability and uncertainty as to the future of these institutions.  It promised that change will be delivered through a most dubious vehicle, that of Seanad reform, which if it is to go the direction that all of us believe will probably be necessary will also require a constitutional referendum.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">It is illogical and inexplicable that this instant and unilateral announcement was made yesterday at three minutes to midnight in terms of the consultation process.  The chancellor and the registrar of the NUI were summoned at 11 a.m. yesterday by the officials of the Minister for Education and Science to be told by the Minister that this was going ahead.  Many people in some of our key universities received no advance knowledge that this was likely to happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">The Minister of State has a good record on educational matters and by virtue of his professional background has a very clear understanding of this.  If we want to become a knowledge economy, which is a shared aspiration throughout the House, and if we want to use the resources of our educational institutions which have an international reputation then dismantling the brand of the National University of Ireland is not the way to go.  Already, damage has been done by the Department of Education and Science in scaling down the marketing efforts associated with promoting Ireland as a centre of international educational excellence.  The education Ireland Bill has been demoted to the point where it will not be brought forward.  This admission has been made by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.  In addition, his suggestion that responsibility for the marketing abroad of Irish educational excellence at third level, which came to his attention during a recent visit to China, should be carried out by Enterprise Ireland has not been picked up by that body.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">To add insult to injury, and chaos and uncertainty to a clear well-established situation which the current occupants want to retain and which on its abolition will deliver no saving of any significance to the State, the Minister has introduced this announcement and I ask him to withdraw it and to reconsider what the future should be.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DickRoche" eId="spk_428" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Dick Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_772">I have a lengthy reply from the Department of Education and Science but I will draw the Minister's attention to the concerns expressed by Deputy Quinn.  I am taking the Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe, who apologises for his inability to be here.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">As Deputy Quinn is well aware, the Government has been considering the role of the NUI in the context both of the establishment of the new qualifications and quality assurance and the recommendation on dissolution contained in the McCarthy report.  The qualifications and quality assurance landscape was examined with a view to simplifying the many relationships between colleges and agencies and the Government recently approved the general scheme of the legislation bringing the functions of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Irish Universities Quality Board, HETAC and FETAC into a new single agency.  I must say that the proliferation of agencies has left me a little in the cold.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">In the October 2008 budget, the Government announced that the NUI's functions would be considered in the context of the establishment of an amalgamated qualifications and quality assurance agency and there was a consultation paper issued on the issues and submissions were received.  At the same time a consultative process on the future of the higher education sector has been under way.  There has been ample opportunity for all interested parties to make their views known.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">Since the enactment of the Universities Act 1997, the NUI has not been a federal university in any real sense.  While the NUI supplies some shared services, all significant powers ordinarily associated with a university are directly assigned to the four constituent universities.  They make their own awards and have their own quality assurance procedures which are externally reviewed not by the NUI but by the Irish Universities Quality Board.  While the NUI senate provides a forum for discussion on most major issues the universities themselves make the decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_776">New partnerships between universities and institutions are evidence that the agenda on collaboration between higher education institutions has moved on and that the NUI is becoming less relevant.  The current arrangement where a separate awarding and quality assurance framework is maintained by NUI for only five recognised colleges is not sustainable.  Some of these recognised colleges are exploring alternatives themselves.  The recognised colleges could enter a quality assurance and award making relationship with the new agency or with an existing university.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">The dissolution of the NUI is not primarily a matter of saving money.  The net savings arising from dissolution may be in the region of €1 million.  Rather it is a matter of being unable to support the continuation of the NUI to carry out its remaining functions, the bulk of which will now most likely be performed by the constituent universities themselves.  The Minister for Education and Science concluded that having a separate institution make awards for a small and reducing number of recognised colleges and to deliver certain shared services for some of the universities is neither strategic nor sustainable.  It is in this context that the Government has decided to dissolve the National University of Ireland.  There is no need to delay while the higher education strategy is being finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_778">As Deputy Quinn stated, the NUI has made an enormous contribution over the past 100 years to our cultural life and national development.  The decision to dissolve the NUI was not taken lightly.  The NUI brand enjoys respect and recognition domestically and internationally.  The awards made by the NUI's constituent universities are entitled awards of the NUI, and will continue to be so.  The Minister is open to discussing with the constituent universities an appropriate mechanism to ensure the protection of the integrity and international reputation of the NUI degree, which is the core issue raised by Deputy Quinn.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dick Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_780">The legislation amalgamating the qualifications and quality assurance bodies will include provision for the amalgamated agency to establish a code of practice and quality mark for the provision of educational services to international students.  Education and training providers will be able to apply for the quality mark based on their compliance with the code of practice, which will cover such issues as treatment of fees and support services for international students.  Additional measures will apply to providers of English language courses.  The quality mark will be a valuable promotional tool for education and training providers, and it is a necessary tool.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">In addition, under new arrangements recently put in place by the Minister to promote Ireland as a centre for international education, Enterprise Ireland has been given operational responsibility, under his authority, for the marketing and promotion of the "Education Ireland" brand overseas and the development, promotion and marketing of international higher education.  I was surprised at the Deputy's comments in this regard because on a number of recent visits I was aware of Enterprise Ireland having an input.  It may differ from place to place, I am not sure.</p>
            <p eId="para_782">Co-ordination of our national effort is hugely important.  That is why the Minister has established a high level group on international education, which will co-ordinate the efforts of the education sector and the national agencies.  This group will meet for the first time next week.</p>

            <p eId="para_784">Maybe so.</p>
            <p eId="para_785">The Minister is confident these initiatives will further strengthen Ireland's reputation for educational excellence and help to ensure that we can take fullest advantage of the growing market in international education.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">Work will now begin on determining, in consultation with the NUI and the constituent universities, the most appropriate arrangements for distributing NUI functions.  On the question of the NUI's role in the election of members of Seanad Éireann, the Minister will work closely with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the context of wider plans for Seanad reform.  Like Deputy Quinn I have some experience of this and I wish them both well.  It is intended that appropriate legislative provision for dissolution will be made in legislation amalgamating the qualifications and quality assurance bodies.  That is from where the reference to Seanad Éireann comes.  I will ensure that the Minister is aware of the Deputy's concerns because I believe that the NUI has made a very valuable contribution to graduates.  However, I must also make the point that I believe the educational landscape in Ireland has changed out of all recognition in recent years.</p>

         if applicants are still required to have been refused a mortgage by two banks before being adjudged credit worthy for the purposes of the home choice loan scheme in view of the fact that the scheme is currently targeted at credit worthy first-time buyers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_790">The Home Choice Loan is intended not to provide an incentive for households to enter the housing market, but to provide access to mortgage finance to facilitate certain first-time buyers who have themselves decided to purchase a home at this time. The scheme is therefore designed to respond, in a very targeted way, to a specific set of circumstances in the housing market whereby prospective middle income first-time buyers, who would previously have been in a position to access mortgage finance from one of the financial institutions, are not currently in a position to do so, due to the impacts of the credit crunch and the general global curtailment of lending to households and businesses arising from it.</p>
            <p eId="para_791">It is important to clarify that applicants under the Home Choice Loan Scheme are not deemed to be credit worthy by having been refused loan finance elsewhere. All applications are rigorously assessed having regard to an applicant's ability to pay, credit history and rating and all other aspects of a strict formal lending policy. An applicant's ability to pay is also stress-tested to assess their capacity to meet their repayments in the event of significant interest rate rises.  It is only after all of these requirements have been met that an applicant can be deemed to be credit worthy for the purposes of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">The requirement for applicants to provide evidence of two refusals or inadequate loan offers from private financial institutions is in place to ensure that those credit worthy households who are in a position to have their loan finance requirements met by a private financial institution, do so.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_798">To the end of last year, some 1,933 units were sourced and approved for leasing in order to meet the housing needs of persons requiring social housing support.  Of these, 437 units are deemed to be operational on the basis of signed lease agreements in place.  Given that I only introduced the Social Housing Leasing Initiative in February 2009, this represents significant progress and shows that the initiative, even at this early stage, is already starting to deliver.</p>
            <p eId="para_799">The progress made in 2009 will be built on and developed further in the year ahead. It is anticipated that the leasing initiative and the RAS programme will together deliver some 4,000/4,500 units in 2010, accounting for 50% of the total social housing output expected this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">These delivery mechanisms will continue to grow in importance in terms of our housing supply programme in the years ahead.  Given increased housing needs at a time of limited Exchequer resources, leasing and RAS offer a pragmatic way of continuing to meet general housing needs, while allowing us to prioritise the available capital funding for programmes targeted at the most vulnerable and disadvantaged households.</p>
            <p eId="para_801">Leasing and RAS are of course more than just a pragmatic response to market conditions. They constitute an important component of a graduated and flexible system of housing supports, within a lifecycle approach to meeting housing needs, which was clearly articulated in the Government's 2007 housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities <i>.</i>

            <p eId="para_807">On 12 May 2009 I announced that the Government had decided to introduce a directly elected Mayor for the Dublin Region in 2010. This decision arises from the commitment in the Programme for Government to introduce a directly elected Mayor of Dublin, and from the considerations in the Green Paper on local government which I published in April 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_808">The Government's decision to introduce a directly elected Mayor of Dublin will deliver significantly strengthened leadership for the city and region, with enhanced accountability and a direct connection with the citizen.</p>
            <p eId="para_809">The Mayor will primarily act as a strategic policy maker who will also work to integrate the activities of local government and the wider public service in and across Dublin. The Mayor will be equipped with a suite of substantial powers across the functions of local government, and will have the authority and powers to deliver real leadership. He or she will establish policy frameworks for the Dublin Region including in the areas of land-use planning, waste management, and water services and will also chair the Dublin Transport Authority.

            <p eId="para_813">The need to deal in a proactive manner with the issue of flood risk was recognised by the Review of Flood Policy agreed by Government in 2004. Following the Review, the Office of Public Works was assigned Lead Agency  responsibility for the management of flood risk. In this regard, I understand that the OPW is commencing Flood Risk Studies with a view to the preparation of Catchment Flood Assessment and Management Plans. The role of my Department, where there is serious flooding, is to ensure that the local authorities are prepared to respond promptly to ameliorate the worst effects in relation to those aspects for which they have direct responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_814">In this regard local authorities act in co-operation with other Principal Response Agencies — an Garda Síochána and the Health Service Executive — and the voluntary agencies and the Defence Forces to limit the effects on individuals whose lives may be put at risk or who may be exposed to serious hardship. The main concern is that effective emergency plans are in place based on the Framework for Major Emergency Management approved by Government in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_815">The management of the emergency response then falls to the local authorities and the other response agencies. In relation to assistance from the European Union Solidarity Fund towards the cost of damage arising from the flooding, this is a matter for consideration by the Department of Finance.</p>

            <p eId="para_819">Since the Department's Retail Planning Guidelines came into force in 2001, Ireland has undergone considerable change in terms of economic and social development, particularly in relation to population expansion and settlement patterns.  In this period, there has been a considerable expansion of retail infrastructure and services which has been positive in facilitating greater competition in the retail sector.  In addition, retail strategies have been prepared by all planning authorities as part of their development plan functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_820">Given changed economic circumstances, it is important that the forward planning context for future retail development remains robust and realistic.   My Department is currently drafting a consultation paper to inform the scope of a focused review of the Retail Planning Guidelines.   This will allow stakeholders and interested parties to assist in identifying key issues for inclusion in draft revised guidelines, which will issue for public consultation before their finalisation at the end of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_822">The renewed Programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce a scheme for the licensing and inspection of septic tanks and other on-site waste water treatment systems.  In October 2009, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) found that Ireland failed to make adequate legislation for dealing with domestic waste-water from septic tanks and other on-site wastewater treatment systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_823">My Department is chairing a task force to consider how the inspection of septic tanks should be carried out and I intend undertaking consultations with stakeholders on the matter. In order to comply with the ECJ ruling, legislation will be required to give effect to the new inspection system. At this stage, while this matter is receiving priority attention, it is too early to estimate when the new arrangements will be operational.</p>
            <p eId="para_824">The results of the last Census of Population indicated that about 418,000 houses, or 32% of the total stock of just over 1.3 million houses, were served by septic tanks in 2006. It is not possible to estimate how many of these septic tanks would be considered to be defective. It is important to note that primary responsibility for ensuring the treatment system is functioning properly rests with the occupier of premises or, if unoccupied, the owner.</p>

            <p eId="para_826">My Department's policy guidance in relation to Taking in Charge of Residential Estates states that planning authorities must adopt construction standards for residential developments that are acceptable to the planning authority for taking in charge and long-term maintenance and that it should be a condition of planning permission that such standards be adhered to.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">The guidance also states that the construction standards adopted by planning authorities should at a minimum comply with those set out in my Department's Recommendations for Site Development Works for Housing Areas, which recommend standards for the diameter of pipes and the amount of cover, and make other relevant recommendations including a recommendation that watermain pipe size and layout should be designed in consultation with the local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">Technical Guidance Document G of the Building Regulations (Hygiene) provides that, in regard to bathrooms and kitchens in dwellings, the cisterns, service pipe and fittings and any associated cold water pipes should be adequately protected against damage by frost.</p>
            <p eId="para_829">My Department's Taking in Charge Guidance also states that it is necessary for the planning authority to satisfy itself, when the developer of a residential estate has ceased construction or notified the planning authority that construction is complete, or after the planning permission has expired, that the development is properly completed in line with the planning permission and, where it is not properly completed, to take early and effective enforcement action.</p>
            <p eId="para_830">Where an estate has yet to be taken in charge, the repair of a burst water main is a matter for the developer.

            <p eId="para_832">Implementation of the Government's Homeless Strategy will result in significant improvements in homeless services, involving action by a number of statutory and non-statutory agencies. At national level, a range of actions has been taken to ensure that implementation of the Homeless Strategy is firmly underpinned by a robust framework of policy, legislation, co-ordination and funding. Practical achievement of the objectives of the Strategy will ultimately be determined primarily by the performance and effectiveness of action by relevant agencies at local level which, in future, will operate within the new statutory framework of structures and action plans provided for in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_833">A core objective of the Homeless Strategy is to eliminate long term occupation of emergency or transitional homeless facilities and enable households to progress to independent living in mainstream housing. This is being pursued through a range of actions including provision of adequate social housing lettings to homeless households, reconfiguration of emergency or transitional facilities as self contained units of long-term accommodation and provision of additional sources of mainstream accommodation. Intensive work on all of these areas is progressing.</p>
            <p eId="para_834">The Support to Live Independently Scheme (SLÍ), details of which issued to local authorities in July 2009, forms an important element of action to end long-term homelessness by providing suitable long term accommodation in mainstream housing with appropriate supports to help people make a successful transition from homelessness to independent living.  It includes the use of accommodation procured through the Social Housing Leasing Scheme or available to local authorities in the form of affordable housing that is unsold or considered unlikely to sell in the current market, along with availability of low to moderate level visiting supports, on a reducing basis for a period, to help homeless households address the challenges likely to arise in making the progression to independent living.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">Implementation of the scheme is proceeding, with the main focus initially on the Dublin area. This involves a three-stranded approach — sourcing of accommodation; assessment of households, formulation of their support plan and allocation of tenancies; and procurement and deployment of visiting housing support services for the purposes of the scheme. The various strands are proceeding broadly in parallel. The scheme will expand progressively in 2010 and all possible action will be taken to maximise progress, particularly in terms of securing accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">The provision of appropriate facilities and supports for homeless people with more intensive needs is also a priority.  The reconfiguration of existing homeless services will result in extending the availability of long term supported residential accommodation for people who are unable to live independently.</p>

            <p eId="para_838">Ireland will make a positive contribution to the successful implementation of the Copenhagen Accord, while maintaining efforts to strengthen it.  Our contribution will be reflected, inter alia, in the emission reduction pledge which the European Union will make before the end of this month for the purposes of Appendix I of the Accord, and in the international financial support to assist developing countries in addressing climate change. The Government has already announced a contribution of up to €100 million for fast start financial support in the three-year period 2010 to 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_839">Reducing global greenhouse gas emissions to a safe level is key to the success of the 1992 Climate Change Convention.  As a contribution to that objective, the EU has adopted an independent commitment to achieve a 20% reduction in emissions by 2020 compared to 1990. In addition, the EU has signalled its willingness, as part of a global and comprehensive agreement for the period beyond 2012, to move to a 30% reduction target subject to other Parties committing to appropriate action. This policy position will inform the final EU pledge for the purposes of the Copenhagen Accord and Ireland will accept its fair share of that burden.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">The EU recognises the importance of the carbon market in achieving global mitigation objectives in a cost-efficient manner.  EU priorities for development of the carbon market include reform of existing Kyoto Protocol mechanisms and the creation of new sector-specific mechanisms. The financial cost of engaging in offsetting in the future will be determined by the extent to which Ireland decides to avail of market options.</p>

            <p eId="para_843">I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 28 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_844">The Government's key priorities in shaping the overall housing provision for this year have been to focus the impact of necessary adjustments on the areas in which there is scope to maintain output through more flexible approaches and where the policy context supports such approaches, and to continue to direct available capital resources substantially towards the most vulnerable and disadvantaged. In keeping with this strategy, the reform programme, now well underway in my Department, involves a shift away from construction/acquisition and a one size fits all approach to meeting social housing needs towards a more graduated system of supports. This refocusing, in policy and financial terms, is rooted in the clearly articulated rationale set out in the Government's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">While the allocations for 2010, when finalised, will show a reduction in the provision for the main traditional local authority programme, I anticipate that, through more flexible market based delivery mechanisms such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and long term leasing, as well as the significant increase in funding available under the Capital Assistance Scheme in 2010, delivery across the range of social housing measures this year will be of the order of 8,000/9,000 units.</p>
            <p eId="para_846">In relation to affordable housing, rather than setting targets for delivery, the emphasis this year, having regard to developments in the housing market, will be on continuing to progress measures to ensure the most effective deployment of already delivered but unsold affordable homes, including their use for social housing purposes.</p>

            <p eId="para_853">General-Purpose Grants from the Local Government Fund are the contribution that my Department makes to local authorities to meet the gap between the cost to them of providing a reasonable level of day-to-day services and the income they obtain from other sources.  A total of €870m in General-Purpose Grants will be provided to local authorities from the Local Government Fund in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">The Local Government Fund is also providing significant funding to local authorities for the improvement and maintenance of local and regional roads.  The allocation of local and regional road grants to individual local authorities is a matter for the Minister for Transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">Local authorities now have access to an additional revenue stream, the €200 non-principal private residence (NPPR) charge.  As of 15 January, €58,164,420 has been collected in respect of 2009, all of which, less transaction and administrative costs, accrues to local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_856">It is a matter for each local authority to prioritise its spending, within the resources available to it, across the range of services it provides.  Equally, local authorities must ensure full value for money for the resources invested, and seek the maximum efficiency across their operations.  I am satisfied that the general purpose grant allocations I have provided for 2010, together with the income available from other sources, will enable Local Authorities to deal with the adverse winter weather conditions and continue to provide an acceptable level of service to their customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_857">In addition, I provided some €16.5m in supplementary funding at the end of 2009 to assist local authorities in the worst hit areas in meeting the immediate and exceptional costs incurred in dealing with the recent flooding crisis. The following table details the amount sought by and granted to individual authorities. Payments were made to the local authorities in the week before Christmas.</p>

            <p eId="para_924">From a social housing perspective, I see clear potential for real and meaningful synergies between the work of the National Asset Management Agency in ensuring the stability of the financial system and the role of my Department in responding to social housing need.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">For some time now the social housing investment programme has been undergoing a significant restructuring to shift the focus increasingly towards more flexible delivery mechanisms, through the Rental Accommodation Scheme and, more recently, the introduction of long term leasing arrangements, with a lesser reliance on construction and acquisition, in line with the reform agenda clearly set out under the Government's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.  This approach is enabling the Government to deal proactively with the new circumstances in the residential property market, seeking to make economic necessity and social need work in tandem.</p>
            <p eId="para_926">I and my Department have met with representatives of NAMA to discuss how we might seek to ensure that a social dividend is secured through the long-term leasing of suitable residential units for social housing purposes, while providing a return in line with NAMA's mandate.  With NAMA now operational, I anticipate that this engagement will continue and intensify in the period ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_928">Part 3 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which provides the legal framework for the introduction of the Incremental Purchase Scheme (IPS), has been commenced and came into effect on 1 January 2010.  The Part was commenced to allow incremental purchase arrangements to be applied to new housing units being supplied by housing authorities.  The Housing (Incremental Purchase) Regulations 2009 set out the classes of dwellings to which incremental purchase arrangements apply and I have no proposals to amend those Regulations.  Further Regulations will be required to give full effect to the detailed terms of the scheme; these are currently being drafted by my Department with the intention that the scheme be fully rolled out to housing authorities by mid-2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">On foot of the Regulations already made, housing authorities have been instructed to begin the process of designating suitable new-build housing for incremental purchase by way of a Manager's Order.  The sale of incremental purchase units, including the number to be sold and the extent to which the IPS may be used in dealing with unsold affordable housing stock, will be a matter for individual housing authorities to decide once the scheme is fully operational.  Households that will be eligible for this scheme are those assessed as eligible for social housing support and existing tenants who wish to transfer to homes made available under the scheme, subject to satisfying certain criteria, including demonstrating a capacity to service the required mortgage.</p>
            <p eId="para_930">A separate scheme for the sale of apartments, based on the principles of the incremental purchase model, is provided for in Part 4 of the 2009 Act.  Part 4 has not yet been commenced as detailed Regulations are required to give full effect to the scheme.  My Department will be working to finalise these Regulations as soon as possible after the incremental purchase arrangements under Part 3 of the Act are rendered fully operational.</p>

            <p eId="para_933">The Commission made a decision on 29 October 2009 to refer Ireland to the European Court of Justice for an imposition of fines in relation to the Directive on the quality required of shellfish waters, while deferring such referral for three months. Ireland has never been fined by the EU for an environmental infringement and I am confident that all outstanding aspects of this case will be completed to the satisfaction of the Commission within the timescale allowed for addressing the outstanding issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_1151">The Programme for Government agreed in 2007 signalled a fundamental change of policy in relation to waste management. Reflecting the ambition of the  Programme commitment, I have repeatedly made clear that incineration can no longer be the cornerstone of Irish waste policy,  and that it is the Government's intention not to support the provision of excessive incineration capacity but  to maximise the diversion of  waste for reuse, recycling, composting or anaerobic digestion. I have made my policy position clear to Dublin City Council on a number of occasions and have drawn their attention to the risks involved in proceeding with an incinerator with a very high level of capacity.</p>

            <p eId="para_1156">I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 299 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1157">On 23 April 2009, I announced that the Government had decided not to proceed with implementation of electronic voting in Ireland. <i>  </i>Since then, a process has been put in place to address the issues that arise from the decision. An Interdepartmental Task Force, chaired by my Department, has been established to bring the project to an orderly conclusion and to oversee disposal of the equipment and termination of storage arrangements.  To date, the Task Force has met three times, and it aims to complete its work as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158">In considering options for disposal of the equipment, the priority is to pursue the most economically advantageous approach, with a view to achieving the maximum recovery of cost possible in the circumstances, consistent with environmental and other obligations.  Detailed consideration of all relevant factors is underway to inform the manner in which disposal of the machines will be effected.  This includes contact with the original suppliers of the machines.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">Details in respect of costs incurred for the storage of electronic voting equipment are gathered annually by my Department from Returning Officers, in January each year.  Figures for storage costs in 2009 are currently being gathered and are therefore not yet available.  Based on figures received in my Department from Returning Officers, the total annual costs for storage of the electronic voting equipment (including the cost of insurance, service charges, rates and heating) for 2008 were some €204,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">In 2007, over 60% of the machines (4,762 in total) were moved from 12 local storage locations to a central facility at Gormanston Army Camp.  The remaining machines are stored at 13 local premises that were originally identified by Returning Officers for this purpose.  It is intended that all machines will be removed from their present locations when arrangements for disposal are implemented.  Work on termination of local lease arrangements is proceeding in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1161">My Department engaged consultants with valuation expertise in May 2007, following competitive tendering, to examine individual leases and make recommendations on termination of leases where appropriate.  In May 2008, I accepted the consultants' recommendations and these are currently being implemented.  The consultants recommended termination of leases in 7 cases and this has since occurred in 3 locations.  No additional payments were made in respect of these terminations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1162">Work is ongoing on concluding the other 4 leases.  It is expected that, in certain instances, termination of lease arrangements will give rise to buy-out costs and these will be dependent on the outcome of negotiations.</p>

            <p eId="para_1171">Good progress has been made in recent years by local authorities in the provision and management of water services in their areas. This progress has been possible through high levels of investment coupled with new legislation on the supervision and enforcement of drinking water standards in public water supplies and the licensing of wastewater treatment plants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1172">There is an ongoing need to expand and improve our water and wastewater treatment capacity to ensure compliance with environmental standards and ECJ judgments, to anticipate future economic and social development needs and to ensure investment decisions reflect other national priorities such as the National Spatial Strategy.

            <p eId="para_1177">Ireland signed the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters on 25 June 1998.  Progress towards ratification of the Convention is closely aligned with work at EU level and, in that context, the European Union has adopted two Directives as part of the ratification process for the Convention.  These deal with public access to environmental information (2003/4/EC) and public participation in certain environmental decision-making procedures (2003/35/EC).</p>
            <p eId="para_1178">The European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations 2007 came into effect on 1 May 2007.  These Regulations transpose EU Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information.</p>
            <p eId="para_1179">The process to transpose the Public Participation Directive is well advanced. The recent European Court of Justice judgment in case C427/07 concerning the Public Participation Directive requires certain legislative amendments which my Department is prioritising in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. When this work has been completed I, along with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will ensure that the instrument of ratification of the Aarhus Convention is submitted to Government and laid before the Dáil as a matter of urgency.</p>

            <p eId="para_1183">I understand that the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (DDDA) is vigorously contesting the action taken by Donatex Ltd. in the Commercial Court over the terms of a property deal to purchase the former Irish Glass Bottle Company site in Ringsend, as part of the Joint Venture with the Authority and Memphal Ltd.   It would be inappropriate for me to comment on matters which are before the Courts, including the potential impact of other related court cases on the Donatex/DDDA case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1184">Regarding the Authority's financial outlook, the Chair of the Authority, during her appearance at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 1 December 2009, indicated that she expected the Authority to report a significantly reduced operating deficit for last year by comparison to the 2008 deficit of €27 million.  The final position for last year, including in relation to borrowings, will be set out in the Authority's 2009 accounts in due course.  No funding was provided to the DDDA from the Exchequer in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185">The Chair has also indicated that the Board has set an objective to return the Authority to a break-even situation as soon as possible.  The Authority is in ongoing dialogue with my Department and the Department of Finance in relation to its financial position.</p>
            <p eId="para_1186">The Authority's accounts are audited by independent external auditors.  Under existing legislation, the Authority, along with many other State and semi-State commercial bodies, is outside the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Last Autumn, I asked the Authority's Chair, who is an acknowledged expert in corporate governance matters, to prepare a report on corporate governance within the Authority.  I will consider the most appropriate response to the findings of this report once it has been formally submitted to me in the coming weeks.  In that context, I will keep the issue of any future involvement on the part of the Comptroller and Auditor General under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_1187">It is important to note that under existing arrangements, it is open to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to request the Authority to appear before it, thus affording Oireachtas Members an opportunity to question the Authority on its activities and outlook.  As indicated above, the last such appearance by the Authority's Chair and Acting CEO took place on 1 December 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1188">The DDDA is already subject to the requirements of the Freedom of Information Acts, under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 (Prescribed Bodies) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 297 of 31 May 2006).</p>

         the provision that has been made to re-house persons occupying unsold affordable housing units at the end of the five year leasing period; if it is intended that tenants would move to another property and re-enter the housing list; if so, the stage at which same would be carried out; if the unsold affordable housing unit would be automatically or potentially leased for another five years; if, in the event that they are re-leased, these properties will be designated as social housing for rental purposes on a permanent basis; the rationale of leasing unsold affordable housing units for five years and subsequently for another five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1199">The social housing leasing initiative encompasses a number of different strands, one of which provides local authorities with the option to lease vacant and unsold affordable units to approved housing bodies, for a fixed period of five years, with the units concerned being made available to households eligible for social housing support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200">At the end of the five year lease period, there will be a range of options available that will protect the interest of the tenants, while at the same time opening up new opportunities to pursue purchase options.  In summary, the housing authority may—</p>
            <p eId="para_1201">(a) sell the units to the existing tenants under the new incremental purchase arrangements;</p>
            <p eId="para_1202">(b) sell the home as an affordable unit;</p>
            <p eId="para_1203">(c) extend the leasing arrangement for a further period of up to five years, or</p>
            <p eId="para_1204">(d) take the unit into its housing stock and continue to rent it to the household concerned, subject to having sufficient funding within its capital allocation and obtaining my Department's prior approval.</p>
            <p eId="para_1205">At the end of the lease period, if the unit is not sold to the tenant or taken into the social housing stock, it will be the responsibility of the housing authority to meet the ongoing social housing need of the household concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1206">The rationale for using unsold affordable units to accommodate social housing tenants in the short to medium term is to match existing vacant housing stock available to housing authorities with the housing needs of those in need of social housing support.  In the wider context, it supports the objective of providing a flexible system of graduated housing supports using a ‘lifecycle' approach to meeting housing need, in line with changes in this regard underpinned by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  These changes will provide for a more objective approach to determining housing need, with more regular assessments to help shape the social housing investment programme, to determine eligibility for social housing support, to identify special needs and to assess the relative priority of households to receive support.</p>

            <p eId="para_1490">The current ambitious multi-annual regeneration programme includes a broad range of projects from smaller estates in regional towns, to inner city flat complexes in Dublin City.  In line with international best practice, each project encompasses a range of activities to deliver integrated physical, social and economic regeneration, incorporating masterplanning, social inclusion interventions, and a planned mix of public and private investment in housing stock, infrastructure and facilities.  Generally, the programme is reviewed on an annual basis in the context of finalising funding allocations, with new projects added and additional elements of existing projects advanced, as resources permit.  The timing and duration of the individual elements vary over the lifetime of the project.  I intend to announce funding allocations for the 2010 programme shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1491">The following table presents an overview of the regeneration programme and the stage of each project.  The table also includes details in relation to a number of projects which were previously expected to be progressed through the Dublin PPP Regeneration Programme — it is a matter for Dublin City Council, in the first instance, to consider how to proceed with other projects formerly within that programme.  In addition, in the light of changes in the housing market, a number of affordable housing projects, which had been earmarked to proceed by PPP arrangements, are not now to proceed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1526">Meeting the requirements of the landfill directive is a key national priority in respect of waste management and I am committed to implementing the measures necessary to ensure that Ireland meets the 2010, and subsequent, EU landfill diversion targets.  Data from the National Waste Report 2008, published by the EPA, show that the quantity of biodegradable municipal waste disposed to landfill decreased by 19% in 2008 to approximately 1.2 million tonnes, which leaves Ireland requiring to divert a further 280,000 tonnes in order to meet the first landfill directive target due in July 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1527">In December 2009 I signed the Waste Management (Food Waste) Regulations 2009, which are designed to promote the segregation and beneficial use of food waste arising in the commercial sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">Also in December, I increased the landfill levy by the currently permitted annual maximum of €5 per tonne to €25 per tonne and I intend to increase it to €30 from 1 February 2010.  This will begin to address the race to the bottom in landfill gate fees, which we are now witnessing and which acts as a barrier to achieving the diversion targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1529">I intend to publish a Bill on levies generally and this will provide for further substantial increases in the landfill levy.  The Bill will also address the extension of levies to other waste facilities.</p>

            <p eId="para_1533">The National Waste Report 2008, published by the EPA, provides the latest data in this regard.  The separate kerbside collection of household food and garden waste in brown bins increased substantially from 18,705 tonnes in 2007 to 37,920 tonnes in 2008 and I would expect to see further increases in 2009 and into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1534">The number of local authority areas where household brown bin waste was collected at kerbside increased from 13 in 2007 to 16 in 2008 mainly due to private operators offering the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1535">A comprehensive circular letter (WPPR 17/08) issued to each local authority in July 2008 requesting that appropriate steps be taken to support an accelerated roll out of segregated collections for organic waste ('brown bins') both to domestic households and to commercial organisations.  Such bins could be provided directly by local authorities where the local authorities remain in the business of waste collection or, alternatively, utilising the existing waste collection permitting system where the service is provided by the private sector.

            <p eId="para_1540">I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 292 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1541">It is the responsibility of the relevant water services authority to deliver quality public water supplies to meet current and future needs.  My Department co-ordinates and finances a major programme of investment in improved drinking water supply infrastructure, on which some €1.8 billion has been invested by the Government in the period 2000-2009.  Substantial funding of €508 million is being provided this year from the Exchequer for the provision of water services infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1542">This level of investment continues to reflect the priority assigned by Government to meeting EU standards for drinking water and providing critical water supply infrastructure, which has seen additional drinking water treatment capacity and additional drinking water storage capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of 855,000 and 1.5 million, respectively, provided in the period 2000 — 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1543">The recent weather has pointed up the need to sustain our efforts in the provision of water services infrastructure and, in particular, the replacement and rehabilitation of older mains which were damaged during the cold spell.  A greater focus on such works will be a key priority of the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, which I expect to publish early this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1545">General-purpose grants from the Local Government Fund are the contribution that my Department makes to local authorities to meet the gap between the cost to them of providing a reasonable level of day-to-day services and the income they obtain from other sources.  A total of €870 million in General-Purpose Grants will be provided to local authorities from the Local Government Fund in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1546">It is a matter for each local authority to prioritise its spending, within the resources available to it, across the range of services it provides.  Equally, local authorities must ensure full value for money for the resources invested, and seek the maximum efficiency across their operations.  I am satisfied that the general purpose grant allocations I have provided for 2010, together with the income available from other sources, will enable local authorities to deal with the adverse winter weather conditions and continue to provide an acceptable level of service to their customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1547">In the last ten years a total of €1.8 billion has been invested by the Exchequer in providing new supply water infrastructure under the water services investment programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1548">Recent water services investment programmes have also included a specific sub-programme on water conservation.  Funding was provided to local authorities to put water management systems in place to monitor water use and losses throughout the supply networks, fix leaks and replace defective pipes where repair is no longer an economic option.  Exchequer spending on water conservation since 2003 amounted to €130 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1549">This investment provides the platform for intensive investment in mains rehabilitation which will be a key priority under the next water services investment programme for 2010 to 2012 which is currently being finalised in my Department.  In inviting local authorities to prepare needs assessments as an input to developing the new programme, the authorities were asked to prioritise key contracts and schemes in this area; and they will also be required to prioritise water conservation works as an alternative to new infrastructure provision.  A greater proportion of the funds available annually under the programme will be assigned specifically to water conservation works.</p>

            <p eId="para_1551">The Services Indicators in Local Authorities 2008 report, a copy of which is available from the Oireachtas Library, includes information on ‘Unaccounted for Water'' (UFW) in each local authority.  UFW includes leakage in addition to other factors including unauthorised connections, unmetered connections and metering errors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1552">My Department does not have figures for the "cost" of UFW.  This figure will vary from scheme to scheme depending on production cost, extent of UFW and any infrastructural cost incurred to compensate for the UFW.</p>
            <p eId="para_1553">Water conservation, which includes the management of water supply systems, active leakage control and mains rehabilitation, has been the focus of a specific sub-programme under my Department's Water Services Investment Programme.  It has led to reductions in the levels of water unaccounted for, improved knowledge of the condition of water distribution networks and consumption patterns, and an improvement in the level and quality of supply to consumers.  Since 2003, local authorities have spent over €130 million on these services with significant Exchequer support.  Water conservation works will be a key priority under the next investment programme, which will cover the period 2010-2012.  The metering of domestic connections will contribute to greater water conservation by facilitating enhanced network management by local authorities and a more sustainable approach to water use by domestic consumers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1556">To date, some 27 housing authorities and four approved housing bodies have had projects approved under the social housing leasing initiative.

            <p eId="para_1557">In the first instance, many authorities rightly focused on bringing into the leasing initiative unsold affordable housing which they already had on hands themselves.  In terms of rolling out the leasing initiative more widely, I am confident that there is a considerable quantum of suitable available vacant accommodation around the country which could be made available for leasing.  Given the work which my Department has undertaken to support the leasing initiative, including the preparation of standard legal documentation and its extension to include the voluntary and co-operative housing sector, and given the impact of the establishment of the National Assets Management Agency in terms of addressing uncertainty in the banking and property sectors, I am satisfied that a solid basis is being put in place to support increased delivery under the initiative this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1567">In the period 2008-2012, Ireland will meet its target for the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol through a series of national measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, supplemented as necessary by the purchase of carbon units on the international market. Government policy in this regard is set out in the National Climate Chance Strategy 2007-2013 and, for the purpose of purchasing carbon units as required, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has been designated as purchasing agent for the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1568">The total cost of purchasing carbon units for Kyoto compliance purposes in the commitment period 2008-2012 is estimated at €99.6 million.  This is made up of €73.7 million for credits already purchased by the NTMA and €25.9 million for credits to be delivered prior to 2012 from investments made in the Carbon Funds operated by the World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1569">In 2008 the NTMA purchased 3.455m carbon credits at a cost of some €52.1 million.  In 2009, they purchased 1.8m units at a cost of some €21.6 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">The economic downturn has implications for the carbon credit purchasing programme.  Recent EPA projections suggest that, with full implementation of all announced emission reduction measures, sufficient carbon units may already have been purchased or contracted for, to meet our Kyoto commitments.  In these circumstances, the NTMA has been asked to put its purchasing programme on hold for the foreseeable future.  Purchasing requirements are being kept under review and will be revised as necessary in the light of future projections.</p>

            <p eId="para_1572">The Government's policy on staffing and numbers in the public sector, including local government, is to ensure that overall staffing levels are significantly reduced. Together with the existing recruitment moratorium, three further schemes to support this objective were announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement of 7 April 2009 — the incentivised scheme of early retirement, the special incentive career break scheme and the shorter working year scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1573">The purpose of the incentivised scheme of early retirement scheme was to facilitate the permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff serving in the local authorities.  Figures supplied by the local authorities, indicate that 300 local authority employees applied for the scheme, of whom 272 have been approved and have completed the necessary documentation.  The majority of these 272 employees have already retired from employment, with the remainder scheduled to leave in 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_1575">The purpose of the shorter working year scheme is to permit local authority employees to balance their working arrangements with outside commitments.

The application period and the scheme itself are currently open ended and applicants are free to apply for the scheme at any time.

            <p eId="para_1577">Despite the challenges currently faced in the housing sector, significant levels of activity have been achieved under the range of housing supports funded by my Department in recent years.  Through these, the accommodation needs of over 20,200 households were met in 2008, an increase of 10% on corresponding figure of 18,300 in 2007.  Final data in respect of 2009 are not yet available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1578">Meeting housing need remains a high priority for the Government.  While ensuring that we can deliver across the full range of needs, the scale and composition of the public housing programme in the years ahead will be dependent on a number of factors, including the level of available funding and the evolution of the housing market generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1579">I am determined to ensure that the overall delivery programme is framed in a manner which continues to optimise the way in which needs are met.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the available Exchequer supports to prevailing market conditions, and explore alternative solutions to address needs, having full regard to the sustainable communities philosophy outlined in the Government's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1580">To this end, the range of delivery mechanisms continues to be adapted and expanded.  For example, last year, I introduced a new social housing leasing initiative, under which in excess of 1,900 units were sourced in 2009 and through which I expect a substantial number of units to be provided in the years ahead to meet housing needs, estimated at just over 56,000 households in the 2008 housing needs assessment.  This, together with the rental accommodation scheme, complements the traditional capital funded programmes operated through local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1581">I will be keeping the leasing initiative and all the other housing programmes under ongoing review to ensure that they are appropriately geared towards meeting the maximum level of housing need.</p>
            <p eId="para_1582">In relation to affordable housing, rather than setting targets for delivery, the emphasis this year, having regard to developments in the housing market, will be on continuing to progress measures to ensure the most effective deployment of already delivered but unsold affordable homes, including their use for social housing purposes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1584">The number of households on a local authority's waiting list continuously fluctuates as households on the list are allocated housing and new households apply for housing support.

            <p eId="para_1585">A statutory assessment of housing need is carried out every three years by all housing authorities in accordance with the terms of the Housing Act 1988.  The last assessment took place in 2008 and indicated that there were 56,249 households in need of social housing support.  Further information regarding the assessment, including a breakdown of housing need figures by housing authority, is available on my Department's website at <i> www.environ.ie.</i>

A higher grant of up to €5,714 may be payable where the house is situated on certain specified islands off the west and south coasts.  In the case of medical card holders, a grant of up to €6,350, or up to 80% of the approved cost, may be payable in respect of houses situated on the mainland, rising to €8,252 where the house is situated on a specified off-shore island.</p>

            <p eId="para_1590">My Department's housing capital programme has provided significant investment in the construction and acquisition of new social housing stock, as well as supporting major regeneration and remedial works schemes for existing housing stock, thereby ensuring that the overall social housing stock is not depleted.  From 1 January 2007, local authorities were given direct control in relation to their internal capital receipts from the sale of local authority dwellings, to be used primarily for extensive improvement works programmes, and on occasion, for additional stock.  My Department approves the overall annual programmes and it is the responsibility of individual local authorities to prioritise and advance the range of projects included in their programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1591">Section 13 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides that any moneys accruing to a housing authority from the sale of a dwelling owned by the authority "shall be accounted for by the housing authority in a separate account and, subject to the prior approval of the Minister, may be used for the provision of housing or for the refurbishment or maintenance of existing housing, or any other related purposes".  I have no plans, at present, to direct local authorities to ring-fence any such monies solely for the construction or acquisition of new units.  Sales of local authority dwellings have, in any event, shown a sharp decline over 2009 and the schemes for local authority sales of affordable housing units were designed to cover the costs of delivering the units, rather than to generate additional funds.</p>

            <p eId="para_1593">The amounts collected to date under the non-principal private residence charge and the net amounts pertaining to each local authority as at 15 January 2010 are detailed in the following table.  The net figures incorporate a reduction of approximately 1% on average to cover administration and transaction charges.  My Department does not have figures relating to amounts received by town councils, as under section 15 of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, the distribution of moneys in this regard is a matter for the relevant county council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1594">The non-principal private residence charge was originally estimated to bring in approximately €40 million in 2009, based on a conservative estimate of 200,000 liable properties in the State.  This figure was drawn from the 2006 Census and information supplied by the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).  I do not have a detailed breakdown of these estimates by local authority area.</p>

In conducting their assessments, local authorities were asked to prioritise schemes and contracts for progression over the coming years based on key environmental and economic criteria.  I expect to publish the Water Services Investment Programme 2010 to 2012 early this year.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_1708">The National Implementation Plan for the Government's Homeless Strategy, The Way Home, provides a robust framework to guide the action required at national level to end long term homelessness and the need to sleep rough by end 2010 through a series of priority actions and supporting measures, and promotes and supports effective implementation locally. At national level, a range of action is being taken to ensure that implementation of the Homeless Strategy is firmly underpinned by research, data and information, by a robust policy framework, adequate funding for homeless accommodation services, effective consultation and co-ordination structures and arrangements, comprehensive legislative provisions, and mechanisms for the provision of suitable accommodation with housing supports, as required. Practical achievement of the objectives of the Strategy will ultimately be determined primarily by the performance and effectiveness of action by relevant agencies at local level which, in future, will operate within the new statutory framework of structures and action plans provided for in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  An order to commence the relevant statutory provisions has been made bringing into force the homeless provisions with effect from 1 February 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">A new scheme of homes and support — "SLI" (Support to Live Independently) — was developed and details issued in July 2009. This will form an important element of action to end long term homelessness by providing suitable long-term accommodation in mainstream housing with appropriate supports to help people make a successful transition from homelessness to independent living. It involves the use of accommodation procured through the Social Housing Leasing Initiative or available to local authorities in the form of affordable housing that is unsold or considered unlikely to sell in the current market, along with availability of low to moderate level visiting supports, on a reducing basis for a period, to help homeless households address the challenges likely to arise in making the progression to independent living.</p>
            <p eId="para_1710">The new Social Housing Leasing Initiative which was introduced in February 2009 has widened the supply avenues available to local authorities to meet social housing need, and this combined with the supports available through the SLI scheme should improve the access of homeless households to long term housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1711">While particular effort to move people with low to medium needs to mainstream housing is proceeding because this will reduce demands on emergency facilities, the provision of appropriate facilities and supports for people with more intensive needs is also a priority, whether in the form of certain mainstream accommodation, long term supported accommodation or emergency accommodation for people with higher needs. The re-configuration of existing homeless services will result in extending the availability of long-term supported residential accommodation for people who are unable to live independently.</p>
            <p eId="para_1712">Exchequer funding available for homeless accommodation and related services is being maintained at a record level of €56m in 2010 notwithstanding the more constrained state of the public finances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1713">Local authorities were advised by my Department to take a proactive approach with regard to homeless people during the severe weather conditions and to ensure, as far as possible, that no person would be left vulnerable due to lack of availability of emergency accommodation, should the need arise. The Department agreed in advance proposals and funding for cold weather arrangements in a number of areas, including Dublin; issued an alert to all local authorities outside of Dublin regarding the need for vigilance, adequate arrangements, etc; and issued a general approval to all local authorities to extend opening hours, where necessary.  The Department is now considering how the good work done and information gained in the context of the recent cold weather efforts can be built on in order to accelerate progress towards achievement of the strategic objective of ending the need to sleep rough.</p>

            <p eId="para_1987">The Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) was established in April, 2004 as part of the Government's insurance reform programme, with the aim of allowing certain classes of personal injury claim, where liability is uncontested, to be settled without the need for the costs associated with litigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1988">PIAB has changed the personal injury claims process in a wholly positive way, with claimants' waiting time reduced, on average, by more than 27 months, from 3 years under the old system to 7 months, and overheads now reduced by some €50 million per annum.  Awards are made at the same levels as the Courts and according to a Book of Quantum published by PIAB in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1989">While the content and format of the PIAB website is a day-to-day matter for the Board itself, I understand that the estimator is a visual display of the information contained in the Book of Quantum and is representative of the range of values contained therein.

            <p eId="para_1991">Under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003, a function of the Board is to prepare and publish a Book of Quantum containing general guidelines as to the amounts that may be awarded or assessed in respect of specified types of injury.</p>
            <p eId="para_1992">The Book of Quantum was compiled by independent, internationally recognised consultants based on data from Courts, insurers and self-insured sectors and it was published in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1993">The Book of Quantum shows, for various injuries, the ranges of compensation to which people may be entitled. Through the use of the Book of Quantum the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) delivers assessments at the same level as those awarded by the Courts in a prompt and transparent manner at considerable savings and significantly quicker than the previous adversarial system.  Since its establishment it has been responsible for a significant reduction in the costs of insurance premiums.  This has been of significant benefit to consumers and businesses in Ireland.  I have no plans at this time for the Book to be reviewed.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_1995">FÁS Employment Services provides a range of services and supports to all Jobseekers, including Jobseekers who have been made redundant. Clients can register at one of the 71 local FÁS Employment Service offices nationwide, for on-site career guidance and job placement services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1996">Various initiatives have also been put in place to assist the growing number of redundant workers and the unemployed. In 2009, FÁS more than doubled the number of openings on its training and work experience courses to over 130,000 places. This was achieved by running a range of new short courses opening up free evening courses to the unemployed and providing a range of on-line blended (internet with tutor support) courses. As part of this process start-your-own-business training has been increased to assist redundant workers who may be interested in establishing their own business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1997">In addition to the FÁS provision the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) can provide support to the micro-enterprise sector in the start-up and expansion phases. The criteria under which financial assistance is available is based primarily on factors such as the sector of the economy in which an enterprise is operating or intends to operate and the size, or proposed size, of the enterprise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1998">Any individual who wishes to seek advice on setting up their own business can contact their local CEB to discuss what assistance may be available to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1999">In addition to the training and advice supports provided by FÁS and the CEBs the Department of Social and Family Affairs' Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA)  is aimed at encouraging people who are receiving social welfare payments to become self-employed. The Scheme provides a weekly payment for unemployed people who set up their own business. It allows these individuals to keep a portion of their social welfare payment for 2 years and is not subject to tax or Pay Related Social Insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2000">I should also mention that in addition to the aforementioned supports not for profit organizations such as First Step finance provide assistance and funding to microenterprises. Finally, I understand that a European Progress Microfinance Facility was approved by the European Parliament in December 2009 and is due to come into force in early 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_2002">The Community Youth Training Programme was introduced in the late 1980s and provided training for unemployed construction workers and time served apprentices to complete industry approved community based training projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2003">In 1993 the new Standards Based Apprenticeship Scheme was introduced which required apprentices to be registered with a FÁS approved employer, who has the range of work, range of equipment and skilled craftspersons to train apprentices in the relevant trades.</p>
            <p eId="para_2004">The Community Youth Training Programme as previously constituted would not provide the necessary range of work and skills development in a commercial environment to ensure that apprentices reach the minimum standard of skills, knowledge and competence required by Industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_2006">State assistance to small businesses in Ireland is provided through a number of State Agencies, including the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and Enterprise Ireland, through whom assistance is delivered directly to businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_2007">Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing micro-enterprises may qualify for financial support from the CEBs in the form of priming, expansion/development and feasibility/innovation grants.  In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow. All of the CEBs operate to the same criteria in relation to the assistance which they can offer i.e. they can support the establishment and/or the development of enterprises provided that the projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability and which over time may develop into strong exporting entities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2008">In order to more fully explore the range of options that may be available, individuals are advised to contact their local CEB to discuss their business needs with the relevant staff of the Board.

            <p eId="para_2169">For several years, the Office of Public Works has held a significant amount of valuable historical data on flood events occurring nationally over the past century.  These data are available on the Flood Hazard Maps website, <i>www.floodmaps.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2170">Following the Review of Flood Policy in 2004, the OPW was assigned lead agency responsibility for the management of flood risk.  Central to the policy is a Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, which focuses on the assessment of flood risk and the long-term planning of the flood risk management measures throughout the country, including non-structural and structural measures.  A constituent part of these risk assessments is reference to records of previous flooding events in each catchment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2171">The CFRAM Programme is being delivered through the CFRAM Studies, led by the OPW, and undertaken in partnership with local authorities, in consultation with stakeholders and the public.  The CFRAM Studies are comprehensive catchment-based studies focused on areas of potentially significant risk, for which detailed flood maps are produced and flood risk management measures are assessed.  These measures will be prioritised and set out in a Flood Risk Management Plan (FRMP).  The CFRAM Programme will, as well as delivering on national policy, meet the requirements of the 2007 EU ‘Floods' Directive.  The procurement process for the national programme of CFRAM Studies has been initiated, and the studies will commence in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2172">OPW is also undertaking a number of other flood risk management programmes, including:</p>
            <p eId="para_2173">Flood Hazard Mapping;</p>
            <p eId="para_2174">Flood Studies Update;</p>
            <p eId="para_2175">Strategic Hydro-Meteorological Review;</p>
            <p eId="para_2176">Research and Development.</p>
            <p eId="para_2177">These Programmes will assist in addressing existing and future flood risk by helping to focus on a series of measures regarding sustainable flood prevention, protection and mitigation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2179">Since the introduction of the Arterial Drainage Amendment Act, 1995, allowing the Office of Public Works to undertake urban flood relief projects to protect residential properties and businesses, approximately €200 million has been invested on capital projects in the intervening years, with over €112 million spent in the last five years alone.  Since 2003, OPW have completed schemes in Carrick-on-Suir, Co. Tipperary, Kilkenny City, Leixlip, Co. Kildare and on the River Dodder in Counties Meath and Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_2180">OPW has currently profiled expenditure in excess of €200 million on about fifteen major capital schemes from now to 2014, with a Budget allocation for 2010 of €50 million.  2010 will see the first phases of major schemes being completed in Clonmel, Co. Tipperary, Mallow, Co. Cork, Ennis, Co. Clare, Waterford City and Fermoy, Co. Cork.  Construction works will continue in 2010 on Schemes at Mornington, Co. Meath and the River Dodder in Dublin.  It is also planned to commence construction of the second phases of schemes in Clonmel, Mallow and Ennis in the first half of 2010, along with the scheme planned for Templemore, Co. Tipperary.</p>
            <p eId="para_2181">While these schemes are at construction, the detailed design and procurement processes for civil engineering contractors for the second phases of schemes in Waterford City and Fermoy will continue.  Other major schemes, which will be progressed through detailed design and procurement processes in 2010, include Arklow and Bray, both in Co. Wicklow.  In addition to all these schemes, it is hoped to commence construction on the main Drainage Scheme in Carlow Town, which includes a flood defence scheme for which OPW is providing funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_2182">All these schemes form the core of the investment planned over the next five years.  In parallel with the major schemes being progressed, a Minor Flood and Coastal Protection Works Programme was initiated in 2009 where OPW are providing funding for minor, localised flood relief work to be undertaken by local authorities.  An initial amount of €6m has been allocated for this in 2010.  This will be reviewed when all applications have been received from local authorities.</p>

The legislation does not include a definition of the term ‘the arts'.</p>
            <p eId="para_2267">Under the legislation, the Revenue Commissioners are required to make a determination as to whether or not a work has artistic or cultural merit before the exemption can be awarded.  The Commissioners are specifically required by the legislation to make their determination having regard to the Guidelines.  The Guidelines set out definitions of the terms original and creative, artistic merit and cultural merit.  They also set out specific criteria to be taken into account in making determinations relating to works of non-fiction and provide for exclusions from what is to be regarded as original and creative in respect of certain works (e.g. textbooks, works of journalism and functional or utilitarian works).  The Guidelines are available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie.</p>

While it may be possible, with the assistance of significant development to the existing computer-based databases and costing model, to produce income statistics for income tax based on individual earners, this is problematic for various reasons, in particular given the facility for married couples to transfer credits and, in part, the standard rate band.</p>

            <p eId="para_2328">I understand that the Deputy is referring to the corporation tax exemption that was introduced for new start-up companies in Section 31 of Finance (No. 2) Act 2008.  The provisions of that section provide for relief from corporation tax, for the first 3 years of operation, for companies incorporated on and from 14 October 2008 that commence to carry on a new trade in 2009.  The relief is granted by reducing the corporation tax on the profits of the new trade and on the gains from disposal of assets used for the purpose of the new trade to nil.  Full relief is available where the corporation tax otherwise payable by the company in respect of any of its first 3 years is €40,000 or less.  There is marginal relief where the corporation tax liability is between €40,000 and €60,000.  Where the corporation tax liability is €60,000 or over in any of the first three years, no relief is available for that year.  The extension of the scheme to companies that commence trading in 2010 was announced in Budget 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2329">The Deputy will be aware of the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation in relation to this exemption.  The Commission proposed that the exemption be extended to non corporates but that it should terminate in 2011. The scheme while still only available to corporates continues to be available for three years.  Therefore, new start-ups that commence trading in 2010 can continue to avail of the exemption up to and including 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2330">The tax exemption does not apply to partnerships, sole traders or to other non-corporates.  It is important that tax reliefs are targeted to the areas which have the potential to provide the best return.  The incentive aims to encourage new entrepreneurial activities in the productive sectors of our economy and provide opportunities for increased employment in those sectors.  To make it available on a broader basis would in all likelihood make it more costly without delivering a return commensurate with the increased cost.</p>

            <p eId="para_2334">The position is that tax law provides that employees and office holders may claim a tax deduction in respect of: (a) the cost of travelling expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of their employment or office; and (b) the cost of other expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment or office.</p>
            <p eId="para_2335">As regards an expenses claim under (b) above, I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that, in strictness, each employee or office holder should submit his or her individual expenses claim to Revenue.  However, by way of long standing practice stretching back over 40 years, the expenses deduction due for certain categories of employee are, for administrative ease, agreed between Revenue and the relevant representative bodies.  These agreed rates of expenses are granted to individuals in their determination of tax credits for PAYE purposes and have become known as "flat rate expenses".</p>
            <p eId="para_2336">Therefore, some employees obtain their statutory tax deduction in respect of expenses via the administrative "flat rate expenses" regime whilst others obtain their tax deduction on foot of an individual claim submitted to the Revenue Commissioners.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the cost to the Exchequer of the tax deduction in respect of expenses (other than expenses of travel and subsistence) incurred by employees for the income tax year 2006, the most recent year for which final information is available, is estimated at about €70 million.  It is not clear what savings, if any, would result in the abolition of the "flat rate expenses" regime as it would still be open to employees to claim their expenses in the normal way in accordance with the relevant tax legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2344">As the Deputy is aware, the Act was introduced in the context of the widely accepted need to give priority to the stabilisation of the public finances and to reflect the substantial benefits generally available to staff under public service pension terms.</p>

The Government has allocated €50M for this area in 2010 and construction works on about twelve major projects will continue throughout this year as well as taking other projects through the various stages of development.  A significant amount of the allocation will be spent on the Minor Flood and Coastal Protection Works Programme where OPW will provide funding to local authorities to undertake such localised flood relief work themselves.  An initial amount of €6m has been allocated for this in 2010.  This may be reviewed when all applications have been received from local authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_2401">In the aftermath of the severe flooding of November 2009, the Government undertook a number of initiatives to address the situation.  The most pressing issue at the time was to provide assistance to those immediately affected and also to assist the Local Authorities in the post-flood clean-up.  An initial sum of €10m was provided for a Humanitarian Aid Scheme, which is administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, to alleviate the hardship caused.  The Government also indicated that further funding would be made available, if required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2402">A further €2m was allocated for a targeted Fodder Aid Scheme to be administered by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to assist farmers who were experiencing a fodder shortage, which might have led to financial hardship and potential animal welfare issues on affected farms.  Funding of €14m was provided by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for the post-flood clean-up by Local Authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2403">In addition to these immediate initiatives, the Government has allocated €50m for flood risk management activities for 2010, which is administered by the Office of Public Works.  This increased allocation will allow OPW to extend the number of Capital Works schemes already underway throughout the country.  Within the overall allocation, I have also announced an increase for Minor Flood and Coastal Protection Works to be undertaken by Local Authorities in 2010.  This Programme, which I initiated in 2009, has been increased initially to €6m, and is to cater for works or studies which can be completed in 2010.  OPW is currently seeking applications from Local Authorities, and, when the applications are received and evaluated, the allocation may be reviewed.</p>

            <p eId="para_2546">The information requested by the Deputy is set out in tabular form and is based on information reported to my Department to date.  In summary, the information reported to my Department to date indicates that some 1,106 Civil Servants have applied for the Incentivised Scheme for Early Retirement (ISER) and that 985 Civil Servants have had their applications approved to date.  These Civil Service numbers are based on returns from all Departments and Offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2547">In the wider public service, some 1,147 Public Servants have applied for the ISER and some 649 Public Servants have had their applications approved to date.  The processing of applications under the ISER was suspended in the Health Sector as a result of a direction by IMPACT and some other health unions to their members not to cooperate with redeployment.</p>

Taking account of overheads, the total estimated spend on the scheme will be in the region of €465m. Given that €448m, has already been provided to the scheme up to the 31st December 2009, the HSE estimate that additional funding in the sum of €17m will be required in 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_2763">In his Supplementary Budget Statement of 7 April 2009,  the Minister for Finance announced that he would make available three schemes to reduce the number of public sector employees in the wider public sector , one of which was the <i>Incentivised Scheme for Early Retirement.</i>   My Department issued a circular (8/2009) on 15 May 2009 to give effect to this measure in HSE and other public health sector employment, including this employment. The closing date for receipt of applications for this scheme was 23rd October, 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2764">The scheme did not apply to grades exempted from the moratorium on recruitment and promotions under the 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector, in order to meet the requirements of integrated health care delivery and, in particular, to address needs in the community in respect of care of the elderly and people with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2765">Members of all other grades who meet the eligibility criteria had access to this scheme provided the grades/staff groups concerned cooperate with the requirements in relation to redeployment, mobility, skill mix and flexibility which are outlined in the employment control framework: this is designed to allow individuals to avail of this scheme while still protecting services.  Because staff who avail of the scheme will not be replaced (save in very exceptional cases), employers were required to pay particular attention, when considering applications, to the scope that exists within the organisation for reorganising and restructuring work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  Staff cooperation and flexibility in that regard was essential.  My Department was informed that the health service trade unions  issued a directive instructing their members not to cooperate with redeployment and reassignment requests from management.  The unions have stated their opposition to the moratorium on recruitment and promotions as set out in 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector, referred to above. This instruction from the unions which remains in place, severely restricts the ability of management to organise/restructure work practice and contravenes the qualification criteria for the scheme.  As a result, the HSE suspended all three schemes in June but continued to accept applications, up to the closing date of 23 October 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2766">The HSE recently requested my Department's approval to lift the suspension as it applied to the ISER, and to allow it to proceed to process to finalisation applications received prior to the closing date. This request is currently being considered by my Department in consultation with the Department of Finance.</p>

            <p eId="para_2770">The information requested by the Deputy in respect of the number of bodies and agencies operated under the remit of my Department, the cost of each on a yearly basis, and the name and number that have been abolished in the past four years is being compiled by my Department and will be forwarded to the deputy when available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2771">With regard to the number of agencies that have been amalgamated, the position is that the Government's programme of rationalisation of agencies in the health sector has been actively progressed by my Department and considerable progress has been made in implementing the programme to date. The primary aim of this ambitious programme is to streamline service delivery, professional registration and policy making in a number of areas in the health sector, through the integration and/or amalgamation of functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2772">The progress to date is as follows.  The Post Graduate Medical &amp; Dental Board was successfully rationalised into the HSE on 1st January, 2009. The  National Council on Aging &amp; Older People and the Women's Health Council were successfully subsumed into the Department of Health and Children in 2009.  The Crisis Pregnancy Agency was subsumed into HSE in January 2010 and  the Drug Treatment Centre Board is due to follow early in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2773">Legislation is required to facilitate the rationalization of the Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council, the National Social Work Qualifications Board and the Opticians Board into the Health &amp; Social Care Professionals Council. It is envisaged that the legislation will be finalised during 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2774">The Government approved the inclusion of provisions in the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2009 to disestablish the Children Acts Advisory Board (CAAB) and to subsume some of its functions into the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on an administrative basis. The Bill was published on 16th September 2009 and it is expected that the Bill will be brought forward in 2010. It is intended that the CAAB staff will move to the Department on an administrative basis until such time as the Bill is enacted.</p>
            <p eId="para_2775">Legislation is already in place to facilitate the rationalisation of the National Cancer Screening Service into the HSE in mid 2010 and arrangements are underway in this regard.  The dissolution of the National Cancer Registry and the transfer of its staff to the HSE will be dealt with under the Health Information Bill.  Legislation is required to merge the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery and assign its responsibilities to An Bord Altranais and the Health Service Executive. The new Nurses and Midwives Bill has been drafted and Government approval will be sought regarding the text of the Bill and seeking permission to publish the Bill in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_2784">The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and regulations made thereunder regulate and control the import, export, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the Schedules to the Act. Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with Ireland's obligations under international conventions and/or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2785">Items available for sale in so-called ‘head shops', including those containing the chemical Mephedrone, and which are often referred to as ‘legal highs', are substances which are not currently controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation. The list of scheduled substances is kept under ongoing review. For example, in 2006 psychotropic (‘magic') mushrooms, which were on sale in such outlets, were banned and their possession and sale is now illegal. On 31 March 2009, BZP was similarly subjected to legislative control measures and criminal sanctions.  Minister John Curran, Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, who has responsibility for co-ordinating the National Drugs Strategy, has identified head shops as an area of concern, and is currently considering the options available to more effectively control the activities of head shops.</p>
            <p eId="para_2786">Under the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, a Research Advisory Group has been established to identify possible options for the regulation of headshops. The Department of Health and Children is actively participating in this process. In the UK, legislation was introduced immediately before Christmas to control a number of substances and groups of substances that have been on sale in headshops. The Department is currently reviewing this legislation to ascertain how similar controls could be introduced in Ireland. The Misuse of Drugs legislation is the most appropriate regulatory framework for regulating substances such as Mephedrone that have the potential to be abused.</p>

            <p eId="para_2810">The Adoption Bill, 2009, is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are  effected in the best interests of the child.

            <p eId="para_2811">The current policy position, as set out in the Adoption Bill 2009, is that for an adoption to be registered under the Bill it must be effected in a contracting State to the Hague Convention or in a country with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement.

            <p eId="para_2823">I propose to take Questions Nos. 139, 141, 142 and 144 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2824">The way to provide the best possible paediatric tertiary care most effectively involves the creation of one single national paediatric hospital, alongside a major teaching hospital, bringing together all the medical and nursing expertise for complex conditions.  The concept of bringing together all three present services is widely accepted.</p>
            <p eId="para_2825">The development of the National Paediatric Hospital is a priority project for the Government.  Rawlinson Kelly &amp; Whittlestone Ltd (RKW), an established UK-based health care planning company, were commissioned to prepare a high level framework brief for the new paediatric hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_2826">The Brief was to include advice on the preferred model of care, on the core services to be delivered at the new hospital, and on the additional range of services to be provided outside of the main hospital. It was also to include an assessment of the range of services to be provided through the urgent/ambulatory care service, and on the preferred location(s) for this service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2827">The Brief considered a number of potential locations using the following criteria: access and travel times, critical mass, staffing implications and available infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2828">Among RKW's findings, which were announced by the HSE on 31st October, 2007, was that a network of Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centres should be established and operated by the new hospital.  The first of these should be developed at Tallaght.  The services to be provided will include urgent care consultations, outpatient appointments and day surgery.</p>
            <p eId="para_2829">The project is proceeding as planned and is being overseen by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board which was established in May, 2007. The HSE is working closely with the Board in progressing the project, which is scheduled for completion and commissioning in 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_2830">Services at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, National Children's Hospital Tallaght and the Children's University Hospital Temple Street will transfer to the new National Paediatric Hospital.  Pending completion of the project, and to ensure the best possible services for children, the HSE will continue to finance the provision and development of services at each of the transferring hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2831">The real challenge in paediatrics is to maximise the efficient use of all our healthcare capacity both in Dublin and across the country.  Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght paediatric services need to be increasingly working in a coordinated, shared and efficient fashion to prepare for the eventual coming together of the three institutions into one national paediatric hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_2832">I have been in contact with the CEO of the HSE and the CEO's of the three hospitals involved and have asked them to have governance arrangements put in place ahead of the opening of the new National Paediatric Hospital for the unified management of the services for children, provided by these hospitals, which will form the basis of the new hospital. In this context the HSE is actively pursuing ways in which services across the three hospitals can best be coordinated, to avoid unnecessary duplication and to achieve savings that can be put back into patient care.  A Paediatric Hospitals Operations Group has now been established for ongoing network management and enhanced integration of the three paediatric hospitals in advance of the transfer to the new paediatric hospital.</p>

         if extra funding will be made available to Cork County Council to help to address the need for road repairs in the aftermath of the November 2009 flooding and the recent extreme weather in December 2009 and January 2010; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3089">The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  The carrying out of works on these roads is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_3090">When Exchequer grants for regional and local roads are allocated each year, my Department does not hold back a reserve allocation, at central level, to deal with weather contingencies.  Holding back such an allocation would mean a reduction in the road grant allocations made to all local authorities at the beginning of each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3091">The allocations made to local authorities are inclusive of a weather risk factor.  Local authorities are expressly advised in the annual road grants circular letter that they should set aside contingency sums from their overall regional and local roads resources to finance necessary weather related works.  The amount of money provided in the 2010 Estimates for funding regional and local roads is €411.177 million and this year's allocation will be based on that amount.</p>
            <p eId="para_3092">I have, however, asked local authorities, including Cork County Council, to provide details of exceptional road related costs associated with the November 2009 flooding and recent prolonged severe weather, which fall outside the normal financial provision for winter maintenance. I will have regard to this information when deciding on the 2010 regional and local road grant allocations.  I will announce these grant allocations by mid February 2010 at the latest.</p>

In 2009, Mayo County Council undertook necessary reinstatement works to address damage to roads caused by flooding in July of that year. The council has submitted applications for regional and local road funding in 2010, including funding for works necessitated by the July 2009 flooding.  Regional and local road grant allocations for 2010 are being considered at present and I will announce these grant allocations by mid February 2010 at the latest.</p>

            <p eId="para_3312">In the first instance, I should clarify that the statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads, is vested in the National Roads Authority (NRA) under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended). Under section 64 of the Act the non-payment of a toll can be  dealt with under either civil or criminal law. This section provides that toll bye-laws made by the NRA in accordance with section 61 of the Act may allow an amount known as a "default toll" to be imposed for the non-payment or late payment of a toll. This section also provides that the default toll may take into account administrative costs in charging and collecting the toll.</p>
            <p eId="para_3313">The system has been carefully designed to act as an effective deterrent to toll evasion. It offers road users significant time to settle their debt and default tolls are imposed on a progressive scale.  Road users have more than two months to pay the toll before court action can be initiated.</p>

            <p eId="para_3317">The Department funds the general administrative expenses of the following agencies and the estimates costs in 2008 and 2009 are set out as follows.  Eight bodies in total have been abolished in the past 4 years.  The Dublin Transportation office replaced by the National Transport Authority on 1st December 2009.  Seven Harbour Authorities established under the Harbours Act 1946 have been abolished since 2006.  Sligo, Annagassan, River Moy, Youghal, Kilrush and Westport harbours have transferred to local authority control and Dingle has been designated a Fishery Harbour Centre. There are six remaining Harbour Authorities under the Harbours Act 1946. Current policy is to transfer responsibility for these to local authorities l or to amalgamate them with State owned port companies. It is hoped that a number of these transfers will take place in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_3318">In compliance with the Government's decision of October 2008, the Air Accident Investigation Unit of the Department of Transport, the Railway Accident Investigation Unit of the Railway Safety Commission and the Marine Casualty Investigation Board will be administratively merged in mid-2010 to form the Irish Accident Investigation Office as an Executive Office under the aegis of the Department of Transport. Legislation to underpin the new arrangements is expected to be introduced in the Oireachtas in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_3319">It is also my intention to amalgamate the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the regulatory functions of the Irish Aviation Authority with the planned new National Transport Authority.  Detailed proposals to implement the decision are currently being considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_3320">In line with the McCarthy Report proposals, consideration is been given to the merging of the National Roads Authority and the Railway Procurement Agency and this will be progressed during 2010. The Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 provides for the dissolution of the Commission for Taxi Regulation by the Minister at the request of the National Transport Authority and for the transfer of the staff, functions, duties and ongoing responsibilities of the Commission to the Authority. This will be progressed on receipt of a request from the Authority.</p>

Therefore, it is not possible to say at present what the take-up of funding under the 2009 programme will be.  As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 346 of 9 June last, the present call for applications is directed at local authorities, other public bodies, NGOs and other relevant organisations and not just at NGOs and partnership companies as was the case with the previous call.  In view of the availability of funds from the 2008 allocation, it was decided to invite groups being assisted from the fund to seek additional resources to continue their projects from 31 December 2009 to no later than 30 June 2010, which is the end of the extended eligibility period, as I explained in my reply to Question No. 346 of 9 June last.

            <p eId="para_3497">I can inform the Deputy that, based on the current information available to me in relation to the recently concluded financial year 2009, the following community organisations based in south Tipperary have received funding in 2009 from my Department approximating €308,000: Aiséirí Cahir: €85,000; Clonmel Youth Training, €90,000; EDGE — Garda Youth Diversion Project, €95,400; South Tipperary Traveller Men's Development Project, €29,000; Integrate Carrick, €700; Three Drives Family Resource Centre, €300; South Tipperary Sports Partnership, €1,000; and Clonmel Community Partnership, €6,700.  I would also like to inform the Deputy that funding allocated by my Department to any Linkage, MOVE or PACE projects within the South Tipperary area has not been included in the above figure, as these projects are based nationwide and it is not possible to provide a break down of such project funding for South Tipperary alone.  The total funding received nationwide by these projects in 2009 was €2,955,000.</p>

            <p eId="para_3511">The Irish Prison Service is developing and rolling out a fully co-ordinated Integrated Sentence Management system (ISM) across all prisons and places of detention.  ISM involves a new emphasis on prisoners taking greater personal responsibility for their own development through active engagement with both specialist and non-specialist services in the prisons.  The end result will be a prisoner-centred approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress.  ISM was first introduced on a pilot basis in Arbour Hill and Wheatfield prisons.  During 2009,  it was extended to additional numbers of prisoners in these prisons and was also initiated in the Training Unit and the Midlands Prison. Preparatory work also commenced in St. Patrick's Institution. Altogether over 200 prisoners have participated in ISM to date. Parallel work on a range of necessary system supports such as the development of an IT database and staff training is ongoing.  It is envisaged that ISM will be consolidated in these five prisons in 2010, with approximately 500 prisoners participating by the end of the year.  ISM will continue to be rolled out to all other institutions on a phased basis, subject to the availability of resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_3513">Section 36 of the Prisons Act, 2007, which was brought into operation on 1 May, 2007, makes it an offence for prisoners to have unauthorised possession of or use of mobile telecommunication devices.  Under the Act it is also an offence to supply such a device to a prisoner.  The penalties for such an offence, on summary conviction, include a fine not exceeding €5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, and on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both.  It is Irish Prison Service policy to report and hand over seizures of mobile phones to the Garda.  Cell and area searches for contraband such as mobile phones take place in all prisons on a daily basis.  These include random, targeted and intelligence led searches.  These searches have been particularly effective and local intelligence indicates that the availability of mobile phones has decreased across the prison system.  Details of mobile seizures are set out in the table below and it is important to note that a large percentage of these seizures are not directly from prisoners but are instead retrieved at entry point or before they get to the prisoner population.  This is as a direct consequence of newly introduced security measures including a airport style scanners and x-ray machines, which are in operation at the entrances of all the relevant closed prisons.  Details of mobile seizures for 2009 and figures to 17 January 2010 are set out in the following table:</p>

The penalties for such an offence, on summary conviction, include a fine not exceeding €5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, and on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both. It is Irish Prison Service policy to report and hand over seizures of mobile phones to the Garda.  As of 20 January 2010, there are 53 people serving sentences for this offence.  Cell and area searches for contraband such as mobile phones take place in all prisons on a daily basis.  These include random, targeted and intelligence led searches.  These searches have been particularly effective and local intelligence indicates that the availability of mobile phones has decreased across the prison system.</p>

            <p eId="para_3581">I am informed by the Garda authorities that the telephone help line referred to by the Deputy was set up following the publication of the report of the Commission of Investigation into Child Sexual Abuse in the Dublin Archdiocese on 26 November last.  A dedicated telephone line with voicemail facility was installed in the office of the Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services, Harcourt Square, and was continuously monitored by a dedicated call taker and personnel at the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit.  I am also informed that after the first week following the installation of the help line there was a marked reduction in the number of calls being received.  A decision was therefore taken to alter the period during which the help line was staffed to between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday to Friday.  Any person who was unable to get through to the call taker and who left a voice mail message was called back.  Following a subsequent further reduction in the number of calls to the help line, it was decided that the voice mail facility would be utilised full-time, checked on a regular basis, and any caller who had left a message would be responded to.  The situation is being kept under review.  The Garda authorities are not aware of any calls not being responded to and, if the Deputy has any further information in that regard, I will be happy to have it examined.</p>

The sole member of the tribunal is His Honour Judge Peter Smithwick.  The total cost of the tribunal to 31 December 2009 (the latest date for which figures are available) is €6.09 million.  The tribunal is in its investigative phase at present and it is not, therefore, possible to say when it will conclude its work.  Neither is it possible at this point to indicate the final cost.  The tribunal of inquiry into complaints concerning some gardaí of the Donegal Division has concluded.

Full details of estimates associated with all the bodies concerned are contained in the Abridged Estimates Volume for Public Services 2010.  The costs associated with these bodies for earlier years are contained in the Revised Estimates for Public Services for each of the years concerned.  Copies of the Abridged Estimates Volume for Public Services and the Revised Estimates for Public Services are available at <i>www.finance.irlgov.ie</i> and in the Oireachtas Library.  With regard to the abolition or amalgamation of bodies and agencies operated under the remit of my Department, I can inform the Deputy that the Garda Síochána Complaints Board and the Garda Síochána Complaints Appeal Board were established under the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act 1986.  The board ceased to accept new complaints when the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission opened its doors on 9 May 2007 and its staff and resources have steadily declined in line with its reduced workload.  It continues, however, to have responsibility for a number of complaints which were already being investigated under its remit at that time.  While most of these have been finalised, a number of them are the subject of ongoing litigation.  When this work has been completed the then Minister will, under powers conferred on her/him by the Garda Síochána Act 2005, by order repeal the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act 1986.  The National Crime Council ceased operation in October 2008.  The Remembrance Commission’s term of appointment came to an end on 31 October 2008.  Government funding to the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism ceased at the end of 2008.  Some of its functions have been absorbed into the Office of the Minister for Integration.  From June 2009, in line with the Budget Decision, secretarial support for the Classification of Films Appeal Board, the Censorship of Publications Board and the Censorship of Publications Appeal Board are provided by the Irish Film Classification Office.  Subject to the enactment of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008 and the commencement of relevant provisions therein, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner will cease to exist in 2010 and its functions will be subsumed into my Department.  The Refugee Appeals Tribunal will be replaced by the Protection Review Tribunal at the same time.  My Department is actively examining where common services or other resources can be shared to obtain efficiencies and reduce costs.</p>

            <p eId="para_3630">The Government re-affirmed its commitment to developing a new prison campus at Thornton Hall, Kilsallaghan, County Dublin and also approved the launch of a new tendering process for the construction of a more affordable and better value prison campus at Thornton. The aim is to provide good quality, regime focussed prison accommodation with appropriate support and rehabilitative facilities for prisoners to prepare them for re-integration back into society. The new prison facility will provide accommodation for 1,400 prisoners with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 in a range of security settings.</p>
            <p eId="para_3631">The development is now proceeding on a phased basis with phase one comprising essential enabling works required for the development including the construction of the dedicated access road, perimeter wall and off-site services. Tenders for the construction of the access road will be issued in March of this year.  A tender competition for the construction of the perimeter wall of the prison will issue mid-Summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_3632">An EU wide tender competition for the appointment of technical advisors to the Irish Prison Service is already in progress. The Irish Prison Service is being assisted in this process by the National Development Finance Agency.

She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.

The Dublin II Regulation, (Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003), is intended to prevent the phenomenon of ‘asylum shopping' across Europe and sets out criteria for determining which Regulation State is responsible for examining an asylum application where applications have been lodged in more than one Regulation State or whereby an asylum seeker has been granted a visa to enter another Regulation State and has entered that other State before entering Ireland and making an asylum application here.  At the same time, it guarantees applicants that one State will process their application, thereby preventing the creation of ‘refugees in orbit', a situation which had previously pertained in Europe.</p>

In other cases, citizenship depends on whether the parent was legally resident in the island of Ireland for an aggregate period of at least three years in the four years prior to the birth of the child.  In accordance with the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004, evidence of lawful residence in the State by one or both parents must be provided.  In cases where a parent is a national of the EU, EEA or Swiss Confederation, a declaration may be made regarding the period of residence.

            <p eId="para_4055">The entire world has been deeply moved by the plight of the Haitian people following last week's earthquake. The devastation which it has wrought is almost beyond belief and the impact on peoples' lives has been made all the worse by the levels of poverty experienced by most Haitians.</p>
            <p eId="para_4056">Casualties from the earthquake are believed to be in the tens, if not hundreds, of thousands and widespread destruction of infrastructure has been reported, including to schools and hospitals. Water and electricity supplies are down, and there is very limited communication.  Immediately following the earthquake the Government announced it would contribute €2 million to the international relief effort in Haiti. This includes €1 million in response to an urgent UN appeal, with the remainder channelled via NGOs such as Concern, Goal and Trócaire, with whom we are in close contact. €250,000 has already been disbursed to the Red Cross.</p>
            <p eId="para_4057">This funding forms part of a €122 million humanitarian response by the European Union, agreed at an emergency meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council which I attended on Monday of this week.  In addition, on Monday evening Ireland dispatched over 80 tonnes of essential humanitarian supplies to Haiti from our emergency stockpiles. These include plastic sheeting, blankets, kitchen sets, soap, and water containers sufficient for 8000 families, which will be distributed by Concern and Goal. This is one of the largest direct provisions of supplies funded by Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_4058">We have also deployed two members of our Rapid Response Corps, a 130-strong group of highly-skilled volunteers available at short notice to humanitarian organisations in need of their skills. The two concerned, and IT expert and an electrical engineer, have been assigned to the World Food Programme. Others, with skills in areas such as logistics, water and sanitation and child protection are on stand-by.</p>
            <p eId="para_4059">A small technical team made up of Irish Aid staff with experience in the humanitarian field and in Haiti itself, as well as a representative from the Defence Forces, has also been dispatched to Haiti. The team will report to me on how Ireland can best contribute to the international relief effort.  Beyond the Government response, the Irish people have demonstrated their characteristic generosity in supporting appeals from a range of NGOs and UN agencies. This has been mirrored across the globe and reflects the will of the international community to respond to the immediate humanitarian needs of the Haitian people.  The Government will ensure that Ireland continues to participate fully in this international effort and I would urge people to continue to make their own personal contribution by supporting the appeals of the relief agencies.</p>

The original intention of the legislation was, inter alia, to create an environment in which the Arts could flourish and to encourage Irish artists on modest incomes to remain here rather than going abroad to earn their living.  I am in favour of this scheme and made my views known to the Minister for Finance prior to the Budget in December last.  I was pleased to note that this scheme has remained largely intact following the December Budget announcements.  My Department, the Arts Council and the Revenue Commissioners will complete their review of the schemes guidelines, for my consideration and that of the Minister for Finance, shortly.</p>

In this context, my Department has set up no such task force since it was established in June 2002 and consequently there are no associated reports.  However, for the sake of completeness, I have asked my Department to collate details of any other substantive reports (i.e. reports other than internal reports, assessments, audits, etc) commissioned during the period referred to and to forward the relevant information directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_4209">I propose to take Questions Nos. 238, 239 and 240, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4210">Following the recent Budget, adjustments have been made to payments and allowances under the Rural Social Scheme (RSS) to reflect the adjustments made to social welfare payments. The payments under the RSS from 2007 to 2010 are set out in the following table.</p>
            <p eId="para_4211">While other allowances may be payable to RSS participants by other Departments/Agencies in certain circumstances e.g. Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance, no such allowances are paid directly to RSS participants in respect of clothing, boots, shoes, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_4212">Since the inception of the RSS in 2004, a materials grant to cover ancillary costs such as travel and health &amp; safety equipment has been paid to the Implementing Bodies who administer the Scheme at local level on behalf of my Department. This grant was paid at the weekly rate of €15.24 per participant per week up to 2008.  In 2009, in the context of the availability of resources, the materials grant was set at €11.63 per participant per week.  In this context, the Deputy should note that guidance was issued to the Implementing Bodies to prioritise essentials such as health &amp; safety requirements. This could include safety clothing and boots for participants, where appropriate.</p>

Expressions of interest for revised supports for the programme were called for on the e-tenders website on 16 June 2008 and a number of expressions of interest were received. My Department subsequently decided, due to the changed economic circumstances at that time, not to proceed with the tender competition.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_4415">I propose to take Questions Nos. 245 and 246 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4416">Funding of €46m is available under the Community Services Programme (CSP) in 2010 compared with €50.6m in 2009, an overall reduction of some 9%.  When account is taken of administrative and related project costs, the reduction in the funding available to directly support CSP projects is generally of the order of 8%.  Of the 450 or so organisations approved to deliver services under the CSP, an increase of 80 on the 01/01/2009 position, contracts in respect of some 320 projects expired at the end of 2009.  In the current economic climate, I am very keen that the current levels of employment in these organisations is maintained.  However, given the reduction in overall funding for the Programme, I can only do this by abolishing the non-wage grant that was previously payable.</p>
            <p eId="para_4417">In this context, the Deputy should note that I have provided these organisations with an opportunity to apply for an immediate review of their 2010 funding allocation where it has implications for the sustainability of the service being delivered or where the organisation has concerns of its financial viability.  It should also be noted that the organisations will have their financial situation and operations more comprehensively examined in the context of being potentially offered three year contracts to the end of 2012.  A key requirement of the CSP is that organisations contracted to deliver services undertake to generate a significant level of resources from non-public sources by way of trading, charging fees and fund raising etc.  This is unlike many of the other programmes operated across the public sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_4418">My Department continues to simplify the information and administrative burden on organisations funded by the Programme.  I believe that the information required is proportionate to the level and duration of funding offered to the groups involved.  The contracts for the 130 or so organisations extending into 2010 are unaffected at this time by the reduction in the non-wage grant.</p>

         the amount applied for by individuals, families or companies from the humanitarian fund in respect of the flooding in November 2009; the amount of money that has been given from the fund to individuals, families or companies to date in 2010; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4461">In recognition of the devastation suffered by people in many areas of the country as a result of the flooding from November 2009 onwards the Government set up a Humanitarian Assistance Scheme to provide income tested financial support to people who have suffered damages to their homes not covered by insurance. An initial sum of €10 million has been set aside by the Government for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_4462">Community Welfare Service staff throughout the country have been providing huge support to families since this flooding occurred. Up to the 15th January 2010 they had already made over 1,861 payments to 1,091 individuals to the value of €744,000. The average payment per individual is €680, with the largest payment to an individual in excess of €20,000. Initially, the vast bulk of applications for humanitarian assistance were for small amounts to assist with basics such as food, clothing, bedding, heating and the hire of dehumidifiers.   As the flood waters began to recede in some areas and householders were able to assess the extent of damage to the contents of their homes, claims have been submitted and approved for items such as carpets, flooring, furniture and white goods.</p>
            <p eId="para_4463">While assistance is available for structural repairs to homes not covered by household insurance, very few large scale claims have been made at this stage. This is because homeowners have not yet established the cost of repair in many cases, for example because they are awaiting builder's estimates. As the flood waters have receded in most areas, individuals are now in a better position to assess the extent of the damage to their homes. It is expected that large scale claims will be received over the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_4468">The Treatment Benefit scheme is paid from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF). Although the SIF has operated a surplus since 1996, this position began to change last year, and expenditure had to be partially funded from the accumulated Exchequer surplus.  It is estimated that the accumulated surplus will be completely exhausted in the first half of 2010, and that Exchequer will be required to subvent the SIF by in excess of €1 billion.  The expenditure pressures on the Fund will continue in the near future. Against this background, the most pressing needs right now are to ease the pressure on the SIF and to get the public finances back on track.</p>
            <p eId="para_4469">The Dental Examinations have been retained. This is intended to encourage customers to continue attending for checkups and so to address some of the concerns expressed regarding the population's dental health.</p>
            <p eId="para_4470">I would emphasise that the Treatment Benefit scheme has not been abolished, only revised for 2010. Although the scheme has been limited to examination only for 2010, customers will still qualify in the normal way through their PRSI contributions. The scheme will be reviewed again towards the end of the year, when a further decision will be made taking account of the prevailing circumstances at that time.</p>

            <p eId="para_4498">Spouses who are actively engaged in a commercial partnership, including the operation of a farm, as opposed to simply being the joint owners of a property, are treated as individual self-employed contributors and are thus liable to social insurance contributions.  On foot of a Programme for Government commitment an information leaflet, ‘Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements', has been developed between the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to set out the social welfare and tax implications of families co-working in a shared business.  It was published on the 25th of June, 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4499">The leaflet clarifies that spouses who operate in a commercial partnership may be brought into the social insurance system, subject to certain criteria.  In this way, both spouses incur a liability to pay self-employed PRSI and build up entitlement towards a contributory state pension and other social welfare benefits.  It is open to any person to apply for recognition of a commercial partnership.  However, to be eligible for State Pension, the legislation stipulates that at least 52 self-employment contributions must be paid by a person before they reach 66 years of age.  Contributions paid by a pension applicant's spouse do not satisfy this condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_4500">Applications for pension or benefit are submitted and processed in the usual way.  The qualifying conditions for State Pension (Contributory) require the applicant to:</p>
            <p eId="para_4501">have entered insurable employment before attaining the age of 56 years</p>
            <p eId="para_4502">have at least 260 paid contribution weeks since entry into insurance</p>
            <p eId="para_4503">satisfy the yearly average condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_4504">In addition, Section 110(1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 provides that a self-employed contributor shall not be regarded as satisfying the qualifying conditions unless:</p>
            <p eId="para_4505">(a) the person has paid self-employment contributions in respect of at least one contribution year before attaining pensionable age, and</p>
            <p eId="para_4506">(b) all self-employment contributions payable by him or her have been paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_4507">According to the records of this Department, the self-employment contributions were all paid by the person concerned after her 66th birthday.  She does not therefore satisfy the condition at (a) above and has no entitlement to a State Pension (Contributory) and has been notified of this decision on the 12th January 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4508">Section 110(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005, has been on the statute books for over twenty years and therefore, there has not been a change in policy in relation to the requirement to have paid self employment contribution prior to reaching age 66 in order to qualify for a State Pension (Contributory).  An overpayment will be determined in the above case and the customer will be notified and requested to repay the amount involved.  However a Recovery Officer may reduce/cancel an overpayment based on the circumstance of an individual case, in line with the governing legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4509">In conclusion, therefore, it should be noted that while the publication of the leaflet ‘Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements' clarified existing procedures in relation to the recognition of commercial partnerships between husbands and wives for social insurance purposes, including retrospective payment of social insurance, it did not involve a change in existing policy or administration.  In particular, the clarification of the position did not alter people's potential entitlements and all applicants for the state pension (contributory) must continue to satisfy the eligibility conditions as contained in legislation, and outlined above.</p>
            <p eId="para_4510">The department understands and apologises for the upset and distress caused to this person and regrets the administrative error involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_4565">Spouses who are actively engaged in a commercial partnership, including the operation of a farm, as opposed to simply being the joint owners of a property, are treated as individual self-employed contributors and are thus liable to social insurance contributions.  Spouses who operate in a commercial partnership may be brought into the social insurance system, subject to certain criteria.  In this way, both spouses incur a liability to pay self-employed PRSI, and build up entitlement towards a contributory state pension and other social welfare benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_4566">On foot of a Programme for Government commitment an information leaflet, ‘ <i>Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements</i>’, has been developed between the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to set out the social welfare and tax implications of families co-working in a shared business.  It was published on the 25th of June, 2008.  To date, more than one thousand applications for commercial partnership status have been received.  Of these, 579 applications have been finalised, of which 508 cases are approved.</p>
            <p eId="para_4567">To qualify for a State Pension (Contributory), a number of conditions must be satisfied.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4568">A person must have at least 260 paid social insurance contributions</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4569">have a yearly average of at least 10 contributions paid or credited since entry into social insurance,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4570">must have entered into social insurance before attaining the age of 56 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_4571">In addition, Section 110 (1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act of 2005 provides that a self-employed contributor shall not be regarded as satisfying the qualifying conditions for State Pension Contributory unless:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4572">the person has paid self-employment contributions in respect of at least one contribution year before attaining pensionable age (66),</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_4573">and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4574">all self-employment contributions payable by him or her have been paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_4575">It is open to any person to apply for recognition of a commercial partnership.  However, to be eligible for State Pension, the legislation stipulates that at least 52 self-employment contributions must be paid by a person before they reach 66 years of age.  Contributions paid by a pension applicant's spouse do not satisfy this condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_4576">Following a review of these pension claims, it was discovered that a number of individuals who had been in receipt of pension did not satisfy the condition whereby they were required to have paid at least one year's self-employment contribution before reaching age 66.  As they did not satisfy this condition, the claims were disallowed, from the date of pension award, and the customers notified.</p>
            <p eId="para_4577">Overpayments will be determined in the above cases and the customers will be notified and requested to repay the amounts involved.  However a Recovery Officer may reduce or cancel an overpayment based on the circumstances of an individual case, in line with the governing legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4578">It should be noted that while the publication of the leaflet ‘ <i>Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements’</i> clarified existing procedures in relation to the recognition of commercial partnerships between husbands and wives for social insurance purposes, including retrospective payment of social insurance, it did not involve a change in existing policy or administration.  In particular, the clarification of the position did not alter people’s potential entitlements and all applicants for the state pension (contributory) must continue to satisfy the eligibility conditions as contained in legislation, and outlined above.</p>
            <p eId="para_4579">The department understands and apologises for the upset and distress caused to these people and regrets the administrative error involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_4581">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</p>
            <p eId="para_4582">Under the relevant legislative provisions, the Department's relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  Legislation does however provide for the making of a rent supplement payment to another person on behalf of the recipient, at the tenant's request and is subject to the consent of the HSE.  Almost 20,000 (21%) rent supplement payments are made to a person other than the rent supplemented tenant, for example to a relative, a landlord or landlord's agent.</p>
            <p eId="para_4583">It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the HSE any instance where a tenant is receiving rent supplement but is not paying their rent.  Where a Community Welfare Officer becomes aware that a person receiving rent supplement is not using that supplement to meet housing costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated.  Any overpayment of rent supplement incurred in circumstances of this kind may be recoverable from the tenant.</p>
            <p eId="para_4584">Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the board's dispute resolution process.</p>

            <p eId="para_5087">In 2008, retained firefighters were given the option of joining the Local Government Superannuation Scheme (LGSS).  Retained firefighters who opted not to join the scheme receive, on retirement, a gratuity of 1/8th of the annual retainer multiplied by the number of years of actual service (up to a maximum of four times the annual retainer).

            <p eId="para_5099">The Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments was established by order of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to inquire into and report on various planning matters, set out in resolutions passed by Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann on 7 and 8 October, 1997 respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_5100">The Tribunal costs in 2010 (up to 19 January 2010) are approximately €76,000, while the overall cost of the Tribunal since its inception is of the order of €98 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_5101">I am advised by the Tribunal that it hopes to complete its report by the end of May 2010, with publication shortly thereafter; this is dependent on there being no unforeseen delays arising due to, <i>inter alia</i>, further litigation or the need to hear further evidence.  The award of third-party costs arising from 2003 onwards will be dealt with by the Chairman after the publication of the final report and, according to the Tribunal, will likely take some 6 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_5102">It is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the final cost of the Tribunal.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, in his Special Report 63 : Tribunals of Inquiry of December 2008, indicated a total cost of the Tribunal of between €171m and €194m, including third party costs of between €84m and €104m.  The Comptroller and Auditor General did note, however, that third party costs could be much higher if a final pattern resembling previous tribunals were to emerge.

            <p eId="para_5165">I assume the Question refers to the Building Control Act 2007 which was signed into law on 21 April 2007.  The Act provides, inter alia, for amendment of the Building Control Act 1990 and for registration of the titles of "Architect", "Quantity Surveyor" and "Building Surveyor".</p>
            <p eId="para_5166">A Fire Safety Certificate (FSC) is currently required before construction work commences on new non-domestic buildings and apartment blocks and extensions to, or material alterations/changes of use of existing buildings.  The FSC is issued by the Building Control Authority and certifies that the building, if constructed in accordance with the plans and documentation submitted, will comply with the requirements of Part B of the Building Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5167">Section 5 of the 2007 Act contains a new provision for the submission of a 7 Day Notice to a Building Control Authority, before grant of the relevant Fire Safety Certificate (FSC), where a person intends to commence work on the construction of a building, or an extension of, or a material alteration to, a building. It must be accompanied by a valid application for a FSC and by a Statutory Declaration stating that the application for the relevant FSC has been completed in all respects and complies with the requirements of the Building Regulations; that any works commenced before the FSC is granted will comply with the Regulations; and that the person will carry out any modifications which may be required by the FSC, when granted, within such period as may be specified by the Building Control Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_5168">There is also a new provision for a Revised Fire Safety Certificate where an application for a FSC is made before the grant of planning permission, for any works required by the permission ultimately granted, or where significant revision has been made to the design or works of a building for which a FSC has been granted.</p>
            <p eId="para_5169">In addition, there is provision for a Regularisation Certificate<b> </b>where a building has been commenced or completed without an application for a FSC, where such Certificate is required. An application for such Certificate must include a Statutory Declaration from the applicant that the works carried out are in compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations. The Building Control Authority is empowered to specify that the Regularisation Certificate will not have effect unless any conditions/additional works required by the Authority are carried out within a period of 4 months after it is granted.</p>
            <p eId="para_5170">Section 5 of the Act also provides for a prohibition on the opening, occupation or use of a building which has not been granted the necessary certificates by the Building Control Authority, as required, including the certificates referred to above.</p>
            <p eId="para_5171">The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2009 provided for the coming into effect of the above provisions on 1 October 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5172">Primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the builders and owners of buildings.

            <p eId="para_5174">The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of a premises and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981.  My Department's role is one of supporting and assisting local authorities in delivering fire services through the setting of general policy and the provision of capital funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_5175">The primary role of the local authority fire service in the event of a fire is to rescue people, save property and extinguish the fire.  Fire brigades routinely prepare internal operational reports on fire incidents attended and these reports may include opinions as to the possible causes of the fires.  However, fire authorities do not carry out formal investigations into the causes of fires.</p>
            <p eId="para_5176">The Garda Síochána carry out investigations to assist the Coroner's Office in all cases where fatalities occur from fire.  The Garda Síochána also investigate fires where a crime is suspected.  Investigations may also be carried out by the Health and Safety Authority and, in certain circumstances, such as the Whiddy Island and Stardust fires, tribunals of inquiry have been established to investigate the fires.  An investigation into this incident by An Garda Síochána is ongoing and therefore it would be important to await the outcome of this investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5177">The Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003 and Building Regulations 1997- 2008 include a range of provisions for fire safety in the design, construction, operation and management of buildings (including apartments).</p>
            <p eId="para_5178">Part B of the Building Regulations 1997 sets out the fire safety requirements to be observed in the design and construction of certain buildings including apartment complexes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5179">Section 18 (Part 3) of the Fire Services Act 1981 places a duty on persons having control over premises, such as apartment complexes, to take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire and to ensure the safety of persons on the premises in the event of an outbreak of fire.  Section 4 of the Act provides that it an offence for any person to contravene any requirement of Part 3 of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_5180">Section 22 of the Fire Services Act 1981, as amended, empowers fire authorities to inspect any land or building, including apartment complexes, for the purpose of the Act, including  enforcement of fire safety matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_5181">I have no role in the day to day exercise of these functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5182">The preparation of legislation on management companies for apartment complexes is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>

            <p eId="para_5189">The Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Fuels) Regulations, 1998, provides for an outright ban on all sales of bituminous, or smoky, coal from within certain designated restricted areas. The aim of these Regulations is to provide for the improvement of air quality in urban areas by restricting the sale of bituminous fuel.

            <p eId="para_5207">As part of an ongoing focus on major emergency preparedness and response, the Government, in 2006, published a Framework for Major Emergency Management.  The purpose of the Framework is to put in place arrangements that will enable the three principal response agencies, namely, An Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive and the local authorities to coordinate their efforts in the event of a major emergency. The Government put in place a Major Emergency Development Programme to implement these new arrangements which led to the three principal response agencies adopting new major emergency plans in September, 2008. My Department chairs a National Steering Group to oversee and drive this Programme and to maintain the Framework into the future.  When relevant my Department will chair a National Emergency Response Co-ordination Committee, as occurred during the recent flooding and  severe weather events.</p>

When effective emergency plans are in place, the management of the emergency response then falls to the local authorities and the other Response Agencies.</p>

            <p eId="para_5210">The capital costs associated with the provision of infrastructure for drainage schemes dealing with waste water management and emissions — generally known as sewerage schemes — are funded under my Department's Water Services Investment Programme (WSIP). The purpose of the WSIP is to fund the provision of water services infrastructure in response to specific environmental, public health and economic needs. Sewerage schemes in urban areas usually have some spare capacity for storm water run-off from development.  Systems may provide storm water drains and outfalls to prevent large volumes of storm water overloading foul sewers or sewage treatment works. To this limited extent only do sewerage schemes provide flood relief measures.  Financial assistance from the EU is not available for these schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5211">The WSIP has no specific function in relation to flood prevention or relief, which is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works. However, my Department has published Guidelines for Planning Authorities on the Planning System and Flood Risk Management which are aimed at ensuring a more consistent, rigorous and systematic approach to flood risk identification, assessment and management within the planning system. I refer to the reply to Question No.280 of 1 December 2009 where further details of the Guidelines are set out.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_5217">I propose to take Questions Nos. 296, 300 and 301 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5218">Despite the challenges currently faced in the housing sector, significant levels of activity have been achieved under the range of housing supports funded by my Department in recent years.  Through these, the accommodation needs of over 20,200 households were met in 2008, an increase of 10% on corresponding figure of 18,300 in 2007.  Final data in respect of 2009 are not yet available.</p>
            <p eId="para_5219">Meeting housing need remains a high priority for the Government. While ensuring that we can deliver across the full range of needs, the scale and composition of the public housing programme in the years ahead will be dependent on a number of factors, including the level of available funding and the evolution of the housing market generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_5220">I am determined to ensure that the overall delivery programme is framed in a manner which continues to optimise the way in which needs are met. To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the available Exchequer supports to prevailing market conditions, and explore alternative solutions to address needs, having full regard to the sustainable communities philosophy outlined in the Government's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities <i>.</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_5221">To this end, the range of delivery mechanisms continues to be adapted and expanded.  For example, last year, I introduced a new Social Housing Leasing Initiative, under which in excess of 1,900 units were sourced in 2009 and through which I expect a substantial number of units to be provided in the years ahead to meet housing needs, estimated at just over 56,000 households in the 2008 Housing Needs Assessment.  This, together with the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), complements the traditional capital funded programmes operated through local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.  The combined budget provision for leasing and RAS for 2010 is €150 million and I anticipate that, taken together, the two schemes will deliver half of the projected social housing output this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5222">I will be keeping the leasing initiative and all the other housing programmes under ongoing review to ensure that they are appropriately geared towards meeting the maximum level of housing need.</p>

            <p eId="para_5227">In order comprehensively to assess the overall level of demand for grant assistance under the suite of Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability, my Department requested local authorities to submit details of their funding requirements for 2010 by 22 January, with a view to determining the allocations for this year as soon as possible afterwards.</p>
            <p eId="para_5228">The allocations are calculated on foot of detailed discussion between my Department and the local authorities and on the basis of the projected level of demand for grants, taking account of the applications on hand that have been assessed as eligible, applications yet to be assessed and projections for new applications to be received during the year. Details regarding the numbers and value of applications under each of the grant measures are awaited.   It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each of the individual schemes, from within the combined allocations from local authority and Exchequer sources, notified to them by my Department, and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within their allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5229">In order to provide for continuity in the processing of applications and the payment of grants under the various measures, local authorities were advised that they could anticipate an allocation for 2010 which would not be substantially below their overall allocation for 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_5231">The monitoring, assessment and management of ambient air quality in Ireland is carried out according to the requirements of the EU Air Quality Framework Directive. This Directive became law through the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, (Ambient Air Quality Assessment and Management) Regulations, 1999. Under further regulations made in 2002, 2004 and 2009, specific ambient air quality standards have been prescribed for the following pollutants:</p>
            <p eId="para_5232">sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and other oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead (2002);</p>
            <p eId="para_5233">carbon monoxide and benzene (2002);</p>
            <p eId="para_5234">ozone (2004); and</p>
            <p eId="para_5235">polyaromatic hydrocarbons, arsenic, nickel, cadmium and mercury in ambient air (2009).</p>
            <p eId="para_5236">Where the indicative level for any pollutant is exceeded, the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2002 require the local authority concerned, following notification by the EPA, to develop a long-term air quality management plan to ensure compliance with the thresholds for the relevant pollutant or pollutants.</p>
            <p eId="para_5237">The EPA reports the results of the air quality monitoring of the above pollutants through its website: <i>http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/monitoring/air/data/</i>.  My Department keeps these data under ongoing review to identify any significant trends which might emerge and also meets periodically with the EPA on air quality issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_5238">The EPA also publishes a comprehensive annual report on air quality, the most recent being the report Air Quality in Ireland 2008 (September 2009). This report provides an overview of ambient air quality trends in Ireland in 2008 based on data from 30 monitoring stations and a further 18 stations operated by local authorities to measure black smoke. The Report confirmed that air quality was generally good at monitoring stations throughout the country, with pollution levels in larger cities highest at traffic influenced sites but highest in smaller urban areas due to the burning of coal and solid fuels. All monitored levels met required EU and national standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_5239">As part of a commitment on monitoring air quality made under the 2007 Programme for Government my Department requested the EPA to undertake an overall review of the adequacy of the air quality monitoring network in light of population change in urban areas.  The review has now been completed and a report of its findings is currently being finalised by the EPA.</p>

            <p eId="para_5241">The Government, largely through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), has, for many years now, worked towards assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country. Between 1992 and 1999 the RPII carried out a comprehensive National Radon Survey to measure radon concentrations in Irish homes. The principal objective was to identify the scale of the radon problem in Ireland and areas at higher risk of radon contamination above the National Reference Level of 200 becquerels per metre<b/>cubed<b/>(Bq/m<sup>3</sup>).</p>
            <p eId="para_5242">Over 37,500 homes have now been measured for radon by the RPII. The results of these tests have been compiled into a central database, which has greatly aided our knowledge and understanding as to the extent of Ireland's radon problem. A summary of the number of homes measured and the number of houses in categories of radon concentration is included in the table below for the last three years. In 2007, the RPII introduced a protocol advising a graded approach in responding to reported average radon concentrations in homes above the national Reference Level.  This protocol is summarised as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_5976">Liquid Bio-fuels can be produced from a range of feedstocks including wheat, sugar beet, rapeseed and tallow.  The choice of feedstock is influenced by a number of factors including the availability of suitable land, crop yields and production costs.  The most pertinent factor is the presence of a well-developed infrastructure to process and distribute the chosen feedstock into liquid bio-fuel. In relation to sugar beet, there is currently no processing facility in Ireland to convert this feedstock into ethanol liquid bio-fuel.  We have no information on the use of sugar beet for ethanol production in the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_5977">As regards EU assistance, discussions on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) post 2013 are still at a relatively early stage.  Although policy analysis and general debates have commenced in a number of Member States including Ireland, they are still primarily concerned with the broad outlines and general principles, including issues such as the amount of funding that will be available, the overall direction of the direct payments system, the positioning of rural development policy in the CAP etc.  The Department received almost 60 submissions in response to the public consultation process on CAP reform, which I launched in July of last year and these are currently being analysed. While I am open to examining all suggestions, my priority at present is to secure a strong and adequately resourced CAP after 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_5978">In the past, CAP funds have been used to support the production of crops grown specifically for use as feedstock in the bio-fuel market.  Under the EU Energy Crops Scheme areas planted with non-food crops qualified for an EU premium worth €45 per hectare.  Uptake of the premium was relatively low in Ireland and in most other Member States.  The EU Commission abolished the premium in 2009 during the CAP Health Check reforms.  Areas sown with non-food crops continue to qualify for the Single Farm Payment.  The introduction of the Bio-fuel Obligation Scheme in mid 2010 is expected to encourage investment in bio-fuels and should help bring some certainty to the market.  The Scheme provides that all fuel suppliers in Ireland must include an average of 4% bio-fuels in their annual fuel sales.  This will increase over time to enable Ireland meet the 10% target for renewables in transport fuel by 2020.</p>

            <p eId="para_6032">Under section 2 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 a person is liable to pay the pensions-related deduction if he or she is a public servant on or after 1 March 2009 and is a member of a public service pension scheme, is entitled to a benefit under such a scheme or receives a payment in lieu of membership of such a scheme.  Therefore, even if a person is not a member of a public service pension scheme, he or she is subject to the deduction if he or she is a member of another public service pension scheme, is entitled to a benefit under such a scheme (eg has a preserved benefit, is in receipt of a pension from another public service pension scheme or if he or she is entitled to a non-pensionable gratuity) or receives a payment in lieu of membership.  In general, persons employed as temporary teachers in first and second level schools are eligible for admission to the superannuation scheme and once they have achieved the vesting period of 2 years service they would qualify for benefit or preserved benefit on reaching normal pension age.</p>
            <p eId="para_6033">A non-pensionable gratuity may be payable to certain staff of VECs and institutes of technology who have given service with a VEC or institute of technology and whose service is not reckonable for superannuation purposes under the pension schemes of those bodies.  The non-pensionable gratuity is paid in the form of a lump sum and is calculated at the rate of one week's pay for each year of service up to 15 years plus two weeks' pay for each year of service over 15 years, subject to a maximum 78 weeks.  Payment of the gratuity is made under the terms of the Local Government (Superannuation) (Gratuities) Regulations 1984 and 1995 which were made under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act 1980.</p>
            <p eId="para_6034">The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 defines a "public service pension scheme" as an occupational pension scheme or pension arrangement, by whatever name called, for any part of the public service provided for under any enactment or administrative measure for the like purpose and effect as the Superannuation Acts.  The non-pensionable gratuity regulations provide a form of pension arrangement, apply to certain parts of the public service (including VECs and institutes of technology) and have their basis in the Local Government (Superannuation) Act 1980.  A person with the required level of service is entitled to a non-pensionable gratuity under such an arrangement and therefore falls within section 2(1)(b)(ii) of the Act.  They are, therefore, subject to the deduction.</p>
            <p eId="para_6035">It should be noted, however, that under section 6 of the Act, if a person does not accrue a superannuation benefit in respect of this service at the time of his or her ceasing to be a public servant, the deduction is refundable to him or her.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind and will provide me will the specific details, I will have the position examined in the Pensions Section of my Department which will communicate directly with the Deputy.</p>

This new method of payment assists Bus Éireann in planning an efficient and cost-effective school transport service well in advance of a school year based on the level of demand for seats.  It also provides comfort to parents in the knowledge that on payment of the charge, a seat is guaranteed for the school year in question.  I appreciate the Deputy's concerns in this matter.  In that regard, my Department, in conjunction with Bus Éireann, is prepared to review aspects of the current arrangements in the light of experiences this year.</p>

The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department’s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.

            <p eId="para_6043">The home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.  Home tuition  grants are paid to the parents, who in turn make payment to the home tuition provider.  Following the introduction of an increased rate of pay to suitably qualified home tuition providers, arrears payments may be due to some tuition providers.  As I advised the Deputy on 10 December, my Department is currently examining the issue.  Officials from my Department will be in contact with the tutor referred to by the Deputy in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_6075">In 2004, agreement was reached to amalgamate the two primary schools referred to by the Deputy.  The application was assessed and the project was assigned a band rating of 1.4.  Details of other Band 1.4 rated building projects are available on my Department's website <i>www.education.ie</i>.  A technical inspection was carried out on the existing school buildings to determine which would be suitable to facilitate the amalgamated school.  The report produced following this inspection concluded that the most suitable building to facilitate the amalgamation would be the girls’ school.  It also found that an additional portion of land would be required from the Sisters of Mercy to facilitate the development.  The Sisters of Mercy have indicated that they would, in principle, be disposed to selling land to the Department to facilitate the proposed works.</p>

          if a mature student, re-entering education after a break of one year or more to pursue an approved full-time level nine qualification is automatically deemed ineligible for the higher education grant if they are already in possession of a level nine qualification, even if that qualification is in an entirely different and unrelated field; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_6404">Financial assistance is available to students under the Third Level Student Support Schemes, which are administered by the Local Authorities and Vocational Education Committees on behalf of my Department.  Students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.</p>
            <p eId="para_6405">Under the terms of the Higher Education Grant Scheme a student is not eligible for grant assistance in respect of a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously.  The scheme also provides that grants may not be paid to candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing a second postgraduate qualification.</p>
            <p eId="para_6406">However, in December 2000 clause 7.7 of the Higher Education Grant Scheme was amended to provide financial assistance to eligible candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and who wish to enter a further postgraduate course, at a higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained.</p>
            <p eId="para_6407">The progression route at postgraduate level, for grant purposes, is as follows: Higher Diploma/Postgraduate Diploma/Masters/PhD/Doctorate</p>
            <p eId="para_6408">Candidates who hold a masters qualification and are currently pursuing a postgraduate qualification cannot be considered for funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_6409">There are no plans at present to change the current arrangements.  Any such proposal would have to be considered in the light of existing resources and other competing demands in the education sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_6421">My Department is actively engaged in a programme of legislative and administrative reform of student grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_6422">The passage of the Student Support Bill will facilitate progress on the two significant pillars of an overall programme of legislative and administrative reform of student grants, the development of a single unified grant scheme and reform of the administration of student grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_6423">I am endeavouring to progress to a single scheme of grants as provided for in the Bill at the earliest possible date.  While the current financial situation may necessitate retention of the existing administrative structures in the immediate term, I am assessing organisational options for the grants administration function in the longer run, with a view to streamlining operations and achieving greater administrative efficiency.  Possible options for a more significant aggregation of functions are now being explored within the broader context of budgetary considerations and the Government's overall programme of public service reform.  A number of the amendments to the Student Support Bill are at the final stages of preparation and my Department is currently working closely with the Office of the Attorney General to finalise any outstanding matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_6424">The Department in the meantime is continuing to work closely with both the VECs and local authorities and other relevant stakeholders to develop a number of initiatives to support more effective delivery of the grant schemes.  A fundamental review of the entire business process is underway with a view to ensuring consistency of application and a more streamlined and effective service for students.  This includes matters relating to application, assessment and payments arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_6426">The funding arrangements made by my Department for second-level schools reflect the sectoral division of our second-level system.  At the core of all arrangements is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_6427">My Department provides funding to secondary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_6428">There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. With effect from January 2009, the standard per capita grant was increased by €14 per pupil and now amounts to €345 per pupil.  In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of €8 per pupil in 2009 in the support services grant bringing that grant to €212 per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_6429">The cumulative increase of €22 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to €557 per pupil.  These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services.  For example, in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support services to over €318,500.  The corresponding figure in 2000 was approximately €147,300.</p>
            <p eId="para_6430">Budget allocations for schools in the Community and Comprehensive school sector, along with those in the VEC sector, are increased on a pro rata basis in line with increases in the per capita grant paid to voluntary secondary schools.  All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_6431">My Department has provided an estimated €21million to voluntary secondary schools in equalisation funding to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_6432">These significant increases in the funding of post-primary schools are a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.  I will consider how best to complete the process of equalisation of funding at second level having regard to available resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_6434">In relation to the correspondence referred to by the Deputy, he will be aware that when the Government was introducing the moratorium in the public sector last year I secured a special arrangement for education which ensured we could fill teacher and SNA posts.  The concession also provides for the filling of Principal and Deputy Principal posts in all schools and the first allocation of posts of responsibility in new schools.  Following the Government decision my Department issued a circular to all schools indicating that with effect from 27 March, 2009 schools may no longer make any appointment to a post of responsibility including those that may have fallen vacant on or before 27 March, 2009.  This Circular 0022/2009 is available on my Department's website.</p>
