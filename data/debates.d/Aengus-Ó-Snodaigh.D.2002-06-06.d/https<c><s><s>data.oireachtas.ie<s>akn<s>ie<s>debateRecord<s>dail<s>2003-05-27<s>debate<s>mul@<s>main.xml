          <p eId="para_3">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">A total of ten freedom of information requests were received in my Department during April 2003. Of these, four were granted. In the remaining cases, one was part granted, no records were held in respect of three cases and two cases are ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">All requests received in my Department are processed in accordance with the 1997 Act and, where appropriate, the 2003 Act. Its implementation in my Department is kept under constant review.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_6">I thank the Taoiseach for that reply. Have any FOI requests been refused in his Department following the recent changes to the Act introduced by the Government? Will the Taoiseach comment on the fact that the Government information service recently inquired of all Departments if they would have a preference for freedom of information requests being cited on its website. Will he agree that should this be implemented it would be a retrograde step in that every request would become common knowledge?</p>

          <p eId="para_8">I do not think any requests were refused. All the information is put up on websites. While every Department does not do this, some do. The practice appears to be to put any information that is given out on the website.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_9">The spokesperson for the GIS said that while it was not actively under consideration she did not rule out a decision being made in this regard in the future. Is it the personal view of the Taoiseach that it would be a retrograde step if all requests for freedom of information were to be posted on the website, including requests from his Department? It would also do away with the exclusivity that the media might wish to have on stories in relation to the Irish Box and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</p>

          <p eId="para_11">Most of the information sought in my Department is on personal cases and I do not think this would be made public. However, it would not be any great harm to give out information on questions of a general nature.</p>

          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_13">The Taoiseach indicated that there were ten requests during the month of April in regard to the passage of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003. Has there been an assessment in his Department of the effect of this legislation and the implications for requesters? Does the Taoiseach have the statistical breakdown of individual requests as against requests from members of the media or other organisations? He indicated that there were ten in all, four of which were acceded to. Does his Department hold to the norm where 60% of requests under FOI come from private individuals?</p>
          <p eId="para_14">The Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill widened the definition of Government. A Secretary General can now verify or certify a committee or working group and preclude its deliberations from FOI on the basis that it is part of Government. What are the implications of this for committees or working groups under the Taoiseach's Department?</p>

          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_18">My question is a supplementary on the impact of the new legislation  in relation to that. It is quite reasonable and within the scope of the question.</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_14">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_19">I do not have the figures with me. I gave the full number of questions for last year in reply to Deputy Kenny during the last Question Time this was discussed.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">If I recall correctly, there has been no change in the majority of personal cases and neither has there been a change in the fee date. On the other questions, decision-makers are independent in the exercise of these functions but most of the questions are relatively straightforward and I do not envisage any change regarding them. They do not concern Government committees so they would not be subject to change in the deliberative process. Therefore, I do not see that the amending legislation will have much effect on my Department. The refusals are normally based on issues that are before Government and are usually section 19 exemptions which deal with Government meetings, but there are not many of those. While I recognise that ten is a small base, four were granted, one was partly granted – that is half of them – two cases are still ongoing and there is no information in three cases. The overall statistics for the year were similar so it covers practically the whole breakdown.</p>

          <p eId="para_21">I take this opportunity to extend my best wishes to the new Information Commissioner on her elevation to that office, as reported today.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">Is the Taoiseach aware of how many appeals there have been against decisions in his office during the past year? Are there plans to furnish additional resources to the Office of the Information Commissioner? I do not know what the position is regarding his Department but the Taoiseach will be aware that there is generally a three-year backlog. Has he plans to deal with that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_16">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_23">A total of 985 requests were received in my Department between April 1998, which was the starting date, and 4 April 2003. Of these, 297 were granted, 244 were partly granted, 60 were transferred to other Departments, 70 were withdrawn, 117 were refused, no records were held in respect of 172 cases and 25 cases are ongoing. The majority of cases that are refused in my Department tend to concern departmental memoranda that are before Government. Many of those requests come back in later and the information is provided. During the five years in question, I have only had a few appeal cases. The number is not contained in the reply but, as I recall, only a handful went to appeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">The resources have already been increased although I am not too sure if there are any outstanding issues concerning the new Information Commissioner, Ms Emily O'Reilly, whom I wish well in her new post. I am sure that if there are any outstanding issues, once she has settled into  her new position, they can be dealt with. However, most of the staffing issues were dealt with during the outgoing commissioner's term. There are now 370 bodies within the extended remit and workload the office has undertaken, which represents a huge increase. Most of the staffing issues were dealt with but it is an ongoing issue.</p>

          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_27">What is the average timescale in processing the 25 ongoing cases mentioned by the Taoiseach? How many cases that have been referred from the Department of the Taoiseach to the Ombudsman have been successful?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_20">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_28">As I said, there have only been a few cases from my Department but I would need to have the information before I can answer the Deputy. I do not want to make a guess about them. Nearly all the questions in my Department are dealt with within the appropriate timescale. Where that is not possible because of the extent of the information, the Department normally informs the individual and then tries to provide the additional information. That arises mainly when research is necessary to compile all the relevant information. However, most requests are fairly straightforward and can be answered within the time scale.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_21">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_29">I wish to add my good wishes to the Information Commissioner on beginning her term of office. In relation to that office and particularly in relation to the Taoiseach's Department, are there adequate facilities and resources to ensure that the stream of information requests in the Irish language are dealt with as expeditiously as those in the English language? Has the Taoiseach any record of freedom of information requests in Irish?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_22">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_30">I do not have such a record but I recall having answered that question previously. In my Department, at a number of levels, there are designated officials who deal with those requests. The number of requests is not very great, if I recall my previous reply correctly. However, there are people designated to deal with them promptly.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_31">The Taoiseach stated, in his reply, that a number of the requests were dealt with under the previous legislation while others were dealt with under the current 2003 legislation. If all had been dealt with under the old legislation, would there have been a substantial difference in the content of the replies subsequently dealt with under the 2003 legislation?</p>

        </question>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_27">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_69">I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 36, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">I attended the informal meeting of the European Council in Athens held on 16 April. I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. The Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Roche, also attended. The declarations adopted by the European Council on 16 Labour, or I  should say April, and by the European Conference held the following day have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, as has the Presidency statement on Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">The signature of the Treaty of Accession for the ten accession countries also took place in Athens on 16 April. The ceremony marked a true milestone in European history. Earlier in the day, an informal meeting of the European Council adopted the Athens Declaration. In this declaration, the European Council set out the principles on which the European Union is founded. These principles are freedom, democracy and the rule of law, respect for human dignity, liberty and human rights and a Union devoted to the practice of tolerance, justice and solidarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">It is useful to be reminded of these principles from time to time. The signing of the Accession Treaty marked the end of a long and bleak chapter in European history. It acknowledged that countries which had been artificially cut off from mainstream Europe had earned the right to membership based on the principles on which the Union is founded. It reaffirmed, once again, the value and success of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">The informal European Council meeting focused on the work of the European Convention. The European Union must be seen to work by our citizens. That is why the work of the convention, and the Intergovernmental Conference that will follow, is so important. It is why the Government is taking the work of the convention so seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">Prior to the European Council, a group of 17 current and future member states met. The meeting was hosted by Prime Minister Verhofstadt of Belgium in the absence of the current president of the Benelux, Prime Minister Juncker of Luxembourg. Ireland was represented by Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Roche. The meeting was a follow-on from a meeting of seven member states which I attended in Luxembourg. The 17 countries agreed a number of fundamental principles which we want to see reflected in the outcome of the convention. The principles that we reconfirmed are the need to ensure the equality of member states and to retain the balance between the institutions, without creating new institutions. The President of the European Parliament, Mr. Pat Cox MEP, addressed the members of the European Council. His presentation focused on the work of the convention from the point of view of the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">An exchange with the President of the European Convention, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing followed. President d'Estaing outlined his plans for the European Convention and the drafting of the constitutional treaty. He confirmed that he would present the final report of the convention to the European Council in Greece on 20 June. The session with President d'Estaing focused on key institutional issues. Along with very many others, I underlined my support for the principles of equality and institutional balance. I said, as did  others, that I hoped as much consensus as possible would be reached, but where this was not possible, the convention should set out options.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">I had a bilateral meeting with Kofi Annan on 16 April at which I underlined the principles on which our policy on Iraq is based. We agreed that the first concern must be the well-being of the Iraqi people. They have suffered greatly and deserve a better future. I assured the Secretary General of Ireland's readiness to assist.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">As regards the longer-term reconstruction and administration of Iraq, I welcome last week's adoption of the resolution by the Security Council on the comprehensive range of issues which need to be addressed in post-war Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">I also met Prime Minister Racan of Croatia. Croatia submitted its application for membership of the European Union in February. It is likely that the application will come up for consideration by the Council following completion of the Commission's opinion towards the end of the Irish Presidency of the European Union next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">In the margins of the European Council, I met Prime Minister Blair and we discussed developments in the peace process at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">While the agenda for the European Council which I will attend has not as yet been finalised, a draft annotated agenda has been circulated by the Presidency. I had the opportunity to discuss the agenda with Prime Minister Simitis when he visited Dublin on Friday last as part of his tour of capitals in advance of the Council. The main item on the agenda will be the European Convention and the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference. Other issues which will be discussed are asylum and immigration and a number of external relations issues, notably Iraq and the Middle East peace process.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">Other meetings in preparation for the Council and any bilateral meetings at the Council will be planned in light of the agenda and the circumstances prevailing at the time. While I have no immediate plans to meet the Prime Minister of Italy to discuss its Presidency of the Council, I will encounter the Prime Minister at the June Council. There is ongoing contact between officials involved in the preparations for our Presidency with their Italian counterparts. I hope to visit Italy before the end of the year, most likely in October, to deepen these contacts.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">I have ongoing contacts with the President of the European Commission, both at European Councils and as required. The need for a bilateral meeting is kept under constant review.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">On Thursday, 8 May, I visited Stockholm for talks with Prime Minister Persson. The focus of our discussions was on issues of concern regarding both the European Union and international matters. I informed the Prime Minister that the effective conduct of the Union's business is the overriding priority and focus of our preparations for our Presidency next year. I stated that work on the development of our Presidency programme is ongoing and that I was anxious to hear  his views and to have an understanding of Swedish concerns as we identified and developed priorities. I informed him that the Lisbon strategy would be a priority for our Presidency and we exchanged views on how best to advance the agenda, despite the challenges of economic slowdown, global uncertainty and in the context of an enlarged Union. Progress at the European convention, where we share many interests and concerns, was a major focus for our discussions. Naturally, Iraq was also discussed.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">In relation to my travel plans for the remainder of the year, I will continue my structured series of engagements with member and accession states in the context of the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union and the ongoing business of the Union on the lines of my recent visits to the Czech Republic, Portugal, Belgium, Germany and Sweden. Visits have been arranged to Finland and Estonia on 12 June, Turkey on 17 July, Austria and Slovenia on 24 July and France on 12 September. Arrangements for visits to Spain and Italy before the end of the year are being finalised. I also hope to visit a number of other countries and these visits are at an early stage of planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">I will travel to St. Petersburg on 30 May for the EU-Russia summit. I will be attending the European Councils in October and December which will be held in Brussels under the Italian Presidency of the Union. I plan to visit the United States of America in September.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"><i>Additional Information</i>The EU-Russia summit 2003 will take place within a general celebration of the 300th anniversary of the founding of the city of St. Petersburg. The association of the summit meeting with the anniversary programme was an initiative of President Putin. An open agenda has been agreed by the EU Commission with the Russian hosts. Participants will have the opportunity to address any dimension of EU-Russian relations. My interest will be on the closer engagement likely to follow on the expansion eastwards next year of the EU and continuing co-operation in economic matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">I welcome the opportunity for bilateral contacts that the weekend programme presents. A series of cultural engagements has been arranged to celebrate the city's anniversary at which many countries will be represented. I very much appreciate the opportunity this will provide for informal meetings and discussions.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">I met the EU High Representative, Dr. Javier Solana, on 21 May following his working lunch with the Minister, Deputy Cowen. We had a very useful and productive meeting at which we reviewed a wide range of international issues of current concern. We also discussed some of the issues under consideration in the convention and we looked forward to Ireland's forthcoming EU Presidency. We discussed the situation in the Middle East and the importance of making early progress in implementing the road map agreed between the quartet of the EU, US, Russia and  the UN. We discussed the situation in Iraq and we both welcomed the progress then being made in the UN Security Council towards restoring international co-operation on the issue, which was reflected in the adoption on 22 May of Resolution 1483 with only one abstention.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">Our discussions on European Union issues included the ongoing work of the European convention which is now heading towards the end-game. We discussed European security and defence issues, on which Dr. Solana was well aware of Ireland's approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">I briefed Dr. Solana on the planning for our EU Presidency and informed him that I am in the course of visiting my colleagues in the European Council in preparation for the Presidency to hear their views and concerns. Dr. Solana's visit was a useful opportunity for us to deepen our co-operation with one of the key figures in the EU, with whom we will have the closest co-operation during our EU Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">The publication Ireland and the European Union – Identifying Priorities and Pursuing Goals is a revised and updated edition of the original paper which was published in April 2002. The publication is part of the Government's efforts to better inform the public of Ireland's policy in relation to the European Union. It sets out our key national objectives across the full range of our involvement in the Union. Copies of the paper were laid before both Houses on publication and it is also available on the Government website</p>

          <p eId="para_92">What is the Taoiseach's and the Government's response to the draft constitution published yesterday by the convention? Does the Taoiseach agree with Deputy John Bruton that the next three weeks will be crucial in shaping the document on the future constitution of Europe? Will he outline for the House the strategy the Government intends to adopt for the next three weeks in terms of putting forward proposals, negotiations with other leaders and the discussions he or his Minister intend to have in regard to shaping the document as it will emerge over the three weeks before final presentation to the Heads of Government? Will he give his reaction to the convention document published yesterday and outline the strategy for the next three weeks?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_29">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_93">The part of my reply relating to my meeting with the EU High Representative, Dr. Javier Solana, on 21 May is included in the reply. I do not think anything in particular was discussed. It was mainly about his meetings on the Middle East, including a discussion about Ireland and the European Union, identifying priorities and pursuing goals. This paper was published approximately two months ago and put before the General Affairs Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">Yesterday's document was the first of a three part document. The convention report is being  produced in three sections. Yesterday's document did not include the whole of section 1. The institutional part, which will be very important was omitted. I have strong views about many aspects of that section but it was not included in yesterday's document. It is in line with what I have said here and agreed with most people. I had an opportunity to meet the convention members, from all parties in the House. We have an agreed line and we have not changed from that line. It has also been discussed by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, at the European affairs committee so our position on that has not changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">On the work that was done yesterday, namely, setting out the principles, simplifying the treaties and setting out the objectives and values of the Union, which I touched on in my reply, what was stated in Athens was good work. It is fulfilling the line that they said, it is simplifying matters and it is easily read. It is easier for people who are not dealing with European business every day of the week, or are not involved in the system, to read. While there are many aspects of it that have not been finalised it is a good document.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">I have to quickly add that Part One sets out the basis, the principles and the objectives. Part Three mainly will set out the detail of how these are worked out and whether we have achieved the two key issues for this country and the group of 16 countries that has been working on this, namely, that we have balance within the institutions and equality among member states. That has been the framework on which we have worked since February last year and that is the framework within which we want to stay. As we stated in February, and at every opportunity since, if those two issues are maintained – balance of institutions and equality of member states – we are prepared to negotiate on everything else and that is where the institutional part, which is left out of Part One, is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">Deputy John Bruton is right and I acknowledge the amount of work and effort he has put in to the praesidium, and his close contact throughout with the Government and officials. He has been extremely helpful to the Irish delegation continuing up to the work on these papers over the last few days. It was extremely helpful to have the input of somebody from the praesidium.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">The next three weeks are crucial as a wide range of meetings is scheduled. I went through our position point by point in a three-hour session with the Greek Presidency recently because it is endeavouring to get everyone's views on the institutional questions and on other key issues. It is not trying to cover every point. The majority of the three parts of this document are not contentious. There are around 30 questions and the Greek Presidency is trying to develop a questionnaire to establish where everybody stands on those questions. We went through our position. The answers to many of these questions are not  a clear "yes" or "no" because of the way one area relates to another.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">The Government has tried to make its mind up as tightly as possible so that there is no question of having five or six positions. Some countries have said they want to go back to the Laeken Declaration and presented six alternatives. I tried to get them down to one or two, and none, in as many cases as possible, because it is an unfair position into which to put the Presidency if it is trying to negotiate across 25 countries with that range of positions. We have tried to narrow down our position, including through the various groups in which Deputy Roche is actively engaged, one of 16 and another of seven, mainly the Benelux countries, with which we have been playing a part. There is another wider group including a number of countries of accession. Ours is the majority view but as with all such issues we have to negotiate our position on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">When the Presidency finishes its work in about ten days' time it will then go to the chairman, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, who will give his views and try to reach as complete a document as possible when we get to Thessaloniki. Then we will see how much is in square brackets, how many options there are, and how it goes into the Intergovernmental Conference. I might as well be totally honest about this as I can see that it could come into the Irish Presidency. I am endeavouring to be as helpful as I can to the Greeks and getting everyone I can to narrow down their positions so that we do not end up like the justice and home affairs area, where there are 700 amendments to one section. I would like it to be finished in this Irish Presidency not the next one. People have to get into their—</p>

          <p eId="para_102">He would have to be around for about 15 years. We must narrow things down and be reasonable. It comes back to the Deputy's question about the strategy. The next three weeks are crucial. As with all such issues, it is a pity that the time period involved is so tight. Everything must happen between Thursday, 29 May and 18 June. It is a very tight time period. If the convention document is as detailed as possible, with the minimum of square brackets and without hundreds of options – obviously there will be some, but not in an unco-ordinated way – we will be able to move successfully to the Intergovernmental Conference in October. People may stick to an enormous range of options, but I will be involved trying to help the Presidency's efforts in that work over the next fortnight. We have a role to play from now on, and we will try to do that. The next few weeks are crucial to avoiding a very difficult Intergovernmental Conference.</p>

          <p eId="para_103">At the Athens Summit, EU leaders called for the United Nations to  be given a central role in Iraq. Does the Taoiseach believe that the United Nations has now been given such a central role in line with their request? Does he agree that the UN arms inspectors should now return to Iraq?</p>
          <p eId="para_104">Before the US and British-led war on Iraq we, in this country, and many others were given to believe that the act of aggression against Iraq was all about weapons of mass destruction, but they have not been found. What is the Taoiseach's view on that now? Does he not regret the support that he offered the United States and Britain in their attack on Iraq on the basis that it was all about weapons of mass destruction, a clearly misleading position presented by those two countries? In the same vein, does the Taoiseach agree with his Minister for Defence, who has just left his side, when he calls for the lifting of restrictions on the Defence Forces serving abroad without a UN mandate to allow them to participate in future EU army activities?</p>

          <p eId="para_105">Will the Taoiseach confirm that if EU leaders agree a draft constitution, it must go before the Irish people in a referendum? What are his current plans for such a referendum? Will he be as specific as possible on when it would be held? Since the timescale that the EU has imposed on itself is now so short, how can the Taoiseach possibly think agreement can be reached on issues of fundamental concern to the Irish people? Specifically, how does he react to the fact that, enshrined in the proposed EU constitution, is the creation of a European armaments industry and a call for an increase in armaments spending in the EU? It is down in black and white. Does the Taoiseach not consider it obscene that further resources should be wasted on military research to incinerate and destroy more people more effectively and that there is the prospect of a new arms race of a different kind between the premier imperial power, the United States, and the EU?</p>
          <p eId="para_106">When the Taoiseach had discussions with Mr. Kofi Annan and Mr. Richard Haass in recent weeks, did they throw any light on the total absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? During the last Question Time I asked the Taoiseach to ask Mr. Haass and to report back to the Dáil. I ask him to report now on what excuse the United States is giving for the lies they told justifying the criminal invasion of Iraq.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">I will answer Deputy Ó Caoláin's questions first. On the matter of the UN resolution of last week, we welcome the adoption of the new Security Council resolution on what is a comprehensive range of issues which need to be addressed in post-war Iraq. The achievement of a consensus on this at the Security Council is to be welcomed and it goes a long way to restoring its unity. There is a sense of relief and achievement across the Union on that issue, as was relayed to me by the Greek Presidency which had been talking to individuals around the system last week. We have always supported the view that the UN should play a key role in the reconstruction of Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">With regard to the Deputy's second question, we are pleased in that regard. We particularly welcome the fact that the Secretary General's special representative has been given a clear mandate and we hope it will prove to be an effective one. Deputies will recall that when I spoke to Kofi Annan and I reported on that here previously, I stated that is what he wanted. He did not want to get into a position where he did not have a very clear mandate. He has that now and he is pleased with that position. That will be important in winning international acceptance for the legitimacy of Iraq's future political structures and the UN should be an equal partner to the greatest extent possible. That is what we have stated all along. It is what the European Union has said, and that has now happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">We also welcome the fact that the resolution lays emphasis on the processes required to bring representative government to Iraq as soon as possible and that the Iraqi people will be in charge of their own destiny as soon as possible. That is equally important.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">Decisions will have to be taken about the future role of UNMOVIC, the IAEA and arms and what will happen in that regard. Those decisions have not been made yet but, as I understand it, they will be made in the immediate future, and then, hopefully, the IAEA and UNMOVIC will get back in. That is what should happen. That is the only way we will get to the end of weapons of mass destruction. That also relates to Deputy Joe Higgins's questions. It is necessary to get the IAEA and the UNMOVIC back into Iraq and, hopefully, decisions on that will be made shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">The majority of EU partners are committed to reopening their offices in Baghdad. The Government is also keeping the question under active review and any such decision will be influenced by the security situation on the ground and the expected benefits for Ireland's interests and the availability of resources, but no decision has been made on that yet. Matters are returning to normal. There are still difficulties on the ground in terms of looting and other issues, but hopefully the UN will be able to play a constructive role in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">Deputy Joe Higgins asked me about the referendum. The position on such a referendum is that it would normally be held two years after the Intergovernmental Conference would conclude. At this stage I do not know when the Intergovernmental Conference will start its work, but I expect that will happen in October. That is not agreed, but I do not envisage it starting before October. When I previously discussed this, I gathered that the Italian Presidency would want this process to start in October. The length of time it takes is a case of how efficiently the work can be dealt with. The normal legal and statutory position is that it will be two years from whenever the Intergovernmental Conference concludes.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">On armaments and the arms agency, the proposals are in draft form and are up for negotiation. People will get to air their views on them. Deputy Joe Higgins will be aware that a number of European countries took the opposite view to the United States and believed that Europe should spend more of its budget on and devote a much higher percentage of its resources to arms. Four countries that met recently – Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany and France – take the view that there should be a counterbalance. They are committed to proceeding with mutual defence. We are opposed to it and will not be part of whatever happens in this regard.</p>

For some reason, the Taoiseach seems to have Labour on the brain these days. Can I take from his reply that the Taoiseach is satisfied with the arrangements made for the United Nations in terms of govern ing the interim situation in Iraq? Did I read correctly in one of this morning's newspapers that our ambassador is about to depart again for Baghdad? To whom is he accredited in those circumstances? Does it mean we recognise the interim arrangement as the Government of Iraq? Will the Taoiseach clarify this?</p>
          <p eId="para_126">In respect of the draft treaty, will the Taoiseach indicate to the House whether there are specific changes he considers to be of importance that would be at the top of his agenda in the discussions between now and the Intergovernmental Conference?

It seems to be watered down from what we were led to believe during the Nice treaty, and likewise with the principle of equality among all nations, large and small, which is not, according to Giscard d'Estaing, to be taken for granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">Will the Government stand firm on the concern it has about the manner in which a President of the European Council is to be elected? Regarding the solidarity clause, apart from the inclusion of NATO which seems to have been introduced quietly in a latter draft, and while I am glad for the Government's sake that there is the issue of national disasters, there is the issue of the terrorist threat. Will the Taoiseach stand firm on this because this idea of a terrorist threat is what resulted in the mayhem in Iraq?</p>

          <p eId="para_133">I will try to try take in all the questions. In answer to Deputy Rabbitte, I should have said 16 April – May Day was weighing heavily on my mind. While the majority of EU partners are now reopening their offices in Baghdad, we have not made a decision on this. It seems that practically all EU embassies will open there over the summer months. Nobody will move until the UN is in on the ground. That the UN is now there, effectively as equal partners, gives it the mandate to open embassies. We closed our embassy in 1990 and will have to revisit the issue. I do not see this happening immediately as there are issues of resources etc. We will see the embassies opening up quickly.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">Deputy Rabbitte also asked about the Intergovernmental Conference. The convention will conclude and then we will move on to an Intergovernmental Conference fairly quickly. The key areas for us are the institutional issues and these are in part 3. We will seek to establish if there is balance in the institutions. If there is a president of the European Council, we must ask how this will operate <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other positions. I am a member of the group that is sceptical about this. The present rotational system works well. Many people downplay it in a way that is unfair given its advantages. At the same time, I recognise that as we are moving towards 25 members states, and as many as 30, that it is not manageable. When this happens I would prefer to look at the issue of team presidencies. I feel that team presidencies, perhaps four, could be rotated over six or seven years. This would not involve six-month presidencies, rather it would last for a year or 18 months. The Councils could then be divided. For example, Ireland would chair ECOFIN while Luxembourg might chair social affairs. I feel this can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">If there is a president of the European Council, he or she will immediately set up an alternative bureaucracy. While this may not happen overnight, it will happen over a number of years. They will not use the Commission and there will be a clash between the president of the Council and the president of the Commission. Both will play to the Parliament and it will break what has been a successful position. I have vehemently argued against this position.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">My arguments are around the institutional issue and how that works out. Many people that have done much talking about this have not thought it through and I have said that to them. I have had the honour of being a member of the Social Affairs Council for five years, ECOFIN for more than three years and the European Council for six years. While it is easy to expand a theory on these issues, I do not accept some of the arguments and how they were thought out.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">Deputy Kenny asked about the position of Commissioner. We have voted on and passed the Nice arrangement. There will be strict rotation so that when Ireland has a Commissioner, for example, Germany has not, or when Germany has a Commissioner Ireland has not. At least it is a fair and balanced system.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">In reply to Deputy Sargent's question, it is not that there is a move away from our position during the Nice treaty referendum. Some countries, and the Commission itself, are now arguing in favour of an alternative position: they would like to go back to having a Commissioner per member state. The reason I did not support that at Nice was that I thought it would result in a two-tier or three-tier Commission arrangement with a front bench, second bench and third bench. This arrangement is on the table now, but my fear is that, not tomorrow but in three or four years' time, there will be a hierarchy of Commissioners.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_149">The National Advisory Committee on Drugs, for which my Department has responsibility, recently published a study on the prevalence of opiate misuse in Ireland. The estimate is based on statistics provided by three data sources for 2001 – the central drug treatment list, the national Garda study on drugs, crime and related activity and the hospital in-patient inquiry database. The Deputy should note that this is the first formal estimate of the number of opiate users undertaken since the 1996 study carried out by Dr. Catherine Comiskey, which used the same methodology. However, it is important to point out that the 1996 study estimated prevalence for Dublin only.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">The latest study estimates that there were 14,452 people using opiates in Ireland in 2001. The estimated figure for Dublin is 12,456 compared to the 1996 figure of 13,461. The Deputy will agree that the drop in prevalence figures in Dublin is encouraging, as is the finding that the numbers of users in the 15 to 24 age bracket has reduced substantially, which may point to a lower rate of initiation into heroin misuse. Since 1996 the availability of treatment for opiate dependence has increased very significantly and this may be a factor in explaining the latest estimates. For example, there were 1,350 places available on the central methadone treatment list at the start of 1996 compared to the current figure of approximately 6,600.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">As I said at the time of the launch of the NACD study, while many of the study's findings are encouraging, we cannot afford any degree of complacency. The Government remains committed to working in partnership with the communities most affected by drug misuse and the continued implementation of the 100 actions set out in the national drugs strategy remains a priority. I do not feel that any change in direction in the strategy is warranted as a result of this report. However, as the Deputy will be aware, the strategy provides for an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the overall framework by the end of 2004. This will examine the progress being made in achieving the overall key strategic goals set out in the strategy and will enable priorities for further action to be identified and a refocusing of the strategy if necessary.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_152">While I welcome the results of the survey of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, is it not a fact that last week a 16 year old boy was declared by the High Court to be in real danger on the streets of Dublin because there was no temporary place available for him? He was addicted to heroin and needed to go into long-term treatment, but he could not get a place unless he spent two weeks drug-free. The Minister's policy has not provided any place for that  young man. Is it not a fact that only 200 residential places are available in the city of Dublin for the 15,000 addicts who live there? What are the Minister of State's comments on this?</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_153">I am not sure what case the Deputy is speaking about, but it is true that the main emphasis in the strategy was on providing treatment. When the strategy was being formulated and everybody, including community bodies and statutory agencies, was involved in discussion, the main thrust of the strategy was to get people into methadone treatment. That has been the emphasis of the strategy. At the same time, the strategy calls for a range of other drug-free facilities. The numbers might not be enormous, but we have made huge progress in relation to the main part of the strategy, which was to have treatment provided. Now that we have more or less worked off the backlog, we will be able to give more time and attention to the other, drug-free, options.</p>

          <p eId="para_156">Will the Minister of State comment on the statement by Tony Geoghegan, the director of the Merchant's Quay Project in Dublin, that the Government's policies lack flexibility and vision, that there should be far greater availability of counselling, training, education and other ancillary services for addicts so that they may move beyond their addiction and that placing them on methadone maintenance, while it is extremely welcome, is not enough? Only half of the heroin addicts in Dublin are on methadone treatment. What plans does he have to provide services for the 6,500 who are not on methadone nor receiving any service from his Department?</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_157">The strategy is flexible enough to take on board any slight changes that are needed. It is not just about methadone, although that is a central part of the strategy. Training is a very important part of it. Currently, about 1,000 places on community employment schemes are ring-fenced for recovering drug addicts. That is a considerable number, particularly when one considers the pressures under which CE schemes are at the moment. We are dealing with training and that programme is doing a lot of good work.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">It is true that many drug addicts are not involved in treatment and that is why our facilities and our strategy have been aimed towards encouraging them into treatment. For a couple of years there was a huge waiting list. Now, although there has been difficulty in one or two parts of the city, the long waiting lists to get into treatment have gone. In the past, drug addicts would  inquire about getting into treatment and when there were delays they might drift or lapse before receiving an offer of treatment, but now we are practically up to speed in providing treatment and I hope that in the coming months, more people will seek it.</p>

On the other issue, I have previously made it clear that I am looking at the operation and co-ordination of the RAPID programme. I have explained that I intend dividing issues into those to be dealt with at departmental level and those which would more appropriately be dealt with at local level. I have outlined in detail the steps I am taking in this regard and the Deputy can be assured that we are looking at ways of improving the operation of the RAPID programme. We are doing not only that which was promised, but a great deal more.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">Tuigtear dom ó Fhoras na Gaeilge go gcuirtear deontais suas go €10,000 an ceann ar fáil ar iarratas ó chumainn iar-scoláirí i ngaelscoileanna chun córais teagmhála a thionscnamh ina measc agus chun páirt-mhaoiniú a chur ar fáil d'imeachtaí trí Ghaeilge. Chomh maith le sin, bíonn teagmháil neamhfhoirmiúil ag an bhforas le cumainn iar-scoláirí éagsúla agus cuirtear fáilte roimh moltaí nó iarratais a bhaineann le forbairt an ghréasáin eatarthu. Maidir leis an eagraíocht Gaelscoileanna, tuigim gur chuir Foras na Gaeilge bundeontas €327,000 ar fáil di don bhliain 2002. Anuas ar sin, chuir an foras deontas breise €22,000 ar fáil do ghaelscoileanna chun físeán agus bileoga eolais faoi bhláthú ghluaiseacht na Gaelscolaíochta a chur ar fáil don phobal. I measc na n-imeachtaí eile atá maoinithe nó á mhaoiniú ag Foras na Gaeilge ar mhaithe le cur chun cinn na Gaelscolaíochta tá: cúnamh €54,000 do FIONTAR DCU chun físeán a dhéanamh lena gcúrsaí céime agus iarchéime a fhógairt i measc daltaí agus iardhaltaí Ghaelscoileanna; cúnamh €31,000 do Chomharchumann Gaeltachta Chiarraí Theas chun an ghaelscolaíocht a chur chun cinn i gColáiste na Sceilge i gCathair Saidhbhín i 2002 agus i mbunscoileanna máguaird; agus cúnamh €33,000 do Chairde Choláiste Íde Teoranta chun an ghaelscolaíocht a chur chun cinn ina gceantar feidhme.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">Chomh maith leis sin, tuigim go bhfuil suim €50,000 ceadaithe ag Foras na Gaeilge i mbliana le caitheamh ar scéim phíolótach chun nasc a chothú idir iarbhunscoileanna agus bunscoileanna áitiúla ar mhaithe le breis daltaí a mhealladh isteach san iarbhunscolaíocht lán-Ghaeilge agus idir iarbhunscoileanna lán-Ghaeilge mar thacaíocht dá chéile, chun eolas a roinnt le chéile agus chun plé fóram a chothú eatarthu.</p>

Tuigim go bhfuil freagracht ar Fhoras na Gaeilge, go díreach mar atá freagracht ar gach tuismitheoir atá ag tógaint leanaí le Gaeilge agus ar go leor daoine eile. Mar Aire insan Rialtas seo, conas, ina thuairim féin, atá ag éirí leis an maoiniú sin? Conas is féidir feabhas a chur ar an ngréasán atá ann idir iardhaltaí scoile? An gceapann an tAire go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go mbeadh ollscoil ann – ní amháin FIONTAR in Ollscoil Átha Cliath – ach le go mbeimis ag dul i dtreo an lae a mbeadh ollscoil Ghaeilge ann chun go mbeadh áit ag iardhaltaí atá ag teacht ó na meánscoileanna lán-Ghaeilge? Go minic, bíonn siad scaipthe ar fud na háite faoi láthair, ach amháin i gcás FIONTAR agus Ollscoil na Gaillimhe.</p>

Ba cheart iad a chiaradh le féachaint conas atá ag éirí le hiardhaltaí tár éis a laethanta scoile. Tá baol ann, dar liomsa. An nglacann an tAire leis go bhfuil borradh mór faoin nGaeilge ag aois áirithe ach go dtagann meath ar an méid Gaeilge atá in úsáid ag a lán daoine sna fichidí?

          <p eId="para_181">Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom a rá, tá. Thiocfainn leat go bhfuil tábhacht nach beag ag baint le gníomhaíochtaí taobh amuigh den scoil ó thaobh na gaelscolaíochta de. Tá an chonstaic ann, mar a deir an Comhalta, go labharfar Gaeilge sa scoil ach nach labharfar taobh amuigh í. Is minic a chasaimse féin le daoine a fuair oideachas trí mheán na Gaeilge anseo ach nar chleachtaigh an Ghaeilge ina dhiaidh sin. Ar an dtaobh eile den scéal, caithfidh mé a admháil, mar atá ráite agam cheana, gur tháinig mise chuige ar threo eile ar fad, is é sin le rá go bhfuair mé chuid oideachais féin trí Bhéarla, ach bhí mé ag labhairt Gaeilge tar éis dom an scoil a fhágáil. Mar sin, tá mé an-tacúil ar fad do iarrachtaí atá ar bun, bíodh siad ar bun ag Foras na Gaeilge nó ag mo Roinn féin, leis na gréasáin seo atá ag fás taobh amuigh den scoil a láidriú.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Ar ndóigh, tá an t-airgead is mó ariamh anois ag Foras na Gaeilge, agus an chuid is mó de sin maoinithe ag mo Roinn-se. B'fhearr liom gan bheith ag plé le ceist na hollscolaíochta, is é sin, ollscoil Gaeilge. Caithfidh mé cuimhniú, mar shampla, nach raibh ollscoil i nGaillimh go dtí le gairid. Bhí coláiste ollscoile ann. Go deimhin féin, ní ollscoil a bhí in UCG go dtí le gairid ach coláiste ollscoile. Tá ciall leis an gcur chuige sin. Tá mé gníomhach le tamall i gcur chun cinn soláthair cursaí tríú leibhéil trí mheán na Gaeilge, agus cuireann mo Roinn cúnamh ar fáil chuige sin as an mbuiséad Gaeltachta atá againn. Go mór, cuirtear airgead ar fáil go hÁras Mháirtín Uí Chadhain nó Áras Shorcha Uí Ghuairm agus iarrachtaí  eile. Tá méadú air sin, agus tá comhráite ar bun leis an Roinn Oideachais.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">Caithfidh mé a rá i dtaobh na hollscolaíochta tríú leibhéil go bhfuil mé féin go pearsanta den tuairim go mba cheart go mbeadh sé sin dírithe go mór ar éileamh an mhargaidh. Mar shampla, tá a fhios agam go bhfuil margadh ann anois le haghaidh múinteoirí bunleibhéil a bheas in ann múineadh trí mheán na Gaeilge. Tuigim go bhfuil margadh ann ag na meáin chumarsáide do dhaoine atá oilte i gcúrsaí cumarsáide. Tosnaíonn siad le TG4 nó Raidió na Gaeltachta, agus bogann siad ar aghaidh ar mhaithe le comhlachtaí eile, agus is iontach an rud é, mar shampla, an oiread sin ainmneacha Gaeilge a fheiceáil in TV3 agus RTE agus mar sin de – daoine a tháinig ní amháin trí oideachas tríú leibhéil ach trí ollscoil Raidió na Gaeltachta, TG4 agus a lán comhlachtaí eile, más féidir liom é sin a rá. Is rud maith é sin, agus tá mé ag tacú le hiarrachtaí atá ar bun cúrsaí tríú leibhéil a chur ar fáil le cinntiú go mbeadh soláthar á dhéanamh go maith mar atá molta do dhaoine le Gaeilge. Ar ndóigh, fásfaidh sin le Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla (Comhionannas) 2002. Ar an dtaobh eile den scéal, tarraingeoidh sé scoláirí isteach dá bharr, mar feicfidh na mic léinn ag dul isteach go bhfuil toradh cinnte ag an deireadh. Níl aon mhaith i gcúrsa Gaeilge mar mhaith le cúrsa Gaeilge. Is iontach an rud é mar sin go bhfuil sé ag tarlú mar a cuireadh an Béarla ar aghaidh sa tír seo. Má tá toradh cinnte ar a gcuid oibre mar sin, feiceann na mic léinn ag cur isteach ar an gcúrsa go bhfuil seans breise post a fháil ag an deireadh.</p>

Ba é sa ndaonáireamh roimh an gceann deiridh an chéad uair dár cuireadh ceist arbh fhéidir brí a bhaint aisti maidir le húsáid laethúil nó sheachtainiúil na Gaeilge. Foilseofar na mionstaitisticí a bhaineann le húsáid na Gaeilge – ní eolas ar an nGaeilge, mar deir an tríú cuid den phobal go bhfuil eolas acu ar an Ghaeilge – go maith os cionn milliún duine. Tá an figiúr sin úsáideach, go deimhin féin. Deirtear gur beag is fiú é sin go minic, ach tá sé úsáideach. Mar shampla, má bhreanaítear ar lucht féachana TG4 ar chluichí peile nó iománaíochta a chraoltar trí mheán  na Gaeilge, feictear go bhfuil sí ar fáil ag an milliún duine sin. Tá an-spéis agam freisin sna figiúirí don úsáid laethúil agus an úsáid sheachtainiúil. Nuair a bheas siad ar fáil, beidh ciaradh an-láidir á dhéanamh orthu le féachaint an bhfuil an treo ag dul suas nó síos agus an bhfuil aon comhbhá idir, mar a deir an Comhalta féin, iardhaltaí gaelscoileanna agus úsáid laethúil na Gaeilge i measc daoine os cionn 18 bliana daois. Is dóigh liom gur sa rannóg 19-25 ar cheart dó bheith ag breathnú leis an stáidéar sin a dhéanamh, agus bí cinnte go mbeimid á dhéanamh sin.</p>

Allocations from within the budget available for the programme in 2003 have now been agreed by the board of ADM and notified to each partnership and community group.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">ADM must manage the programme from within the budget available in my Department's Vote. This year the Vote of my Department for local development/social inclusion measures is €44.6 million, compared to an allocation of €47.6 million in 2002. This represents a decrease of 6% in the Vote. The reductions in available funding for 2003 are being managed on a sliding scale, ranging from 4% to 7%, depending on the annual budget of the area partnership company or community group.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">As I have outlined to this House on a number of occasions in recent weeks, I am aware that some area partnership companies and community groups had the expectation of carry-over of previous years underspends into 2003. However, my Department must operate, as do all other Departments, on an annual cash basis and not on an accrual basis. Therefore, my Department cannot facilitate a cumulative carry-over of underspends.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">I assure the Deputy that ADM is working closely with the area partnerships to minimise, as far as possible, the impact of the reductions in funding this year. The following tables set out the revised allocations to the various bodies in 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_522">I am unhappy with Minister's response because the partnership companies will tell him, through PLANET, their organisation in Wexford, that there is a shortfall of over €2.2 million in their budgets. Is the Minister aware of this? Did he not meet them on 13 May?</p>
          <p eId="para_523">Is it not a fact that partnerships deal with the most disadvantaged and deprived sections of the  community and that, in particular, the following partnerships have told the Minister that they will not now have adequate resources, particularly for education? Five homework clubs in Longford community resources will be reduced by 20%, the County Wexford partnership will cut its prevention of early school-leaving programme by €55,000 and the County Monaghan  after school clubs programme will be cut by over €8,100.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is savagely cutting third level education programmes which the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, made such a play about. The Clondalkin higher education access project has been cut, and, particularly, the Finglas/Cabra partnership will be reducing its access to third level education programmes by 50% due to the inadequacy of the funding Deputy Ó Cuív is providing to these people. If his Government means anything, it means it is neglecting the communities which are deprived and which are in need, and the partnerships, in particular, are suffering as a result of the cutbacks.</p>

          <p eId="para_525">As I have stated today and before on numerous occasions, the facts speak for themselves. There was a 6% cut in the budget for this programme this year. How that cut was managed and the decision to spread it equally across all the partnerships on a basis that the smaller ones got cut by 4% and the larger ones by 7%, was a matter for ADM. Therefore, if any of the partnership have difficulties regarding specific programmes which they feel should have got priority over other programmes, that matter should be taken up directly with ADM. As Minister, I do not have the control or the power to direct ADM regarding specific projects. I provide the global sum of money which, in this case, is 6% less – no more, no less – than the money in the previous year's Estimate.</p>

          <p eId="para_528">I am not talking about the Minister's budget, which is annual, but the partnerships were budgeting on multiannual funding. They spent approximately €400,000 before Christmas and the remainder of the €2.2 million was drawn down to be paid after Christmas. The partnerships are the victims in this dispute between the Minister and ADM. The partnerships have the poverty programmes and they will implement them if the Minister funds them. The partnerships are the victims of this Government's lack of resource provision to the disadvantaged. The Minister cannot escape the fact that he is the Minister and he must provide the funding. The partnerships had every expectation and are doing a wonderful job. I ask the Minister to reconsider what he has just said. He is effectively saying that he will do nothing to help them at this stage and that as Minister he cannot intervene with ADM. He can intervene if he wishes.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, was able to get €45 mill ion from the budget of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. Surely the Minister can get the €2.2 million that the partnerships require to run these programmes for the deprived and the people who need to access education at either second or third level.</p>

          <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_530">Figures are being thrown around like snuff at a wake. I am amazed at how the figures keep moving. I had a fruitful and positive meeting with PLANET recently. We jointly had a good understanding of the situation. I must reiterate that ADM does not say it has a multiannual arrangement with the partnerships. I cannot find out where this multiannual understanding came into being for the period 2000 to 2003. I accept that prior to that, when it was a European-funded scheme, there was multiannual funding. ADM has informed me that it understood perfectly that when the Estimate was published – approximately €44 million for the year 2003 – it acted on that without demur or any representation to me. It took the decision without reference to me, as was its right, to spread the 6% cut by cutting the funding to the smaller groups by 4% and the larger groups by 7% on a straight line basis without making individual assessments of each case. That was its decision and anybody who is unhappy with that arrangement should refer to ADM.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">This House often amazes me. Ministers are often damned if they do and damned if they do not. We keep insisting on setting up structures independent of Ministers and when those independent structures do something we do not like, we insist on coming back and contradicting ourselves and asking why the Minister does not interfere. ADM was set up as independent of the Minister, the decision has been made and anybody who is not happy should go back to ADM.</p>

          <p eId="para_533">The Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board is an independent statutory body under the aegis of my Department. I understand that the disbursement plan is currently in preparation by the board. When completed, the plan must be submitted to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The board will publish the plan as soon as it receives approval. Decisions on disbursements from the fund will be made by the board as provided for under the legislation. The terms of ref erence of the board in preparing its disbursement plan, and in making disbursements, are clearly set out in sections 41, 42 and 43, as amended, of the Dormant Accounts Act 2001.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Shea</from>
          <p eId="para_535">Will the Minister of State expand on what is meant by "charitable and community purposes"? He stated that the terms of reference of the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board are laid out in the legislation. Will he inform the House who the members of the board are and what instructions were given? Will he say what is the time span for the production of the three-year report? The money is there to be used and the sooner it is used, the better for all those who will benefit from its use.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_536">I will supply the Deputy with a list of the members of the board. It is information which is in the public domain. The board was set up last year and I attended its first meeting last July. We are expecting to receive the disbursement plan soon and certainly before the summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The term "charitable or community" can be used to cover a fairly wide area. It can mean programmes or projects that are designed to assist the personal, educational and social development of persons who are economically, educationally or socially disadvantaged or those with a disability. It is a broad term which covers disadvantage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianOShea" eId="spk_102">
          <from>Mr. O'Shea</from>
          <p eId="para_538">The Minister for Finance is on the record as saying that he hoped money would be channelled in the direction of intellectual disability. If €35 million was sent in that direction this year it would be a great boon to this sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">Deputy O'Dowd has spoken at length on the subject of the CDPs. Could this fund be used to make up the 6% shortfall in funding to ADM and consequently to the community development projects, particularly in regard to the general Government commitment to front-load in the direction of disadvantage? This forms the basis of the RAPID programme. I am concerned that this will drag on. The money is available and there is a great need for it to be used. Will the Minister of State guarantee that the report will be published before mid-year – before the summer recess?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_103">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_540">I do not foresee a delay. The board has been established less than a year and it has a big job to do. Projects or services for the mentally handicapped can certainly be included. The sum of €165 million has recently been transferred for disbursement but no more than €30 million will be disbursed in any one year. It can be used for capital projects or for services. Nothing we receive in the future will be similar to this money because it is a once-off payment. The board will therefore look at capital projects in the main. I am confident that the disbursement plan will be available by the summer, whatever about when the House goes into the summer recess.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianOShea" eId="spk_104">
          <from>Mr. O'Shea</from>
          <p eId="para_541">The board is to produce a three-year plan. The Minister of State has stated that there is approximately €165 million in the fund and it is not envisaged that more than €30 million will be spent in any one year. This indicates that only €90 million would be spent over the three years. Is that the intention and what is the justification for not releasing all the money over the three-year period?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_105">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_542">One year out of the three years is already gone. It could be said that only €60 million will be spent. I suppose the temptation is there to blow the money but we are regarding it as a guideline. The Department of Finance advises us not to spend the money all at once because it is reckonable as part of the indices of Government debt borrowings and spending. I am not an expert in such matters but it would be regarded as part of overall Government spending in those various indices.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">We are considering spending about €30 million a year. If the need arises, we could ask for Department of Finance approval to increase that figure.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Shea</from>
          <p eId="para_544">What is the position regarding insurance policies which have not been claimed? Will that money be added to the fund as it comes on stream next year?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_107">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_545">It will. We have no expectation or estimate yet. The money will not be available to us for another year. We have not even heard an estimate figure. The main function of the dormant accounts legislation that was originally passed was to allow banks and building societies to reunite people with their money. We have all heard of people who have been telephoned by a bank manager and told that an old account in their father's name has been dormant for 40 years. The initial estimate one hears is not necessarily what is transferred. Some €165 million has been acquired for disbursement and an additional 15% has been placed in a reserve account for those who may claim their money at a future date. I am no expert on that.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_547">With regard to the commitment in the programme for Government, officials in my  Department have held discussions with officials from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism on how best to carry out a survey of the availability of recreational facilities in disadvantaged areas. In this context, the Deputy should note that the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism has commenced work on drawing up a new long-term strategic plan for the provision of sports facilities throughout the country. A national audit of local sports facilities will be carried out as part of this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">An inter-agency steering group will be established towards the end of the summer to oversee the national audit of facilities. This group will be chaired by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and will include representatives from my Department, the Departments of Education and Science and Environment and Local Government, the Irish Sports Council and some local authorities. I understand from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism that carrying out an effective and comprehensive national audit of local facilities is a major and complex undertaking which is likely to take a substantial amount of time and resources to complete.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianOShea" eId="spk_109">
          <from>Mr. O'Shea</from>
          <p eId="para_549">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Is it good enough, in the context of the provisions that are made for front-loading under the RAPID programme, that we should have to wait for the outcome of a national audit before this issue is substantially addressed in disadvantaged areas? Given that there are relatively few disadvantaged areas, is it not possible for local authorities to provide a list of the sporting facilities in such areas to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs? The machinery could then be put in place to prioritise those areas and to discriminate in their favour in terms of the disbursement of funding under the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism's scheme.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_110">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_550">The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism has stated that a major review of facilities is a comprehensive task and it is keen to consider the parameters of such a study. It is making it sound like a major project. We are trying to push the Department along, but another fund – the young people's facilities and services fund – is being provided for by my Department in the meantime. This fund was set up when we recognised that disadvantaged areas are not well served for sporting and recreational facilities. Approximately €60 million has been spent under the fund and we are continuing to push for more money to be allocated to it. The national audit of local sports facilities will be conducted, primarily, by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_551">It will be good to complete a survey of the type referred to by the Minister of State, as it will provide major benefits in the future. Can we have a guarantee from him,  however, that the grant payment system will operate on the basis of the survey? A simple survey that is available to everyone shows that the allocation of moneys under the sports programme in recent years has been massively weighted in favour of County Donegal, which happens to be the home county of the former Minister in this area. Similarly, County Kildare, which happens to be home county of the Minister for Finance, also benefited to a massive extent. Other areas, such as counties Monaghan and Cavan, received the crumbs that remained. We need an assurance from the Minister of State that the historic benefits enjoyed by some areas will be taken into account. I urge him to examine the facilities in towns like Monaghan, which does not have a swimming pool. We do not want a survey that will allow such projects to be delayed, as they are vital if communities are to grow. As the Minister for Finance said in the House not so long ago, we cannot have decentralisation without facilities such as swimming pools. There is a knock-on effect. I ask the Minister of State to give an assurance that the survey will take into account the massive benefits given to certain areas that were over-financed in the recent past.</p>

          <from>Ms Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_552">Will the Minister of State consider areas where a fairly comprehensive study has already been conducted and where data is available? A needs and resources study in relation to sporting facilities, which was conducted in Cork city over a two-year period, has been completed in the last 12 months. As we emerge from a period in which we had government by committee, I am worried that we are entering a period of government by survey. Will the money start to flow if the information is available? I have been pointing out for years that it is reprehensible that one of the most successful camogie teams in Ireland, Cork, does not have a pitch of its own. This is an equality issue – I refer to equality of gender rather than social advantage and disadvantage. Will we receive the money to provide what is needed on the basis of the survey in Cork, which has been completed?</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_553">The questions asked by the two Deputies are coming from opposite perspectives, in a way. The programme for Government includes a commitment to complete a national audit of sporting facilities and to put in place a long-term strategic plan to ensure the development of necessary facilities throughout the country. The theory is that the strategic plan should be observed, after it has been completed, when one is dispersing funds. I cannot give an assurance in that regard but I can say that there is no point spending two years conducting an audit and preparing a strategic plan if the Minister then ignores it. I refer to the Department which will be involved in the allocation of funds. Any plan should be put in place for a purpose.</p>

          <p eId="para_558">Is the Minister prepared to indicate the number of staff reductions per year he has been asked to achieve by the Department of Finance? The question in Deputy Cuffe's name was meant to elicit information not only about the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, but also about agencies that are within the Department's remit. Does the Minister accept that there is a danger that many people involved in community development work who are employed on temporary and short-term contracts will lose their positions, for example if their contracts are not renewed, as a result of the fact that this type of threat is hanging over them by Government diktat?</p>

My view is that the Government services should be staffed by reference to the number of people needed to do the job effectively. That is what should inform our staffing levels.</p>

          <p eId="para_569">The two major agencies which are directly funded by my Department are Údarás na Gaeltachta and ADM. They do not have very large numbers of staff. Údarás has a basic level of staff of about 119. If one takes that pro rata across the public service in total – because this relates to the greater public service, I think there is 90% in the health service alone – one will see that any cut across those bodies would be very small and quite manageable within the staffing complements. I presume other bodies refers to CDSPs, partnerships and so on. Normally the staffing levels in these organisations are quite small and it would not have any significant impact on them. If this is followed through on an absolute <i>pro rata </i>basis, which I would not expect to happen, one would be literally talking about fractions of a position. The question could be asked as to how one could have a fraction of a position but with different working systems, work sharing and so on, that is a possibility.</p>

Currently REPS  grants are not being paid because critical people are not in place. Likewise, farm building grants are not being paid because critical people are not in place. Can the Minister guarantee that in his Department he will ensure that critical personnel will be retained and that there will be some common sense approach. Community groups and others should not be asked to bear the same problems as the farming community is today under REPS and farm building grants.</p>

The focus should be on efficient delivery of service rather than simply having numbers. I have always believed that, both in my time working as a manager and as a Minister.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_577">Last weekend saw one of the rarest spectacles in Irish politics – the Fianna Fáil Party in full flight for cover, chameleon-like, led by the Taoiseach, followed by the electorate and all the parties in this House, including a substantial number from his own, on the issue of the reintroduction of third level fees. It says much for the style of leadership of the Taoiseach and for his management of serious political issues that he should publicly back the Minister for Education and Science on a number of occasions in previous weeks and indicate to this House and to the country at large that this matter would be brought to the Cabinet and a decision made there on the final recommendations of the Minister. That did not happen because it became obvious to the Government, both Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, that this was wrong, that the electorate would not wear it and that the concern expressed by Fine Gael, Labour and other parties in the House had risen to a state where it would just not be acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">The Government solved the political problem by finding €15 million, €12 million in the Tánaiste's Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and €3 million in the Department of Education and Science. The Government attempted to cloak this in the guise of concern for disadvantaged and under-resourced communities. It is a pity it would not show the same concern and the same urgency in attempting to solve other problems of the disadvantaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">I suggest that the Taoiseach now instruct that an audit be carried out in each Government Department to see what other moneys are lying  around there that could be used to deal with issues of disadvantaged, under-resourced communities and the underprivileged. This situation has brought about clarity. The Government cannot be trusted and its word cannot be taken. It is bereft of political leadership on serious issues that concern people.</p>

          <p eId="para_593">This package combines substantial improvements in the level and coverage of maintenance grants for those on low to middle incomes. A total of 56,000 students will benefit from the package, 11,000 of them for the first time, which is the highest number that ever benefited from an initiative on the first time. An extra 4,000 students will no longer be required to pay the €670 student service charge. It may help more and more people in disadvantaged communities to get an opportunity to enter third level education. Time will tell but given recent experience following the moves we have taken in the past few years I think that will be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">The package combines substantial improvements in the level and coverage of the maintenance grant for those on low to moderate incomes, while increasing the level of top-up grants. In addition, it will take 4,000 students out of the service charge area. There is also a 15% increase in the level of maintenance grant, which will provide a realistic increase in the level of support to meet the basic living expenses of students from families with low to moderate incomes. Students from these families will receive an increase of €377 over the current rate and that will be extremely beneficial. There has also been a significant extension in the coverage of the maintenance grant eligibility – the full rate of grant will be extended from the current threshold of €28,000 to €32,000, thus, increasing the number of eligible students by more than 5,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">The action group's report on access to third level education recommended the introduction of top-up grants at special rates for those in the lowest income groups and that has also happened. The personal rate of unemployment benefit and assistance is the State-recognised level of support for this purpose. All in all, this has been, as the Minister wished it to be, a significant improvement in the levels of assistance to help those people in disadvantaged communities.</p>

What about the cases where respite care services have been withdrawn because of cuts to the disadvantaged? What about the non-implementation of the educational welfare services?

I watched the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, on "Questions and Answers", claiming that the Fianna Fáil backbenchers stopped the reintroduction of third level fees. Does that mean that the Taoiseach is referring to his own backbenchers as not giving two hells about disadvantage or does he disagree with comical Willie, who even has the moustache to go with it?</p>

          <p eId="para_637">A particular difficulty was highlighted at third level, where we needed to improve the position. I have already answered that. As I have already stated, in every area of education the House would not argue that the provision of 3,500 additional places for special needs assistants in classroom is a pittance. It has been a very important expansion of educational disadvantage programmes, along with Giving Children an Even Break at primary level, the school completion programme at post-primary level and the extension of the home-school community liaison programme for all primary and post-primary schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">I suggest to Deputy Rabbitte that any audit or examination would demonstrate very clearly that this Government has been committed every year, even this year in more difficult times, to providing money in a strong and dedicated way to help with educational disadvantage. We will continue to do as we should do. We have set up the programmes and we now have to put in the people and the effort. Undoubtedly, it is a costly process – Irish education is costing €5.6 billion. It is not very long since the figure passed the €1 billion mark and only a short period since it passed the €3 billion mark. Deputy Noel Dempsey will correct me if I am wrong, but only a few years ago there were only 150 special needs teachers in the Irish educational system. Now there are 3,500.</p>

There are people in this House who know more than me about disadvantaged education as they taught in that area and would know that I have always been committed to it. Now, we have an opportunity to follow on into third level from what we did in first and second level education. Five years ago, the expenditure on disability and disadvantage at third level was only €500,000 out of a total spend of €2.9 billion. Now, at least, we are beginning to spend respectable resources – I will not say it is too much – having increased the figure from €26 million prior to this issue. I am very glad we have achieved that.</p>

Can he not even answer the question now? As regards the €12 million which Deputy Harney discovered in her bottom drawer when she went to St. Luke's, is the Taoiseach aware that one of his own backbenchers spoke in the House, the week before last, in connection with the savaging of the community employment scheme in the Minister's Department and the stopping of recruitment for the job initiative scheme? If the Minister had €12 million lying in her bottom drawer, why could she not devote it to the cuts in her own Department affecting the most disadvantaged communities? This is robbing one section of the disadvantaged for another section, in order to get the Taoiseach's Minister off his own petard, where he had impaled himself. Will the Taoiseach tell the House from where the €42 million is coming? The Minister for Finance had stated that no more money would be provided for education. From where is this €42 million supposed to come? Why could Deputy Harney not devote that €12 million windfall to tackling real disadvantage in her own area, where communities are being ravaged because of the undermining of the community employment scheme? What does "windfall" mean? Are there other windfalls around the various Departments?</p>

Disadvantaged areas have also been supported by the new RAPID programme for the BMW region. Where there are some difficulties, they have been highlighted. The budget in the social economy area supports the development of enterprise, into which resources have been put. Deputy Harney has followed a consistent programme with less resources than she previously had. Any additional resources picked up in her budget or any other budget have gone towards targeting disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">Deputy Rabbitte can be assured that the resources provided from that Vote and from the  work in which the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was also involved with Global Crossing Limited will assist the addition for the remainder of this year and the full amount will be provided in the Estimates for next year.

Is he aware, to give but one example, that the North-Eastern Health Board, at its meeting yesterday, reported a variance €3.25 million from budget for the first three months of the year to 31 March? That represents an excess of 2.9% on the provision for that period. When the pay element is removed, the figure grows to 6.26%.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Is the Taoiseach aware that, in answer to questions from this Deputy, the chief executive officer of that health board stated clearly that further cuts will be needed in the areas of care for the elderly and acute hospital services, so that the board can meet the Department's demand for a break-even position by the end of this year? He also acknowledged that further difficulties for patients and clients would be inevitable. The chief executive officer stated that, while every effort would be made to reduce the hardship and inconvenience which would be suffered, there was no question but that the board would have to ensure that further cuts would be imposed in these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">How can the Taoiseach possibly justify a continuation of the policy of cuts which are already hurting and harming the lives of the most disadvantaged and marginalised within our communities?

          <p eId="para_658">I am aware of some difficulties in some of the hospitals. Back in January, when the Minister for Health and Children received almost €1 billion in extra resources, he asked the various health boards and other hospitals – the Dublin teaching hospitals – to put forward their service plans. Some of those hospitals had overruns from a previous year under the 1996 legislation and that became a first call on the figures for this year. They then had to manage that within their budget because, as the Minister said, there would not be Supplementary Estimates this year. That has created some difficulties. I am not aware of the details of what the North-Eastern Health Board stated yesterday. They signed up to their service plan for this year in February, which is three months ago. They knew what the service plan would be and they received sufficient resources to deal with it. The Minister and his officials have been dealing with the various health boards and chief executive officers on these issues. In January-February agreement was reached on the figures and service plans, which is the procedure that is in operation. If there are difficulties the issue should be taken up with the Minister's officials or the health board who agreed the plans.</p>

It was introduced by the chief executive officer and the Minister for Health and Children. Those who did not sign up to the plan included the Taoiseach's own party members on the North-Eastern Health Board who could not accept the per capita allocation in the north east, recognising it was totally and absolutely inadequate for the board to provide the services which are expected of it. Does the Taoiseach understand that the strictures of his Department on the boards will ensure there will be ever deeper cuts in the whole area of home help hours, respite and day care and a whole host of services for the most vulnerable in society? He claimed in recent days to be the champion of the disadvantaged. How does he expect these steps, already taken over the first three months and now to be expanded in the coming nine months, will in any way address the needs of the disadvantaged in our society? Will the Taoiseach explain, as other Deputies have sought to find out, how at the eleventh hour, the Government was magically able to provide essential moneys to address one area of need, yet people who are queuing up the length and breadth of this jurisdiction for hospital services and are in need of real community-based care, includ ing home help, respite care and residential care, cannot get an extra euro from the Government to meet their needs this year?

At the weekend the Minister for Transport indicated that he proposed to privatise the Dublin Port tunnel, which would involve charging motorists in Dublin and those using the port €100 million per year for the benefit of using this public infrastructure. What legislation, either primary or secondary, will be introduced in the House to bring about this change? A very different proposal was put to the people at the time detailed public inquiries were held into the operation and building of the tunnel. If the Government is proposing to change the ground rules, we need to see proper secondary legislation and a debate on the subject.</p>

        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_547">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_1011">Before resuming my contribution on this Bill, I had the advantage of hearing the opinions of various organisations on the effects of the Bill. We have also had several opportunities to hear the philosophy that underlines the legislative programme of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">The Human Rights Commission has made a strong submission to the Oireachtas Joint Com mittee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights which deals with aspects of the Immigration Bill. It states, along with the UNHCR and others who are working with asylum seekers, that there are a number of areas in which the Bill may breach important international protocols. The submission mentions the fact that Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provides everyone with the right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution, might be breached. It states that Article 31 of the convention relating to the status of refugees, which provides for contracting states not to impose penalties on refugees, may be breached. Most important, according to the submission, Article 33 of that convention, the important guarantee of non- <i>refoulement</i> whereby each state is obliged not to send back any person in any manner whatsoever to a country in which he fears persecution if he returns, may be breached. On all those grounds, this is a defective Bill and the Minister is obliged to return to this House with a Bill that properly reflects our commitments in international agreements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">The Minister should state in his reply to Second Stage whether he agrees with these criticisms and, more important, whether he agrees with the right of the Human Rights Commission to make such a submission criticising the failings they see in this Bill. Recently the very same Minister sought aggressively to attack another civil servant in the performance of his duty, namely the outgoing Ombudsman and Information Commissioner, who was performing exactly the same role in regard to concerns he had about the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill. A Minister who behaved in that manner then is likely to behave in the same manner now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">We have also heard, since I last had the opportunity of speaking in the House on this issue, an extraordinary speech by the Minister in which he spoke about the culture of human rights speak and attacked the notion of a rights-based society – a philosophy that will permeate all legislation the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform intends to introduce here. Most obviously, it can be applied to the long-awaited disability Bill and the rights of those with disabilities. This specific legislation can also be applied to asylum seekers and refugees. If rights are to be defined as the Minister recently defined them in his speech, then we are much poorer as a society. He is dividing up the notion of rights between civil and political rights and economic and social rights. He says that social and economic rights should not be defined or put in constitutional or legislative form; that if they come about they should do so by way of recognition of the workings of Parliament and that it is the benevolence of Parliament that will decide whether citizens have rights in social or economic areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">The Minister might see himself as a type of latter day Edmund Burke but even he must recog nise that this is a Chamber that does not operate to the highest levels of parliamentary democracy. We do not have a parliamentary form of Government; we have an Executive that largely determines what is decided, when it is decided and what resources are provided for particular measures. A Minister who suggests that rights in relation to asylum seekers and refugees will somehow be defined for citizens and residents in our country is a Minister who is playing fast and loose with reality. This is a Government that will never grant such rights because it is philosophically disinclined to give rights to those it believes are not entitled to them. It is because the Government makes the definitions and decides how resources are divided that we need, in constitutional and legislative form, a defined series of rights for all members of our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">The Minister will also need to respond to the point that Ireland is probably already in breach of Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in that people are being turned away from this country at the point of entry even if seeking the right of asylum. A recent newspaper article affirmed this fact and the Irish Refugee Council has also stated that there is growing evidence of asylum seekers being refused entry at Dublin and Cork Airports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">It is ironic that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is bringing in a Bill to introduce controls which, in practice, are already in operation by officials of the State. We also need to be concerned that in the long run, the trend of European Union anti-immigration laws seems to go even further. It has been proposed that legislation be introduced stating that where a person does not have a return flight, that person will be deemed to be a person who should no longer be in the country. This is being talked about and will possibly take the form of a directive to be adopted by all member states of the European Union. We then get into the very grey area of whether we are using such laws to affect genuine asylum seekers and refugees. Will they be applied as they were in the case of a noted Zimbabwean human rights lawyer travelling from a French airport to this country last week? If we are turning away people on the most tenuous of grounds even though they have a legitimate right to travel, we have already lost an important battle in regard to the standards of decency that should prevail in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">A further irony is that the Minister, as a result of discussions taking place at European Union level, is obliged to introduce the immigration and residents Bill in this House. If such a Bill is to come before us, why are we debating the Immigration Bill 2002? The Minister has, in his public pronouncements, given the impression that he is a "can do" Minister who is tackling problems but he can, in every aspect, be seen to be failing in terms of not living up to what he is saying in public and not providing any political back-up for what he is promoting in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">I made the criticism in the past that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible, with 37 proposed Bills, for most of the legislation on the Order Paper. Yet, we have no date in relation to the introduction of more than half of them. The propensity of another Minister to invent legislation was mentioned earlier on the Order of Business. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has an additional skill in that he goes so far as to give such legislation a title, yet none of us knows whether there is any intent behind it or whether we, as Members of the Dáil, will have an opportunity of examining such legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">I will return now to the Human Rights Commission's criticisms of this Bill. It is clear from the sizeable submission presented to the joint committee that a precedent exists in international case law that what the Minister is proposing in this legislation cannot, given existing standards, be applied at an international level. The Minister needs to take responsibility for legislation with which the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees disagrees.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">Now that the Minister has returned to the House, I will repeat the three criticisms made by the Human Rights Commission in regard to this legislation and perhaps he might respond to them later in the debate. The Commission said it is likely this Bill will breach three international conventions, Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Articles 31 and 33 of the convention relating to the status of refugees. I also asked earlier if the Minister agrees with the correctness of the Human Rights Commission making such a submission because he appeared to have difficulty with officers of the State taking on a similar role in regard to other legislation in the past. The Human Rights Commission has done a good job in putting forward a critique which needs a response. I have yet, as a Member of this House, to hear the Minister or other members of the Government commenting on whether there is validity in such criticisms and what changes, if any, we intend making to this particular legislation to make it better.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">Based on the Human Rights Commission's criticisms, the fact that we are already breaching the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by turning away asylum seekers at airports, the criticism of the Irish Refugee Council and the fact that European Union legislation is heading in an even more draconian direction and is not supported by the majority of people in this country let alone in this House, the Minister needs to take this Bill away and reintroduce it rather than subject it to the wholesale number of amendments it will need on Committee Stage to make it a worthy Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#ConorLenihan" eId="spk_548">
          <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1023">Deputy McDowell has again proved himself an active Minister, presenting legislation which in many ways is long overdue. We, as a country, have been the subject of unforeseen and unforecastable net inward  migration in recent years. The extent of this is challenging and would be so for any Deputy who would be in charge of the justice portfolio at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">Over the past seven years we have seen an astounding level of inward migration. To illustrate that, we are talking about a net inflow of 20,000 people per year. From 1999 to date, 100,000 non-European economic area nationals applied for work permits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">In 2002, 93,000 people registered or renewed their work permit applications. That illustrates the extent to which we must be careful of the systems which we designed for a period when this was not a country which was a source of immigration but which traditionally – for obvious reasons of poor economic performance and other historical factors – exported its people to other countries. For all those reasons, we were singularly inept and unable to deal with this crisis when it broke.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">I am reminded again of the period prior to the 1997 election when we had a confused response to this issue from the rainbow Government. There seemed to be a kind of occupational schizophrenic or sclerotic response from the then Government, which was not able to make up its mind then or in its period in Opposition to this Government and the previous one which came into office in 1997. The rainbow Government was not prepared or able to make up its mind as to what policy it favoured in this whole area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">That is something of which one cannot accuse the Minister, Deputy McDowell, or his predecessor, Deputy O'Donoghue. They made a clear policy and philosophical choice, that we would be firm but fair. They made clear that we would be fair to genuine asylum seekers looking for the protection of the Irish State under the UN Charter, but firm towards those who are abusing the system and undermining the chances of the genuine asylum seeker from achieving the status he or she might seek.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">The dramatic figures are there for everybody to see. Some 90% of all the applications for asylum are rejected and the number of people who, having lodged their applications, simply do not show up for the requisite interview to establish whether they are genuine, is quite astounding. The figure, on which the Minister may correct me when he replies, is of the order of 47%. In the subsequent appeals process, an astounding 11% of people do not show up, even though they have gone to the bother of appealing. That demonstrates that there are clear signs, although these are anecdotal because one can never be precise in these matters because we cannot physically trace or track down these people who have simply disappeared. One cannot establish scientifically whether they are abusing the system but the odds are that they are doing so if they do not bother to show up. This Bill addresses that issue in a timely way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">For those people who do not give an address on applying for asylum on arrival in Ireland, there  is also a new requirement in the Bill that they have five working days to give notice of their address to the authorities. That is reasonable, given that at present there are about 1,000 people who have arrived, invoked the asylum procedures and said they are political refugees fleeing persecution, but who have disappeared having lodged their application and made that particular cry for help in seeking asylum status. It is extraordinary that there could be 1,000 such people. The Minister is deciding to close down this loose procedure, mainly because we as a country were not prepared to deal with this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">As every Member will be aware, up to about seven or eight years ago we were a relatively culturally and ethnically homogenous society. One of the most unpleasant aspects of representational politics in Ireland in the 1990s and at the turn of the century is the horrible underbelly of racism which has been exposed by our enormous economic success. It is clear that in my own constituency and, according to what I hear from colleagues, also in other constituencies, particularly in urban areas – I do not know about and cannot speak for rural areas – there is a horrible undercurrent of racism in this society towards people of a different colour, towards genuine people coming here to work and even towards genuine asylum seekers. It is a great tribute to all the Members—</p>

          <p eId="para_1034">—language restraint that is applied in this House regarding race and immigration that we have not evolved a racist political party or structure. As we see in Austria, Germany, France, Italy or any of the so-called modern and allegedly advanced European nations, they have dysfunctional attitudes and relationships regarding immigrant populations within their boundaries. Happily that has not arrived here. There have been a few disgusting incidents or nasty attacks, but they are in the minority, rather than mainstream or quotidian or a regular part of the streetscape. It is not as common as is experienced in some of those European countries that I have mentioned, where one can talk about systematic abuse and physical attacks on immigrants. That has not happened here. The groups which represent refugees and people who come  to these shores, say that threatening language is used and that there are racist attitudes. I do not believe it is as bad as that, but there is a nasty racism nonetheless and it is the role of every responsible Member of this House to denounce that for what it is – a fraudulent prejudice of the worst kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">One of the most important issues on which the Minister, Deputy McDowell, is following his predecessor is in arguing that we must be fair but firm. We cannot expect that we can operate an open door. I throw down this challenge because it is not so long ago – I think it was during the last Dáil – that the Labour Party was an advocate of an open door policy with regard to immigration. I would like to know whether, under the new leadership of Deputy Rabbitte, that is still Labour Party policy. Is it still the Labour Party's intention to open the doors to all inward migration from wherever it comes? If that were the case, it would be interesting at a time when our finances and economy are significantly challenged by events beyond our shores regarding the global economy. I wonder is that still the Labour Party policy because it was rightly condemned as crazy in the last Dáil and if it is still the policy, it is even crazier now. Unfortunately I do not think this country could support an open door policy in economic, social or cultural terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">Is it still Fine Gael policy to allow people who are applying for asylum status to work while their application is being process? I put that question deliberately because that was the policy three Fine Gael leaders ago. Deputies opposite may correct me if I am wrong. I am not sure whether in the transition from Deputy John Bruton to Deputy Noonan, and now to the third and perhaps least effective incarnation of all, Deputy Kenny—</p>

We all know the effect that would have on the employment scene  in Ireland. We are all aware of the inequity it would breed in this country whereby people in a vulnerable position applying for asylum status would be systematically exploited for a short period by employers who would be aware that those workers would be deported if their application was refused.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">The Opposition response to this issue is hypocritical. It resorts to a liberal critique of this Minister and his predecessor as being tough and as eroding civil liberties. This is utter nonsense. Many of the changes being implemented in this area are directly in response to the fact that our island neighbour, the United Kingdom, or Britain as it is sometimes called, has decided to tighten up its rules and regulations. We had to respond regarding the social welfare code and provisions for the same reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">The Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Tim Dalton, stated at a meeting in the last session of the Committee of Public Accounts that Ireland had become and was perceived to be a soft touch as far as illegal immigrants were concerned. In other words, when Nora Owen was Minister for Justice, Ireland was being advertised on every website as being a soft touch and a place to go for illegal or economic migrants seeking to land their boat somewhere in Europe. That was the position during the time of the Government previous to the Government of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. The laws were applied fairly loosely.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">This legislation will tighten up regulations dealing with the "no-shows" and the issue of an address which must be supplied within five days or else the application will be deemed to be invalid and the person will be deemed to be in the country illegally. It deals with the matter of "no-show" for the first interview which is an essential part of determining whether a person is a genuine refugee seeking status here. If a person consistently fails to appear for the appeal hearing it is clearly indicative that the application is not serious and should not be treated as such.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">The Bill also deals with the question of carrier liability.

          <p eId="para_1087">Issues of asylum and immigration have become increasingly important for Ireland and its citizens since I was first elected to the Dáil in 1997. We have a more diverse and multi-cultural society than ever before. The past six years have seen an unprecedented number of people coming to live and work in Ireland. There has been an unprecedented number of applications for asylum. Most Irish people have greeted these changes in an open-minded and hospitable manner, which is exactly what we should expect of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">New ethnic communities have been formed. Our children are learning from the cultures of people from many parts of the world. The children of such people, in turn, are enjoying Irish culture, such as our native language, music and national games. I am happy to say that I have had first-hand experience of such developments in terms of traditional Irish music, song and dance and a developing and interesting command of our own language in my community in County Monaghan. Tragically, we have also seen a persistent racism among sections of the community. This has manifested itself in many ways, such as silent hostility, verbal attacks and vicious physical assaults on people because of their skin colour or ethnicity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">The Government's response to the need to develop better asylum and immigration legislation and practice has been totally inadequate. It falls far short of the leadership given by those who have worked to ensure that those who come to live among us are greeted justly and fairly. I will resume my contribution when the Minister, Deputy McDowell, has finished his <i>tête-à-tête</i> with his official, as my words are directed at him. Perhaps the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would like to ask the Minister to pay attention, as he might actually learn something. This is a very serious and important issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_1091">I am delighted that the Minister has chosen to grace the debate on this subject with his presence and his attention. Let me say at this juncture that the manner in which the Minister's colleague, Deputy Conor Lenihan, challenged Fine Gael earlier was very interesting. The Deputy clearly believes that refugees and asylum seekers should not be granted the dignity of the right to work while their applications are being processed. I have no difficulty in affirming in the House this evening, as I have done on many occasions in the past, that I believe such people should be granted the dignity of the right to work. Deputy Lenihan's comments wound these unfortunate people. He proceeded to insult Irish employers by saying that they would either  exploit or take advantage of the status of these unfortunate people. Surely we can legislate against exploitation, if necessary, rather than legislating to exclude, as this Government has done repeatedly and as this Bill seeks to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">This Immigration Bill is the latest in a series of flawed enactments in the area of immigration and asylum introduced by this Administration since 1997. My colleague, Deputy Ó Snodaigh, who is Sinn Féin's spokesperson on justice, equality and law reform, has put on the record my party's opposition to the Bill and has urged the Minister, Deputy McDowell, and the Government to withdraw it. I reiterate that call this evening. This Bill should be withdrawn and completely rewritten in consultation with those who deal most directly with asylum seekers and immigrants and who are aware of the reality. At the very least, it should not go to a select committee after Second Stage has been passed by the House. It should be the subject of joint committee hearings so that the many organisations and individuals who have expressed grave concerns about its implications can outline in detail their case for a different and better Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">The Government should listen, in the first instance, to the substantial body of opinion that is opposed to the Bill, which includes the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, Amnesty International and the Irish Refugee Council. It will be a serious setback if the Government proceeds with this Bill in the face of such opposition on the part of those who are respected nationally and internationally. The principal objection to this legislation is that it introduces the principle of carrier liability. In a State such as this, which can be entered only by sea or air or across the Border, carrier liability amounts to an end, in effect, of the right to claim asylum as we know it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1097">The carrier liability provisions amount to an end of the right to claim asylum as we know it. They mean that the staff of ferries and airlines will, in effect, become immigration officers and adjudicators on the right to asylum. The Government cannot credibly argue that this does not affect the right to claim asylum. Carriers will be penalised if they carry passengers without proper documentation. It is the nature of genuine asylum seekers – those fleeing persecution – that very often they do not have proper documentation and have to escape  from countries under false names. This Bill will turn the carrier into a barrier. It does not provide for a right of appeal or the application of the hitherto internationally recognised right to claim asylum. The Government has, quite rightly, condemned the heinous practice of trafficking in human beings and I join it in condemning this absolutely. We have seen a number of examples of smugglers causing the tragic deaths of unfortunate people seeking to come to this jurisdiction. I deplore the activities of such ruthless people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">What will this Immigration Bill do? This Bill and similar legislation, including EU legislation which the Minister was quite right to mention, will turn Europe into a fortress. Similar legislation throughout fortress Europe will drive people into the hands of smugglers. It will have the contrary effect to that claimed by the Minister and his co-drafters in the Department. It can only result in further tragedy. Only this week, the Irish Refugee Council stated that people are being deported from the State without being given the chance to claim asylum and without getting the opportunity of a hearing. They are being turned away at the airports without being given the normal courtesy of an opportunity to present their cases. They are being deported on the next flight. This amounts to summary deportation – I cannot describe it in any other way. People's rights are being violated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">Genuine asylum seekers are being returned to situations of danger. I have no doubt that this is the case and that it will result in tragedies in other jurisdictions in other circumstances, which will reflect on Government policy and how it is enacted. The Irish Refugee Council has publicly stated that people in the prison system and in airports have contacted them to express concern at these deportations. These are people in the employ of the Government in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who are expressing concern. The council also pointed out that although the Government was offered EU funds to provide human rights monitors at airports and ports, it has not taken up the offer. Will the Minister confirm if that is the case? If it is, will he explain it to the House. I urge him to take up the offer and appoint such monitors in line with the offer from the EU, which he and his colleagues are sometimes wont to quote.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">The Bill is fundamentally flawed. It is a major backward step for asylum seekers and it does not address the reality of immigration and the rights of immigrants. In recognition of the time I will leave my notes aside and stand before the Minister – as I did before his predecessor, Deputy O'Donoghue – and appeal to him to listen, to take heed of the heartfelt appeals of Deputies in this House. It is not a matter for political sword fencing. This is a matter of firm and fundamental belief systems. There is a challenge here. There are levels on which we agree but there are clear and fundamental areas of disagreement. The Minister and his colleagues must take on board  the words not only of Deputies but those of the many eminent bodies working at the coalface with refugees and asylum seekers. He must pay heed and listen not only to the nationally-respected organisations but to the internationally-respected ones who have clearly voiced their disagreement and opposition to the proposed legislation. I urge the Minister to withdraw the Bill and to engage with all of that opinion. In the event that that is not his decision, I ask him to refer it to the joint committee in order that a proper hearings procedure can be put in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_1101">We can rely on Deputy Conor Lenihan to carry the torch to ensure that we will no longer be accused of being soft on immigration. If the Minister's resolve on immigration issues ever weakens he should join the Deputy in the Dáil bar where he will no doubt be informed that he is not going far enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">While non-nationals seeking asylum or refugee status constitute a significant minority, their integration into mainstream society has been slow. There has been much discussion about how we deal with our new and expanding role as hosts to a large number of asylum seekers and immigrant workers. There will be difficulties in this role because we all have racist tendencies, whether we like to admit it or not. Tensions will always exist between cultures unless there is an effort towards understanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">Over the course of the debate on this Bill last April and today we have spoken about many issues relating to the refugee council. However, a system has existed in the field of health care for a number of years that is less well known. There has been a form of institutionalised racism in our health services for years. We still treat many of the non-EU doctors in the health service very badly. If we have such a negative approach towards these non-national doctors why should we be surprised to find out that the overall feelings of the population is negative towards non-nationals, especially those of African or Asian descent? We are not doing enough to combat racism in society and we have never done so. Non-EU doctors make up some 80% of the non-consultant hospital doctors in hospitals outside the major urban areas of Dublin, Cork and Galway. A significant number of these doctors also hold temporary consultant contracts in these hospitals. If anything were to happen to the availability of non-national doctors the effects would be the closure of more hospitals than even the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, would expect in his wildest dreams. We await what will emerge in the report which is due in the next four to five weeks in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">The recent threatened closure of the accident and emergency department of Wexford General Hospital was due to one non-national doctor returning to Pakistan and another one being accepted for specialised surgical training in the national health service of the United Kingdom. We have allowed our health system to become  dependent on non-EU doctors because so few of our own doctors have the desire or the inclination to work in our health system which is increasingly falling apart and becoming much more bureaucratic than it was even ten years ago. Many of the non-national doctors stay in Ireland for the full seven years that their temporary registration with the Medical Council allows. In that time they provide medical service to the people of Ireland which is vital in keeping smaller hospitals across the country open. Many such doctors bring their families with them and they go to Irish schools, make Irish friends and, as the saying goes, they become more Irish than the Irish themselves. When the seven-year period is up they are no longer allowed to practice as doctors because they are not able to get temporary registration to work here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105">The Medical Council has made changes to the regulations to allow these doctors apply for full registration so they can continue to work here. These amendments must be sanctioned by the Minister for Health and Children. To my knowledge, no doctor has yet been affected but the deadline is fast approaching for many. Meanwhile, the amendments have been with the Department since last June. This constitutes a significant issue for those doctors who have given so much to our health service, who are prepared to continue to work in our shambles of a health service and yet the amendments have not yet been signed off. If this is the way we treat non-nationals who are vital to our citizens well being then it should come as no surprise that we have a lackadaisical attitude to the rights and anxieties of asylum seekers and refugees.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">The Immigration Bill will slow down the number of asylum seekers reaching our shores. As has been pointed out, genuine refugees do not get the time to get their documentation in order. As a GP I have dealt with asylum seekers and while I agree with some Government members, I would like to try to view the situation with more understanding. Many asylum seekers could be classed as economic migrants. Regrettably, we are afraid to voice these opinions in a public forum or even in Dáil Éireann because we could easily stand accused of racism. Significantly, by not saying that these abuses exist in the system where people can claim asylum does a disservice to asylum seekers who need our understanding of their plight. I would not like to go down the road of Deputy Conor Lenihan who was almost trying to incite those who disagreed with his opinions. If that is the way he talks about such things in Dáil Éireann, I would hate to think what he says to his constituents in the privacy of his clinics.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">A great deal of legislation in regard to this issue will be forthcoming from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is a complex subject but if we are serious about making real changes in society we have to look at the issue of racism from a social point of view. There are a number of social factors and, as has been pointed out both directly and indirectly, we still have a  very negative reaction towards asylum seekers and to refugees and immigrants in general. I hope that in the course of the debate on this Bill and future legislation on this issue, we will have a more enlightened approach to how we deal with it.</p>

I do not blame the Progressive Democrats for not taking him too seriously either because his comments are not worthy of a response.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">I want to ask the Minister a few questions which he might answer when he is replying to the debate. First, does the Government have any agreement with China concerning the number of Chinese people coming into this country?

          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_1111">I thank the Minister. We are the most racist country in the world and there is no point in pretending otherwise. The Irish have travelled the world and I come from a county where emigration was a password. When a person reached 18 years of age, or even younger, he or she took the boat to Britain, America or whatever other state would accept him or her. Listening to many people who have come back here to retire, they are probably more racist today than when they left. Look at the way we have treated our own Travelling community – it is the greatest national disgrace. We must all share the blame for this because, as elected public representatives, we have not tried to delve into that serious problem. Travellers have been discriminated against since the foundation of the State and are still, even to this day. They feel that with all these people coming into the country they have fallen further behind and do not count, but that is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">I do not disagree with what the Minister is proposing in the Bill. For the sake of the economy, we cannot allow thousands of people to come into the country every week, although as an EU member state we have to accept our quota. There is nothing wrong with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">What precautions will be put in place at regional airports? I have received complaints that many immigrants arrive in Britain and then fly into our regional airports. That is how they are getting into the State undetected and they then apply for asylum or work permits. The Bill places a responsibility on airports, ports and lorry drivers and they should accept such a responsibility. We have seen refugees and asylum seekers  emerging from lorries arriving in our ports. We also saw a terrible tragedy at Rosslare a number of years ago when a number of stowaways died of suffocation in a lorry. Trafficking in human beings is wrong and must be dealt with. The traffickers must be taken on and hunted, whether they are operating inside or outside the State. Anybody assisting the traffickers here must also be tracked down.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">I have already written to the Minister about a constituent of mine who has been in this country for many years. I hope the Minister can see fit to allow that man to stay in the State because his life will be at risk if he returns to his country of origin. He is the most intelligent man I have ever met; he can speak French, Spanish and English better than some people in this country. He is seeking asylum and wishes to be able to travel in and out of the country freely. He also wishes to correspond with his own people living abroad to assist them to deal with the terrible dictator in his home country. I will provide the Minister with further details of this case, if he so wishes. I would like the Minister to meet this man who is the brightest person one could ever meet. One would think he had been living here for 20 years. He would like to be able to come in and out of this country to help his own people who are living under a dictatorship in their own country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">Asylum seekers should be allowed to work from the date of their arrival. Some people think asylum seekers should not be permitted to work, while others think that everything is provided for them. Many asylum seekers would like to be able to work. Every morning on the Order of Business I admire the sight of school children sitting in the Gallery. We now have people of different races coming into the State and we can see such children mixing with one another. They think nothing of working and communicating with each other, which is great. Children of different racial backgrounds are now participating in GAA games, including hurling. It is great to see them becoming involved in their local communities and that is happening because many such immigrants are being allowed to work and earn a living.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">I do not disagree with the Bill on the basis that there has to be some security in the State and, in addition, we have to be able to watch who is entering the country and leaving it. We cannot allow an overflow of people to come in every week. Last year, some 20,000 people applied for asylum and the Department will have to deal with that. It is taking too long to deal with people who make asylum applications and it is the same with applications for work permits. People want to enter the work place and people want to employ them, but if they have not got a work permit they could be prosecuted for working illegally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">I heard Deputy Conor Lenihan speaking about employers who take on illegal immigrant labour but there are good and bad employers. Some employers will take advantage of immigrants, while others will look after them, treat them with  respect and pay them a proper wage. There will always be rogue employers who will hire such people illegally and not pay them properly. That is something with which the Government and society generally, will have to deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">We often introduce legislation but do not put in place the necessary protections, or empower people through proper resources, to deal with the aftermath of its enactment. In many cases concerning legislation we have failed to provide sufficient money and resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">The Government recently made a decision concerning "detention centres"– I am using that term because people do not have free movement while they are waiting to be assessed by the Department. It is wrong to place 20 or 30 immigrants in a hostel and not allow them out into the general community. Where possible, these people should be given rent allowances. The Government has changed the legislation so that such allowances are no longer permitted and immigrants must reside where they are placed by the local health board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">This country has gained from immigration and we should not be too restrictive. We should allow a fair quota of people to enter the country. I live in a county from where tens of thousands of people emigrated. It is a pity that Deputy Lenihan is not here now. In recent years the Department of Social and Family Affairs penalised many returning emigrants when sterling and the dollar were strong. At the next Cabinet meeting, the Minister, Deputy McDowell, should ask his colleague the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, to examine this matter. Now that the euro is strong she should top up the pensions of such people because she took money off them for some years. I will start a campaign about this tomorrow morning, and every morning, on the Order of Business until social welfare officers give these people the dues to which they are entitled. These are people who emigrated in the past and now have to be looked after. I hope the Minister, Deputy McDowell, will support my point in Cabinet because he is a fair-minded man. These people worked abroad but could not afford an Irish pension when they came back. They were penalised by this State because sterling was strong at the time. However, sterling is weak now and the euro is strong, so the Government should deal with this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">We are racist in this country but people are beginning to realise that, whether we like it or not, we will have a mixed culture. Every town and village will have to play its part in dealing with racists by taking them on. We have to support immigrants and make them feel wanted, but we must also grant them their pride by allowing them to work and their children to attend school. They must also be able to access the health system. We must give them the backup they need. If we do so, they will be good citizens, paying their taxes and not depending on the State. Many of them do not currently have work permits but if they  had that opportunity they would not require such welfare allowances.</p>

          <p eId="para_1122">I would be the last person to restrict the scope of debate in this Dáil or the range of points which Deputies wish to make. However, when Government Deputies come to speak on legislation, among the wide-ranging points they might like to make, they should actually refer occasionally to the Bill. They should give the House a view on the proposed legislation under the guise of which they speak. In fairness to Deputy Conor Lenihan of Fianna Fáil, I would not expect of him an ability to raise the legal or parliamentary discourse in the House to the zenith of intellectual capacity. However, we should have heard views on the proposals which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is bringing before the Dáil, together with reasoned arguments in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">I would have expected that, prior to the continuation of this debate, the Minister might consider withdrawing the Immigration Bill 2002, in view of the cogent and reasoned arguments made regarding it by many of those who work at the coalface of immigration, with particular reference to the problems of refugees – people seeking shelter on our shores. Some relevant points have been made. In replying to the debate, there is an onus on the Minister to respond specifically to those points. This Bill is designed to frighten transporters and carriers into a policing role for the immigration service and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That is entirely wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">In a speech on 10 December 2002 to a civil rights organisation, the Minister said that he was looking to enact the Immigration Bill 2002, whose provisions on carrier liability will allow a more effective policing of our borders and assist in combating illegal immigration and trafficking. In reality, the Minister is making transport companies and their employees agents of the State's immigration laws and putting an onus on them to implement the policing aspects of those laws. For example, employees at their desks, checking passengers going through airports or wherever, or drivers of various forms of transport are expected to act as immigration officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">I ask the Minister to address this issue when he comes to reply to the debate, because that would be seriously subversive of the Refugee Act 1996 and of the Geneva Convention of 1951, to which this State is a signatory. The effect could well be to exclude those who would be found to qualify for refugee status if they had the possibility of a hearing. In effect, they would be unable to make such an application by virtue of being prevented from seeking access to that process as a result of transport carriers, in fear of the Minister's provisions in the Bill, implementing, in a ham-fisted and incompetent way, measures to cover themselves against the large fines and other sanctions which the Minister proposes against them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">The Refugee Act 1996 defines a refugee as:</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">a person who, owing to well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">Essentially, the Minister is putting the onus on transport operators who have no expertise and no function in adjudicating on the merits or otherwise of any individual human being's application to be considered a refugee under this law or under the Geneva Convention. He is putting the onus on people who should have nothing to do with making such judgments. I believe the Minister will have to respond to that. It also involves putting undue pressure on ordinary workers, as a by-product of this legislation, apart from the fundamental human rights issues at stake in this regard. Checkers, transport workers, drivers and so on are not obliged to be expert in the range or validity of documentation which might be shown to them by people who, in reality, are coming to this State in search of refuge. From that point of view, the procedure is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">The Geneva Convention recognises that, in the circumstances of those fleeing persecution and who may be in fear of their lives, it is justifiable to use invalid documentation to secure safe passage to a country where they can apply for refugee status or asylum. The Minister's proposal is seriously subversive of that possibility and that aspect has to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">One could give many examples of the way in which this legislation, if enacted, could be seriously detrimental to people genuinely seeking refuge. Indeed, a carrier might feel obliged to betray somebody to the very authorities from whom he or she was fleeing, in order to avoid the penalties the Minister is seeking to impose. The moral and, in my view, internationally legal course of action is that those seeking to flee from repressive regimes, in fear of their lives or persecution, should be aided in whatever way is possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">Another serious problem is that this legislation, combined with similar legislation in other European countries, can have the effect of driving refugees into the arms of the gangster groups who traffic, quite callously, in human beings and, as we have seen in recent years, at the cost of literally thousands of innocent victims. This came to our shores in a dramatic and tragic way a few years ago when Kurdish people perished attempting to make their way to the United Kingdom. They were diverted here and found in a container in Wexford, which shocked the entire country at the time. I fear that the effect of legislation such as this will be to make more lucre for the criminal gangs who prey on human beings in this fashion. There have been even more horrific  death tolls among people being brought into Britain, for example. People who flee from various African countries to the south of Spain routinely perish in the Mediterranean. These people are brought across by a variety of means or, in desperation, flee themselves. The point made, which is a valid one, is that it is difficult to legally present oneself as an applicant for refugee status within the EU and the difficulty is becoming even greater.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">The Minister must say what steps he proposes to take in the event that he does not withdraw the legislation, which I still urge him to do. What steps does he intend to take to cut across the dangers I have outlined and to guarantee that those who are genuinely fleeing persecution are able to make safe passage to these shores in order to present their case and, I hope, get a favourable, just and successful hearing? Will he give advice and draw up regulations for carriers in that regard? Has he thought through this issue? As well as waving a big stick over their heads, which he is undoubtedly doing, is he taking measures to ensure that the right of human beings to seek refuge is being protected? I will listen with great interest to the Minister when he replies to the debate on Second Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">Our history as a migrant people, where millions of our ancestors fled economic disaster, political oppression and so on and found their way into most corners of the world, should make us a particularly generous nation when it comes to understanding the terrible human trauma that lies behind those stories which bring people to our shores. The role of any humane immigration policy must be to assist those at risk, those who are fleeing and attempting to find a new life in this country. We should be generous in this regard. I do not contribute to the glib assertion which is sometimes thrown out that we are an extremely racist people, that Ireland is a racist country and that the majority of people are racist. These facts are completely false. I believe a minority among us are racist but the majority of people are not racist. It is an insult to people to make these kinds of broad assertions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">The majority of people are generous and wish to be generous to those who seek refuge in this State which is supposed to be responsible to them. It is, therefore, particularly reprehensible when elected Members of the national Parliament stand up and use their position to pander to that small minority who are racist, xenophobic and deny the history of this nation over generations and centuries. It is reprehensible that we had a type of mean-spirited, mean-minded racist outburst from two or three Members of the Dáil. It is a source of scandal to me that these Deputies were not immediately ejected, expelled and cast out from their political parties as a signal to the world that this country stands for toleration and integration of people of different cultures, races, creeds, colours and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">The Government should look at this issue and do more to create a better environment and, in so doing, enrich our society for those who come here to seek refuge. Those who are waiting a determination on their asylum applications should be given the right to work. I have repeatedly heard these people say that they do not want to be in receipt of the paltry State handouts they receive. They want to work and earn their keep and this should be granted.</p>

          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_1136">I agree with most of what is contained in the Bill. It resembles a Bill before the House of Commons. I believe the legislation will help the problem but I would like it to do more. That is my job as an Opposition Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">Travel companies and other organisations should not need the legislation to ensure that illegal or economic refugees without the proper paperwork are not allowed to arrive in this country. However, a case should be made for lone lorry drivers driving through ports without whose knowledge unwanted passengers may attach themselves to trucks while slow moving or stopped. One simply cannot see all that is happening from inside the cab of a truck while driving. The Bill will make such people more responsible and put the blame on them. The port authorities could be flexible and help out by checking these trucks before they board and after they exit ships to ensure determined asylum seekers have not attached themselves to the vehicles. This would make perfect sense. The Bill seeks to prevent indiscriminate people who ignore safety procedures and the law from smuggling foreigners into the country while robbing them of all their money. These criminal gangs and thugs must be stopped because they have no respect for human life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">If one is a minister in a national government, one must ask what caused the problem in the first instance. What brings these people to this country? What makes them leave their home and family to travel here? Why is it that in a world of plenty so many have nothing? Why does this problem exist? While we in this House cannot solve the problem on our own, we can show leadership.</p>

Sin an rud atá á lorg againn – go mbeadh tacaíocht chuile pháirtí don rún seo mar gheall ar an gcruachás ina bhfuil próiseas na síochána. Tá an rún simplí go leor.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156">I welcome constructive contributions from all Members of the House in this critical debate. I look forward to the debate because in the recent past all the parties in this House objected to the cancellation of the elections. The Taoiseach said that both Governments had a fundamental obligation to uphold the will of the people and secure the Agreement. He also said that the Govern ment disagreed with the British Government on the postponement of these elections, that it did not agree with or endorse this step and that postponing the election caused more problems for the process than it solved. The Fine Gael party said that postponing the elections for the second time was deeply disappointing and that stagnation would not only ruin the process, but also ruin lives. The Labour Party said in the House that for the British Government to postpone the Assembly election flew in the face of some fundamental principles, that it was hard to find any normal reason that would justify the postponement and that it is unacceptable in any normal scheme of things that the people can arbitrarily be deprived of the right to vote. The Green Party said it was deeply disappointed at the postponement of the elections and the Socialist Party said that the British Government was going down a very dangerous road in denying the people of Ireland a democratic say in their own affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">It is possible with this motion to reach consensus in this House and I urge people to vote tomorrow night in that way because the elections, which were to take place in two days' time, were unilaterally cancelled by the British Government. Approximately one million Irish voters will be disenfranchised by this undemocratic decision. We have always complained when dictatorships in other countries cancelled elections, for example, in Lesotho in 1970, Chile in 1973, Algeria in 1992, Sri Lanka in 1998, Nepal last year and Georgia this year. It is right that we should criticise those countries for cancelling elections because that creates a political vacuum and many here recognised that, as did both Governments in their Joint Declaration. They said that the best way of ensuring that peace remains permanent is by demonstrating that politics work. How does cancelling the elections demonstrate that politics work on this island and specifically in the Six Counties?</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">The peace process has transformed politics on this island and it has transformed the situation in the Six Counties. We need only look back ten years to when this island seemed to be trapped in a conflict that many believed was intractable. In a relatively short period of time we have made significant progress and in a peace process that came about from political negotiations. For 25 years armed groups, whether British, Unionist or republican, set the agenda on these islands. This was the legacy of the undemocratic partition of this island and the imperialism of the British over many centuries. Some of that has changed and for the first time in a quarter of a century political leaders are in the driving seat, thanks to the Good Friday Agreement which 94% of the people in this State and 71% of the electorate in the Six Counties endorsed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159">Our peace process is in deep crisis, first because the British Government unilaterally suspended the democratic institutions which were agreed and established under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and endorsed by the  people. The Assembly was up and running for only 21 months following its establishment in December 1999. The present suspension is the fourth suspension in as many years since it was set up. The British Government also recently accepted that it has failed to fully implement its commitment under the Good Friday Agreement. Now it has cancelled the elections which are mandated under the Northern Ireland Act. Those elections were first scheduled for 1 May then 29 May and now there is no guarantee that they will take place at all. The British Government has also ignored the Irish Government's status as a joint and equal partner in the Agreement.</p>

          <p eId="para_1161">The Irish Government's opposition to the British Government's unilateral action has been ignored totally to date. The British Government had no right to cancel the elections. The Irish Government rightly opposed it, as did every political party. Only David Trimble and the British Government supported this undemocratic action. The cancellation of the elections is a subversion of democracy. In any normal democratic society a crisis in the political process would lead to a fresh mandate and elections, but this has not happened. A dangerous political vacuum has been created which those who are opposed to the peace process seek to fill. More than one million Irish citizens have been disenfranchised by the unilateral British action.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162">It is necessary that an election date is set for the end of June, the institutions are re-established and the Agreement is implemented in full. Sinn Féin is fully committed to the peace process and that is why we are putting this motion forward and asking once again that every Deputy in this House endorses it. I hope we will get action from the British Government.</p>

          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_1165">I hope Members will see fit to support this measured motion. It seeks to bring the madness we have seen over the past few weeks, including MI5, Stakeknife and all sorts of attempts to divert this issue away from and destabilise the peace process, back to the core, which is the Good Friday Agreement. To get back to it is what we all need to try to do. That is what this motion is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166">I wish to deal with a few of the main issues that concern people most in areas like north Louth, Tyrone and Fermanagh. It is not only people in those areas who should be concerned, but people from all over this country. One of the main issues is demilitarisation. Some Members may consider that five years into this process that issue has been sorted and dealt with, given that we have seen Oglaigh na hÉireann on several occasions putting weapons beyond use. However, what has happened on the British side? I will share with Members some of what has been going on in and around my area. The British have extended the spy post on Faughal Mountain which overlooks the Belfast-Dublin road. They put a big shiny new camera on top of each of the installations. There are about eight cameras now spying, not only on the people in south Armagh, but also those in north County Louth. That has happened in the past six weeks. There has also been an extension to Sliabh Brach, a major British army installation which is in the same type of position – right on the Border at Forkhill overlooking north Louth and south Armagh. We have heard about the number of dismantlements that took place at Tiffcrum, slightly further on from Forkhill, and at Cloughe, near Newry on the main Belfast-Dublin road. Cloughe is still saturated with cameras. A fly would not alight around that area without the British army and British intelligence knowing about it. To say that has been an improvement in demilitarisation is nothing short of a joke.</p>
          <p eId="para_1167">There have been increased foot patrols with soldiers walking – like the British policy in Ireland – backwards around the streets and on the roads of south Armagh. On a drive to south Armagh last Sunday afternoon, I met about 40 of them with blackened faces, like modern day Black and Tans, reversing up the road and behaving like what they really are, an occupying army. We are five years into the process and we are told there are fewer foot, military and helicopter patrols than ever. That is possibly true in overall figures, but those figures are not relevant to the areas I listed. Those figures are taken in the context of the whole of the North. It is a typical distortion by British Government spin doctors to try to tell us that there has been an improvement in these areas, but that is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168">For some 30 years the British Government has been involved in the murder of Irish citizens through its agencies, mainly MI5, British military intelligence and the RUC-PSNI Special Branch. MI5 was and remains in charge of these operations. It was responsible for liaising with the others and reporting directly into Whitehall. British Prime Ministers like Thatcher, Major and right up to today with Blair, have seen these intelligence reports. They have seen what their agents in Ireland have been up to. I do not know if they did anything to stop them – they may well have sent them words of encouragement. They did so because they decorated a few of their main spies who were dealing with people like Brian Nelson.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169">John Stevens, a British policeman, was sent over here and he compiled a report on collusion between Unionist paramilitaries and British agents, but the British Government could not even publish his report. All it could manage to put out were 19 sanitised pages from the report. The British Government must publish the Stevens report. It must show us what is in it and what one of its own law agents found. If it does not, we are rightly free to make what assumptions we wish in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170">In Belfast today, Sinn Féin launched a document outlining the involvement of the British Government through its agencies in the killing of Irish citizens across this island, including Eddie Fullerton, a Donegal Sinn Féin county councillor, and Seamus Ludlow in my own county. We need full and proper disclosure on all these issues. We also need independent inquiries into the murders of Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson. The British Government must end the operations by its agencies aimed at destabilising the peace process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171">Another of the issues on which I would like to briefly touch is that of policing. It must be said that the communities worst affected by the lack of policing in the North are working class Unionist communities and working class Nationalist communities. Sinn Féin wants to see an accountable police service that has the respect and confidence of everyone, but this will never happen while the Special Branch has the freedom of action afforded to it by the British Government. That is at the core of what is wrong with policing in the North today. We must remember that Patton described the RUC Special Branch as a force within a force, and it is still a force within a force. Those people who ran the Special Branch are still in place. So, too, is their ethos, mindset and practices. These are the issues that are preventing a new beginning to policing, not Sinn Féin.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172">People in this State need to realise what is going on in the North. People should travel up there. I spoke to members of the South Armagh Farmers and Residents Association who asked me to extend an invitation in this debate to any Members of this House who would care to join them on a tour around south Armagh to see at first hand what is happening on the ground. I have been around the lookout post at Faughal several times and on the last occasion I was there we managed to get into it. We did not bother dismantling it because we thought at the time the British were going to do that. However, had we been as wise then, which was about 18 months ago, as we are now, I would have a few large sheets of galvanised iron belonging to it at my house now.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_1176">This morning in Belfast Sinn Féin launched a document entitled Who Sanctions Britain's Dirty Squads – Time for the Truth, a copy of which, if not already available to Deputies, will be made available in the next day or two. I advise everybody to read and study it. While not directly related to the issue we are debating, the contents of this document will give people an understanding of why so many northern Nationalists and republicans are alienated from and mistrustful of the Six Counties state, those who run it and why they are becoming increasingly angry and disillusioned with the so-called democratic process. I do not need to rehearse the argument that it must be remembered that the Nationalist/republican population of the Six Counties never asked to be part of that state, they never asked to be abandoned by this State and they never asked to be treated as second-class citizens in this country. It was something foisted upon them without the slightest reference to their consent and then they were left to struggle on their own in the situation in which they found themselves. In that situation they were, at best, ignored and disenfranchised by the British State in terms of social and economic opportunities and resources and, at worst, considered a threat to Unionist dominance that could and should be dispensed with.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177">The limited Stevens report is strongly referenced in the document launched this morning. It estimated conservatively that since the 1980s up to 80 citizens have been targeted by the British secret service and its forces and set up to be assassinated – either shot or blown up – by loyalist death squads. Bearing that in mind nobody could argue that the Nationalist/republican population of the Six Counties has no justification for distrusting the intentions not only of the British Government and the Unionists, but of the Twenty-six Counties establishment as well. However, they did, through the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, try to understand and reach a just and peaceful resolution to the conflict. After a decade of intense work on the peace process, the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, the establishment of the Assembly and the election of the cross-party Executive, the Good Friday Agreement has still to be fully implemented, the Assembly has been suspended and democratic elections have been cancelled. The British Government has done all this at the behest of Unionists.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178">As republicans we have lived up to all our responsibilities under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. We have gone way beyond them in the interests of making the Agreement work while others have been actively engaged in trying to wreck it. We have stretched ourselves to breaking point to ensure the Agreement does not unravel. To that end, I commend all those within  the republican movement on their discipline and commitment and on giving their all in trying to ensure the Agreement survives. We have reached out to Unionists and sought to accommodate them as best we could. We have made what is to many of our supporters a painful and profound compromise to ensure Unionists of our bona fides.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179">I hope we can have all-party support in the House for the motion and show a united front against what the British Government has done, namely, denying democracy to the people of this island and choosing to disenfranchise those of us who have stood by and supported the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_622">
          <from>Mr. Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_1180">Táim sásta cúpla nóiméad a bheith agam chun labhairt ar an rún seo. I am happy to have a few minutes to address this question. This is a matter of democracy. The referendums that were held north and south of the Border on the Good Friday Agreement were passed by 94% to 95% of voters in the Twenty-six Counties and by 70% to 75% of voters in the Six Counties. That is the democratic and legitimate basis for the Good Friday Agreement. It is another matter whether everyone agrees with everything in it, but it was democratically agreed by the people in referendums on both sides of the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181">It is unacceptable that the British Government should have the right to cancel elections or suspend institutions in this country. If the Good Friday Agreement allows the British Government to do that, any review should include the section that allows this. It should not be possible for the British Government to dictate what happens in terms of democracy on this island. The institutions have been suspended on a number of occasions at the whim of the British Government and the diktat of Unionist politicians.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182">The British Government has apparently used its veto to ensure that no democratic elections take place for these institutions in this country. The elections were suspended on 1 and 29 May and now we do not know if they will take place. It appears our Government has no say in this matter. Its amendment to the motion only says that it deeply regrets the decision by the British Government to postpone the Assembly elections scheduled for 29 May 2003 which was taken without its support. Obviously the Government has agreed to a situation whereby the British Government would appear to be within its rights, although I do not accept this, to cancel the elections. This will have to be changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183">The cancellation of the elections creates a serious, difficult and dangerous political void in the Six Counties and ensures that there will be a marching season with no institutions in place and no elections having taken place. It will be a dangerous period during the summer months until August or September during which marches will take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184">I support strongly another aspect of the motion which has not yet been referred to, namely, the section that urges the Irish Government to provide for representation in the Dáil for citizens of the Six Counties. That is something they should have. They are Irish citizens and, if they elect people to represent them in the Six Counties, they should have an opportunity to represent the views of their constituents in this House and in Seanad Éireann. I support this part of the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">It would be remiss of us to discuss a motion such as this without calling for a full public inquiry and investigation into the murder of Pat Finucane and to raise the question of the dirty tricks which have been taking place for many years in the Six Counties and which were perpetrated by various agents of the British Government, be they MI5 or whatever. We have read a great deal in newspapers recently about Stakeknife, and this is the type of dirty tricks to which I refer. This type of set-up, which is still ongoing, does nothing for the peace process or democracy on this island and should be stopped immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">I agree with Deputy Morgan that the demilitarisation of the Six Counties should take place with great urgency. We have not heard a call for the withdrawal of troops for some time and it is time it was put back on the agenda in a strong and forceful way by the Irish Government and elected representatives in the country, North and South. I support the motion and am glad of the opportunity to speak to it.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1187">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak to this motion which involves justice, equality, democracy and the future of the people and the evolving peace process. It is above party politics and I urge all Members to support it. It concerns the future of the people, our citizens on this island. It also concerns the right of the people to make their own decisions and the urgent need for self-determination. This debate must include the vision and implementation of structures that will lead to Irish independence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">People should stop apologising for having these principles. It is a noble objective to have a modern, inclusive and democratic Ireland that looks after the men and women of no property. Surely this is the way forward. The two-nationists and revisionists must be challenged inside the House and in the wider sections of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">There are many sections of the media that do not represent anyone, yet they appear to receive massive coverage. If they were to stand in an election tomorrow, they would get barely 200 votes. They seem to have complete free rein to attack and ridicule anyone who supports Irish independence. These vested interests must be challenged. We all know that, regrettably, they have many supporters in the House. Let them open their eyes. They should listen more often to the northern minority and the vast majority of Irish citizens when they seek equality, justice and a democratic peace settlement. I challenge the so-called demo crats in this House to speak out and show their commitment to all the people on the island of Ireland. The revisionism and two-nation views that exist in this House must be challenged once and for all. Our people deserve leadership. They deserve a progressive political plan with a vision for the future. That is what this motion is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190">Section one of the motion reaffirms support for the Good Friday Agreement. While I strongly support the motion, it is important that we all take responsibility for the peace process and the positive moves that are taking place in this country. Change and radical reform must be at the top of the agenda, whether it is on policing issues, cultural or citizens' rights, sectarianism or the cancellation of the election in the North. I strongly resent and oppose the delay of the election. It is unacceptable, unfair, unjust and, above all, it is a blatant attack on our democracy. I thought the response of the Government and the two major Opposition parties was extremely weak and lacked conviction. I felt completely let down by the lack of serious and decisive leadership on this issue. The Northern minority also felt let down and felt as though they were being dumped into the Irish Sea. I would like to reassure them that these are not the views of many Deputies. I express my total support and solidarity on this important issue at this important time in our history.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">The view of the Conor Cruise O'Briens, John A. Murphys and Eoghan Harrises on modern Irish history is now melting away.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1193">Ireland is radically changing for the good. We are moving towards the goal of a modern, independent and inclusive Ireland where we look to the future while respecting our past.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194">However, there are people who want to wreck and stop this development. We have seen the British Government and so-called security forces setting out to wreck, destroy and damage participants in the peace process. When one talks about the peace process, it is legitimate and sensible to raise serious issues of concern about peacekeeping and the whole question of policing. In recent days we have seen the disgraceful evidence of collusion between death squads and the police and British army in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195">Successive British Governments have sanctioned murder. They have employed agents and given them a licence to kill along with the freedom to act with impunity. British agents helped arm Unionist paramilitaries with hundreds of weapons and grenades imported from South Africa. No member of the British army's covert force research unit, FRU, or RUC special branch has ever been charged with any offence relating to attacks on 80 people. Intelligence agencies have not been subjected to any serious process of reform. They have not been made subject to pub lic debate about accountability in the way the issue of policing has. Instead, the likes of MI5 and military intelligence have remained immune from change. The public has been led to believe the FRU has been disbanded, indeed I also believed this until recently. It has been renamed as the joint services group. The policies and practices that led to the death of a great man like Pat Finucane and 28 others, as a result of FRU agent Brian Nelson's files, are still in place today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196">We often talk about the policing board. The board cannot investigate these matters and it has no power to investigate incidents involving MI5, the British army or the RUC prior to 1999. The ombudsman cannot investigate the activities of MI5 or military intelligence. Her powers to fully investigate the special branch are useless, as it has been made clear that she does not have the financial resources to do so. I strongly support the demands made by Deputies Healy and Morgan for inquiries into the Finucane, Nelson and Hamill cases. These are legitimate demands.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197">I urge Members to support this motion which is about the peace process, a process of change, development and inclusion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_626">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_1198">Taken as a whole and for the most part, this motion should have the overwhelming support of everyone in this House. It seeks to reaffirm support for the Good Friday Agreement as endorsed in referendum by the people of Ireland. I hope this includes an implicit endorsement of all political agreements that have followed the Agreement, where the use of violence to further any political end should have no part to play in the future of this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199">The motion recognises that the political process brought about by the peace process has benefited all the people of Ireland. There is no doubt that benefits have accrued from the peace process but we must also recognise that large degrees of fear and mistrust still exist and these must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1200">The motion records an appreciation of the work done and undertaken by all-Ireland bodies. Everyone can be satisfied that the benefits promised, in terms of economies of scale, the exchange of ideas and cultural, tourism and environment benefits have resulted from the all-Ireland bodies which should be allowed to continue and prosper in existence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201">The motion seeks to recognise the joint and co-equal responsibility of both the Irish and British Governments to ensure the full implementation of the Agreement as mandated by the people. It is important to stress that the Good Friday Agreement is an international agreement to which the Irish and British Governments are equal partners. Unfortunately, the impression has been created that while relations between the Governments continue to be friendly, that it is not a fully equal relationship. It seems not unlike the relationship between that of the British and US Governments with the roles reversed. While they are ostensibly partners, there is a major part ner that makes decisions on behalf of both. This is a process that cannot be allowed to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202">The motion seeks to recall the progress that has been made in restoring political institutions. While progress has been achieved it has not been relentless. It has been open to setback and while it has been frustratingly slow, we need to recognise that it has moved forward. The motion seeks to deplore the decision of the British Government to cancel the Assembly election due to have been held on 29 May 2003. While "deplore" is an extremely strong verb, I do not think anyone can deny the extreme unhappiness and disappointment of most Members at the postponement of this election. The election should have been held, even if it were to bring about a result that would be seen as undesirable in many people's eyes. This political problem would have then been dealt with – the democratic exercise should not have been forgone.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203">The motion demands that the British Government fully restores the political institutions established under the Agreement and sets a date for the Assembly election to be held before the end of June. Everyone would like to the see the restoration of political institutions. I am uncertain if the means exist within the British parliamentary system to put forward new legislation to allow the election to be held before the end of June. The legislation recently passed by the British House of Commons postponing the election was extraordinarily vague. We should demand, at the very least, that if an election is to be held – and we think it should – it should be held on a date specified in any legislation that goes through the House of Commons.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">The final part of the motion urges the Government to provide for representation in the Dáil for citizens in the Six Counties and promote all-Ireland policies and strategies across the full range of Government responsibilities. Certainly, the second part of this is uncontentious. I await the Government's view on whether there should be an amendment to this motion. I feel the first part would be open to constitutional difficulty. Representation in this Dáil should occur for Members elected on the same day from whatever constituency to reflect the political opinion that exists on the island, if that is how we decide to structure this Parliament. The second issue is one of proportionality. If current members of the Northern Ireland Assembly are to have speaking rights, and possibly voting rights, in this Chamber, it must be noted that they have been elected with a different population ratio. This is something that would be difficult to implement on constitutional grounds even if the spirit is something we would be prepared to see progressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">The Green Parliamentary Party comprises eight members. Two of these are MEPs who can only contribute to the workings of this House through the European Affairs committee. The Green Party is not recognised by Standing Orders  in terms of getting speaking rights by having its mandates recognised. I would like to see a more forward-thinking and generous approach. With that one reservation on a matter that is outside the scope of the general spirit of this motion, I hope the Government's views will be largely in agreement with the proposal.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_629" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_1227">I apologise to the House for being unable to be here sooner to hear the proposal of the motion as I was overseas and was delayed. As I have just arrived back and obviously had to make an input into my speech, it will be available to Deputies shortly. I am glad to have this opportunity to address the House on this very important subject and hope that our debate over the coming two nights will be constructive, forward-looking and solution-oriented.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228">When it reported in January 1996, the international body led by Senator George Mitchell stated that the people of Northern Ireland wanted "lasting peace in a just society in which paramilitary violence plays no part". That is a  simple yet powerful mission statement for the work we have all been doing over recent years. While considerable progress has been made towards reaching those goals, we have not yet reached the final destination.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229">A significant step forward towards the achievement of a just society was taken on 1 May when the Irish and British Governments published their Joint Declaration. This document is a comprehensive audit of the various commitments contained in the Good Friday Agreement. It is also a blueprint for the implementation of its outstanding aspects. It addresses a range of issues which derived from the Agreement and are central to the achievement of a just society in Northern Ireland – equality, human rights, criminal justice, policing and the normalisation of security arrangements on the ground. When they met in Farmleigh on 6 May, the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, agreed that other than those aspects explicitly linked to acts of completion by others, the commitments contained in the Joint Declaration should now be implemented by both Governments. The meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which I co-chaired last week in London, was largely devoted to a detailed discussion on the implementation of the Joint Declaration and that work will be proactively advanced through the conference.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230">It is a matter of great regret that some people have denounced the Joint Declaration. Since its content is largely dictated by the terms of the Agreement itself, such a denunciation is either motivated by a partisan purpose or is a covert attack on the Agreement. It is doubly unfortunate that such assertions have the effect of reinforcing the perception, which I do not share, that many Unionists are hostile to the notion of a just society, the achievement of equality or a genuine partnership with Nationalists.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231">According to recent reports, Jeffrey Donaldson MP has called for an unequivocal rejection of the Joint Declaration. Does such a statement imply a rejection of the goals of achieving a fully representative police service and a more effective and representative criminal justice system? Does it mean a summary dismissal of a bill of rights for Northern Ireland, adequately resourced and empowered human rights and equality commissions, the elimination of the current unemployment differential between both communities, an effective community relations strategy and the need to regenerate deprived areas in both loyalist and Nationalist communities? We should recall that all these practical measures of equality and renewal are at the core of the Joint Declaration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232">I cannot believe that any substantial segment of the Unionist community would so unequivocally turn its face away from such key objective requirements of a just society. These are requirements which protect both communities – they are emphatically not a concessionary agenda to any one side. An unequivocal rejection of the Joint Declaration may of course have more to do with the political fault lines between nationalism  and unionism or, indeed, within unionism itself. If so, it is a particularly dismal manifestation of the zero-sum mindset that we are trying to leave behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_1233">The entrenchment of equality, human rights and effective, fair and impartial policing and criminal justice systems is necessary, but not sufficient, for the achievement of a just society. These fundamental entitlements also need to be complemented by a political process that offers the right of democratic participation and the prospect of effective government. Elections are the key interface between democratic politics and government. The recent postponement of Assembly elections not only closed off the route to the formation of the next devolved administration in Northern Ireland, it also drained a great deal of energy from the operation of day-to-day politics. Deputy Boyle made some comments about the Government in this respect. If the Irish Government had been legally required under the Good Friday Agreement to sign for elections to be deferred, we would not have done so. We can only do what is within our power.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234">The restoration of that political momentum requires that there now be a credible prospect of the elections taking place as early as possible and in any event no later than the autumn. The holding of elections should not be contingent on some subjective judgment that a particular party or community now has sufficient trust and confidence to proceed with the democratic process. The elections should proceed as of right and, in a positive context, as part of the process of renewing that trust and confidence. The holding of elections will not, of course, guarantee the formation of an inclusive administration. Unionist participation in government, like that of Nationalists, is a voluntary engagement. Securing such Unionist participation will be dependent on achieving an end to paramilitarism in a way which everyone accepts and believes. Equally, the ability of the republican movement to undertake these final steps will be influenced by whether unionism is willing to embrace the agenda of change represented by the Good Friday Agreement. Both sides have fundamental choices to make but will only make them in the context of a vibrant political process, not within one which is stagnant and in which the prospect of elections is a receding target.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235">In terms of these fundamental choices that the parties have to make, it seems there are two clear realities that need to be confronted. The first reality, for unionism, must be that devolved government in Northern Ireland will only be available in the context of the kind of balanced political arrangements contained in the Agreement, including a Northern Ireland administration constructed on an inclusive basis. The alternative is the Good Friday Agreement without devolved institutions but with the intergovernmental dimension, as provided for in  the Agreement. That is not the preferred option of any partner in the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236">The second reality, for nationalism, is that sustainable participation by republicans in such an inclusive administration requires the cessation of all paramilitary activity, as outlined in the Joint Declaration itself. In the absence of that, there is little prospect of Unionist partnership in government on a stable and sustainable basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237">The two Governments have made it very clear that the British-Irish Agreement is not negotiable. Its core values must be at the heart of any stable dispensation for the future. I cannot imagine a Nationalist of any persuasion or, indeed, any Irish Government being willing to dilute the key protections and principles at the heart of the Agreement. Those who argue that the Agreement must be renegotiated to secure the majority support of Unionists, which they allege is in deficit, have never clarified who they expect their negotiating partners to be or why a solemn referendum in both parts of the island should be overturned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1238">Despite all the difficulties, contact between the political parties should be maintained. It is important that we have a calm summer so that the autumn elections can be held in as positive a context as possible. We need to find reasons to do things rather than excuses not to move things forward. I have just returned this evening from a EuroMed meeting in Greece where I discussed with Palestinians, Arabs and Israelis the resuscitation of the Middle East peace process. My words were ones of encouragement and of the need to maintain partnership regardless of the inevitable ups and downs of the peace process there. I recently visited the Balkans where less than a decade ago ethnic tensions erupted, 400,000 people lost their lives and four million people were displaced from their homes. They are now seeking to chart a way forward and build a future based on one point of departure. That point of departure is that they do not agree on the past. Each party to the conflict in those areas will tell you that theirs is a legitimate story and, of course, the cause of the tragedy that enveloped them was that each party had indeed a legitimate story to tell.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239">We in Ireland, therefore, must not predicate our future on the basis of getting prior agreement on the past. A lesson in our history is that we cannot fashion a future exclusively through our experience of the past. Our primary responsibilities are in the present and the future. Following 25 years of conflict, the Downing Street Declaration set out where we were politically in 1993. The Framework Document produced parameters within which political dialogue and discussion could take place. The British-Irish Agreement is the culmination of painstaking negotiations that addressed the three strands of the relationships that need to be addressed for political and economic stability. It is a formula that provides inclusive partnership government in Northern Ireland with cross-Border institutions to facilitate pro gress on an all-island basis for our mutual benefit. The British-Irish Council was established to reflect the more mature partnership that now exists between two neighbouring EU countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240">The people having voted for it in both parts of the island concurrently, the British-Irish Agreement now represents the democratic imperative that governs our political life and has brought peace and, ultimately, will bring reconciliation to our country. The process of reconciliation and outreach also applies to republicans. In this regard, I welcome the recent remarks by the Sinn Féin President, Gerry Adams, directed to the Unionist community. I endorse his view that Nationalists and Unionists, republicans and loyalists have to recognise each other's integrity and must provide the required mutual reassurance about their future intentions. In this regard, our collective task is to create the confidence that Northern Ireland is irreversibly on course to become a society in which paramilitary violence plays no part and where democratic institutions, open to all who have an electoral mandate, will operate on a stable and sustainable basis. These are the two sides of the same coin of trust and confidence and were the core objectives of the acts of completion process pursued by both Governments over recent months. They remain to be fully achieved and must be secured if we are to provide a sustainable basis for future political stability and partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_1241">It is now clear that the peace we are all seeking must involve the ending of all paramilitary activity as set out in the Joint Declaration. That peace is best achieved and consolidated when elected representatives of all sides in the community recommit themselves to work together for the betterment of all, as the letter and spirit of the Agreement demands. The Northern Ireland Executive does not work to its full potential if it is simply regarded as a coalition of necessity, protecting one's own political interests at the expense of the other. Real political engagement in an inclusive partnership Executive will bring win-win situations to Northern Ireland's divided society. Hesitancy, mistrust and a refusal to engage in an agenda of real and lasting change for the better simply provides a no score draw.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242">Part of the more difficult agenda of reconciliation will also involve bringing closure to the conflict. Ceasing activities inimical to the peace process is but one confidence-building measure. In that respect, the victims of the conflict, and they were far too many on both sides, will, of course, not be forgotten by their families, friends and communities. The terrible legacy left by that hurt and pain should remind us all of the need to put ourselves in the other person's position and understand their point of view when we confront difficult issues that remain to be addressed in the aftermath of conflict. Bearing this in mind, and the fact that there were 1,500 unsolved murder cases in Northern Ireland during the course of the conflict, it would appear that, for many, closure will not come by way of resolving these murders  through police investigations and subsequent and successful prosecutions in a court.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">The Governments have sought to make their contribution to achieving closure in respect of a number of cases which are currently being examined by the eminent international jurist Judge Peter Cory. These are cases of serious controversy in their respective communities. The cases of Pat Finucane, Robert Hamill, Rosemary Nelson, Judge Gibson, RUC Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Robert Buchanan and loyalist Billy Wright are being investigated by Judge Cory. Both Governments are committed to respectively implementing Judge Cory's recommendations on these cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1244">We also have here the Barron inquiry into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings which reflects the Government's commitment to pursue matters that have given rise to public concern. In dealing with these matters from the past it is important that they not become preconditions for the necessary political developments to secure our future. They must be dealt with on their merits. Accountability and confidence in the future must mean that the recommendations of the Stevens investigation and the Crompton report are fully and transparently implemented through the policing board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245">The Good Friday Agreement is about a new beginning, turning a bloody page in our history, insisting on the primacy of politics so that we can create a just society without victims and reforming the institutions so that all political persuasions can participate in the democratic life of the society. We need to end the public psyche of victimhood, not perpetuate it into the future. In short, we need to come to terms with a past that can have no place in our future and we must do so in a way that gives hope and optimism to all our people that we are finally on the road to reconciliation, recognising the wrongs and violence that were visited on far too many for far too long.</p>
          <p eId="para_1246">The Government will work with others in good faith to achieve full implementation of this Agreement in a way that is sustainable and permanent. We have come too far to resile from our collective responsibilities now. Given the recent past and present that we have helped to shape, we owe it to this and future generations on this island to make it work. We should make our own history and I firmly believe that we must work in the coming weeks and months to shape an enabling context that will provide us with the ability to confront these responsibilities courageously.</p>
          <p eId="para_1247">While mindful of the requirement to justly deal with the painful legacies of the past, we must also be conscious of the need to protect and conserve the gains of recent years. In working with the British Government, we are determined to protect and develop the achievements of the Good Friday Agreement despite the suspension of the Assembly. In this connection, the importance of the continued operation of the North-South bod ies was restated by the two Governments at the meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in London last week. For our part, we have consistently emphasised the importance of maintaining the programme of North-South co-operation agreed by the North-South Ministerial Council prior to suspension and ensuring that the North-South bodies continue to successfully operate and perform their essential public functions throughout this period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248">We have repeatedly stated our determination that the progress we have made in North-South co-operation since the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council and the founding of the North-South bodies over three years ago will not fall victim to the difficulties in the wider process. This determination is shared by the British Government. The two Governments jointly take any decisions necessary to ensure the continued effective operation of the North-South bodies on a care and maintenance basis. That arrangement will continue until the Assembly is restored and we can once again come together with Northern Ministers to agree ways in which we can move forward to fully develop and enhance our relationship of partnership and co-operation for the benefit of all. I look forward to that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249">Recharged with the original spirit and energy of the Good Friday Agreement, and not allowing ourselves to be distracted by the negative fall-out of the divisive legacies of the past, we must press on with the outstanding tasks of fully implementing the Agreement, ridding ourselves of paramilitarism and sectarianism, and consolidating the achievement of a just society, including in the areas of policing and criminal justice. Above all, we must assert the primacy of politics because it is only through renewed political engagement and momentum that we will close the remaining gaps and finish the job of securing the new beginning envisaged by the Agreement for the benefit of all of the people on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">I recognise the constructive purposes underlying the motion tabled by Sinn Féin. Likewise, I also recognise the helpful and constructive elements of the amendments tabled by Fine Gael and the Labour Party. The differences between the motion and those amendments are more questions of emphasis and nuance than major substance. Nevertheless, I believe that the Government amendment represents a more balanced and comprehensive reflection of the overall sentiment in this House. I commend it to Dáil Éireann and ask others who have tabled amendments to consider an agreed motion in the Government's name.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusKirk" eId="spk_630">
          <from>Mr. Kirk</from>
          <p eId="para_1251">I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this most important debates. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has given the background to North-South co-operation and re-affirmed the  Government's commitment to ensuring that the solid progress that has been made since the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council can be maintained, and that our achievements to date can provide a foundation upon which we can build a stronger relationship between the people of this island, North and South.</p>
          <p eId="para_1252">Since the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council, North-South co-operation on this island has gone from strength to strength. The practical benefits that have emerged from increased cross-Border co-operation can be easily seen both socially and economically. The work under way in the North-South implementation bodies, Tourism Ireland and in the areas of co-operation is sometimes low-key but always important, and in many areas crucial to the well-being of the people of this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253">The tourism sector, for example, is of vital importance to the economy in the South but increasingly in Northern Ireland as well. As a direct result of the Good Friday Agreement and the context of partnership it has helped to create, we have established an all-island tourism marketing company, Tourism Ireland. In Tourism Ireland we are pooling our efforts, our resources and our expertise on an all-island basis to market the island of Ireland overseas as a single tourism destination.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254">Tourism is one of the State's most important economic sectors. We had 6 million visitors in 2002. The tourism industry provides €4 billion per year in foreign earnings and provides approximately 150,000 jobs in tourism and tourism related enterprises. In all, the contribution made by tourism to our GDP is of the order of 5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255">By comparison to our own, the tourism industry in Northern Ireland is less well developed and Tourism Ireland is strategically committed to the further development of tourism in the North to bring it in line with development levels here. The economic and social committee of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, of which I am chairman, had the opportunity to conduct an in-depth examination of the need to develop and provide a dynamic to the development of tourism, particularly north of the Border and indeed in the Border counties, North and South. The potential for economic development in those areas cannot be over estimated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">Tourism Ireland went operational in late 2001 – a very difficult time for the tourism sector. Since then a series of global shocks have combined to create a challenging climate for tourism companies worldwide. Nonetheless, Tourism Ireland is developing successfully and continues to strengthen its performance in a highly reactive and competitive global environment. The fact that we on this island can take a joint approach to these challenges is of significant benefit to the tourism sector island-wide.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">It is a measure of the importance we attach to the development of North-South co-operation and partnership that an area so crucial to our economic well-being is now being developed on  an all-island basis. This is an indication also of the potential we see in the all island dimension.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">In a related sector in the domestic arena, the all-island inland waterways body, Waterways Ireland, is engaged in the maintenance of our inland waterways and in their development for recreational use. The largest of the North-South bodies, Waterways Ireland, employs 320 people and has its headquarters in Enniskillen and several regional offices throughout the island. Waterways Ireland is responsible for the Shannon, the cross-Border Shannon-Erne waterway, the Royal and Grand Canals linking Dublin and the Shannon, the Barrow navigation, the River Bann and Lough Erne. These are shared natural resources on this island and it makes perfect sense to develop and protect them in a co-ordinated manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">The development of our rivers and loughs is a significant responsibility which has been filled successfully by Waterways Ireland and the Loughs Agency, which is an agency for the Foyle, Carlingford and the Irish Lights Commission, and is responsible for the management of Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough. The interpretative centre being developed at the Loughs Agency's headquarters in Prehen, County Derry, will allow for the transmission and dissemination of information on the loughs and the work of the Loughs Agency to the general public. It is encouraging that the potential for increased tourism and the development of Carlingford Lough being explored by the Loughs Agency will provide an economic boost for the communities around the lough and in the Border areas of north Louth and all of County Down.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">InterTradelreland, the cross-Border trade and business development body, has its headquarters in Newry and a board of directors drawn from leading figures in the business sector, North and South. Like the other North-South bodies, InterTradelreland takes its overall policy direction from the North-South Ministerial Council. Prior to the suspension of the Assembly, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Northern Ireland Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment held regular meetings to agree policies and actions for the body.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261">The establishment of this body represents a significant public investment in the all-island economy project. InterTradeIreland is the key agency, North and South, charged with facilitating and driving the development of the all-island economy. This is a long-term project, which encompasses a wide range of complementary activities and initiatives. At present, these include: work on all-island competitiveness; taking the lead on the future development of the Digital Island project; the design of an all-island business model; the innovative Focus and Fusion programmes linking the education and business sectors to mutual benefit north and south of the Border; and many more.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262">In the agriculture sector, the excellent co-operation between the two relevant Departments dur ing the foot and mouth disease crisis of 2001 was vital to the containment of the disease and the aversion of a wider crisis. The development of the all-island animal health strategy is an important project. When completed it will ensure a common approach North and South to the issue of animal health which will provide an even stronger foundation for the prevention of the spread of diseases in animals in the future. Another significant issue on which the two Departments are hoping to develop a common approach is CAP reform as proposed under the mid-term review.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263">Our environment is one of the most pressing issues on the agenda of any Government today. The conservation of our shared assets and the prevention of pollution are crucial issues, especially on this island, when so much of what makes us an attractive tourism destination is our natural environment, lakes, rivers and forests. The promotion of these treasures is the responsibility of three North-South bodies – Waterways Ireland, the Loughs Agency and Tourism Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1264">The environment is also an area of co-operation under the North-South Ministerial Council and here too there is a significant programme of work under way. On waste management, for example, proposals have been drawn up for developing an all-island strategic approach to market development for recyclable material. Tenders have been invited for an all-island fridge freezer waste management service and an economic appraisal has been undertaken on a proposal for an all-island community recycling network.</p>
          <p eId="para_1265">As regards North-South co-operation in health, there has been a long tradition of contact and consultation between individuals, health professionals and local and regional health authorities on both sides of the Border. Since the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council and its adoption of health as an area of co-operation, this tradition of co-operation has been formalised and strengthened at Government level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1266">There are significant programmes of work under way in the health sector which bring real and practical benefits to the people of this island. Some of the projects under way at the moment involve accident and emergency services, joint training, staff development and exchange opportunities in radiotherapy services, the provision of tertiary cancer care, and the development of a cross-Border breast surgery team in the north-west.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">The first all-Ireland cancer network was launched in February 2003. The network will ensure that Irish patients have access to the latest and most effective cancer therapies. The consortium's second international cancer conference is scheduled to be held in Cork in October 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268">In the education sector, the work of the North-South Ministerial Council is being taken forward by the relevant Government Departments and agencies, North and South. There is a broad agenda for co-operation in this sector. Some of  the recent key developments include the North-South Ministerial Council's decision to establish an all-island centre of excellence in the education of children with autistic spectrum disorders in Middletown, County Armagh.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_631">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1269">Amendment No. 3 in my name states:</p>
          <p eId="para_1270">To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_1271">– reiterating its support for the Good Friday Agreement which was endorsed by the people, North and South;</p>
          <p eId="para_1272">– noting that the Agreement provides that changes in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland can only be brought about by democratic means;</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">– acknowledges the progress which was achieved in the recent all-party negotiations aimed at restoring the political institutions;</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">– noting the joint declaration published by the Irish and British Governments;</p>
          <p eId="para_1275">– recognising that further steps need to be taken to restore confidence between the communities;</p>
          <p eId="para_1276">– regretting the decision of the British Government to postpone the Assembly elections due on 29th May; and</p>
          <p eId="para_1277">– noting the valuable work being done by the all-Ireland bodies;</p>
          <p eId="para_1278">calls for the Irish and British Governments to convene immediate talks with the pro-Agreement parties to identify the specific issues which require further clarification;</p>
          <p eId="para_1279">demands that the Provisional IRA states clearly that its paramilitary activities will cease and that the process of putting its arms verifiably beyond use will be completed;</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">calls on the Ulster Unionist Party to make clear its willingness to participate in and uphold inclusive government in Northern Ireland; and</p>
          <p eId="para_1281">expresses the sincere hope that the outstanding issues can be resolved quickly so that elections to the devolved institutions can be held as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">I wish to share my time with Deputy Coveney. There are a number of overlapping measures in the motions before the House with which I am sure all parties are in agreement. The purpose of the amendment in my name and that of my party colleagues, is to achieve clarity. There should be clarity in the message that goes out from this House and there should be clarity of stance and intention by the key players in what has become an unnecessarily protracted process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">Fine Gael has always believed in the Good Friday Agreement. We have done so from the outset  because the principles underpinning the agreement are those we have articulated and defended since our party founded this State. We have always sought a settlement based on inclusiveness and reconciliation, on mutual respect and understanding, on democracy and power sharing. When political violence managed to retain a certain grotesque glamour in other respectable quarters, Fine Gael was never ambivalent. We never equivocated about the existence of private armies or their use. For Fine Gael, the pursuit of democracy and terror were, and remain, mutually exclusive. We have always been crystal clear in that regard. It is that kind of clarity that we are trying to achieve now in this critical stage of the peace process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">If in the last 48 hours Ariel Sharon can embrace the road map to peace in the Middle East, which must be quite difficult and complex for politicians in that part of the world to do, and I hope it succeeds, then surely our brokers can sit down together and hammer out once and for all those residually contentious issues that are still outstanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">To achieve that clarity, one thing that both Governments could do would be to convene with a new sense of urgency, round-table talks with all the pro-Agreement parties. The documents from all sides are now in the public domain. Let their authors sit down face to face and sort out what still divides them, once and for all. To do less will ultimately prove a false choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">When one considers that all parties to the agreement were in the same room as President Bush at Hillsborough recently in connection with the Agreement and other matters, if people are convinced that issues outstanding are complex but not that great, then it should be possible for elected politicians to sort it out and allow peace to reign.</p>
          <p eId="para_1287">The representatives of Sinn Féin have been elected to this House. As regards Sinn Féin the big shifts have already been made and what remains is a small but critical gap which must be breached if we are to have a lasting peace on this island. Sinn Féin and the IRA can bridge that gap by giving us clarity. They can do it by abandoning their ritual torture of the English language and their unhealthy obsession with parsing and analysis. Instead, they can state clearly and without equivocation, their commitment to a solely democratic political agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288">We can all be clear then that what happened in Bray some time ago involving van-loads of "volunteers" with black balaclavas will no longer feature as a dubious attraction of that town. We can also be clear that training in the remoter parts of Donegal need not occur any more. Sinn Féin can give us clarity that the process to divest themselves of arms and place them verifiably beyond use, which they are committed to doing, will come to a speedy and final conclusion. That is what is required and anything else is the politics of sham.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289">In respect of Hillsborough, this is a frustrating time for all who want to see progress. It is almost  three months since the round-table talks at Hillsborough, but we have yet to see even a glimmer of the shared understanding we are told was achieved there. It is difficult to see how there could be such understanding when the institutions to which people claim they are committed, stand suspended yet again. The SDLP is correct to call for a repeal of the suspension legislation. The current suspension has added greatly to the inertia affecting the process, way past the eleventh hour. Any further suspensions would surely be the end of hope for this and future generations of people on this island. Again, clarity can help to win the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">Pro-Agreement Unionists have already given much to this process and I appeal to them, once again, to hold their nerve. Even now, they await that critical but thus-far elusive statement of comfort from the republican side. However, as they do, they too must deliver. They must acknowledge and be clear that the institutions must stand and that they must be allowed to work. They must realise that the resilience of the institutions is finite. Suspension can never again be an option. They must face up to the fact that at this late stage, workable solutions must take precedence over sanctions. Once the institutions are working, they cannot and should not balk at the first sign of trouble. Therefore, they must state their absolute commitment to participating in and upholding inclusive Government in Northern Ireland. At this stage, no less a commitment is required from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">The spectre of collusion is becoming a near constant of this process. It seems certain now that what may have been considered a scattered, lunatic militia had, in fact, complex connections at the very heart of what was called "security" in Northern Ireland. It seems certain too that in certain cases, this same "security", far from preventing the savagery and fanaticism of this militia, was instead, protecting and in some cases even facilitating it. It is precisely those complex connections – as illustrated most recently in the Stakeknife controversy – that give great and growing impetus for a full inquiry into that particularly savage episode of blood and misery, the murder of the Belfast solicitor, Pat Finucane. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs has pointed out, Judge Cory is dealing with the cases of Pat Finucane, Robert Hamill, Rosemary Nelson and others and we await his decision. It lies within Judge Cory's remit to sanction such an inquiry and he must be aware of the deepening distress of Mr. Finucane's family, given yet another round of revelations regarding the amorphous and poisonous relationship between terror and security in Northern Ireland. This outstanding issue and the Stakeknife issue must be addressed by the Stevens inquiry in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292">It is now clear that the securocrat mentality that has already prevailed for too long, will do nothing to advance this process, especially at this critical stage. The time for dark and dirty secrets is well and truly over; it is time for all sides to  give them up. I share the view expressed by the Minister for Finance that this should not impede progress for the future while these matters are literally being unearthed from the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">In that context, I reiterate my call to the British Government to increase by some considerable measure the speed at which it is releasing documents critical to the Barron inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. It says it is doing its best but as the Barron report is already nine months overdue, its best is obviously not good enough. I urge the new British ambassador to Ireland to use his good office to try to expedite the release of the necessary documents. I ask the Taoiseach to use his special relationship with Mr. Blair to ensure the information needed by Mr. Justice Barron is provided as a matter of urgency. Fine Gael has raised this matter in the Dáil on a number of occasions in the recent past, most recently two weeks ago, and will continue to do so. I am sure there is agreement in the House that the Barron report is the very least the families of the victims deserve after almost 30 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">I do not think any of us could forget the account of that day given by Angela O'Neill. She recalled that her first communion clothes were hanging on the balcony door of her family's flat in Dominick Street when her mother received the news at 10.30 p.m. that her husband had died. Edward O'Neill, who was 29, had been pierced through the heart by shrapnel and suffered massive head injuries. He was the father of five children, two of whom, Billy and Angela, were due to make their first communion the following day. His son, Billy, never made it. We must have clarity for their sakes and the sake of all those who died in the Troubles. That clarity will get us to the stage where the elections can proceed as soon as possible and democracy is seen to work by and for all the communities of Northern Ireland.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_632">
          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_1295">I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I thank the parties responsible for bringing forward this motion and giving the House an opportunity to speak on the issue. I take this opportunity to reaffirm my support and that of the Fine Gael Party for the Good Friday Agreement which was endorsed by an overwhelming majority of the people on this island, both North and South. Although there have been numerous stumbling blocks and crises to overcome since the Agreement was signed in 1998, there is no doubt that Ireland, as an island, is now a better place than it was before the Agreement. Although thuggery, hatred and sectarianism are still evident in certain unfortunate communities in the North, the main terrorist organisations on both sides of the divide are on ceasefire and inch closer each day to becoming irrelevant and, I hope, disbanding. It was perhaps always somewhat unrealistic to expect the path to democracy, tolerance and normality in Northern Ireland to be without huge difficulty and frustration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">As the House attempts to assist in the promotion of the implementation, in full, of the Good Friday Agreement, political progress has been made. Who would have envisaged a decade ago that Gerry Adams, Mark Durkan and David Trimble would work together as Ministers in a devolved Government of an Assembly for Northern Ireland, debating day-to-day issues as well as the bigger question? The all-Ireland bodies have made progress. Co-operation between North and South on issues of mutual concern has helped to break down barriers raised during years of bitterness and feuding. This has led to a new relationship based on respect and increasing trust, albeit broken at times. The co-operation during the foot and mouth disease crisis on this island was an impressive example of how well co-operation between North and South can work. It showed how a devolved Government in the North can work with the Government in Dublin on an issue of mutual concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">The last six months, unfortunately, have seen a deterioration in relations and the collapse of the institutions due to a breakdown of trust between Unionists and republicans. Such events were hugely damaging and set the process back as we approached the elections supposed to take place this week. The inability to re-establish the Assembly was a failure of the political process and has fuelled the arguments of the more extreme elements in Northern Ireland and those who oppose the Good Friday Agreement. The suspension of the elections due this week has only served to heighten tensions even further. The blame game is now in full flow, as always when there is a crisis in the North. Unionists are blaming republicans for a lack of clarity on the wording of IRA statements and republicans are blaming Unionists for a lack of leadership. Both sides are blaming the Governments in Dublin and London for failing to put in the place the conditions in which measurable progress can be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">I regret the decision to postpone elections indefinitely. When I was in Derry last week, I spoke to many people from the Catholic community who are hugely worried that a vacuum is being created in the absence of elections, or an Assembly where issues in Northern Ireland can be democratically debated and focused on. As we approach the summer marching season when the sectarian temperature will rise again and fuel division and perhaps violent extremism, politics needs to be seen to work and leadership is required. The communities in Northern Ireland, particularly those in interface areas, some of whom I met in Belfast in January and Derry last week, have suffered greatly in the past and will suffer again this summer. The arguments of those who oppose the only workable solution for politics in Northern Ireland will be fuelled once more. Those who offer criticisms and hard-line, non-compromising positions rather than solutions will again be in the ascendancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">Fine Gael's amendment to this motion calls on the British and Irish Governments to take the initiative once more, as they have done in the past, and convene immediately talks with all pro-Agreement parties. Both Governments must create the atmosphere and conditions that will allow those who seek to make progress to identify and discuss the specific issues which require further clarification. All pro-Agreement parties agree that during the talks in the build-up to the postponement of elections we were only inches away from acceptance and the re-establishment of the Assembly. I have heard this opinion expressed by many in this House, too. We must try again to get over the line. Trust must be rebuilt, despite all the setbacks, in order that elections can be called and held as soon as possible. I have already outlined the reasons the dangers of indefinite delay to the Agreement are grave. People are disenfranchised in the absence of certainty, working politics and elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">Fine Gael has been consistent in its insistence on an end to the armed struggle and private armies on this island. In its amendment to the motion Fine Gael demands that the Provisional IRA state clearly that its paramilitary activities will be ceased and that the process of putting arms verifiably beyond use will be completed. A mechanism is already in place for doing this and has been agreed by all signatories to the Good Friday Agreement. It is not only the republican side that needs to make progress on these issues. Fine Gael's amendment also calls on the Ulster Unionist Party to make clear its willingness to participate in and uphold inclusive government in Northern Ireland. We urge David Trimble and his party to show the courage and leadership necessary to carry things forward, despite the difficulties he faces and the fact that the anti-Agreement members of his party need to be faced down by him time and again. Time is of the essence in Northern Ireland. The Fine Gael Party urges all parties involved to waste no time and redouble their efforts to get the pro-Agreement parties together in order to make progress before the summer marching season begins.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">I recognise the efforts of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the process, although we have failed to date to get the Assembly re-instated and to fix a date for the election which was, unfortunately, cancelled due to a decision taken by the British Government. I agree that the Irish Government still has a significant role to play and I wish the Minister for Foreign Affairs well in those efforts.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Veterinary Medicines.</heading>
        <speech by="#SeamusKirk" eId="spk_634">
          <from>Mr. Kirk</from>
          <p eId="para_1303">I am glad of the opportunity to raise this important issue as far as the sheep farmers in the Cooley Peninsula are concerned. In the previous debate we had references to the co-operation between North and South to combat the serious difficulty of foot and mouth disease which was contained in the Cooley Peninsula. This was clearly at a significant price to the sheep farmers in the hills and mountains of the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304">Bringing new stock onto the hills and lowlands brings its own difficulties. The bringing of new stock into an area in which they are not immediately familiar poses its own problems. One of the difficulties we have is with looping ill disease. In recent times it has come to my attention that the availability of vaccine which helps the individual sheep farmer to counteract this problem has become less than available on the market for reasons which are unclear. Hence my raising the issue on the Adjournment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Aylward, for coming in to take this important item. I look forward to his response and hope he will have some good news for individual farmers who are finding it extremely difficult to source the vaccine to which I referred.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Aylward)</from>
          <p eId="para_1306">I thank Deputy Kirk for raising this matter. I know how important this is to him, particularly in regard to the Cooley Peninsula, but also to other prominent sheep-raising areas throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307">The market in veterinary medicines, which includes veterinary vaccines, is regulated under a comprehensive body of EU legislation. Member states are obliged to implement this legislation in a uniform way so as to ensure that the Single Market operates effectively. The EU legislation has been transposed into Irish law by means of the Animal Remedies Act 1993 and regulations made thereunder. The primary objective of this legislation is the protection of public health. Protection of animal health and welfare are also key objectives of the legislative regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_1308">The Irish Medicines Board is designated as the competent licensing authority for all categories of veterinary medicines, except for veterinary vaccines, where competence rests with the Department of Agriculture and Food. In the case of vaccines, prior to the enactment of the Animal Remedies Regulations 1996, product licences had been issued under outdated legislation, namely, the Therapeutic Substances Act 1932. Consequently it was necessary to fully review the licences for all vaccines on the Irish market by  reference to current scientific standards and in accordance with the detailed requirements of the current regulatory regime. In order to achieve this, the Department reached agreement with the Irish Medicines Board that the board, using its established expertise, would carry out the detailed examination of the voluminous and complex application dossiers from applicant companies and on this basis make a recommendation to the Department on the grant or otherwise of a licence and on the conditions to accompany such a licence. The Department as competent authority, then makes a final decision on each product application taking full account of the recommendation received from the Irish Medicines Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309">The product in question is used to vaccinate sheep against looping ill disease which, in Ireland, is geographically limited to rough hill grazing areas where the tick which spreads the disease is prevalent. The assessment of the product under the review process was begun by the Irish Medicines Board in April 2001. Expert examination of the application dossier revealed that the information and data submitted did not reach the required standard to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the product to enable it to be recommended by the Irish Medicines Board for licensing by the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310">I understand that in the intervening period a number of detailed exchanges took place between the Irish Medicines Board and the sponsoring company about the outstanding requirements and that the board had been prepared to afford the company concerned adequate opportunity to provide the required information and data which would demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine. I further understand that the company concerned informed the Irish Medicines Board in March last that it did not intend to sustain its application and consequently intended to withdraw the product from the Irish market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311">The company subsequently entered into correspondence with my Department about arrangements for withdrawal of its product from the Irish market. My Department wrote to the company concerned in mid-May seeking further relevant information and details and a response from the company is, as of now, awaited.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312">It will be evident from the above that the Department, as competent authority, has not had the opportunity to reach a final determination on a licensing application for this product. Indeed, the decision by the company to withdraw the product from the market pre-empted a final recommendation from the Irish Medicines Board on the grant or otherwise of a licence. It goes without saying that the initiative as to the maintenance of a licence application rests in the first instance with the applicant. That said, the Department continues to await a response to the issues raised with the company within the last two weeks. The company must respond to the Depart ment before a final decision can be made on this matter.</p>

        <heading>Hospital Practices.</heading>
        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_636">
          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_1313">I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter with the Minister because it is of deep concern to many of my constituents and to me personally. I request that the Minster meet with the victims of symphysiotomy so that he can hear at first hand, as I did, the barbarity and brutality that was inflicted upon these women. These women deserve, in the same way as the victims of the hepatitis C infections and the haemophiliacs infected with AIDS, a Government inquiry into the carrying out of this brutal practice. Those who carried out these procedures must be held accountable. I ask the Minister to meet with the survivors of this brutal practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314">I am concerned that the Minister for Health and Children and the medical profession have failed to provide answers regarding the use of symphysiotomies in obstetrical practice and the disturbingly high number of cases which were carried out in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. At least 349 symphysiotomies were carried out in County Louth. The last recorded case was at the hospital in 1983. I noted from previous answers to parliamentary questions that the practice was supposed to end in 1962, which is clearly not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">These women were neither informed about the procedure nor asked for their consent to have this brutal practice carried out on them. The hallmarks of the direction of the Catholic Church are apparent here. It was feared that women who had repeated sections would go on the pill or be sterilised. This cries out for an immediate and in-depth inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">Women who underwent this procedure have suffered terrible pain, back pain, incontinence and depression and other ensuing problems such as marital breakdown. In one case it was only after 33 years that the victim concerned found out that this procedure was carried out following an emergency section and the birth of her baby. At the time the symphysiotomy was carried out she was just 18 years of age. There was no justification for the carrying out of this procedure and the woman concerned has never received an explanation. There are many questions which must be answered regarding what went on in our at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. At the time it was run by the Medical Missionaries of Mary from whom the North-Eastern Health Board took over the hospital in 1995.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317">The Minister must not turn a deaf ear to the suffering of the survivors of symphysiotomy. They are seeking relatively little at this time. Their most urgent call is for a medical remedy for the serious effects of this dreadful and barbaric so-called procedure that was carried out on them. They are also seeking an independent inquiry, similar to that established for haemophiliacs and  those with hepatitis C. I hope these people will not have to take to the streets to demand what it is only fair and just for them to receive since this treatment was administered to them, effectively, by an organ of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318">They are also asking for counselling services to be put in place. At the moment these women have been left to counsel each other without the requisite skills. By sharing their experiences, however, they have tried to offer some solutions to lessen the difficulties they have encountered. In addition, they have sought a telephone helpline because many victims of this procedure have never come forward due to embarrassment and ignorance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319">In many cases they did not understand what this procedure involved. For the record I will outline the basic details. It involved sawing through the pelvic bone to assist an obstructed labour and permanently widen the birth canal for future births, as Caesarean sections were considered unsafe at the time. Many of the women to whom I have spoken, however, actually had the procedure carried out after giving birth. Many of them had no major difficulties in their pregnancies, yet this procedure was carried out.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1322">On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I welcome the opportunity to clarify the position in relation to the issues raised by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1323">In April 2001, arising from concerns about the use of symphysiotomy in obstetrical practice in the past, the chief medical officer at the Department of Health and Children asked the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists for its comments and advice on the matter. The institute represents obstetrical and gynaecological opinion in Ireland, acts as an advisory body on matters relating to education, research and administration in the speciality and seeks to raise standards in obstetrics and gynaecology in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1324">In May 2001, the institute replied to the chief medical officer and confirmed that from about 1920 to about 1960 symphysiotomy procedures were carried out on selected patients in Dublin, mainly at the National Maternity Hospital and the Coombe Hospital. In the case of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, my Department was informed by the North-Eastern Health Board that 188 such procedures were performed at the hospital in the period 1955 to 1982, with 158 of these being performed prior to 1970.</p>
          <p eId="para_1325">The institute advised that favourable results were claimed for the procedure which had the effect, as Deputy Morgan outlined, of permanently enlarging the pelvis and allowing women to undergo normal delivery. This was at a time when Caesarean section had a high mortality rate due to sepsis, one of the leading causes of maternal death at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1326">The institute stated that in properly conducted cases complications were rare. Published medical reports of the time indicated favourable results for the procedure. Many of the cases referred to in these reports were emergency admissions with obstructed labour where sepsis following Caesarean section would have carried a significant risk of maternal death.</p>
          <p eId="para_1327">From 1950 onwards, the operation of symphysiotomy for obstructed labour was gradually replaced by the modern Caesarean section as antibiotics were available by then to treat infection and sepsis was less of a hazard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328">The institute stated that "the operation of symphysiotomy remains an accepted indication for the management of a trapped after-coming head of a breech" but that Caesarean section is now recommended for all mature infants who present with a breech presentation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1329">We must be cautious about judging procedures and interventions which were used in previous generations in light of current knowledge and experience. Enormous medical advances have been made in obstetric practice since the 1950s and procedures were not as advanced then as they are in Ireland today. Under these circumstances, the Minister for Health and Children has no plans to establish an inquiry into the use of symphysiotomy in obstetrical practice.</p>

        <heading>Taxi Regulations.</heading>
        <speech by="#SeanRyan" eId="spk_640">
          <from>Mr. S. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_1330">On 21 November 2000, the taxi industry was deregulated overnight. Since then hundreds of families have suffered considerable financial loss and many are experiencing significant personal financial hardship. These are the facts of life for them today. Since then they have lobbied to have their plight recognised and adequate compensation awarded to them. To date they have been literally ignored, disregarded and treated with contempt by a Government whose decision to deregulate the industry was a politically motivated quick fix that failed to acknowledge the problems that would arise from such a short-sighted approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_1331">Overnight, the value of a taxi licence dropped from approximately €100,000 to about €6,500. No system was put in place to provide for those who were obliged to mortgage their homes and the future of their families to secure employment. An unsuccessful applicant in 1999 was told that if he wanted a taxi licence his only option was to purchase an existing one. It cost £77,000 and £3,000 was paid to Dublin Corporation to transfer the licence at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332">Despite the best efforts of many of the genuine, hard-working taxi drivers, the industry has deteriorated since deregulation. While the number of taxi plates has increased nearly threefold to 10,000 in the Dublin region, the morale of workers in the industry has dropped. Many of the new part-time taxi drivers only venture out at the weekend. Drivers who remortgaged their homes are obliged to work 12 to 14 hours a day, six days a week to exist and pay their mortgages. This is having a drastic effect on family life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333">The group entitled FAIR, Families Advocate Immediate Redress, brought its case to the European Union. The EU committee on petitions appointed a fact-finding delegation, which visited Ireland and made recommendations. The committee's report stated that without questioning the right of the Government to deregulate, it is clear that the original hasty decision was not a clearly thought-out response to the problems which existed in the industry. Further, the delegation was of the view that individual rights had not been fully recognised in dealing with the matter and were critical of the delay in resolving the individual cases of hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334">Some 30 months have passed since deregulation and there is still no progress to report. This is an utter scandal. The EU delegation recommended that the proposals of the taxi hardship panel should be reviewed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and by the Minister for Transport in light of the findings of the report and that new proposals should be made to the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335">What has the Minister done to date? He gave a commitment to the delegation that he would meet the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport to discuss proposals from the taxi hardship panel with a view to making new proposals to the Government on the levels of compensation. Thus far, he has failed to do so and all the indications are that he intends to renege on his promise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336">To date, the proposed taxi regulator has to be appointed and the relevant legislation will not be in place prior to the summer recess. Were the legislation to be published, that, at the very least, would represent some progress. When can the families who have suffered as a result of deregulation expect to receive adequate redress? They include families that borrowed large sums of money to buy into a Government-regulated industry in recent years, widows, drivers approaching retirement, the sick and the infirm.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337">Some Fianna Fáil TDs and councillors conned taxi drivers over the years. The least they could do now is ensure there is a commitment by the Minister to bring this issue to a satisfactory conclusion. The current situation is untenable and if the Minister is not prepared to meet the rightful demands as acknowledged by the EU petitions committee's report, we could well see the membership of FAIR having to take to the streets again to obtain a satisfactory outcome to their case. The Government has a political and moral responsibility to address this matter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_641">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1338">In 2000 Government efforts to provide for a substantial increase in Dublin taxi licence numbers to meet the demand for such services led to High Court proceedings. The subsequent October 2000 High Court judgment created the legal position that limitation of taxi licences in the interests of existing licence-holders could not be sustained. The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2000 were made to respond to the new legal reality and sought to establish orderly licensing arrangements in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339">The courts clarified on a number of occasions since 1992 that there can be no legal duty on the State to compensate taxi licence-holders in relation to the open market value of licences. However, in excess of 1,000 individual claims for damages or compensation arising from the October 2000 High Court judgment and the introduction of the new taxi-licensing regime have yet to come before the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340">The Government recognised that some difficulties might be caused by the new taxi regime for some existing taxi licence-holders, and it is appropriate to acknowledge the efforts that have been made to address those difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341">It was recognised that, given the many changes which were taking place, certain of those who had recently become holders of taxi and wheelchair-accessible taxi licences would be in the position of having paid much higher licence fees to local authorities than those which now obtained. Accordingly, arrangements were made for the introduction of a scheme of refunds by certain local authorities regarding taxi licence fees charged at above the default level fixed by the Public Service Vehicles Regulations 1995.</p>
          <p eId="para_1342">Additional mitigating measures were included in the Finance Act 2001, which provided for a new scheme of capital allowances for expenditure incurred on the cost of taxi licences acquired on or before 21 November 2000. The Act included specific provisions targeted at addressing some hardship cases that had been brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343">Following persistent claims that certain taxi licence-holders suffered extreme personal financial hardship following the November 2000 changes which may not have been fully addressed by the mitigation measures already put in place, the Government decided in February 2002 to approve the appointment of a panel of three independent persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344">The taxi hardship panel was asked to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship experienced by individual taxi licence-holders arising from loss of income as a direct result of the liberalisation of the taxi-licensing regime on 21 November 2000, including an estimate of the numbers of individual licence-holders involved, the likely financial implications and the recommended criteria for assessment of extreme personal financial hardship under any subsequent proposed response by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345">On 17 December 2002, the Government approved the phased implementation of the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel. The report of the taxi hardship panel recommends the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence-holders who fall into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">The design and administration of a scheme to implement the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel and the arrangements to facilitate the making of payments to eligible persons are being expedited to ensure that applications are dealt with confidentially and objectively. Every effort is being made to put in place a structure to facilitate the commencement of payments on the basis of the panel recommendations as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1347">On 19 November 2002 the Government approved the establishment, initially on a non-statutory basis, of the Office of the National Taxi Regulator. In that context, the preparation of the necessary legislation to support the establishment of a Commission for Taxi Regulation is proceeding as a matter of urgency in the Department of Transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_1348">As an interim measure, an interim chairman of the commission has been appointed pending the recruitment of a statutory chairman, and Mr. Farrelly has commenced a series of detailed consultations with those involved in the taxi, hackney and limousine industry, local authorities, the Garda Síochána and other interest groups with a view to assessing and addressing those issues relating to standards in the industry. The Minister for Transport has also asked Mr. Farrelly to expedite, as a priority, the implementation of the findings of the taxi hardship panel report.</p>

        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_642">
          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_1349">This issue is serious and I am glad to have the opportunity to raise it, having had it on the waiting list for Adjournment debates for some time. I hope that the Minister of State will take it as seriously as I do. I will not waste time by outlining the detailed history of the Irish ISPAT steel site, formerly Irish Steel, on Haulbowline Island in the centre of Cork harbour. The Minister will know that in 1996, in an effort to save the plant and jobs, Irish Steel was sold to Irish ISPAT, part of a huge multinational steel company, for IR£1. Now the plant has closed, the big question is who will take responsibility for the clean-up of the site and what environmental damage might be caused by what lies on it. The horrifying legacy of environmental pollution revealed by the Environmental Protection Agency's investigation in preparing to issue an integrated pollution control licence to Irish ISPAT is startling. A 2001 EPA report states:</p>
          <p eId="para_1350">The site investigation in 1995 involved trial pitting and the installation of bore holes distributed throughout the landfill. Trial pits of 4  metres depth indicated completely heterogeneous material, including silver slag material, brown gravel material containing metal and brick fragments, plastic bags and so on. Soil samples from the trial pits were analysed. These show high concentrates of copper, chromium, cadmium, lead and zinc.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351">In June 2001, the EPA imposed very significant obligations on the new owners, and rightly so, owing to environmental fears. I believe that the potential cost involved in fulfilling the EPA's requirements was one of the factors that contributed to Irish ISPAT's decision to close operations. Serious quantities of material have been dumped in the centre of Cork harbour adjacent to Haulbowline Island and Rocky Island. It was thought, and is still thought by some, that constructing a wall surrounding the landfill section of the island in an attempt to encase what may be contained in that dumping area will suffice.  Since liquidation, a receiver has been put in place and has been selling off bits and pieces of the site and obviously giving the money received to ISPAT. In recent weeks part of the overall ISPAT site was sold for €800,000 to Cork Harbour Commissioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352">I want the Minister to tell me who will take responsibility for the site when Irish ISPAT leaves this country in the next few weeks. When it does so, I fear that we will have no power to demand of it what we should be demanding, namely, a very significant contribution towards the clean-up of that site – in an area in the middle of Ireland's largest natural harbour perhaps as environmentally sensitive as anywhere else in the country – to make it environmentally safe. There are serious question marks as to whether it will suffice to surround the landfill with a wall because of leaching over time, and environmentalists question that as a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353">A company in liquidation is about to leave the country, selling off assets and apparently planning no significant contribution towards the clean-up operation. We will be left with part of an island with a landfill site where a variety of metal wastes and perhaps toxic chemicals have been dumped with the potential of leaching into Cork harbour. To give an idea of the cost we may be talking about, cleaning up the Dublin gas site cost between €19 million and €20 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354">I ask the Minister if it is possible for the Government to freeze the remaining assets of Irish ISPAT until we have secured a significant contribution towards the clean-up operations on that site. Does the Minister possess a detailed environmental assessment of the site so that we can put to rest people's fears about what is there and how the State will deal with it? Regardless of whether we like it and how expensive it proves, the site must be cleaned up for the sake of people living in the Cork harbour area and so that we can progress and develop that site for the benefit of Cork harbour in future.</p>

        <speech by="#PatTheCope" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_643">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_1355">I will begin by thanking Deputy Coveney for raising this matter in the House and for providing an opportunity to outline the up-to-date position on matters connected with Irish ISPAT. While Deputy Coveney takes this matter very seriously, it is not necessary for me to state that the Department and I take it equally as seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356">At the outset, it might be useful if I set out the background to this case. In 1996, the State sold Irish Steel Limited to ISPAT Mexicana for the nominal consideration of £1. As part of the sale agreement, the company received payments and loan write-offs to the value of approximately €47 million. These reflected the fact that Irish Steel Limited was carrying significant liabilities and had a considerable negative net value. As part of the sale agreements, ISPAT Mexicana gave a number of commitments, including an undertaking that a payment of £2.36 million made to the company would be spent on environmental works. In a subsequent reorganisation of the ISPAT Group, ISPAT International became Irish ISPAT's parent company, in place of ISPAT Mexicana. Most of the commitments entered into under the sale of Irish Steel had been met by the time Irish ISPAT Limited ceased trading and went into liquidation in June 2001. However, there remains some outstanding issues to be determined, particularly in relation to the expenditure on environmental works.</p>
          <p eId="para_1357">Among the assets of Irish ISPAT Limited were the land and buildings on Haulbowline and elsewhere from which the company operated. Some of these lands were held on a freehold basis while others were leased. The Haulbowline lands, on which the company's main production facility was located, were leased from the Departments of Finance and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The lease contained standard type clauses requiring that, on its termination, the lands should be reinstated. It should be noted that an expert report commissioned by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources indicates that the cost of full site remediation could be in the region of €30 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1358">The liquidator has applied to the High Court seeking an order allowing him to disclaim the lease under section 290 of the Companies Act 1963 on the basis that it is onerous. In addition, in accordance with a break clause in the lease, he is seeking to surrender the lease itself. The State is resisting these actions. Separately, proceedings have also been initiated under the Waste Management Act 1996.</p>
          <p eId="para_1359">An interim injunction was granted to the State on 19 May 2003, restraining the liquidator from vacating the leased land. Yesterday, an interlocutory injunction was granted by agreement between the parties, pending the liquidator's removal of radioactive materials from the lease hold site. This injunction will remain in place until 18 June at which point the liquidator will update the court on progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_1360">As Irish ISPAT Limited is in liquidation, it is now a matter for the liquidator to realise the assets of the company and to apply the funds realised to discharge the legal liabilities of the company to the extent possible in line with the normal requirements of insolvency law. The State will be seeking to maximise any possible recoveries from the liquidation or otherwise in respect of the costs of whatever environmental clean-up of the site is required. The various legal actions to  which I have referred are consistent with this objective. Given the liquidator's role and responsibilities in this matter, legal advice received indicates that it would not be necessary or appropriate to seek to freeze the assets of the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361">In responding to this item, I have endeavoured to provide as much information as possible for Deputy Coveney while respecting the fact that matters connected with this case are the subject of various legal proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362">The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 28 May 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_1371">I propose to take Questions Nos. 88, 91, 119, 124, 129, 140 and 144 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1372">The Deputies will be aware that my Department, supported by ADM Limited co-ordinates the implementation of the RAPID programme. It is, however, a matter for individual Departments to advance and report on progress in relation to implementing RAPID proposals that fall within the remit of their areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1373">I am on record as saying, however, that there are certain elements in relation to the RAPID process that I am unhappy with. One of these is the difficulty in quantifying the amount of spend in RAPID areas brought about by re-prioritisation. In addition, plans received from the RAPID areas are varied, ranging from small low cost local actions to large scale proposals with considerably higher cost implications. I am endeavouring to separate small scale proposals which can be dealt with at a local level by the Partnerships and the CDB structure, from the large proposals that have to be dealt with at a central Government level. Over the coming weeks and months, discussions will take place with the area implementation teams, partnerships and CDBs in relation to implementing this proposal. My Department will also be discussing the issue with the south and east and BMW regional assemblies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374">In terms of staffing issues, the Deputies will appreciate that the allocation of specific staff to deal with the RAPID programme is a matter for individual Departments. However, following a series of meetings between my Departments and other Departments during 2002, I am satisfied that sufficient staff resources have been put in place to deal with the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1375">It is a matter for each Department to make allocations to RAPID projects from available NDP funding within their own budgets. As regards my own Department, proposals from the RAPID plans fall to be considered under the young people's facilities and services fund, the community development programme and funding for local drugs task forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_1376">In the case of proposals relevant to the YPFSF, proposals submitted under the RAPID plans will be considered in the context of decisions to be made under round II and in light of the overall funding position for 2003.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_20">A number of proposals in RAPID plans relate to the community development programme. Allocations of funding to six new community development projects in RAPID areas were announced recently. Projects in Bluebell, Dolphin House, Inchicore, Merchants Quay-Ushers Quay, Longford Town and Tipperary each received a renewable one year contract for funding of €60,000. In addition, core funding was provided under the CDP to St. Munchins CDP – £100,000 - €127,000 – was provided to the building project in 2001 and €25,000 was paid to St. Munchin in 2002 towards equipping the centre.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_21">An amount of €1 million was also allocated under the premises initiative to a local drugs task force project in Tallaght.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_22">My Department has provided €2.2 million to the area implementation teams to support the local areas in the preparation and implementation of their plans.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_23">In regard to CLÁR, the measures introduced under the programme were decided after consultation with the communities in the areas concerned. Furthermore, they are, for the most part, operated in tandem with the lead Departments or agencies, as appropriate, thus ensuring efficiency and effectiveness as well as meeting the needs of the people in the CLÁR areas.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1418">I propose to take Questions Nos. 93, 96, 100 and 428 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1419">Area Development Management Limited manages the local development social inclusion programme on behalf of my Department. Allocations from within the budget available for the programme in 2003 have now been agreed by the board of ADM and notified to each partnership and community group.</p>
          <p eId="para_1420">As the Deputies will appreciate, ADM must manage the programme from within the budget available in my Department's Vote. This year the Vote of my Department for local development-social inclusion measures is €44.6 million, compared to an allocation of €47.6 million in 2002. This represents a decrease of 6% in the Vote.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_36">The reductions in available funding for 2003 are being managed on a sliding scale, ranging from 4% to 7%, depending on the annual budget of the area partnership company or community group. As I have outlined to this House on a number of occasions in recent weeks, I am aware that some area partnership companies and community groups had the expectation of carry-over  of previous years underspends into 2003. However, it is important to point out that my Department – as do all Government Departments – operates it on an annual cash basis and not on an accrual basis. Therefore, my Department cannot facilitate a cumulative carry-over of underspends.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_37">I am looking at the position regarding unpaid valid claims which were submitted by the partnerships to ADM prior to Christmas 2002 which were not paid until 2003. I can assure the Deputies that ADM is working closely with the area partnerships to minimise, as far as possible, the impact of the reductions in funding this year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_38">The following tables set out the revised allocations to the various bodies in 2003. With regard to Drogheda and Cork City partnerships, the reductions in their allocations are 7% each.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_39">With regard to the future of area partnerships, one of my Department's primary objectives is to maximise the impact, coherence and effectiveness of the local and community development programmes for which it is responsible. As a first step towards achieving this objective, a review of the programmes and activities that fall within the remit of my Department is being undertaken, with a view to achieving greater coherence across the various initiatives and improved impact for communities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_40">The views of the relevant parties, including area partnerships, have been sought and will be considered in the context of the review. In this context I am well aware of and appreciate the valuable work being undertaken by the area partnerships.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
          <p eId="para_1746">In terms of Government policy generally there have been significant developments in recent years which contributed to the increase the use of the Irish language nationally and which continue to do so: Raidió na Gaeltachta is now broadcasting 24 hours a day; TG4 is now well established with a constantly increasing audience; the importance of the Irish language is recognised in the Planning Acts; An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta has been established; specific responsibility for Gaeltacht and Irish language matters has been reassigned to a Cabinet Minister, which is a clear indication of the importance of the language in the Government programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1747">From the perspective of my own Department, a review was carried out in recent months of departmental schemes and policies as part of the process of drawing up the Department's first strategy statement. That process identified a number of critical issues to be addressed in relation to Irish language policy over the period 2003-2005, including the examination of the recommendations of the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta; language planning, followed by the implementation of a focused action plan; and the provision of Irish-medium education at all levels. There has been a significant growth in the number of Irish language schools in recent years. This has been supported by my Department through annual funding from Foras na Gaeilge to the organisation Gaelscoileanna.</p>
          <p eId="para_1748">As regards the provision of public services through Irish, the Official Languages Bill 2002 has particular policy relevance. Key tasks arising from its provisions will include: working with Government Departments and other public bodies to put in place agreed new schemes and structures regarding service provision through Irish; and establishing an operating structure for the official languages commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1749">As I stated in this House last week on the Second Stage of the Bill, I am confident that its enactment will have a major positive impact on the position of the Irish language in the life of the country, including a significant increase in the visibility of the language on a day-to-day basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1750">Other key tasks planned, or already in hands, include the rolling out, on a broad front, of a series of practical, costed measures to strengthen Irish as the principal community language in the Gaeltacht; working with Údarás na Gaeltachta to strengthen the organisation's focus on language-centred projects; supporting Foras na Gaeilge in its statutory task of increasing the use of the Irish language in everyday life throughout the island of Ireland; and the preparation of a publication setting out the evolution of the Irish language, its constitutional and legal status, official policies to support and promote its role in contemporary Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_1755"><i>Homeless</i>The NACD has been working with key groups from the addiction and homeless services, the health boards, the ERHA and the homeless agency to identify the key issues relating to drugs use and homelessness in Ireland and to advise on the scope and implementation of the research study to be commissioned. Following a competitive tendering process, the contract for the study was awarded to Merchants Quay Ireland in February 2003 and the final report is due before the end of 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1756"><i>Travellers</i>The NACD has established a research steering group to assess the issues relating to drug misuse among the Traveller community. The NACD and the steering group, consisting of representative agencies from the Traveller community such as the Irish Traveller Movement, Pavee Point etc. and the traveller health unit within the Department of Health and Children, have been working in close collaboration over a number of months to develop a specific research methodology and research design for this study. Following the tendering process, a research organisation has been selected to conduct this study and the research is scheduled to commence in June and due to be completed by end of 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1757"><i>Early School Leavers and Sex Workers</i>The NACD has been liaising with agencies working with these groups to identify the key issues warranting examination. On the basis of this work, research proposals and appropriate research methodologies will be developed and a request for tender will be issued later this year.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_652">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1762">I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 141 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1763">The National Advisory Committee on Drugs, for which my Department has responsibility, recently published a study on the prevalence of opiate misuse in Ireland. The estimate is based on statistics provided by three data sources for 2001 – the central drug treatment list, the national Garda study on drugs,crime and related activity and the hospital in-patient inquiry database.</p>
          <p eId="para_1764">This is the first formal estimate of the number of opiate users since the 1996 study carried by Dr. Catherine Comiskey, which used the same methodology. However, it should be noted that the 1996 study estimated prevalence for Dublin only.</p>
          <p eId="para_1765">The latest study estimates that there were 14,452 people using opiates in Ireland in 2001. The estimated figure for Dublin is 12,456 compared to the 1996 figure of 13,461. The drop in prevalence figures in Dublin is encouraging and to be welcomed as is the much reduced numbers of users estimated to be in the 15 to 24 year old bracket which may point to a lower rate of initiation into heroin misuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_1766">Since 1996 the availability of treatment for opiate dependence has increased very significantly and this may be a factor in explaining the latest estimates. For example in relation to methadone, there were 1,350 places available on the central methadone treatment list at the start of 1996, whereas currently there are 6,600.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_57">As I said at the time of the launch of the NACD study, while many of the studys findings are encouraging, we cannot afford any degree of  complacency. The Government remains committed to working in partnership with communities most affected by drug misuse and the continued implementation of the national drug strategy remains a priority.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_58">In relation to the Merchant's Quay, I am aware there were a number of media reports mentioning the figures raised by the Deputies. It is my understanding, however, that the Director of Merchant's Quay Ireland has since clarified that he was misquoted regarding the 30,000 figure and that he based his estimate on the Eastern Regional Health Authority figures which were, in turn, based on the 1996 Comiskey study.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_59">As the Deputies are aware, Merchant's Quay Ireland works with homeless persons and drug misusers and I am very familiar with their valuable work and have visited their sites on number of occasions. The organisation provides an impressive array of services ranging from open access, crisis intervention, needle-exchange and health promotion services, to day-support programmes, educational programmes, vocational training and settlement support services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_60">In relation to funding, my Department has responsibility for the local drugs task forces through which Merchant's Quay has received funding in the past. A number of projects included in the first round of local drugs task force plans run by Merchant's Quay were positively evaluated and mainstreamed by relevant Departments and agencies who are now responsible for their continued and on-going funding.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_61">Merchant's Quay currently receives funding from a number of statutory sources. Their main funding comes from the South-Western Area Health Board which has allocated more than €1.08 million to them in 2003 under Section 65 of the Health Act 1953 and a further €116,000 to projects mainstreamed through the local drugs task forces.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_62">In addition, through Dublin City Council, the Department of the Environment and Local Government funds the Fáiltiú Resource Centre in Merchant's Quay. I understand the allocation in 2003 is €859,950 and that last year, Fáiltiú received funding of more than €677,000.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_63">Merchant's Quay Ireland is also supported by FÁS which has enabled the development of a number of community employment projects and by CERT who have helped develop training opportunities in the tourism sector for homeless persons and drug misusers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_64">On further funding, I understand my colleague the Minister for Health and Children recently informed this House that there is regular communication and discussion between his Department and Merchant's Quay Ireland in relation to the services they provide. In this context, I understand that Merchant's Quay Ireland is at present considering a proposal from the South-Western Area Health Board regarding the provision of additional services relating to homelessness and addiction.</summary>

The forum was first convened in May 2000 and has met on three occasions since then. Issues discussed at previous meetings of the forum included progress on the implementation of the White Paper on Rural Development, farm incomes, the national spatial strategy, rural transport, rural tourism, rural planning and financial services in rural areas.

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_66">I do not agree with the opinion expressed with regard to Government support for the Gaeltacht. My Department supports the Gaeltacht in a range of ways, all of which are aimed at the pro motion of sustainable and culturally vibrant communities there and the maintenance and strengthening of the use of the Irish language as the chosen spoken language of the region. For example, last year capital grants exceeding €16.5 million from my Department were approved for the improvement of Gaeltacht infrastructure, including roads, marine works, village renewal and various recreational facilities such as community centres, playing fields and other such amenities. This represents an increase of 12% on the previous year. A further €4.7 million was expended by my Department in 2002 under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts in order to further improve the housing stock in the Gaeltacht – an increase of almost 25% on 2001. My Department continues to support Gaeltacht households who provide suitable accommodation for learners of Irish who attend Irish language summer colleges and I was delighted to be in a position earlier this year to sanction a substantial increase in the grant paid to these households. My Department also provided more than €1.5 million last year for various organisations working to maintain and strengthen the Irish language and culture in the Gaeltacht.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_67">Údarás na Gaeltachta, which, as the Deputy is aware, discharges its responsibilities through a range of socio-economic activities in the Gaeltacht, received a total of €42.9 million from my Department last year to allow it to continue with the development of the Gaeltacht economy and the preservation of the Irish language. As Minister with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, I recognise that the Irish language is the most valuable resource in the Gaeltacht and that the future development of the Gaeltacht will depend in no small way on its preservation.</summary>

To this end, my Department is involved in a wide range of invest ment programmes, both EU and national to promote this objective.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_70">In addition to the EU programmes and the national development plan investments, I also introduced the CLÁR programme in October, 2001 to address depopulation as well as the decline and lack of services in rural areas.</summary>

These include areas I announced last January in honouring the Government commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to review the areas in light of the 2002 population census results. These areas suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 2002 with an average population loss of 50%. The exception is the Cooley Peninsula which was included based on the serious difficulties caused there by foot and mouth disease.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1780">On foot of information provided to him in response to previous parliamentary questions the Deputy will be aware that my Department is responsible for a wide range of schemes relating primarily to the support of community and voluntary activity, particularly among disadvantaged communities, throughout the entire country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1781">Decisions to award grants are made on a continual basis on foot of the consideration of applications received. The advertising of grant schemes and the announcements of awards are publicised through a variety of media including my Departments website www.pobail.ie. Details of the various schemes are provided as follows:</p>
          <p eId="para_1782">My Department supports local self-help and community development initiatives targeted at disadvantaged communities nationwide, in recognition of the role that voluntary groups have in facilitating local communities to address the problems facing them. This support is made available through a range of grant schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1783">The scheme of grants for locally-based community and voluntary organisations provides funding towards training and education initiatives, self-help and personal development programmes, the renovation or acquisition of premises, the purchase of equipment or transport, once-off publications or research or other special projects. The scheme of community support to older people provides funding for initiatives to improve the security and support of vulnerable older people.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_76">On an ongoing basis, my Department also supports 155 locally-based projects nationwide, which are involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives in their communities. This support is provided by way of funding through the community development support pro grammes and the funding is targeted specifically at disadvantaged communities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_77">The Department recently appointed consultants to carry out an assessment of applications under the scheme of grants for training and supports in the community and voluntary sector and under the funding scheme to support the role of federations, networks and umbrella bodies in the community and voluntary sector. It is expected that these assessments will be completed in the coming months. All applicants will be advised of the outcome of their application shortly thereafter.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_78">In addition to the above schemes that operate to the benefit of all regions of the country my Department also oversees a number of schemes that operate on a restricted geographical basis. These include measures under the CLÁR programme which, of course, only apply to the specified CLÁR areas. These have recently been expanded to cover parts of 18 counties. These measures support physical, community and social infrastructure across a variety of schemes such as electricity conversions, roads, water and sewerage, village enhancement, health and sports projects. Support for rural development research and pilot projects may be provided from the rural development fund.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_79">My Department has responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the RAPID, revitalising areas by planning, investment and development programme. The programme which is managed by ADM Limited is designed to ensure that 25 urban centres and 20 provincial towns with the greatest concentration of disadvantage receive priority attention for the funding of investment under the national development plan.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_80">My Department also continues to provide grant assistance in Gaeltacht areas towards the improvement of Gaeltacht infrastructure, including housing, roads, marine works, village renewal and various recreational facilities such as community centres, playing fields and other amenities. Grants are provided to Gaeltacht households who accommodate Irish language students and grant assistance is also available under the Irish language speaking scheme. My Department also provides funding to Údarás na Gaeltachta which enables the Údarás to establish and develop job creating industries and services in Gaeltacht regions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_81">Grants are provided by my Department for economic and social development on offshore islands as well as the subsidising of the operation of ferry-air services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_82">Funding is provided to a number of Irish language organisations at international, national and local level to foster the use of Irish outside the Gaeltacht. This includes grants paid jointly by my Department and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the North to An Foras Teanga to foster Irish, Ullans and Ulster Scots cultural issues.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_83">As in previous years, it is proposed to award grants under the various schemes outlined above during 2003.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1787">I propose to take Questions Nos. 106, 113 and 127 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1788">My Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the national drugs strategy 2001-2008. The strategy aims to tackle the drug problem in the most comprehensive way ever undertaken in this country and contains 100 individual actions, under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1789">Since it was launched in May 2001, Departments and agencies have made considerable progress in implementing the actions set out for them in the strategy. The interdepartmental group on drugs, which I chair, meets regularly in conjunction with the national drugs strategy team, to assess progress being made and any obstacles to the implementation of any of the actions are brought to light at these meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1790">The strategy also provides for an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the overall framework by end 2004. This will examine the progress being made in achieving the overall key strategic goals set out in the strategy and will enable priorities for further action to be identified and a refocusing of the strategy, if necessary.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_84">Six monthly progress reports on the strategy are provided to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion, the most recent of which was presented in September last. It is intended to submit a further progress report to the committee next month and this is currently being finalised. In this regard, I can tell the Deputies that approximately one third of the 100 actions have already been  completed or are on-going tasks over the life of the strategy. With the exception of a few actions where work has yet to commence, I can confirm that work is in progress on the remainder.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_85">I wish to highlight, in particular, a few areas where significant progress has been made: The Customs and Excise have launched a coastal watch programme and have implemented a number of measures to enhance drugs detection capability at points of entry; guidelines to assist schools in the development of a drugs policy have also been developed and were issued to all primary and post primary schools in May 2002; the Department of Education and Science is now represented on all local drugs task forces and are recruiting extra support staff to enable the delivery of substance misuse prevention programme in all schools. Schools in the local drugs task force areas are being prioritised in this context; considerable progress is also being made as regards increasing the number of methadone treatment places. The number of places at the end of January 2003, the latest date for which confirmed figures are available, was 6,601 exceeding the target of 6,500 set in the strategy. The equivalent figure at the end of 2000 was 5,032; a national drugs awareness campaign was launched on 15 May. The campaign features television and radio advertising supported by an information brochure and website, all designed to promote greater awareness and communication about the drugs issue in Ireland. This first phase targets the general population while subsequent phases will focus on specific groups such as parents and young people; more than 1,100 recovering drug misusers are now on the special FÁS community employment programme; and regional drugs task forces are being established in the ten health board areas throughout the country. The national drugs strategy team has prepared guidelines for their operation and, to date, most of the RDTFs have held their first meetings.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_86">On the local drugs task forces and young people's facilities and services fund my Department also has responsibility for the work of the 14 local drugs task forces. All the LDTFs, with the exception of Bray, are currently implementing their second round of action plans and, to date, over €14.5 million has been allocated. In total, the Government has allocated or spent over €65 million to implement the approximately 500 projects contained in the plans of the task forces since 1997. The Deputies should also note that over €11.5 million has been allocated to projects under the premises initiative, which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_87">In addition, over €59 million has been allocated to support approximately 350 facility and services projects in LDTF areas and the four other urban centres under the young peoples facilities and services fund. The main aim of the fund is to attract "at risk" young people in disadvantaged areas into recreational facilities and activities and  divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_88">In total, approximately €135 million has been allocated or spent by the Government since 1997 through these initiatives in the LDTF areas and the four other urban centres funded through the YPFSF.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1792">There is a commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to provide new fixed wing air services to both Inishbofin, County Galway and Tory Island, County Donegal and to upgrade the existing infrastructure on the three Aran islands. During my term as Minister of State for the Gaeltacht and the Islands, I decided to carry out a comprehensive study on the proposed development and day-to-day management of airstrips and associated air services on a number of offshore islands, including Inishbofin, County Galway and Tory Island, County Donegal. This study, carried out by the air transport group, Cranfield University was essential in order to inform my Department of how best to go about providing air services to the offshore islands.</p>
          <p eId="para_1793">I also requested Údarás na Gaeltachta, independently of that study, to proceed with the planning of airstrips on Inishbofin and Tory Island. Much progress has been made by an tÚdarás in this regard, including the obtaining of planning permission for an airstrip on Inishbofin</p>
          <p eId="para_1794">It is my intention to press ahead with this work with a view to fulfilling the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government. With regard to the upgrading of the Aran islands infrastructure, the Irish Aviation Authority has drawn up a list of works in respect of these three airstrips in order to bring them up to an acceptable standard. I understand that Údarás na Gaeltachta, which owns these facilities and oversees their operation, has set aside a portion of its 2003 financial allocation for this purpose.</p>

As I indicated in that reply, the joint approach being taken by me and my colleagues, the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Environment and Local Government, has three basic strands. These include a consultative process with the various agencies and bodies, a review of existing arrangements between Area Development Management Limited, Government Departments and other stakeholders, while the third element is a requirement that various local agencies and boards submit their business plans to city or county development boards for endorsement, in order to support greater coherence at local level.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_661">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1808">I propose to take Questions Nos. 110, 117, 132, 137 and 426 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1809">My Department has no direct responsibility for either alcohol or youth affairs policies, which rest with the Ministers for Health and Children and Education and Science respectively. My Departments primary role with respect to young people is through the management of the young peoples facilities and services fund which is aimed at countering drug misuse.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_91">The fund was established in 1998, in the context of the Government's national drugs strategy, to assist in the development of facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The objective of the fund is to attract "at risk" young people into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_92">To date, the main focus of the fund has been in the 14 local drugs task force areas. However, recognising that the drug problem is not confined to the LDTF areas, funding was also allocated to a number of urban areas, Galway Limerick, Waterford and Carlow, where a serious drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_93">Under the first round of the fund, just over €54 million was allocated to the 14 LDTF areas. The following tables provide details of the allocations made under the first round. Overall expenditure up to end 2002 was €39.813 million. However, it should be noted that the Department of Education and Science retains responsibility for expenditure up to the end of 2002 and we have asked that Department to forward the relevant detailed information on each project to Deputy Stanton as soon as possible.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_94">My Department has taken over responsibility for expenditure under the fund from January 2003 and funding of €15.877 million is available in the Departments Vote this year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_95">With regard to the current position, the national assessment committee for the fund which is chaired by my Department, is examining the services projects funded under round one, including the Donnycarney youth project. The intention would be where they are found to be effective, they will be mainstreamed, thereby enabling their on-going provision by statutory agencies.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_96">Qualification for continued funding is dependant on the successful evaluation of each project by the services steering group, which has been set up to examine the projects, and subject to sufficient funding being in place. I understand that the work of the steering group has been completed and recommendations will be submitted to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion at its June meeting. The development groups will be informed of the outcome as soon as possible thereafter.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_97">The position regarding the funding of additional proposals is being considered by the assessment committee who are having on-going discussions with the relevant Departments and State agencies involved.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_98">Recently, the Cabinet committee also considered a number of issues in relation to the operation of the fund, including its future funding. The matter will be kept under review and the Cabinet committee will be returning to the issue again at its next meeting.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_99">The YPFSF is regarded as a very important element of the overall national drugs strategy,  particularly the prevention pillar, and has been very positively received in local drugs task force areas since it commenced five years ago. In sup porting communities in their efforts to prevent young people drifting into drug misuse, the fund aims to provide positive alternatives and divert them away from the dangers of drug dependency.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2812">With regard to the issue raised by Deputy Bruton, the national drugs strategy team carried out a comprehensive review of local drugs task forces during 2002. The recommendations of this review are extremely valuable and helpful and have been discussed at meetings of the interdepartmental group on drugs, which I chair. The Deputy should note that many of the recommendations are currently being implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_2813">The LDTFs continue to play a valuable role in tackling the drug problem in the areas of highest misuse, particularly opiate misuse. With regard to the question of additional resources, as my Department is currently involved in a consultation process on greater cohesion and integration across community and local development initiatives, I do not envisage the question of additional staff being considered until this process has been completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_2814">With regard to the other issue raised by Deputy Timmins, in March 2002, the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion approved a number of proposals under phase II of the action plans of the LDTFs. However, a number of projects had previously been identified by the NDST as being more appropriate for funding by agencies under mainstream programmes and initiatives. As a result, my Department wrote to the other relevant Departments and to the National Advisory Committee on Drugs asking them to consider funding the projects identified under their on-going programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_2815">The matter is currently been pursued in conjunction with the LDTFs and the NDST.</p>

          <p eId="para_2820">My Department has responsibility for the work of the local drugs task forces, which were established in 1997, in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse. Currently, there are 14 local drugs task forces – 12 in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Bray. All the LDTFs, with the exception of Bray, are currently implementing their second round of action plans and, to date, over €14.5 million has been allocated to implement these plans. In total, the Government, through the Cabinet committee on social inclusion, has allocated or spent over €65 million to implement approximately 500 projects contained in the plans of the task forces since 1997. The Deputy should also note that over €11.5 million has been allocated by the Cabinet committee to projects under the premises initiative, which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects, the majority of which are in LDTF areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_2821">In addition, over €59 million has been allocated to Cabinet committee to support approximately 350 facility and services projects in LDTF areas and the four other urban centres under the young peoples facilities and services fund. The main aim of the fund is to attract "at risk" young people in disadvantaged areas into recreational facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.</p>

          <p eId="para_2827">I established an advisory committee in October 2002 to advise on the actions necessary to facilitate the practical implementation, where appropriate, of proposals contained in the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta.</p>
          <p eId="para_2828">Among the issues and initiatives being considered and progressed by my Department with the assistance of the advisory committee are: the linguistic impact of planning policy in the Gaeltacht; the presentation of a submission in regard to critical issues affecting the Irish language in primary and post-primary education in the Gaeltacht; proposals for the re-structuring of Irish language pre-school services in the Gaeltacht; and recommendations in regard to new structures for youth organisations in the Gaeltacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_2829">My Department has had consultations with relevant government Departments and other organisations in relation to progressing these specific issues and further discussions, where appropriate, are planned.</p>
          <p eId="para_2830">In addition, the general question of how best to strengthen the linguistic development of the Gaeltacht was the subject of recent discussions by the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_2831">On foot of those discussions, I am commissioning a comprehensive linguistic study of Irish usage in Gaeltacht areas which will form the basis for the development of the Gaeltacht as an Irish-speaking area and for a review of Gaeltacht boundaries. The terms of reference for the study have been finalised by my Department and tenders will be invited shortly by way of open competition. I expect that the contract will have been awarded and the study commenced by the autumn. I have arranged for a copy of the terms of reference to be sent to the Deputies as soon as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_138">The transmission of the Irish language from one generation to the next is critical for its survival. In this regard, an action plan, aimed at advising parents in Gaeltacht areas, particularly those with young children, of the advantages of choosing Irish as the household language, is currently being formulated by a sub-group established by the advisory committee. It is intended to bring forward proposals in relation to this action plan in the very near future. In addition, my Department is engaged in a review of schemes which play a significant role in strengthening the usage and transmission of Irish in Gaeltacht areas  in general, namely scéim labhairt na Gaeilge and the language assistants scheme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_139">I intend, in tandem with the advisory committee, to press ahead with these and other proposals in the coming months. It should be recognised, of course, that the successful outcome of the overall process is largely dependant on the co-operation and commitment of all who have a stake in the future of Irish as a language in Gaeltacht areas, not least of which are the relevant government Departments and State agencies as well as the Gaeltacht communities themselves.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_140">As regards the provision of public services through Irish, the Official Languages Bill 2002 has particular policy relevance. Key tasks arising from its provisions will include working with Departments and other public bodies to put in place agreed new schemes and structures regarding service provision through Irish; and establishing an operating structure for the official languages commissioner.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_141">As I stated in this House last week on the Second Stage of the Bill, I am confident that its enactment will have a major positive impact on the position of the Irish language in the life of the country, including a significant increase in the visibility of the language on a day-to-day basis.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2836">I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 and 131 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2837">Negotiations on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food. He agrees with the broad thrust of the Commissions proposals under the mid-term review of Agenda 2000, in so far as rural development is concerned, which is to extend the range of on-farm rural development measures to promote food quality, meet higher standards and foster animal welfare. However, the Commission is also proposing to introduce a system of modulation, which would reduce direct payments to farmers receiving over €5,000 a year to provide additional funds for such rural development. There is an intrinsic contradiction in this proposal to reduce farmers incomes, which will be damaging the economies of rural areas in order to provide funds for certain rural development measures. My colleague has made his overall opposition to the proposals clear in the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers and his objective in the negotiations is to preserve the benefits to Irish agriculture and to rural communities achieved under the Agenda 2000 Agreement. The Minister for Agriculture and Food continues to keep me apprised of the progress of the negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_2838">As I have indicated, rural development in the context of the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy is farm-related, and not wider rural development as is generally understood here.</p>
          <p eId="para_2839">In relation to the rural development programmes for which I have responsibility, principally Leader, the outcome of the Common Agricultural Policy negotiations will not affect existing financial commitments under the national development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_2840">However, my Department will be working closely with the Department of Agriculture and Food in the coming period to ensure that coherent rural development policies are pursued, so that the effects of any changes in farm related policies do not impact negatively on rural development generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_2841">The mid-term review of the national development plan being carried out currently will also assist in terms of assessing the effectiveness of expenditure in this area.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_670">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_2843">My Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the national drugs strategy 2001-08. The strategy aims to tackle the drug problem in the most comprehensive way ever undertaken in this country and contains 100 individual actions – under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research – to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_2844">My Department also has responsibility for the work of the local drugs task forces, which were established in 1997, in the areas experiencing the highest levels of drug misuse. Currently, there are 14 local drugs task forces – 12 in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Bray. In total, the Government has spent or allocated over €130 million to implement the proposals contained in the two rounds of plans of the task forces since 1997, the premises initiative for drugs projects and young peoples facilities and services fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_2845">As regards the research which has been done in the area of cocaine use in Ireland, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs has commissioned a national population survey, which is due to be completed this summer and which should give us a reliable picture of drug use nationwide, including cocaine. The committee also undertook its own review of the available information on the nature and extent of cocaine use in Ireland and this was presented to the interdepartmental group on drugs in April.</p>
          <p eId="para_2846">In this context, the best available information is based on the recent SLÁN, survey of lifestyles, attitudes and nutrition, survey carried out by the Department of Health and Children, which found that 2.4% of respondents in the 18 to 64 year age bracket reported using cocaine in the 12 months preceding the survey. More recent provisional figures from the Customs and Excise and the Garda also suggest that cocaine seizures in Ireland have increased substantially, particularly in 2002, and the Garda authorities have expressed concern at the apparent recent increase in cocaine use, especially in the Dublin City area.</p>
          <p eId="para_2847">The Eastern Regional Health Authority has also reported that its services are beginning to notice an increase in those presenting with problems related to cocaine use, though it should be noted that the numbers involved are still very low and, in total, they make up about 1% of those in treatment.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_143">The increase of cocaine use in Ireland would appear to coincide with an increase in the availability and use of cocaine in Europe generally, as a result of increased production, particularly in Colombia, and a consequential drop in the street price. In addition, I am aware that there is a growing perception among some people that cocaine is a safe drug. I am very conscious of the  fact that we need to counter this perception as the risks associated with the drug are very high, particularly when combined with alcohol.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_144">In this regard, it is worth noting that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and I recently launched the first phase of a national awareness campaign. The campaign features television and radio advertising supported by an information brochure and website, all designed to promote greater awareness and communication about the drugs issue in Ireland, including cocaine. This first phase targets the general population while subsequent phases will focus on specific groups such as parents and young people.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_145">With regard to treatment, as the Deputy is probably aware there is no substitution treatment drug for cocaine and I understand that existing services such as counselling and behavioural therapy are the best treatments available. It is worth noting that the three area health boards of the Eastern Region Health Authority have recruited additional counsellors and outreach workers in the last number of years and that the Northern Area Health Board has recently established a treatment clinic, dedicated to cocaine misuse, in the north inner city.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_146">I am confident that any measures that may need to be taken to tackle cocaine use can be addressed in the context of the national drugs strategy 2001-08 and I can assure the Deputy that I will be keeping the matter under review.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2870">In July 2000, I approved a grant of €1.84 million to Mayo County Council for the provision of a cable car and associated services between Inishbiggle and the mainland at Bullsmouth. This grant was based on a total estimated construction cost of €2.03 million with Mayo County Council to provide the balance of €190,000 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_2871">It was hoped that construction of the cable car would have commenced in 2002 and that the service would be fully operational by the spring of this year. However, a delay was incurred as a result of an objection lodged with An Bord Pleanála against one of the compulsory purchase orders in respect of the land required for the project. While An Bord Pleanála subsequently confirmed the said compulsory purchase orders, this decision is currently the subject of a High Court judicial review.</p>

          <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
          <p eId="para_2885">I propose to take Questions Nos. 143 and 145 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2886">I launched the CLÁR programme, Ceantair Laga Árd-Riachtanais, for disadvantaged rural areas on 5 October 2001. CLÁR funds, or co-funds, with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities investment in selected priority developments. These measures support physical, community and social infrastructure across a variety of measures such as electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village enhancement, health and sports projects. The measures introduced under the programme reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas which I consulted at the outset. These measures were agreed with the lead Departments or State agencies, as appropriate. The areas selected are those which have suffered the greatest depopulation since 1926, with the exception of the Cooley peninsula, which was included based on the serious difficulties caused for that area by foot and mouth disease.</p>
          <p eId="para_2887">Arising from the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, on 17 January last I announced the extension of the CLÁR areas to include an additional 189 DEDs, bringing the total to 890 in 18 counties. The total population in the extended CLÁR areas has increased from 284,000 to 362,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_2888">In 2002, €14.14 million was spent under the various measures. While this year's provision is €9.517 million, nevertheless I expect that I will be able to complete a comprehensive work programme. For example, I do not expect the exceptionally high level of expenditure on class three roads last year fully funded from this Department – nearly €7 million of the €14.14 million to which I referred – to arise this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_2889">CLÁR funds act as a lever to elicit funds from other sources. The 2003 CLÁR allocation will be sufficient to continue this leverage and so sustain an effective programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_2890">As it is not practical to list all the measures and the expenditure details, I am arranging to send them to Deputy Seán Ryan in the next few days.</p>

          <p eId="para_2894">The European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs, ESPAD, study examines the prevalence of drug use, both legal and illegal, among 16 year old schoolgoers. The study describes the substance use behaviours, as well as related beliefs and attitudes, among over 80,000 15-16 year olds in 30 European countries. The methodology involves the use of an identical questionnaire in each of the participating countries, which is then collected, using the same methods to allow for the collation of a comprehensive and comparable dataset. The most recent ESPAD study was conducted in 1999 and the report published in 2001. On this basis, the ESPAD study conducted in 2003 will not be available until 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_2895">I should make the Deputy aware that the national advisory committee on drugs, has commissioned a general population survey on drug use and the results are due out later this year. In addition, the NACD recently released an estimate of the number of opiate users in Ireland which, when compared to the previous estimate, showed a drop in prevalence in Dublin.</p>

          <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
          <p eId="para_2899">My Department is continuing, in partnership with Údarás na Gaeltachta, to actively examine the recommendations contained in the report of the working group on the creation of employment in the Gaeltacht to determine how they can be most effectively implemented. For example, the various recommendations in the report relating to enterprise development and employment creation were dis cussed at a recent meeting between officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and its agencies, Údarás na Gaeltachta and my Department. In addition, discussions have taken place with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism regarding the potential that tourism, particularly cultural tourism, can offer in helping to create and sustain employment in the Gaeltacht. The further promotion of these issues will continue to receive priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_2900">I reiterate that the Irish language is the Gaeltacht's most important natural resource and, indeed, the future development of the Gaeltacht will depend in no small way on the preservation of Irish as a spoken language there. Accordingly, for 2003 I have agreed with Údarás na Gaeltachta that 20% of its capital budget should be allocated for the development of ventures and enterprises that have a clearly defined Irish language focus. This policy complements the report's recommendations in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_2901">Also arising from this report, Údarás na Gaeltachta has formulated an action plan to tackle the significant unemployment problem in the north-west Donegal Gaeltacht. In addition to the appointment of a senior official to the Údarás office in Gweedore, a committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. Peter Quinn, has been formed to assist in the implementation of this action plan. This committee held its first meeting on 29 April 2003 in Gweedore.</p>

          <p eId="para_2905">Following my appointment as Minister with responsibility for the islands last year, I held a meeting with Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann – the Irish Islands Federation – at which this issue was discussed. It was agreed at that meeting that An Chomhdháil would examine this issue in greater detail in order to fully establish its requirements in this regard. On receipt of An Chomhdháil's response, it is my intention to pursue this issue with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_2907">All grants available from my Department for the islands, both Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht, are listed on pages 60 to 84 of my Department's section 16 reference book under the Freedom of Information Act 1997, a copy of which will be forwarded to the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_2908">In relation to the introduction of additional grant schemes for islanders to ensure that non-Gaeltacht islanders have access to the same schemes as Gaeltacht islanders, the Deputy should be aware that many of the schemes available to Gaeltacht islanders, such as the scheme of grants under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts, scéim labhairt na Gaeilge, the Irish speaking scheme, and scéim na bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge, the Irish language learners scheme, have, as their objective, the preservation and promotion of the Irish language. Consequently, it is a condition of these schemes that Irish must be the principal language of the applicant household.</p>
          <p eId="para_2909">The Deputy will be aware that housing grants for non-Gaeltacht islands are dealt with by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and that the new house grant in non-Gaeltacht areas, both on the mainland and on the islands, is no longer available. I have also recently been informed by that Department that it currently has no plans to extend the house improvement grant scheme, currently administered by my Department on Gaeltacht islands, to non-Gaeltacht islands. Údarás na Gaeltachta recently introduced a new scheme for the development of enterprise on Gaeltacht islands and preparation for the introduction of a similar scheme for the non-Gaeltacht islands are well advanced.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_2931">I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 160 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2932">No successful prosecutions have been taken by the Stock Exchange for insider dealing. One case was brought before the courts in 2002 arising from reports made to the Director of Public Prosecutions by the Stock Exchange. The case involved the then managing director of Dunloe Ewart plc, who was found not guilty. This was the State's first criminal trial for insider dealing.</p>
          <p eId="para_2933">The primary responsibility for overseeing the provisions of Part V of the Companies Act 1990, which deals with insider dealing, rests with the Stock Exchange. The Stock Exchange is prescribed by the Minister as a "recognised stock exchange" for the relevant provisions of Part V of the 1990 Act. Section 115(1) of the Act places a statutory duty on the Stock Exchange to furnish the Director of Public Prosecutions with a report where it appears to it that an offence has been committed under the legislation. As amended by the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, such reports must now also be furnished to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_2934">The Stock Exchange is obliged under section 120 of the Companies Act 1990 to furnish to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment an annual report on the exercise of its functions under Part V of the Companies Act 1990. In the five years to end 2002, the Stock Exchange referred five reports of suspected insider dealing to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Under section 114 of the Companies Act 1990, a person who commits an offence under Part V – insider dealing – of the Act shall be liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to a fine not exceeding €1,269, or to both, or on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to a fine not exceeding €253,947, or to both.</p>

          <p eId="para_2936">Sixteen investigations into company law matters have been initiated by me since I first came into office as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_152">In respect of three of these, the High Court  appointed, on an application by me, inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990. The inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on 10 June 2002. The report was subsequently published. The report has been passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_153">Section 8 inquiries into the affairs of National Irish Bank Ltd and National Irish Bank Financial Services Ltd are continuing. I understand the final report is likely to be submitted to the High Court towards the end of 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_154">One investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act 1990 was completed in 1998. The report on this has been passed to the DPP.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_155">Eleven investigations were initiated by me under section 19 of the Companies Act 1990. Six of these have been concluded. Of the six investigations completed, two of the reports were passed to the DPP. A number of summary prosecutions have since been successfully concluded in one case. One report provided an input into the successful application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors under section 8 while the fourth report was passed to the relevant High Court inspectors. One report was completed in September 2002 and has been referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. A further report was recently completed and has been referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_156">Three investigations under section 19 are ongoing. The report in respect of one of these investigations is at a very advanced stage.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_157">Two investigations were held up in legal appeals, on which a judgment was delivered on 5 June 2002. These inquiries are now the responsibility of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_158">One investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act 1989. The report on this has been referred to the DPP as well as to the inspectors undertaking the section 8 investigation into that company.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_159">The costs incurred since 1997 on company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department currently amount to €9.76 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of civil service staff working on a number of these investigations or the legal costs, which are primarily being borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor. Most of this €9.76 million derives from the costs to date of the High Court inspectors appointed under section 8 – National Irish Bank €4.96 million and Ansbacher €3.5 million.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_160">The question of recovering costs from the section 8 investigations does not arise until such time as the inspectors complete their investigations. The issue of recovering costs in relation to the Ansbacher inquiry is now before the courts. Section 19 as originally enacted did not provide for the recoupment of costs. This has now changed with the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001.</summary>

The PPF provides for an overall appraisal of active labour market programmes to be carried out and this work is being undertaken under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, which is chaired by my Department. Indecon International Economic Consultants was commissioned by my Department, on behalf of the standing committee, to facilitate a rigorous assessment of the overall effectiveness of existing programmes and to help inform the deliberations of the standing committee.

Similarly, any further reports filed by the receiver with the CRO would also be available for public inspection. The High Court appointed a liquidator to the company to act on its behalf in January 2002. The liquidator is an officer of the court and will report back to the court. I have no further information on this and I have no function in the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_2945">Section 221 of the Companies Act 1963, provides that when a final order is made to wind up a company, a copy of the order must be forwarded by the company to the Registrar of Companies for registration. Under the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, liquidators have certain duties to report to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. For example, where a company is insolvent, liquidators are obliged to provide a report to the director on the conduct of the company's directors. They are further obliged to make application to the High Court for the restriction of each of the company's directors unless specifically relieved of that obligation by the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Liquidators are also obliged to report suspected criminal offences to the director, but, in the case of court appointed liquidations, it is for the court to the direct the liquidator to refer a matter to the director.</p>
          <p eId="para_2946">Section 56 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, provides that the Director may, on his own initiative or at the request of a member, contributory or creditor of the company, request a liquidator of a company in liquidation to produce their books for examination. The director is independent in the performance of his statutory duties and I have no function in the matter.</p>

In recent months, Google, a world-renowned high tech company decided to locate in the area and this decision positions Ireland as a prime location for global Internet services. Enterprise Ireland offers a range of supports to companies in south Dublin to enable them to retain existing jobs or create new ones and in this regard the agency is working closely with 316 grant assisted projects in south County Dublin.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_164">As part of the community enterprise centre programme, which encourages local enterprise, the agency provided grant assistance to the four community enterprise centres in Tallaght, that is, Main Road, Bolbrook, Brookfield and Killinarden. The agency also works closely with the South Dublin Chambers of Commerce, which have purchased the EI enterprise centre in Whitestown and have approved funding of €2.54 million towards a new campus innovation centre at the institute of technology in Tallaght. In addition, some of the largest higher value added companies in the country are located in the environs of Tallaght. During 2002, Enterprise Ireland provided financial support to 61 projects in south County Dublin at a cost of €2.67 million.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_165">At the micro-enterprise level, the South Dublin County Enterprise Board has, since its inception, supported projects in the Tallaght area with grants amounting to €2.5 million. It has assisted in the creation of 560 jobs in the area and provided a comprehensive range of supports and training. The board will continue to assist other groups, including the Tallaght community group, PARTAS, in its enterprise training programmes for the unemployed.</summary>

The 80% advance payment in respect of two hundred and forty one eligible animals on the first six applications has issued. This herd was subsequently randomly selected for a field inspection which has now been finalised. As a result, the 80% advance payment in respect of 119 animals on the last two applications is expected to issue within the next ten days. Four animals have been previously paid the first age premium.</p>
          <p eId="para_3132">It has not been possible to date to finalise the quota overshoot on the special beef premium for 2002 as my Department is awaiting clarification from the European Commission on the application of the relevant EU Regulations. A decision will be made on the processing of balancing payments in respect of special beef premium as soon as this clarification is received. The person named has been paid in full in respect of 330 animals under the slaughter premium scheme 2002. Some 49 of these animals were heifers under 30 months of age at slaughter and therefore are eligible for the national envelope top-up. Some 80% advance payments have issued in respect of the national envelope slaughter top-up and the 20% balancing payment will issue during June.</p>

          <p eId="para_3136">The recent FAPRI study has confirmed the findings of the previous FAPRI study, both of which I requested, that full decoupling would be likely to lead to a reduction in beef and sheepmeat production. However, due to a change in one of the underlying assumptions, the reduction is less than that forecast in the previous FAPRI study. I have stated my opposition to full decoupling in the Council of Agriculture Ministers because of the likely resultant reduction in production. That position remains unchanged.</p>

          <p eId="para_3314">The person named applied for premium for 19 cows and three heifers under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme. An 80% advance  payment amounting to €3909.17 issued on 16 October 2002. This was in respect of 21.8 animals, which is the number of quota rights on record for the person named.</p>
          <p eId="para_3315">Under the terms and conditions of the scheme, a producer applying on 14 animals or more must continue to own, possess, hold and maintain on his holding during the retention period a number of heifers at least equal to 15% and at most equal to 40% of the total number of animals for which premium has been requested or have acceptable replacements for those animals. In processing the application for balancing payment it was found that one of the heifers calved during the retention period causing the heifer percentage to fall below the required 15% level. However, due to industrial action by the clerical staff in the Galway office who are members of the CPSU, the application cannot be processed further at this time.</p>

      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Agriculture and Food</b>
      if the early farm retirement scheme will be reviewed by the EU Commission, in view of the very low take-up of the scheme at the moment and its lack of attractiveness for farmers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_3317">To date, 1,900 applications have been received under the current early retirement scheme since it was launched at the end of 2000. Take-up under the scheme, while less than initially projected, remains steady and there is evidence of continued interest in the scheme. The Teagasc national farm survey, taken in autumn 2002, indicated that a further 4,400 farmers in the 55 to 66 age group would consider joining the scheme. Given that the survey did not include those who will reach the eligible age group before the current programming period ends in 2006, and taking into account the rate of applications so far, continued growth in participation levels can be expected.</p>
          <p eId="para_3318">The scheme of early retirement from farming is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, and the main provisions of the scheme are included in the CAP Rural Development Plan 2000-2006. An independent evaluation of the schemes that form part of the rural development plan is currently under way as part of the mid-term review process, and will be submitted to the European Commission in due course.</p>

Payment of his 80% advance instalment for €3048.44 issued to him on 16 October 2002. The 20% balance instalment for €762.11 was recovered against an overpayment that had occurred under the 2002 area based compensatory allowance scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_3341">The person named was paid €5121.10 on 23 September 2002 under the 2002 area-based compensatory allowance scheme.

To date, €762.11 of the overpayment has been recovered from the 20% balance of the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme and €48.00 from the 20% balance of the 2002 slaughter premium scheme, leaving €184.39 to be recovered from future grants due to the person named.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3400">The person in question failed to qualify for an allocation of quota under the 32 million litre scheme as his milk deliveries in one of the reference years was not greater than the actual quota allocated in 1984 or increased by any subsequent allocation from the national reserve. Due to an error within my Department, a letter issued to the person in November 2002 erroneously noti fying him that he qualified. When this error was discovered, the applicant was informed by letter on 2 December of his failure to satisfy the condition. This correcting letter, however, based on inaccurate information from his co-operative, stated that the failure was due to quota having been temporary leased during the period 1998-99 to 2000-01 rather than the actual reason referred to above. While errors in communicating the outcome of this application are regretted, the fact is that the applicant failed to qualify on the basis of one of the primary criteria. A definitive listing of allocations issued to the co-operative concerned in March 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_3401">The allocation of milk quota from the national reserve is granted on the basis of recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. The tribunal is a body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system. The person named may apply to the tribunal when the application forms become available in the autumn from his milk purchaser or from the milk policy division of my Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_3403">My Department has made a very strong case to the European Commission outlining specific proposals to deal with the overshoot on the special beef premium in respect of 2002. The main justification put forward for special treatment of Ireland's overshoot was the fact that the early publication of a confidential draft legal text of the Commission proposals for the mid-term review gave rise to a surge of applications submitted to my Department in late December 2002 which contributed to the scale of the overshoot. The Commission, in its reply, acknowledges the exceptional circumstances leading to the overshoot in 2002 and specifically the impact that the leaking of these proposals had on the scale of the overshoot. It goes on to state that it is not ready to propose a derogation from the Council regulation while this issue is part of the current discussion on the reform proposals in the Council.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_200">I am satisfied that the Commission implicitly acknowledges that this matter may be further considered in the context of the mid-term review negotiations and I will now take this matter up directly with Commissioner Fischler. In the meantime, I can confirm that advance payments, at the rate of 80% of premium, have issued in respect of eligible animals and that balancing payments at the rate of 20% of premium have issued to applicants who have applied on a total number  of fifty animals or less in 2002. However, it has not been possible to finalise the quota overshoot calculation for 2002 as my Department is awaiting separate clarification from the European Commission on the application of a number of technical issues in the relevant EU regulations. A decision will be made on the processing of the remaining special beef premium balancing payments as soon as this clarification is received.</summary>

The potential effects of this proposal on the public postal sector and public postal services is being examined in my Department and in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. If the draft directive, as proposed by the European Commission, was agreed, one of the potential effects would be the imposition of a positive rate of VAT on public postal services. This would impact on all who cannot recover VAT, including the general public, financial institutions and charities and voluntary organisations. I have received correspondence from the voluntary and charitable sector in this regard and I understand its concerns.

          <p eId="para_3432">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that  they publish the amount of tax debt each year in their annual report. Publication of the report in respect of 2002, with figures for tax debt as at 31 May 2003, is expected in June. At present, Revenue does not have finalised figures to make available. The level of tax debt fluctuates significantly throughout each year as tax charges are raised and collected. For that reason, and to ensure comparability between published figures, it has been agreed between Revenue and the Comptroller and Auditor General that debt is measured at 31 May each year.</p>
          <p eId="para_3433">At 31 May 2002, the total debt was €1.507 billion. Of this total, 48% was less than two years old and was still under active collection or appeal, while 70% was less than four years old. These figures reflect Revenue's efforts in recent years to reduce the age of debt. In that regard, Revenue's recent statement of strategy states their intention of ensuring that no debt will be allowed to become more than six years old. In 2003, while figures are not yet available, it is expected that the level of the debt will reduce further.</p>

          <p eId="para_3435">The details requested by the Deputy are outlined as follows. In addition to capital projects being initiated by my Department in 2003, funding for capital projects in other Departments is also provided through central funds, as in the case of the Information Society, €3.393 million and e-Procurement €500,000. In relation to the years 2004-2007, details of all future capital projects are not available. The Deputy may also wish to note that capital expenditure is also incurred on consultancy type and human capital expenditure, for example, legal, financial, educational, cultural etc, which are not project based.</p>

          <p eId="para_3665">EUROSTAT, the statistical office of the European Union, has final responsibility for scrutinising the general government balance, GGB, figures reported by member states and for interpreting the accounting rules. National statistical institutes, including the CSO in Ireland, are responsible for ensuring that these rules are applied in calculating the GGB. The accounting rules are outlined in the publication European System of Accounts – ESA95. Formally, this is Annex A of EU Council Regulation 2223/96. They are further refined in the manual ESA95 on Government Deficit and Debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_3666">The accounting rules are straightforward for some types of public private partnership contracts. For example, if the private sector provides an asset and, under agreement with Government, recoups its costs by charging third parties for using the asset, these transactions have no impact on the GGB. The West Link toll bridge is an example of this type of public private partnership project. In other PPP contracts a private sector partner builds, finances and operates an asset and the Government makes ongoing payments for the use of the asset. When the fulfilment of the contract involves very little risk for the private sector partner because its costs are almost certain to be recouped, the public private partnership project is considered to represent the purchase of an asset by the Government with a full impact on the GGB. An example of such an arrangement in Ireland was the PPP contract involving the provision of the bundle of five schools at Ballincollig, Clones, Dunmanway, Shannon and Tubbercurry. EUROSTAT determined that in this project the Government retained most of the risks and the transaction was treated as an asset purchase by Government with the full construction costs impacting on the GGB as the schools were built.</p>
          <p eId="para_3667">The determination and measurement of ownership risks is difficult and the existing accounting rules do not always deal adequately with the many types of public private partnership projects being developed. EUROSTAT is currently examining ways in which the existing accounting guidelines for PPP projects can be made more precise and comprehensive. For this purpose, it has established a task force of national accounting experts from a number of member states. The CSO has a representative on this task force. The task force will complete its work later this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_3676">I am informed by my officials that Dublin City Council, which is the contracting authority for the greater Dublin drainage study,  which includes a full study on the River Tolka catchment, expects to receive a draft technical report on the River Tolka catchment from the consultants, M.C. O'Sullivan and Company later this month. This will require detailed technical examination by the contracting authority and the Office of Public Works. While the draft technical report is being considered the consultants will carry out an evaluation of the issues raised in third party submissions and will also complete a cost-benefit analysis on the recommended scheme. The contracting authority expects a draft final report before the end of July.</p>
          <p eId="para_3677">When the full report is completed, it should provide additional information on the entire catchment of the Tolka and this along with the items in the interim report, which have not yet been implemented, will provide the basis on which decisions will be made on further flood alleviation measures. Decisions on the provision of funding for a flood relief scheme on the catchment can only be made when the final report has been fully examined. The group undertaking the review of national flooding policy, which I set up late last year and which is now well under way, has met with the Irish Insurance Federation to discuss all the relevant issues in this area in detail. Regular communication will be developed between the IIF and the body charged with future responsibility for flood management in the country, an issue which is also under consideration as part of the review.</p>
          <p eId="para_3678">As I have outlined to the Deputy before, the Office of Public Works has been giving every assistance in these areas since the severe flooding from the River Tolka last November. In the immediate aftermath of the flooding the Office of Public Works mobilised its resources to carry out emergency works as three houses off Tolka Road were in danger of subsiding into the river. The work involved constructing a new wall along the Tolka to the rear of these houses. The Office of Public Works has also, since January, been carrying out further flood alleviation measures, which were contained in the interim report prepared by the consultants carrying out the flood study on the River Tolka for Dublin City Council. Further works including the construction of walls and embankments, the replacement of Woodville Road Footbridge and the maintenance cleaning of the channel have all been ongoing in this period. Indeed, the Office of Public Works will continue these interim works until the autumn when they are due to be completed.</p>

          <p eId="para_3680">I met with the Irish Insurance Federation (IIF) on 6 December 2002 to listen to its views, concerns and proposals in relation to the  problem of flooding in Ireland. It was a very constructive meeting. The IIF welcomed my earlier decision to set up a group to undertake a review of national flooding policy and to develop a cohesive national flooding policy. This review, which I chair, is now well under way and is currently involved in a comprehensive public consultation process which not only involves close examination of the 70 written submissions received, but also a series of meetings with key bodies to discuss issues in more detail. The IIF, given their important role in this area, were invited to meet representatives of the review group and this meeting took place on 23 May 2002. I am advised the meeting was very productive and centred on the key issue of how all stakeholders might alleviate future flood damage and its subsequent impacts. In particular it was unanimously agreed the speedy development of flood hazard maps to provide valuable information to assist in numerous decision-making processes including planning and development and flood works prioritisation, would be a very progressive advancement.</p>
          <p eId="para_3681">In this regard I can confirm preparatory work is already under way within my office for the development of these maps and it is envisaged they should be available in 2005. It is was further agreed at the meeting that clear and regular communication channels between the IIF and the body responsible for flood management in the future – the issue of responsibility for flood management is currently under consideration as part of the review – be developed as a matter of priority. As to the review, it remains on target to present its report to Government by late autumn 2003 as previously stated.</p>

The person in question has been visited by a diplomatic officer from the embassy in London and the embassy is also in regular contact with his solicitor. I understand that the person concerned,  through his solicitor, is pursuing an appeal against his conviction. As the Deputy will appreciate, in these circumstances it would not be appropriate to comment on the judicial process. I have met with members of the family of the person concerned and supporters of the campaign for his release and I have assured them that my Department will continue to provide every possible consular assistance to the person concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_3687">The Department of Foreign Affairs has limited capital budgets under Vote 38 – Foreign Affairs – and Vote 39 – International Co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_3688">In the case of Vote 38, the capital budget is used, in the main, for the purchase and maintenance of Irish offices or residences abroad and for the development of the Department's information and communication technology, ICT, infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_3689">The purchase of property abroad is reviewed by the Department on an ongoing basis with decisions to purchase being based on a thorough assessment of the costs and benefits involved, on local conditions and on the availability of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_3690">A capital sum of €3.1 million is being sought for 2004 and €5 million for subsequent years in order to purchase and maintain suitable property, in other countries, on behalf of the State. No such projects have been initiated in 2003. No new ICT capital projects will be initiated during 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_3691">A smaller amount, €1.5 million in 2003, is allocated under Vote 39 for the maintenance, purchase or development of Embassy premises in countries where there is a significant Ireland Aid programme. Some €1 million will be spent in 2004 on the completion of a new premises in Mozambique, the construction of which was initiated in 2002.</p>

          <p eId="para_3695">The Patten commission laid considerable stress on police training, education and development, identifying change in these areas as being essential for the delivery of effective policing. It also specifically recommended that the Northern Ireland police should have a new purpose-built police college and the funding for it should be found in the next public spending round – recommendation No. 131. The oversight commissioner, Tom Constantine, and the PSNI Chief Constable, Hugh Orde, have both commented that the current arrangements for training police officers are flawed and have identified the provision of a new purpose-built police college at the earliest possible opportunity as a key policing objective. This matter is now being taken forward by the Policing Board and Chief Constable.</p>
          <p eId="para_3696">At its meeting of 6 February 2003, the board approved the PSNI business case for the new college and signalled its intention to request approval from the Northern Ireland Office to proceed with the project. It is intended to award the building contract in 2005, with a completion date in 2007. As Patten indicated, funding for the college will be provided by the British Exchequer. At the meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in London on 20 May last, I inquired about progress on the new police college and was informed that the search for a suitable site is ongoing. There has been some speculation in the media regarding the possibility that the Government may make a financial contribution towards the cost of a new police college for Northern Ireland located in Derry. However, as I have outlined above, funding for the college will fall to be provided by the British Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_3698">We believe that the European Convention on Human Rights is the cornerstone of international human rights protection in Europe. Article 2, which enshrines each individual's right to life, is a fundamental and essential element of the convention. Each state party to the convention commits itself to upholding Article 2 and there is no derogation permitted from this article, except in respect of deaths resulting from lawful acts of war. Ensuring compliance with the article, and with all the provisions of the European Conven tion on Human Rights, falls to two bodies. The first is the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg which issues legally binding judgments on cases taken under the convention. The second is the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers which is charged with supervising the execution of the judgments issued by the court. In practice, this supervisory function is fulfilled by the committee of ministers' deputies at which each state party is represented by their permanent representative.</p>
          <p eId="para_3699">Ireland fully supports the work of both these bodies and is very active in the work of the Committee of Ministers' Deputies through its resident ambassador at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. At national level, the Deputy will be aware that the provisions outlined in Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights are provided for in Article 40.3.2 of the Constitution which states: "The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life. . .  of every citizen."</p>

The British Embassy checked with the Immigration Department in Kathmandu and a number of the border posts into India and Tibet.

          <p eId="para_3815">Evidence generated from the pilot phases of the school completion programme shows that the most effective way of addressing educational disadvantage is through an integrated services approach based on the development of local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. This prompted my Department to significantly expand the programme based on the project model rather than funding individual schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_3816">In 2002, a significant expansion of this programme took place with the introduction of 65 new projects in addition to the 17 existing projects. My Department also continued to support 53 second level schools under the 'stay in school retention' phase of the school completion programme as they were not selected for the project phase. At that time, it was decided to support these 53 Schools, which include Coláiste Mhuire, Johnstown, Co. Kilkenny on a phasing-out basis to 31 August 2005. This involves providing 50% funding for the school year 2003-04 and 25% funding for 2004-05.</p>
          <p eId="para_3817">I am aware that some schools have been successful in reducing the number of students dropping out of school, but some schools have not. Therefore, my Department is currently reviewing the position in relation to the SSRI strand. Any decision to include SSRI strand schools in the school completion programme will be based on a selection process, which will take into account the latest available analysis of pupil retention rates at second-level. The 53 SSRI schools will be notified of the outcome of this review shortly.</p>

          <p eId="para_3824">The Higher Education Authority has commissioned Professor Patrick Clancy to undertake national surveys of entrants to higher education. Surveys have been undertaken on the cohort entering full-time higher education in 1980, 1986, 1992 and 1998. The most recent report, entitled College Entry in Focus: A Fourth National Survey of Access to Higher Education, is based on a national survey of all first enrolments of undergraduates in their first year of study as full-time higher education students in 43 colleges in autumn 1998. The study is based primarily on an analysis of personal demographic and educational data, which were abstracted from individual student record forms. Being the fourth in a series of national surveys carried out at six-year intervals, this study facilitates an analysis of changes in the pattern of participation over a period of 18 years.</p>

          <p eId="para_3943">The position is that Tralee Educate Together national school, Collis-Sandes, was granted provisional recognition in September 2002. The school authorities were advised at the time that the question of permanent recognition would be considered when the Department was  satisfied that long-term viability had been demonstrated and that the school was operating in accordance with the rules for national schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_3944">I should explain that under the enrolment criteria for the recognition of new schools there is a requirement for a guaranteed initial enrolment of 17 junior infants and a minimum projected enrolment of 51 pupils for third year of operation. On the basis that the junior infant enrolment figure in Tralee Educate Together NS last September was only 14, the school does not satisfy the criteria for recognition of new schools. My Department is however disposed to the continued recognition of the school once the required enrolment criteria are met. In this context, and in accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Education Act 1998, the school authorities were invited to submit to the planning section of my Department, any representations made by the board, the patron, the teachers or the parents in support of the school. A response has been received from the school principal which will be considered together with any other representations received in my Department in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_3945">A decision on the continued recognition of Tralee Educate Together NS beyond June 2004, will be made and notified to the school authorities by the end of June 2003.</p>

      if his attention has been drawn to the offer made by the Argentine navy to provide artefacts to the State for presentation at a memorial park dedicated to Admiral Brown, founder of the Argentine navy; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that two containers of artefacts donated by the Argentine navy are lodged in the Dublin docks since 1998; his views on whether this position is satisfactory; if he will make direct contact with the port authorities and the organisers of the approved Admiral Brown Memorial Park, Foxford, County Mayo, in order to have these artefacts provided to the committee involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter in order that this current problem can be resolved and the matter brought to a satisfactory conclusion.

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_4016">I propose to take Questions Nos. 283, 323, 324, 328 and 330 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_4017">Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a severe form of pneumonia or infection of the lungs which appeared recently in south-east Asia. As of 24 May 2003, a cumulative total of 8,141 probable SARS cases with 696 deaths have been reported internationally to the World Health Organisation. To date there has only been one probable case of SARS in Ireland; the individual concerned has made a full recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_4018">I established an expert group in mid-March to monitor the situation as it developed and to advise me of the measures required to deal with this syndrome. This group continues to meet on a regular basis. The group consists of experts from public health and related fields as well as two consultants in infectious diseases and two consultant microbiologists.</p>
          <p eId="para_4019">One of the issues considered in depth by the expert group was the Special Olympics. Having considered all of the available options, the expert group recommended that certain delegations be asked not to attend the games. The countries would be those which, at the operative time, are on the WHO list of areas with recent local transmission. This decision was not taken lightly. I considered the expert group's decision at length. I then discussed the matter with the Taoiseach. Both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste agreed that the best course of action was to accept the expert group's recommendation. It is unfortunate that this decision had to be made and I acknowledge and regret the disappointment that this has caused. Clearly, having asked an expert group of professionals to assess and make a recommendation, it would be wrong to ignore their advice and medical knowledge. It should be borne in mind that the WHO status of some countries may change as we get nearer to the date of the games.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_224">Persons travelling to Ireland from areas with recent local transmission of SARS are advised to monitor their health for ten days following their departure from an affected area. If they develop any of the symptoms of SARS they should seek medical advice urgently and advise the relevant medical practitioner that they have recently been in an affected area. Advice to this effect has been prominently displayed in the national newspapers on a number of occasions since the end of March 2003. Radio advertisements are being run regularly taking into account the most recent information from the expert group in relation to SARS. Specific travel advice and guidelines have been developed by the expert group for members  of the public as well as for teachers, students and health care workers. These guidelines are available on my Department's website at www.doh.ie.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_225">In addition, my Department strongly advises individuals not to travel to the following SARS affected regions: China and Taiwan. Passengers intending to transit through airports in the affected areas should consider using an alternative route where possible. This advice is being reviewed regularly and may change. Since the incubation period of SARS can be up to ten days, general registration or health controls, that is, screening at ports of arrival in Ireland, are of little value. On the contrary, they may give the public a false sense of security. This is in line with expert advice received from the World Health Organisation and the European Union's communicable disease network committee. Instead, the WHO recommends that persons departing from an affected area should be screened prior to departure.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_226">Protocols and guidance for hospitals and health professionals which describe the syndrome and provide advice on how suspect cases should be managed have been developed. The relevant guidelines and protocols have been circulated to medical practitioners. This material is reviewed and updated by the expert group and the most up-to-date information is also available on my Department's website at www.doh.ie. A large amount of other relevant information in relation to SARS has also been placed on that website including a frequently asked questions document which should help to inform the public and to address public concerns. This information is updated on an ongoing basis.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_227">Recommendations have been made by the expert group as to the nature of the public information which should be made available in relation to SARS. Arrangements have been put in place to give effect to these recommendations and, early in the process, information was made available by way of notices in airports to alert travellers to the issue. This effort was expanded recently and, with effect from Monday, 28 April 2003, arrangements were made to hand out information leaflets on all incoming flights to Ireland and at other points of entry, such as ports and Enterprise trainline. Public announcements are also being made on incoming flights and ferries as well as radio announcements. SARS information desks have been set up at arrival terminals in all airports and ferry ports. A national SARS freephone information line, 1800 45 45 00, has been set up with effect from 28 April 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_228">The World Health Organisation has laid down guidelines in relation to the isolation and accommodation facilities required for the management of probable SARS patients in an in-patient setting. These are, in descending order of preference, negative pressure rooms, single rooms with their own bathroom facilities and cohort placement of patients in a dedicated area. My Department has been advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards that there is considerable response capacity in place which satisfies the WHO guidelines.</summary>

      <b>Mr. F. McGrath</b>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_4021">There has been a significant reduction in the number of adults waiting longest for in-patient treatment. The total number of adults waiting more than 12 months for in-patient treatment in the nine target surgical specialties has fallen by 30% from 7,402 to 5,209 in the period June to December 2002. Some individual specialties have shown greater reductions. The specialty of cardiac surgery, for example, showed a reduction of 47% in the numbers waiting more than 12 months in the period June 2002 to December 2002 while the specialty of gynaecology showed a decrease of 45% in the same period. The total number of children waiting for more than six months for in-patient treatment has fallen by over 31%, from 1,576 to 1,081, between June and December 2002. The most significant reductions have been seen in the specialties of general surgery and plastic surgery where the number of children waiting more than six months for treatment has fallen by 52% and 44% respectively in the period.</p>
          <p eId="para_4022">A sum of €43.8 million is available to health agencies in 2003 under the waiting list initiative. In addition, a further €31 million is available under the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, to target those waiting longest for treatment. To date, approximately 4,200 long waiters have received treatment under the NTPF. The work of the NTPF has raised issues in relation to the accuracy of numbers reported to be waiting longer than 12 months for treatment. As a result, in consultation with the NTPF, ERHA and the health boards, I intend to bring forward proposals for a new system of management and organisation of waiting lists nationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_4023">In relation to bed closures, it is a feature of all acute hospital systems that some beds are out of use for short periods due, for example, to ward refurbishment, essential ward maintenance, staff availability and infection control measures. Under the Health (Amendment)(No. 3) Act 1996, health boards are required to deliver a level of services consistent with their approved budgets. Given the level of funding available this year, the structuring of overall service plans by health agencies for 2003 may involve some containment of service activity in order to manage within budget.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_4053">Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a severe form of pneumonia or infection of the lungs, which appeared recently in south-east Asia. As of 24 May 2003, a cumulative total of 8,141 probable SARS cases with 696 deaths have been reported internationally to the WHO.</p>
          <p eId="para_4054">I established an expert group in mid-March to monitor the situation as it developed and to advise me of the measures required to deal with this syndrome. This group continues to meet on a regular basis. The group consists of experts from public health and related fields as well as two consultants in infectious diseases and two consultant microbiologists. One of the issues considered in depth by the expert group was the implications of SARS for the Special Olympics. The group considered the matter over a number of meetings and also met with Dr. Richard Pebody of the World Health Organisation, who provided technical advice. Measures considered by the group were grounded in a number of priority objectives to: preserve the low level of incidence of SARS cases in Ireland – to date there has been only one probable case of SARS in this country and that person has now fully recovered; maintain the highest level of public health in Ireland; minimise disruption of normal health services; minimise the risk of introduction of SARS into Ireland; protect athletes and delegates from SARS infected areas – we have a responsibility as the host country to assess and minimise the risk and to provide the best protection, advice and facilities; protect athletes and delegates from other participating countries – we have a duty of care to all attending the games; maintain the integrity of the Special Olympics to ensure the participation of the highest number possible and to create the most conducive atmosphere for the competitors to excel without having undue or unnecessary concerns about their health.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_229">The expert group also considered the nature of the event and its distinctive, unique characteristics in the context of risk assessment and risk minimisation for the importation of SARS. Many of the people with disability participating in the games are at increased risk of infection, particularly respiratory infections, and bringing together people in large numbers would further increase the likelihood of transmission of infectious diseases. The expert group's final recommendation was also based on a number of key questions: would existing measures here be sufficient, how effective would quarantining at port of exit be, how effective would quarantining and screening be in Ireland and, considering all these, what is the best solution?</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_230">Having considered all available options in depth, the expert group regretfully requested that certain delegations be asked not to attend the games. The countries would be those which, at the operative time, are on the WHO list of areas with recent local transmission. The operative date would be ten days prior to the normal arrival of such countries before the official start of the games. This decision was not taken lightly. At present the countries on the WHO list of areas with recent local transmission are China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_231">I considered the expert group's decision at length. This matter was then discussed with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste who agreed that the best course of action was to accept the expert group's recommendation. It is unfortunate that this decision had to be made and I acknowledge and regret the disappointment that this has caused. A lot of hard work, time and effort have been put into preparing for and organising the games by the athletes as well as the Special Olympics committee, the host towns and local communities. It should be borne in mind that the WHO status of some countries may change as we get nearer to the date of the games.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_232">The Special Olympics committee has asked to make a presentation to the expert group on this issue and agreement to this request has been granted. The Department of Health and Children will continue to be in constant communication with the WHO and the Special Olympics committee.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_4056">I am aware of the concerns regarding the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those will autism. Additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support ser vices to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the significant revenue investment, amounting to €188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</p>
          <p eId="para_4057">The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism. The overall investment by this and the previous Government in services to persons with disabilities, which amounts to €555 million, is evidence of the priority which has been given to these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_4058">Despite this significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</p>
          <p eId="para_4059">The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_4063">A number of Deputies have sought assurances that the Government will not introduce legislation that permits the deliberate destruction of human embryos. There are no plans to introduce any such legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_4064">In relation to assisted human reproduction services generally, while there is no legislation regulating this area at present, medical practice is governed by guidelines issued by the Medical Council. These state that the creation of new forms of life for experimental purposes or the deliberate and intentional destruction of human life already formed is professional misconduct. I am conscious of concerns about the absence of a statutory framework to regulate this area. With a view to addressing these concerns in a comprehensive and informed way, and following a Government decision on the matter, I established the commission on assisted human reproduction in March 2000 with the following terms of reference: "to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all areas of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area."</p>
          <p eId="para_4065">When completed, the commission's report will provide the basis for informing public debate prior to the finalisation of any policy proposals. Given the complexity of the issues under examination, it is difficult to be definitive about when the work of the commission will be completed. I am, however, satisfied that it is working as expeditiously as is feasible.</p>

Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_4098">While it is useful to examine spending as a percentage of GDP, the Deputy should be aware that setting such a target for health expenditure is not ideal. A target spend in a particular area could result in a decrease in expenditure should overall GDP decrease. Also, increases in GDP reflect growth on the basis of the economy expanding over a period of time. While the amount committed to the health service may increase significantly in real terms, the percentage committed may fall due to overall GDP growth. OECD figures, for example, indicate that public expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP in Ireland fell from 5.2% in 1999 to 5.1% in 2000, although investment by the Government actually increased by 17% in the same timeframe. However, experience from 1997 to 2002 has shown that increases in the level of health funding have in fact outstripped the rate of increase in  GDP by an annual average of 6.4%. Evidence from the World Health Organisation also indicates that greater expenditure on health does not necessarily translate into a better performing health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_4099">The health strategy, Quality and Fairness – a Health System for You, identified a number of measures to deliver a better health service, including many of the recommendations of the value for money audit of the health service carried out by Deloitte and Touche. Additionally, a review of health delivery structures, both internal and external, has been undertaken by Prospectus Consultancy. These reports will inform future decisions by the Government on the most efficient and effective methods for the funding and delivery of the health service.</p>

          <p eId="para_4104">Following the publication of the report of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services in March 2002, a major priority for my Department was to promote an integrated and co-ordinated approach by the health boards to its implementation over time. This applied in particular to the major recommendations of the report relating to the organisation and management of psychology services, entailing substantial increases in the number of principal and director level psychologist posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_4105">Given the key role of the health boards executive in fostering collective working and progressing organisational change and development in the health service, my Department secured the agreement of the executive to work with the directors of human resources in the health boards towards the implementation of the recommendations of the report. The present position is that the directors of human resources are in the process of individually considering the recommendations contained in the report and how their boards might propose to proceed with the implementation process in due course. This work is being undertaken in light of service imperatives, funding priorities and the budget 2003 announcement on public service numbers. In this context, it is important to bear in mind that the overall budgetary and economic position in 2003 has had important implications for all aspects of public spending and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by Government for 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_4106">Given these constraints my Department, together with the directors of human resources in the health boards, is prioritising support for the implementation of a key recommendation of the joint review report relating to human resource planning through the provision of a substantial number of additional post-graduate training places in clinical psychology. This has resulted in a threefold increase since end-1999, from 26 to 83, in the number of student clinical psychologists employed in the health services. This development, in enhancing graduate output, will help maintain an improved balance between demand and supply in human resource and service provision.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_234">My Department remains committed to working on an ongoing basis with health agencies, educational providers and the education authorities to ensure adequate provision of training places in clinical psychology, consistent with the medium-term human resource requirements of the health services and the important recommendations on investment in training and education detailed in the action plan for people management published in November 2002. A particular priority is to secure the best return, in terms of graduate output, on the significant financial resources currently being invested in the health services to support postgraduate clinical psychology training. Consequently, my Department, together with the health boards' directors of human resources, is examining the current model for post-graduate  psychology training with the objective of supporting training provision on a planned and sustainable medium-term basis.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_235">Responsibility for human resource planning, including the monitoring and filling of psychologist posts, in the mid-west region rests with the chief executive officer of the Mid-Western Health Board.

This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards, including two from the Western Health Board, for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus,  there is an aggregate of 20 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. The creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist is another structural measure being introduced in order to increase the number of orthodontic treatments.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_237">Orthodontic initiative funding of €4.698 million was provided to the health boards/authority in 2001 and this has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities. The additional funding of €0.628 million allocated to the Western Health Board in 2001 for orthodontic services included €0.533 million for an orthodontic initiative in the board. Last year, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. Under the scheme, the Western Health Board received €0.465 million for the treatment of patients in this way.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_238">The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that the staffing complement in the orthodontic department currently consists of one consultant orthodontist, three orthodontic specialists, one non-specialist dentist and one trainee orthodontic specialist who has a part-time commitment to the orthodontic department. Since 2001 progress has been made by the board in recruiting an orthodontic specialist and two additional specialists commenced duty with the board on completion of their specialist training last year. The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has further informed me that the number of cases awaiting orthodontic assessment and treatment, as at 31 March 2003, was 1,633. This is in comparison to a corresponding figure of 2,392 in 1996, 3,642 in 1997 and 4,003 in 1998.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4115">The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards, including two from the Western Health Board, for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus, there is an aggregate of 20 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. The creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist is another structural measure being introduced in order to increase the number of orthodontic treatments.</p>
          <p eId="para_4116">Orthodontic initiative funding of €4.698 million was provided to the health boards/authority in 2001 and this has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities. The additional funding of €0.628 million allocated to the Western Health Board in 2001 for orthodontic services includes €0.533 million for an orthodontic initiative in the board. Last year, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. Under the scheme, the Western Health Board received €0.465 million for the treatment of patients in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_4117">The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that during the period 1994 to 1996, 3,000 patients commenced orthodontic treatment in the board's area. During this time 800 of those patients completed their treatments. In the intervening period, the board experienced staffing shortages, resulting in reduced levels of activity and an increase in waiting lists and waiting times for assessment and treatment, with some 300 cases commencing treatment in the period 1996 to 1997. Since 2001 progress has been made by the board in recruiting an orthodontic specialist and two additional specialists commenced duty with the board on completion of their specialist training last year. The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has also informed me that the number of cases awaiting orthodontic assessment and treatment, as at 31 March 2003, was 1,633. This is in comparison to a corresponding figure of 2,392 in 1996, 3,642 in 1997 and 4,003 in 1998. The chief executive officer has also informed me that 1,649 people were receiving orthodontic treatment at the end of March 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_4122">As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic treatment is the responsibility of the health boards or the ERHA in the first instance. Any entitlement to orthodontic treatment is determined by reference to orthodontic guidelines, a set of objective clinical criteria applied by health board orthodontists when assessing children's priority of need for treatment. The guidelines were issued by my Department in 1985 and are still in use. They are used to ensure that orthodontic resources are prioritised for, and applied equitably to, the most severe cases. Patients assessed as category A have severe malocclusions and should receive urgent orthodontic care. Patients assessed as category B have less severe  problems and are placed on orthodontic treatment waiting lists. The number of cases treated depends on the level of resources available in terms of qualified staff in the area and this is reflected in the treatment waiting list.</p>
          <p eId="para_4123">The provision of orthodontic services is severely restricted at present because of the limited availability of trained specialist clinical staff to assess and treat patients. Accordingly, boards do not normally maintain category C waiting lists. I have taken a number of measures to address this shortage. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two universities in the UK. The 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are in addition to the six dentists who commenced training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. There is an aggregate of 20 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</p>

The strategy is centred on four goals: better health for everyone; fair access; responsive and appropriate care delivery; and high performance.

I propose to make a copy of the progress report available to the Deputy in the near future. He may also wish to note that three reports are pending which will have major implications for the reform of the health system: the audit of structures and functions of the Irish health care system; the national task force on medical staffing; and the commission on financial management and control systems in the health service. Progress on a further 18 strategy actions is dependent upon the outcome of these reports and decisions with regard to their implementation.</p>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_243">I wish to clarify that the public health review, also known as the Brennan review, commenced in 1999 and published its recommendations in April 2002, not in 1994 as the Deputy stated. The Brennan review was charged with reviewing the operations of the public health departments and community public health medical services of the health boards in the context of the 1994 memorandum of agreement between the Department and the Irish Medical Organisation and with considering future developments for these services. The group consisted of representatives of the Department of Health and Children, the health boards and the IMO. There was agreement on many of the matters considered by the group, including the need for a formally structured out-of-hours arrangement. There was one main area of disagreement, however. The IMO held the view that public health directors and specialists should have parity with hospital consultants,  while management felt that this was outside the terms of reference of the group. The report did not make a recommendation on the matter and the chairman recognised that any such issues as referred to by the official side would have to be the subject of industrial relations negotiations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_244">The report also acknowledged that there might be a need to revisit the recommendations in relation to public health following the implementation of proposed changes recommended by the health strategy and the primary care strategy. Formal and informal talks have been held with the IMO on these issues since the publication of the Brennan report. The issues central to the public health doctors' dispute have been the subject of negotiations between the IMO and management, comprising officials from the Health Service Employers Agency, the Department of Health and Children and the health boards over the last 12 months, initially through joint discussions and in more recent times under the aegis of the Labour Relations Commission.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_245">Efforts have been made at the highest level to reach a satisfactory conclusion since the IMO commenced strike action. In this regard, I wish to state that management has made a substantial offer to the IMO. On 14 March at informal talks at the LRC, management made an offer of 10.5%, excluding benchmarking, through the independent chair. This offer was confirmed in writing by the HSEA on 18 March. The application of such an increase, as well as the increases awarded to public health doctors under benchmarking and the national agreement, Sustaining Progress, would result in increases of between €11,000 and €29,000 for public health doctors between now and 2005. The HSEA also asked the IMO to agree to have all outstanding issues referred to the Labour Court. Unfortunately, the IMO did not agree to this request and a strike started on 14 April. I have asked the IMO to return to the negotiating table on at least three occasions since then. In addition, the national implementation body has urged the IMO to suspend its strike and to avail of the industrial relations mechanisms in accordance with the conditions of the national pay agreement, Sustaining Progress.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_246">Exploratory talks took place at the LRC with the HSEA and officials from my Department earlier this month. At these talks, management indicated its willingness to discuss the implementation of the recommendations of the Brennan report, including the development of a structured out-of-hours system. In addition, the above mentioned increase of 10.5% was again offered. During these talks, management stressed that the issue of the granting of consultant status to directors and specialists was not the subject of a recommendation by the review group on public health. The 30% pay increase called for by the public health doctors is in addition to the provisions of Sustaining Progress. The IMO was not only involved in the discussions leading to the recent social partnership agreement but, in its role as a member of ICTU, was also a signatory,  indicating its acceptance of the agreement. By their acceptance, the parties involved have agreed to preclude strikes or other forms of industrial action and when local negotiations prove to be unsuccessful they have agreed to refer to the LRC or the Labour Court.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_247">The signatories of Sustaining Progress have committed themselves to stable industrial relations and the maintenance of a well-managed industrial relations environment to minimise disputes affecting the level of service to the public. The national implementation body emphasised this when, in its press release of 24 April, it called on the IMO to suspend its strike action and to agree to a referral of the matter to the Labour Court. Across the health system, different levels of staff enter claims about a variety of issues related to their terms and conditions of employment. If each of these claims was to be conceded without challenge, the resources available would not be used effectively. There are general frameworks – such as the various pay agreements – within which any such claims have to be examined and considered. There is also the formal industrial relations machinery through which valid claims must be processed. It is not within my power, nor that of my Department, the HSEA or any other agent of management, simply to concede major pay claims just because they have been demanded. Such a concession is not given to any group in the health system or the wider public services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_248">The national implementation body has urged the IMO to suspend its strike and to avail of the industrial relations mechanisms in accordance with the conditions of the Sustaining Progress. Efforts are currently being made under the aegis of this body to identify a basis on which negotiations can be resumed, leading to a resolution of the issues in dispute.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_249">A number of reports are currently being formulated in respect of the reform of the health system. The first of these relates to action 114 of the health strategy, which deals with the need to  support organisation development, to clarify roles and to co-ordinate the work of organisations. Prospectus Strategy Consultants were contracted in June 2002 to complete an audit of structures and functions in the health system. The terms of reference included consideration of the structures and functions of health boards and the ERHA, as well as other specialist, advisory, regulatory and executive agencies under my aegis. The terms of reference also required Prospectus to make recommendations to improve corporate governance arrangements in the health system generally. This was to include consideration of interactions between all agencies that play a pivotal role in the system, including the Department of Health and Children.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_250">The outcomes sought were to ensure that the structures in the system are the most appropriate and responsive to meet current and future service need; constitute an adequate framework for overall governance of the health system; achieve an effective integration of services across all parts of the system; adequately represent the views of consumers in the planning and delivery of services; and focus on the principles of equity, accountability, quality and people-centredness and the national goals of the strategy. Prospectus included, as part of the overall consultancy, a review of international health care system reforms to provide relevant insights into specific aspects of international health care structural and functional reform. It was also intended to identify structural reforms and concepts that would warrant further consideration as the reform of the Irish health service continues into the future. The research spanned eight jurisdictions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_251">A second report is being prepared by the national task force on medical staffing. This review is concerned with preparing a plan for the medical staffing of acute hospitals, based on the recommendations of the report of the Medical Manpower Forum in 2001 and the report of the national joint steering group on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors in 2001. The key work of the task force is to devise a strategy for reducing the average working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors; to achieve the requirements of the European working time directive; to address the consequent medical staffing needs of Irish hospitals; to analyse the practical implications of moving to a consultant-provided hospital system; and to consider the requirements for medical education and training arising from any changes to the current model of delivering services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_252">A third report, by the commission on financial management and control systems in the health system, was undertaken on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Finance. The commission carried out a detailed examination and review of the financial management and control systems in the health service. While the principle remit related to matters of financial management, the analysis and conclusions of the commission  necessarily drew it into the organisation and configuration of the health service more generally. The commission also considered an analysis of best international practice as part of its recommendations on financial management and control systems in the health service.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_253">These reports are at different stages of finalisation. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, has recently received the report of the commission on financial management and controls in the health service and is considering its contents. The work of the national task force on medical staffing is at an advanced stage but has not yet been finalised. I have received the final draft of the Prospectus report and I hope with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, to bring it and the report of the commission on financial management and controls in the health service to Government in due course.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4139">The National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, plays a key role in the prevention and management of infectious diseases. The Irish approach to infectious diseases outbreaks and epidemics is based on sound internationally accepted principles such as: preventative measures; early identification of cases; effective clinical care including good hospital infection control appropriate surveillance; contract tracing and management of contacts. The procedures for dealing with infectious diseases are based on these principles.</p>
          <p eId="para_4140">Many infectious diseases can be prevented by vaccine use. Immunisation against infectious disease has probably saved more lives than any other public health intervention, apart from the provision of clean water. Improvements in living standards have reduced the mortality from infectious diseases, but immunisation has also played a large role in the reduction of disease incidence. It would not have been possible to eradicate smallpox without vaccine, and the eradication of polio in the European region is also largely due to immunisation.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_256">In recent years, improved economic and social conditions, together with public health action, have virtually eliminated the pandemics of communicable diseases.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_257">I have in the past and will continue to establish expert committees-groups to advise on the most appropriate action given the particular circumstances of the outbreak concerned. Guidelines and protocols on the management of many different types of outbreaks have been developed based on the principles referred to. These guidelines also take into account guidance published by the World Health Organisation, WHO, the Centres for Disease Control, CDC, in the USA and a number of other reputable international public health bodies. Most outbreaks are dealt with the establishment of an outbreak control team, who manage the outbreak and put in place whatever control measures are needed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_258">The issue of diagnosis of infectious diseases is a matter for the appropriate clinicians concerned. In relation to isolation, in recent years it has become the practice to refer and treat patients with infectious disease in acute general hospitals. It is now generally agreed by the medical profession, including the Medical Council, that an acute general hospital is the appropriate setting for the delivery of this service. My Department has been advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards that there is considerable response capacity in place for isolation and accommodation facilities should they be required for the management of patients with infectious diseases in an in-patient setting, that is, single rooms with their own bathroom facilities and/or cohort placement of patients in a dedicated area.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_259">Unfortunately at present the capacity of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the health boards and the National Disease Surveillance Centre to respond to any problems in the area of infectious diseases is compromised due to the ongoing industrial action by public health doctors. Every effort is being made to resolve this dispute.</summary>

Save in exceptional circumstances, at least three firms should be invited to tender.

          <p eId="para_4149">Charges in respect of long-stay or extended care can be made under two sets of regulations. They can be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services)  (Amendment) Regulations, 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months. The regulations provide that a charge is made at a rate not exceeding the person's income. Medical card holders and persons with dependants are exempt from these charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_4150">Charges may also be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965, where the patient receives "shelter and maintenance" rather than treatment. These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes, including medical card holders and persons with dependants.</p>
          <p eId="para_4151">In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</p>

          <p eId="para_4171">MMR vaccine is available under the primary childhood immunisation programme. The programme provides for the immunisation of children against a range of potentially serious infectious diseases. Under the programme, parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice. The schedule of immunisation is in accordance with the recommendations of the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland – RCPI.</p>
          <p eId="para_4172">There is a sound evidence basis for use of MMR in the national programme. Since the original publication of UK research from Wakefield about a possible causal link between MMR vaccine and autism, many researchers have investigated the proposed causal relationship and concluded that there is no link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. My Department's submission to the relevant Oireachtas committee contains further details on the scientific evidence in this regard. In Ireland, this issue has been examined by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland immunisation committee and the Irish Medicines Board. The conclusions are that there is no evidence to support the association between MMR vaccines and the development of autism or inflammatory bowel disease and the vaccine is safer than giving the three component vaccines separately. The Oireachtas committee has also endorsed the safety of the MMR vaccine.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_263">The international consensus from professional bodies and international organisations is that the  MMR is a safe and effective vaccine. The institutions include the Medical Research Council expert committee and the British committee on safety of medicines in the UK, the centres for disease control and prevention and the American Academy of Paediatrics in the USA, as well as the World Health Organisation. Studies by the United States Institute of Medicine concluded that there is no link between the vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. A large Finnish study, involving 1.8 million individuals, demonstrated that no case of inflammatory bowel disease or autism was linked to the MMR vaccine. A recent UK study where researchers analysed 2,000 studies from 180 countries found no evidence of a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. The World Health Organisation, WHO, strongly endorses the use of MMR vaccine on the grounds of its convincing record of safety and efficacy. This view is supported by the Irish Medicines Board and by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_264">The Irish Medicines Board, IMB, is responsible for the monitoring and safety of all pharmaceutical products in Ireland. The monitoring of safety is ensured through clinical trials prior to licence and post-licence surveillance by the IMB. The IMB liaises closely with international bodies including the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and the World Health Organisation. Information provided by the IMB indicates that there is no thiomersal in either of the two licensed MMR vaccines on the Irish market and therefore there are no health implications in this regard.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_265">I take this opportunity to urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme. This is in order to ensure that both children and the population generally have maximum protection against the disease concerned. General practitioners are aware of the contra-indications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their general practitioner before making a decision about their child's immunisation.</summary>

While the national lottery applications submitted by the organisation in 2001 and 2002 were recommended for funding by the services division, the number of applications received far exceeded the available resources and it was not possible to assist during 2001 and 2002.</p>

          <p eId="para_4185">Measles is a highly infectious and serious disease. Approximately one in 15 children who contract measles will suffer serious complications. The MMR vaccine protects against this disease and can be administered to children at 12 months of age. A vaccine uptake rate of 95% is required in order to protect children from measles and to stop the spread of the disease in the community. I am concerned about the unsatisfactory MMR immunisation uptake rates in childhood immunisations because of the risk of unimmunised children contracting the potentially serious diseases concerned. The outbreak of measles in 2000, which resulted in three deaths and approximately 2,000 cases, is evidence of the consequences of insufficient immunisation uptake.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_267">The health board chief executive officers established a national immunisation steering committee to address a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation programmes, including the identification of issues that are hampering the achievement of uptake targets. The steering committee was assisted by four working groups, which examined the following areas in relation to immunisation: (a) communication, (b) materials management, (c) IT systems and (d) planning and organisation. I launched the report of the steering committee on 22 April 2002. This report is a major step towards improving immunisation uptake and also enhancing and developing the key systems which underpin the immunisation programmes. In July 2002, a national immunisation implementation group was established and is responsible for co-ordinating the planning and implementation of immunisation programmes in order to improve uptake. This group reports to the national steering committee. Some €2.116 million is being made available at national level in 2003 in respect of specific projects and measures which are being designed to improve immunisation uptake.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_268">Based on information available from the National Disease Surveillance Centre, there has been a significant increase in 2003 in the number of reported measles cases. In weeks one to 14 inclusive in 2003, 377 cases of measles have been reported, compared with 51 cases in the same period in 2002. Specific outbreak management measures were put in place in the two regions concerned – the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Midland Health Board earlier this year. In addition, in order to prevent a serious outbreak, chief executive officers in all health boards and the ERHA were asked earlier this year to ensure that specific immunisation measures were prioritised in all regions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_269">Immunisation is the key to preventing a measles outbreak and, therefore, I take this opportunity to again urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the disease concerned. This is particularly important at present in light of the increase in reported cases. Unfortunately, at present, the capacity of the ERHA, the health boards and the National Disease Surveillance Centre to respond to any problems in this area is compromised due to the ongoing industrial action by public health doctors. Every effort is being made to resolve this dispute.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4229">Private operators are required under the Road Transport  Act 1932 to apply to my Department for a licence to operate a route or to amend an existing licence. All applications for new licensed services or amendments to existing licensed services are considered on an individual basis. Depending on the nature and complexity of the application, this process can take some time. Detailed analysis is required to ascertain, for example, the extent of any overlap between the proposed service and existing licensed or other public transport services. This can include similar licence applications already received.</p>
          <p eId="para_4230">Applications are dealt with on a first come, first served basis. Naturally, if there are pressing or exceptional circumstances this would be taken into account in determining the order in which such an application would be dealt with. In some circumstances while the preliminary work may have been completed on a particular application, a final decision cannot be made until other relevant applications received prior to it have been finalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_4231">In relation to the company referred to in the Deputy's question, my Department received an application on 14 April 2003 for a proposed Galway-Shannon Airport bus service. A prior application for a proposed service between Galway and Cork was received on 31 January 2003. Both these applications are currently being processed and my Department will revert to the company in due course.</p>

      <b>Mr. F. McGrath</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Transport</b>
      if his attention has been drawn to the damage to homes by the construction of the Dublin Port tunnel; and if the 30 metre zone will be extended to a 60 metre zone in order to protect the interest of the residents.

          <p eId="para_4233">The matters raised by the Deputy are matters for the contractor, Dublin City Council and the NRA.</p>
          <p eId="para_4234">I am informed by the NRA and Dublin City Council that the port tunnel passes under approximately 50 apartments and 334 houses. To date it has passed under close to half of these properties. From this total a small number of complaints have been received claiming damage to some properties. I understand that any verified damage connected with the tunnelling will be made good by Dublin City Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_4235">I understand that a number of measures are in force to ensure the safety of properties. All properties lying within a 30 metre zone of influence on either side of the tunnel have pre-construction and post-construction building condition surveys carried out by independent building surveyors. Any damage attributable to tunnelling works are covered by a property protection guarantee issued by Dublin City Council to all the property owners before the tunnelling works commenced. There is also provision for interim surveys should complaints arise during the construction period. The project's insurance loss adjusters are also available to assess any damages arising from property owners claims, if and as they arise.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_291">I also understand that other significant measures have also been taken to monitor and ensure the safety of buildings over the tunnel including vibration monitors being installed at various properties to monitor any vibration from the works; and settlement surveys being carried out on an ongoing basis during tunnelling under houses and an extensometer being installed in certain boreholes along the route which remotely monitors ground movements in the rock before such movements appear at the surface and provides substantial information on the ground behaviour associated with the tunnelling.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_292">Within the tunnel, monitoring of the tunnel walls is also carried out. This involves the setting up of deformation points which are regularly checked for position and movement. Any movement or misalignment will be registered. A 24 hour hotline and emergency response is in place and available.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_293">This package of measures along with the other various controls and monitoring arrangements that exist represents a comprehensive approach to ensuring the safe passage of the tunnelling works under properties. It is in line with the best international practice and is part and parcel of the successful delivery of tunnels around the world.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_294">In regard to the question of extending the survey area from 30 metres either side of the tunnel to a 60 metre distance, the NRA and Dublin City Council consider this unnecessary. The rationale behind the 30 metre "influence zone" is based on a prediction of ground impacts associated with the tunnel. Actual ground settlement results have corroborated the accuracy of the limit of this predicted influence zone.  Any basis for change to the width of the zone would have to be guided by the actual settlements measured. I am informed that to date, settlement readings have not indicated a need to widen the "influence zone".</summary>

          <p eId="para_4239">Under Directive 74/483, bull bars and other exterior projections to motor vehicles are covered by an EU-wide type approval arrangement.

New proposals for a type approval directive with regard to the protection of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users in the event of collision with a motor vehicle have been introduced by the European Commission which will, <i>inter alia,</i> review the present arrangements relating to bull bars.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_296">During the lifetime of the Government Road Safety Strategy 1998-2002, the issue of vulnerable road users was given specific recognition. In the case of pedestrians this was given particular prominence through the promotion by the National Safety Council of major road safety educational programmes targeted at both first and second level school children. In addition, the question of pedestrian attention to road safety was graphically promoted through a major publicity campaign, which was also promoted by the National Safety Council.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_297">Proposals for a Directive concerned with improving the protection of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users in the event of a collision with a motor vehicle have been made by the European Commission and are under consideration by Member States. Ireland fully supports the proposal.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_298">The High Level Group on Road Safety has been tasked with the preparation of a new Road Safety Strategy, one of the key areas of which will be pedestrian safety. The preparation of the new strategy will take account of the achievements in meeting the targets set out in the Road to Safety Strategy 1998-2002, a comprehensive review of that strategy, and the evolving developments in relation to the proposed EU Third Road Safety Action Plan. Preparation of the new strategy is well advanced and I expect to bring specific proposals for the strategy to Government later this year.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4405">It is proposed to introduce metric units for road traffic signs for speed and speed measurement in 2004. The change over to metric values in this field of application will fulfil the timescale requirement of the European Communities (Units of Measurement)(Amendment) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 619 of 2002). These regulations, made by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, specify that imperial units of measurement may be used until 31 December 2004 and shall not be used thereafter.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_299">A comprehensive review of speed limits is currently under way. The review will address all of the major issues relating to speed limit policy including the range of speed limits deployed on roadways and in relation to particular categories of vehicles, the signage used to indicate speed limits and the implications of the adoption of metric values for speed measurement. A broadly based working group has been established to carry out this review and it is intended that the review will be completed this summer. The working group's report will make recommendations relating to the timing and administration of the adoption of metric values and inform the neces sary legislative requirements needed to underpin those recommendations.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4421">I propose to take Questions Nos. 371 and 372 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_4422">The number of retired members of the Garda Síochána from Garda to Chief Superintendent rank who retired before 1 October 1982 and who do not have rent allowance included in their Garda pensions is 159. The current estimated cost of having a rent allowance element included in their pensions would be €227,688 per annum.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_305">The number of members of the Garda Síochána from Garda to Chief Superintendent rank who retired before 1 January 1993 and who do not have weekend-unsocial hours allowance included in their Garda pensions is 1,553. The current estimated cost of having the unsocial  hours element included in their pensions would be €5,334,555 per annum.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_306">There are also a number of Garda spouses' pensions in payment to the spouses-children of deceased members who retired prior to the dates in question which would give rise to a further annual exchequer cost.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_307">As the Deputy is aware, the Government decided in September 2001 to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the commission on public service pensions and to establish a working group to advise on implementation as provided for in the programme for prosperity and fairness. Parallel structures with the same remit were established in the case of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. The operational details of the implementation of the Commission recommendations will be agreed by Government following receipt of a report from the implementation working group. The report is being finalised at present.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_308">The position on the issue of parity of pensions for members of the Garda Síochána who retired prior to 1 January, 1993 who do not receive the unsocial hours element in their pensions and those who retired prior to 1 October 1982 who do not receive the rent allowance element in their pensions, is that the commission examined the specific issue of the pensionability of allowances for members of the Garda Síochána and others, as part of its deliberations but having assessed the arguments involved, did not recommend any increase in pension for the groups involved.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_309">In addition, the extension sought in relation to Garda allowances could not be confined to retired members of the Garda Síochána. There could be considerable additional costs with regard to allowances in other areas of the public sector, notably the defence forces, teachers and prison officers. A concession in these areas would impose a significant cost on the State, in excess of €12 million a year and an accrued liability of about €152 million based on 1997 costs for Garda and Defence Forces pensioners outlined in the final report of the commission on Public Service pensions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_310">Having regard to the commission's report, I have no plans to introduce amending legislation at this stage.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4435">The person referred to by the Deputy is serving a sentence of life imprisonment for murder. As the Deputy may be aware, persons serving life sentences for murder may have their case reviewed by the Interim Parole Board after they have served seven years in custody. The board was established in April 2001 to advise me in relation to the administration of long-term prison sentences and replaces the work previously carried out by the sentence review group.</p>
          <p eId="para_4436">With regard to the prisoner in question his case was reviewed by the sentence review group in November 1999, February 2001 and August 2001. As a result of recommendations received from the group following those reviews my predecessor approved a programme of daily temporary release for work-training purposes for this person from April 2001. He has also been granted occasional periods of release for resocialisation-reintegration purposes. It should be noted that it is a condition of all such releases that he does not return to his home area, where the offence occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_4437">In September 2002, the Interim Parole Board, in considering his case, recommended that the programme of temporary release should continue. This recommendation was accepted by me. The Interim Parole Board also set a date of September 2004 for the next scheduled consideration of his case.</p>
          <p eId="para_4438">I assure the Deputy that I am very conscious of the impact of crime on victims and their families, as indeed are the agencies who advise me in relation to the management of the sentences of life sentenced persons, that is, the Interim Parole Board, the Irish Prison Service and the Probation and Welfare Service. I acknowledge that for every offender there is a victim and although there is no formal mechanism in place to obtain the views of every victim, or their family, the fact is that such views, when made known, are always given due consideration. In this case I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that a member of the family of the victim has been in regular contact with them and has been informed of the general programme the offender is undertaking. Procedures are in place for the immediate family to be informed by the victim liaison officer of any significant change in the administration of his sentence. Such change would include, for example, transfer to more open conditions, permission to travel to his home area, extension of terms of temporary release, and any other major change to his temporary release conditions.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_311">While it is essential that the sensitivities and concerns of victims of crime should be and are carefully considered during the sentence manage ment process, it is also the case that there is a need to rehabilitate offenders and reintegrate them back into society, and a balance must be struck in this regard. This balance is not always easy to achieve. However, I can assure the Deputy that when making these decisions, I do give careful consideration to all aspects of each case.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4498">The application in question was in respect of a non-EEA national who stated that she intended to enter the State to get married. The application was refused because it was not established, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicant and her reference in Ireland have ever met. There is no evidence available on file that the reference in Ireland has ever been to the Philippines, which is the country of nationality of the applicant, or to Israel where the applicant now resides. In addition, it would appear that the applicant has never been to Ireland previously. The reference in Ireland did not supply proof of finances, even though he stated that he would be supporting the applicant during her stay in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_4499">It is open to the applicant to appeal against the refusal by writing to the visa appeals officer in my Department, together with additional supporting documentation. Full copies of both passports should be submitted with the appeal.</p>

This does not include the cost of standard local authority accommodation provided for Travellers which was funded under my Department's local authority housing programme or housing provided by voluntary housing bodies and funded under my Department's voluntary housing schemes which was allocated to Travellers in this period. My Department continues to provide the necessary funding to meet the cost to local authorities of the provision of Traveller specific accommodation. Total expenditure for the provision of such accommodation during the first three years of the Traveller accommodation programmes was €65.46 million. A further €30 million has been allocated in 2003 for Traveller specific accommodation.</p>

The person was requested by my Department to cease digging drains on part of his land as no notice had been given or consent obtained under the EU (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997 prior to the undertaking of this work. Subsequently, most of his land was excluded from the cSAC following an informal appeal. Restrictions no longer apply to that portion of his land. The person has been advised that he may appeal the designation of the remainder of his land to the Special Areas of Conservation Appeals Advisory Board. In the meantime, staff of my Department had a meeting with the person on 22 May 2003 to assist in resolving outstanding issues.</p>

As stated in that reply, an allocation of €3.8 million was indicated under the National Development Plan 2000-06 for the provision of a visitor centre for Ballycroy National Park, County Mayo. An attractive and extensive site has already been acquired for the proposed building in the village of Ballycroy and a working group, comprising officials of my Department,  the Office of Public Works, Mayo County Council and local tourism, development and community representatives, has brought the project to an advanced stage. I am well aware of the support for this project within the local community and I appreciate the constructive role which local representatives have played in the deliberations of the working group to date. I hope to be in a position to make a final decision on this project in the near future, following which it will be possible to address the planning and operational issues arising.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5018">Negotiations on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food. He agrees with the broad thrust of the Commission's proposals under the mid-term review of Agenda 2000, in so far as rural development is concerned, which is to extend the range of on-farm rural development measures to promote food quality, meet higher standards and foster animal welfare. However, the Commission is also proposing to introduce a system of modulation which would reduce direct payments to farmers receiving over €5,000 a year to provide additional funds for such rural development. There is an intrinsic contradiction in this proposal to reduce farmers' incomes which will be damaging the economies of rural areas to provide funds for certain rural development measures. My colleague has made his overall opposition to the proposals clear in the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers and his objective in the negotiations is to preserve the benefits to Irish agriculture and to rural communities achieved under the Agenda 2000 agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_5019">The Minister for Agriculture and Food continues to keep me apprised of the progress of the negotiations. As I have indicated, rural development in the context of the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy is farm-related and not wider rural development as is generally understood here.</p>
          <p eId="para_5020">In relation to the rural development programmes for which I have responsibility, principally Leader, the outcome of the Common Agricultural Policy negotiations will not affect existing financial commitments under the national development plan. However, my Department will be working closely with the Department of Agriculture and Food in the coming period to ensure that coherent rural development policies are pursued so that the effects of any changes in farm related policies do not impact negatively on rural development generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_5021">The mid-term review of the national development plan being carried out currently will also assist in terms of assessing the effectiveness of expenditure in this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_5023">My views on the dispersed rural populations are well known to Members of this House. I have spoken many times of the need for a settlement pattern that would allow for the regeneration of rural areas, particularly those which have suffered continuous decline.</p>
          <p eId="para_5024">Government policy on rural development is set out in the White Paper published in August 1999. As a result the Government is committed to ensuring the economic and social well-being of rural communities and, providing the conditions for a meaningful fulfilling life for all people living in rural areas. The aim is to have vibrant and sustainable communities able to enjoy a standard of living and quality of life which will make them attractive communities in which to live and work and where individuals and families will have a real choice as to where to stay in, leave or move to rural Ireland, whether in farming or otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_5025">Rural communities should also be able to enjoy access to education, training and lifelong learning and an adequate level of social and other services and infrastructures. Their cultural identities, in particular the language, traditions, heritage and sense of community, must be valued and retained.</p>
          <p eId="para_5026">In my statement welcoming the publication of the national spatial strategy, NSS, last November, I said the strategy sets down clear markers for the way ahead in rural development. It addresses many of my concerns on issues such as rural housing, services and cultural identity. My Department is represented on the interdepartmental committee established to implement the NSS where many of these issues will be pursued. As further evidence of the Government's commitment, I launched the CLÁR programme for disadvantaged rural areas in October 2001 during my time as Minister of State with responsibility for rural development. In January of this year, I announced the extension of CLÁR areas arising from the review based on the 2002 population census as promised in the Agreed Programme for Government.</p>

In total there are 38 groups operating in all 26 counties (when the area based  rural development scheme is taken into account) and these are engaged in funding small-scale capital projects.

          <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
          <p eId="para_5446">I propose to take Questions Nos. 431 to 434, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_5447">The Deputy will be aware from my reply to his Parliamentary Question No. 432 of 3 December last of the wide range of schemes already operated by my Department for the purposes of revitalising communities, both urban and rural, throughout the country. The Deputy will also appreciate that, in light of the sheer diversity of these schemes, it would not be possible to provide a county by county breakdown of the operation of these services in the time available.</p>
          <p eId="para_5448">My Department continues to implement these programmes and has commenced a review of their operation with a view to achieving optimum efficiency in the delivery of these supports. My Department's statement of strategy for the years 2003-2005 is now being prepared for printing and bilingual publication.</p>
          <p eId="para_5449">The strategy statement indicates that overall, our aim continues to be the support of local self-help, and rural areas integrated local development and community development initiatives through a range of once-off grant schemes and long-term funding programmes. For example, the local development social inclusion programme funds 38 area partnerships and 33 community groups, located throughout the country, which continue to provide services to a range of target groups. The funding available under the programme in 2003 is €44.6 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_5450">The community development support programme currently provides core funding on a contract basis to 155 community development projects throughout the country. I recently announced plans to expand the programme by setting up a further 15 projects in specifically targeted areas. In addition, a further 15 project start-ups are scheduled for 2004, subject to funding being available.</p>
          <p eId="para_5451">Under the young people's facilities and services fund, which operates primarily in local drugs task force areas in Dublin and Cork, an amount of €54 million has been allocated towards the provision of approximately 350 facility and services projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_5452">On the services side, approximately 130 project workers have been appointed – 80% of whom are outreach and youth workers – to work on the ground with the target group offering developmental activities and educational programmes for young people who have traditionally found themselves outside the scope of mainstream youth work due to family background, involvement with crime or drug misuse or lack of education. In addition, a wide variety of community-based prevention-education programmes and targeted interventions are being funded.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_372">The position regarding the funding of additional proposals is being considered at present by the national assessment committee for the fund which is having ongoing discussions with  the relevant Departments and State agencies involved.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_373">A number of other measures will also further contribute to community and voluntary sector support. These include the implementation of the recommendations in the White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity; and the introduction of legislation to ensure an appropriate regulatory framework for the charity sector.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_374">Another important factor will be the disbursement of moneys from the dormant accounts fund. The dormant accounts legislation provides for a scheme to disburse moneys on programmes or projects to assist those who are socially, economically or educationally disadvantaged and people with a disability. The Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, which is an independent board under the aegis of my Department, is currently preparing a disbursement plan that will outline its objectives and strategy for achieving those objectives.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_375">The placing of the remit for rural development within a new Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is a reflection of the need for sustained focus on rural communities. While the 1999 White Paper on Rural Development sets out a vision and a framework for the development of rural communities, a critical challenge is to ensure the White Paper commitments are addressed across a wide range of Departments and public bodies. Effective formalised co-ordination systems need to be maintained and strengthened with the appropriate Departments and agencies.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_376">Considerable success is already being achieved through, for example, the operation of the CLÁR – Ceantair Laga Árd-Ríachtanais – programme, which is designed to address rural areas of special disadvantage. The CLÁR programme funds, or co-funds, with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, investment in selected priority developments, encompassing, electricity conversions, roads, water and sewerage, village enhancement, telecommunications, health and sports projects. In January of this year I was pleased to announce the expansion of the CLÁR areas having regard to the preliminary results of the 2002 population census, as promised in An Agreed Programme for Government.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_377">As the national authority for Leader, my Department will continue to oversee the operation of this EU community initiative for rural development. It provides approved local action groups with public funding – EU and national – to implement multi-sectoral business plans for the development of their own areas. The Leader programmes in Ireland are now fully operational under the current round of Structural Funds. Some 38 groups are delivering the programmes nationwide covering all rural areas. Coverage of all counties is provided for under the programmes while implementation at county level is co-ordinated through the county development boards.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_378">With regard to the Gaeltacht, it is clear that in order to attract modern service-based industries there and sustain Gaeltacht populations, critical structural deficiencies need to be addressed. The ongoing work of both my Department and Údarás na Gaeltachta with regard to the development of strategic Gaeltacht infrastructure, will continue to be important in creating sustainable  employment in the changing Gaeltacht environment. My Department will continue to provide assistance in Gaeltacht areas towards the enhancement of Gaeltacht infrastructure, including housing, roads, marine works, village renewal and various recreational facilities such as community centres, playing fields and other amenities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_379">Promoting the sustainable development of the populated off-shore islands will also remain a key task of the Department. While much has been achieved in recent years, further improvements in access, services and infrastructural supports are necessary in order to maintain and enhance islanders' living standards. My Department will continue to work with local authorities and community groups to ensure the provision of appropriate infrastructure and services for the benefit of these geographically remote communities.</summary>

      <b>Mr. Durkan</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</b>
      the number of applications for financial or grant assistance received in his Department in 2003 in respect of both urban and rural communities; the extent to which it is expected to respond favourably to such applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
          <p eId="para_5454">As the Deputy will be aware from previous parliamentary questions, my Department is responsible for a wide range of schemes relating primarily to the support of community and voluntary activity. The Deputy will appreciate that decisions to award grants are made throughout the year on foot of the consideration of applications received. The advertising of grant schemes and the announcements of awards are publicised through a variety of media including my Department's website – www.pobail.ie.</p>
          <p eId="para_5455">Within that context I can advise the Deputy as below in relation to applications received to date in 2003 under those schemes involving the provision of financial or grant assistance to urban and rural communities, that are administered directly by my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_5456">A total of 670 applications have been received by my Department to date for grant aid under the training and supports in the community and voluntary sector scheme and the funding scheme to support the role of federations, networks and umbrella bodies in the community and voluntary sector. Applications are being assessed by consultants at present and recommendations are expected in the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_5457">Three applications for grant assistance from Ciste na Gaeilge have been received to date this year in respect of both urban and rural groups. Of this, one application has been granted, the remaining two are currently under consideration – the Deputy should note that the bulk of applications for grant assistance for 2003 were received in late 2002.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_380">No applications have been received so far this year under the rural development fund, while the scheme of once-off grants to voluntary organisations and the scheme of community support for older people have not, as yet, been advertised for 2003. It is envisaged that both schemes will be  advertised in the national press in the coming weeks.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_381">Under the Gaeltacht improvement schemes my Department receives various applications on an ongoing basis throughout the year. Assistance is provided towards the development of Gaeltacht infrastructure, including housing, roads, marine works, village renewal and various recreational facilities such as community centres, playing fields and other amenities. Statistics are not readily available as to the number of applications received to date and it is felt that the work involved in compiling a figure for the number received would exceed the information value of such a statistic.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_382">The islands' section of the Department receives applications for assistance on an ongoing basis each year. Again, statistics are not readily available regarding the number of applications received to date. Each application received is evaluated in the context of the funding available for island development and the various other demands on that funding.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_5459">My Department now has responsibility for a number of community support initiatives previously administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, namely the community development support programme, the scheme of once-off grants to voluntary and community groups, the scheme of community support to older people and certain supports for the community and voluntary sector provided within the framework of the White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_5460">The community development support programme currently provides core funding on a contract basis to 155 community development projects throughout the country. In line with the Government's continued commitment to tackle social exclusion and despite the tighter budgetary situation this year, I recently announced plans to expand the programme by setting up a further 15 projects in specifically targeted disadvantaged areas throughout the country. It is expected that these new projects will be ready to join the programme with effect from September next. Each will receive an initial one-year contract in the sum of €60,000. Priority in selecting new projects has been primarily with reference to areas identified under the RAPID and CLÁR programmes. In addition, a further 15 project start-ups are scheduled for 2004, subject to funding being available.</p>
          <p eId="para_5461">The scheme of once-off grants and the scheme of support to older people will be advertised in June and July respectively. Both schemes will be open to voluntary and community groups on a nationwide basis and the criteria will be similar to those applicable in previous years.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_383">In the context of the White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity, my Department recently  appointed consultants to carry out the assessment of applications under the following schemes: scheme of training and supports in the community and voluntary sector; and scheme to support the role of federations, networks and umbrella bodies in the community and voluntary sector.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_384">It is expected that these assessments will be completed by the end of June and July respectively. All applicants will be advised of the outcome of their applications shortly thereafter.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5466">As the Deputy will be aware, my Department co-ordinates the implementation of the national drugs strategy 2001-08. The strategy brings together all elements of drugs policy in Ireland into a single framework with responsibilities clearly assigned. It contains 100 separate actions across the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research to be carried out by a range of Departments and agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_5467">My Department also has responsibility for the work of the local drugs task forces. The majority of the task forces are currently implementing their second round action plans. To date, the two plans have funded approximately 500 local community-based projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_5468">Since 1997, more than €130 million has been either spent or allocated to projects in the local drugs task force areas through the two local action plans –€65 million, the Premises Initiative for drugs projects –€11.5 million – and the young people's facilities and services fund –€54 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_5469">The Deputy should note that in 2003, an amount of €16 million is available under the drugs subhead to fund the work of the local drugs task forces, the Premises Initiative and the National Advisory Committee on Drugs. This represents an increase of approximately 16% over the funding available in 2002.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_385">Funding of €15.877 million is provided for the young people's facilities and services fund in  2003. Responsibility for the fund was recently transferred to this Department from the Department of Education and Science.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5481">Disability allowance is a weekly allowance paid to people with disability, the payment of which is subject to both medical suitability and a means test. The principal items counted as means include the value of savings or properties other than the home, maintenance paid to those who or are separated and cash income of the claimant's spouse or partner. The legislation governing the operation of the means test does not make provision for the exclusion of medical expenses in the calculation of household means. Provision of assistance for health care and medical expenses is seen primarily as the responsibility of the health boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_5482">The first €88.88 of the weekly earnings of a disability allowance recipient's spouse are disregarded and are therefore not assessed as means.

As this assessment was higher than the statutory  limit of €135.60 per week for disability allowance, her claim was disallowed. This decision was subsequently upheld on appeal. Any changes to the means test for disability allowance would have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5484">The breakfast club in question is funded by the Department of Education and Science and is operated by FÁS trainees. My Department provides funding for the food element of the project but the issue of providing staff is a matter for the project itself. I understand that the training initiative started in February 2002 has been extended by FÁS up to the end of the current school year in June 2003 and that FÁS will provide training to 20 new trainees in order to operate the project from September 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_5486">There is no change in the position which was outlined in the Department's reply to Parliamentary Question No. 202 of 11 December 2002. The person concerned is currently working as a services officer in a Government Department in Dublin and is seeking a lateral transfer to Navan. There is currently no services officer post in my Department's local office in Navan. Navan local office and staff are to be relocated to new premises at end of June 2003. The question of appointing a service officer at the new premises will be reviewed at that time. In the event of a services officer post being required, the normal selection procedures will apply. The application of the person concerned for transfer has been noted and will be considered in that event.</p>

          <p eId="para_5488">The pension services office in Sligo processes claims for old age and retirement pensions, survivors and one parent family payments and related household benefits. In addition to claim processing, it also carries out the maintenance functions related to these payments where changes arise affecting entitlements and to the normal control functions associated with this work. The volume of business is growing each year and the highest priority is given to processing applications and related maintenance work.</p>
          <p eId="para_5489">The work attracts a significant volume of phone calls. The extension of the Locall service to this office in October 2002 has provided an additional facility to customers in that regard. The volume of calls is sensitive to a variety of factors which can give rise to delays. The service is organised in designated phone banks so as to ensure that increased demand does not impact on claim processing and related activity affecting payments to the various customers which the office serves.</p>
          <p eId="para_5490">Every effort is being made to ensure a quality customer service for claimants under the various schemes and for the callers who telephone about their entitlements. The staffing levels for the office are also being examined as part of a review of the overall staffing levels in my Department. On an interim basis and pending completion of this review, additional staff have been assigned to claim processing areas in order to improve the service they were providing. This should have a positive knock-on effect for the telephone service. The overall position is being kept under continuing review and any measures to improve the level of service which are possible will be made.</p>

          <p eId="para_5492">My Department has no record of receiving a maternity benefit claim from the person concerned. All pregnant employees have a right to maternity leave under the Maternity Protection Act. To qualify for maternity benefit a person must be in insurable employment covered under the Maternity Protection Act, or be self-employed. Certain PRSI contribution conditions must also be satisfied.</p>
          <p eId="para_5493">Based on her existing social insurance record it would appear that she has insufficient PRSI contributions paid to qualify for maternity benefit. However, on receipt of a completed application form, her entitlement to maternity benefit will be appropriately determined.</p>
          <p eId="para_5494">Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</p>
